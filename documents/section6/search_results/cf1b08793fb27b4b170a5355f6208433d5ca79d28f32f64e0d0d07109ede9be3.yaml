    \ countries with water scarcity.\nThis also aﬀects\nagriculture, as a large amount\
    \ of water is dedicated to that use. The possible consequences of global\nwarming\
    \ lead to the consideration of creating water adaptation measures to ensure the\
    \ availability\nof water for food production and consumption. Thus, studies aimed\
    \ at saving water usage in the\nirrigation process have increased over the years.\
    \ Typical commercial sensors for agriculture irrigation\nsystems are very expensive,\
    \ making it impossible for smaller farmers to implement this type of\nsystem.\
    \ However, manufacturers are currently oﬀering low-cost sensors that can be connected\
    \ to\nnodes to implement aﬀordable systems for irrigation management and agriculture\
    \ monitoring. Due to\nthe recent advances in IoT and WSN technologies that can\
    \ be applied in the development of these\nsystems, we present a survey aimed at\
    \ summarizing the current state of the art regarding smart\nirrigation systems.\
    \ We determine the parameters that are monitored in irrigation systems regarding\n\
    water quantity and quality, soil characteristics and weather conditions. We provide\
    \ an overview of\nthe most utilized nodes and wireless technologies. Lastly, we\
    \ will discuss the challenges and the best\npractices for the implementation of\
    \ sensor-based irrigation systems.\nKeywords: irrigation; IoT; precision agriculture;\
    \ sensors\n1. Introduction\nThe lack of fresh water is a rising concern, particularly\
    \ in the Mediterranean countries or southern\nAsian countries such as India. Among\
    \ the countries in Europe, the Mediterranean countries are the\nmost vulnerable\
    \ to drought [1]. A connection has been established between climate policies and\
    \ water\nmanagement. Water management can be aﬀected by diﬀerent variables such\
    \ as the water demand\nfrom the diﬀerent sectors or the consequences of some degrees\
    \ of warming on hydrological resources.\nClimate change and its eﬀects are a recurrent\
    \ topic in research papers regarding water resources and\nagriculture. The possible\
    \ consequences of global warming have led to the consideration of creating\nwater\
    \ adaptation measures to ensure the availability of water for food production\
    \ and people and\nto maintain ecosystems [2]. Furthermore, the safety of the water\
    \ to be consumed by humans and\nto be returned to the environment must be ensured.\
    \ The possible risks of climate change are an\nincrease in water shortage, the\
    \ reduction of water quality, the increase in water and soil salinity,\nthe biodiversity\
    \ loss, the increase in irrigation requirements or the possible cost of emergency\
    \ and\nremediation actions. These reasons have led to an increase in the number\
    \ of studies focused on\nreducing water usage in irrigation processes. Some of\
    \ these studies suggest the implementation of\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042; doi:10.3390/s20041042\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n2 of 48\nsocial, economic\
    \ and climate change policies, as well as the implementation of technological\
    \ innovations\nto improve water management.\nThe agricultural sector is one of\
    \ the most important economic resources in these countries\nadding to the importance\
    \ of managing well the available water resources to ensure the continuing\nof\
    \ this economical sector. In India, 10% of the area of the country is covered\
    \ by rice plantations [3].\nFurthermore, 20% of the Indian population is below\
    \ poverty levels and 15% is food insecure. Therefore,\nlow food production aﬀects\
    \ both the population and the economy. In 2002, the monsoon season\nproduced the\
    \ least amount of precipitation in the last 130 years. That resulted in a loss\
    \ of rice production\ndue to the lack of fresh water. To determine the drought\
    \ caused by anomalies in surface water, the\nStandardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration\
    \ Index (SPEI) was utilized. These indexes and the\ninformation gathered from\
    \ sensors that monitor the environment, the soil and the water can be utilized\n\
    to determine the current state of the water and the possibility of covering all\
    \ the freshwater needs.\nCountries with higher funds are already implementing\
    \ systems for water management and water\nreuse aiming to optimize water usage\
    \ and reduce the environmental impact caused by utilizing great\namounts of water.\
    \ However, some countries may ﬁnd these solutions to be costly.\nCommercial sensors\
    \ for systems aimed for agriculture and its irrigation are very expensive,\nmaking\
    \ it impossible for smaller farmers to implement this type of system on their\
    \ farms. However,\nmanufacturers are currently oﬀering low-cost sensors that can\
    \ be connected to nodes to implement\nlow-cost systems for irrigation management\
    \ and agriculture monitoring. Furthermore, due to the\ninterest in low-cost sensors\
    \ for monitoring agriculture and water, new low-cost sensors are being\nproposed\
    \ in researches such as a leaf water stress monitoring sensor [4], a multi-level\
    \ soil moisture\nsensor comprised of copper rings placed along a PVC pipe [5],\
    \ a water salinity monitoring sensor\nmade with copper coils [6] or a water turbidity\
    \ sensor made with colored and infrared led emitters\nand receptors [7].\nDue\
    \ to the recent advances in sensors for the implementation of irrigation systems\
    \ for agriculture\nand the evolution of WSN and IoT technologies that can be applied\
    \ in the development of these\nsystems, we present a survey aimed at summarizing\
    \ the current state of the art regarding smart\nirrigation systems. In this survey,\
    \ we are going to provide an overview of the state of the research\nregarding\
    \ irrigation systems. We will determine the parameters that are monitored in irrigation\n\
    systems regarding water quantity and quality, soil characteristics, weather conditions,\
    \ and fertilizer\nusage. We will provide an overview of the most utilized nodes\
    \ and wireless technologies employed to\nimplement WSN and IoT based smart irrigation\
    \ systems. Lastly, we will discuss the challenges and the\nbest practices for\
    \ the implementation of sensor-based irrigation systems.\nOther authors have performed\
    \ studies with a focus on irrigation systems, water management\nor precision agriculture\
    \ systems. However, the other available surveys on smart irrigation systems\n\
    analyzed quite a few papers [8–12] and therefore do not provide an in-depth analysis\
    \ of the state\nof the art regarding irrigation systems. Others are focused on\
    \ speciﬁc aspects regarding irrigation\nsuch as software for irrigation systems\
    \ [13], pivot-center speciﬁc irrigation systems [14] or irrigation\nsystems for\
    \ greenhouses [15]. Lastly, there are surveys that focus on precision agriculture\
    \ [16–21], crop\nmonitoring [22] and the agro-industrial and environmental ﬁelds\
    \ of agriculture [23] that comment on\nirrigation agriculture. In this survey,\
    \ we provide an overview of the current advances in irrigation\nsystems and the\
    \ utilized sensors and actuators. Furthermore, we provide discuss the most utilized\n\
    nodes and the wireless technologies employed for the communication and transmission\
    \ of the data\ngathered by the sensors. This way, with this work we address the\
    \ current gap in literature with a\nsurvey that provides an overview of IoT-based\
    \ smart irrigation systems.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section\
    \ 2 presents the methodology employed to\nperform the survey. Section 3 presents\
    \ the water management techniques utilized in current studies, the\nparameters\
    \ that are utilized to determine the irrigation schedule and the related actuators.\
    \ The sensors\nand parameters considered for the soil monitoring aspects of the\
    \ evaluated smart irrigation systems\nare depicted in Section 4. The most monitored\
    \ weather parameters and the sensors that monitor\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n3 of\
    \ 48\nthem are presented in Section 5. Section 6 comments on the most utilized\
    \ nodes for IoT and WSN\nirrigation systems and the most popular wireless communication\
    \ technologies and cloud platforms.\nThe discussion of the current trends regarding\
    \ IoT crop irrigation systems is presented in Section 7.\nLastly, the conclusion\
    \ and future work are presented in Section 8.\n2. Materials and Methods\nIn this\
    \ section, the process followed to elaborate this paper is presented. To perform\
    \ this study,\nthe following research questions were considered: What are the\
    \ current IoT solutions for smart\nirrigation for agriculture? What sensors, actuators,\
    \ nodes, and wireless technologies are being utilized\nto develop IoT irrigation\
    \ systems? Search engines and digital libraries were utilized by the authors to\n\
    search manually for papers suitable for this survey. A total of 283 papers were\
    \ obtained from Google\nScholar [24], IEEE explore [25], Scopus [26] and the digital\
    \ library of Sensors [27]. The keywords\nemployed to obtain the total number of\
    \ papers to be analyzed were IoT irrigation, IoT irrigation system,\nand smart\
    \ irrigation. Furthermore, all papers were checked to ensure they included the\
    \ keywords\nirrigation or water and IoT or smart in their content.\nIn order to\
    \ discern which papers to use, only papers written in English were considered.\n\
    Furthermore, to observe the recent evolution in this ﬁeld, the selected papers\
    \ were published from\nthe years 2014 to 2019 (both years inclusive). Finally,\
    \ a total of 178 papers were utilized to compile\nthis review.\nAfter the selection\
    \ process, all papers were classiﬁed manually into IoT irrigation systems and\n\
    architecture, protocol and sensor proposals that were not used to create the ﬁgures\
    \ in this paper but\ndiscussed relevant information. The papers from the ﬁrst\
    \ group (160) were then analyzed to determine\nthe sensors and actuators that\
    \ were employed to develop the IoT irrigation system, the parameters\nthat were\
    \ monitored, the type of irrigation and agriculture, the type of node, the type\
    \ of wireless\ntechnology and data visualization technique that was utilized to\
    \ access the data and to manually\nchoose the actions of the irrigation system.\
    \ All the collected data has been then classiﬁed into diﬀerent\nsections and converted\
    \ into graphs and tables to provide a complete overview of the actual state of\
    \ the\nart regarding IoT irrigation systems.\nThe distribution of the papers regarding\
    \ the country of the ﬁrst author is presented in Figure 1.\nAs it can be seen,\
    \ the countries that investigate IoT systems for irrigation are countries where\
    \ agriculture\nis a major economic source. India is the country with the highest\
    \ number of papers with a total of\n92 papers, 57.5% of the total. China and Spain\
    \ are tied with seven papers each. Costa Rica, Ecuador,\nIndonesia Thailand, and\
    \ the USA have between three and six papers. The rest of the countries that\n\
    have investigated IoT systems for irrigation have one or two papers.\nIt is remarkable\
    \ that only one out of the ﬁve countries with the highest agricultural land area\n\
    (China, USA, Australia, Brazil, and Kazakhstan) is included in the top ﬁve countries\
    \ of our survey\nin terms of water management. India, which is the country with\
    \ the highest production of papers\nthat presents IoT systems for water management\
    \ is the 7th country in terms of agricultural land area.\nWith regard to the top\
    \ six countries, in terms of published papers with irrigation systems, three of\n\
    them (India, China, and Spain) have regions with high and moderate water scarcity\
    \ problems. Again,\nthere are some countries with regions aﬀected by water scarcity\
    \ that use irrigation systems in their\nagriculture and have published fewer papers\
    \ on irrigation systems like the USA. Nonetheless, it does\nnot mean that in these\
    \ countries no eﬀorts are done in order to reduce water use in agriculture. It\
    \ is\npossible that in these countries the major eﬀorts are done by enterprises\
    \ and their ﬁndings are directly\npatented and distributed in the marked. Most\
    \ of the papers are published by authors who come from\ndeveloping countries.\n\
    As per the number of papers per year of publication, see Figure 2, the interest\
    \ in this topic has\nbeen increasing over the years. The lower amount of papers\
    \ for 2019 is due to the year not being\nﬁnished when the selection process of\
    \ the papers was completed. Thus, not all the papers performed\nin 2019 had been\
    \ published.\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n4 of 48\n \nThe distribution of the papers\
    \ regarding the country of the first author is presented in Figure 1. \nAs it\
    \ can be seen, the countries that investigate IoT systems for irrigation are countries\
    \ where \nagriculture is a major economic source. India is the country with the\
    \ highest number of papers with \na total of 92 papers, 57.5% of the total. China\

    countries that have investigated IoT systems for irrigation have one or two papers.\

    \ irrigation per country.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n4 of 48 \nIt is remarkable that\
    \ only one out of the five countries with the highest agricultural land area \n\
    (China, USA, Australia, Brazil, and Kazakhstan) is included in the top five countries\
    \ of our survey in \nterms of water management. India, which is the country with\
    \ the highest production of papers that \npresents IoT systems for water management\
    \ is the 7th country in terms of agricultural land area. With \nregard to the\
    \ top six countries, in terms of published papers with irrigation systems, three\
    \ of them \n(India, China, and Spain) have regions with high and moderate water\
    \ scarcity problems. Again, there \nare some countries with regions affected by\
    \ water scarcity that use irrigation systems in their \nagriculture and have published\
    \ fewer papers on irrigation systems like the USA. Nonetheless, it does \nnot\
    \ mean that in these countries no efforts are done in order to reduce water use\
    \ in agriculture. It is \npossible that in these countries the major efforts are\
    \ done by enterprises and their findings are directly \npatented and distributed\
    \ in the marked. Most of the papers are published by authors who come from \n\
    developing countries.  \nAs per the number of papers per year of publication,\
    \ see Figure 2, the interest in this topic has \nbeen increasing over the years.\
    \ The lower amount of papers for 2019 is due to the year not being \nfinished\
    \ when the selection process of the papers was completed. Thus, not all the papers\
    \ performed \nin 2019 had been published. \n \nFigure 2. Number of published papers\
    \ presenting IoT systems for irrigation per year. \n3. Water Management \nIn this\
    \ section, we present the information and analysis of papers that present different\
    \ \ntechniques for water management in the irrigation process. For this analysis,\
    \ we consider the papers \nthat include any sort of water pumping actuator as\
    \ an irrigation system. From a total of 178 evaluated \npapers, 107 of them present\
    \ an actuator for irrigation. After analyzing the 107 papers we discard the \n\
    ones that just offer partial information, a total of 89 papers are included in\
    \ this section.  \nIn the agriculture activities that use water inputs, also known\
    \ as irrigated agriculture, there are \ndifferent manners to distribute the water.\
    \ The different options present different efficiency and, in \nsome cases, a specific\
    \ manner should be used for a specific crop. The specific manners to irrigate\
    \ have \na great variety but we can divide them into the following categories:\
    \ Attending to the way of water \nis distributed we can consider: (i) flood irrigation,\
    \ (ii) spray irrigation, (iii) drip irrigation, and (iv) \nnebulizer irrigation.\
    \ Regarding the existence of sensing systems we can have: (i) irrigation without\
    \ \nany consideration, when the amount of water is not calculated or estimated,\
    \ (ii) scheduled irrigation, \nwhen the water is supplied according to the estimated\
    \ needs in a period of year, (iii) Ad hoc irrigation, \nwhen the amount of water\
    \ is calculated based on the sensors measurements. The vast majority of the \n\
    papers included in this section propose to use pumps and valves to distribute\
    \ the water in \nconjunction with sensors to measure environmental parameters\
    \ in order to calculate the water needs. \nFrom the 89 evaluated papers in this\
    \ section, 83 include clear information of the proposed irrigation \nsystem, the\
    \ other six only mention that they include actuators for irrigation, see Figure\
    \ 3. Those 83 \ninclude different levels of detail, there are 49 papers that only\
    \ indicate that there are motor/pumps in \nFigure 2. Number of published papers\
    \ presenting IoT systems for irrigation per year.\n3. Water Management\nIn this\
    \ section, we present the information and analysis of papers that present diﬀerent\
    \ techniques\nfor water management in the irrigation process. For this analysis,\
    \ we consider the papers that include\nany sort of water pumping actuator as an\
    \ irrigation system. From a total of 178 evaluated papers,\n107 of them present\

    \ section.\nIn the agriculture activities that use water inputs, also known as\
    \ irrigated agriculture, there\nare diﬀerent manners to distribute the water.\
    \ The diﬀerent options present diﬀerent eﬃciency and,\nin some cases, a speciﬁc\
    \ manner should be used for a speciﬁc crop. The speciﬁc manners to irrigate\n\
    have a great variety but we can divide them into the following categories: Attending\
    \ to the way\nof water is distributed we can consider: (i) ﬂood irrigation, (ii)\
    \ spray irrigation, (iii) drip irrigation,\nand (iv) nebulizer irrigation. Regarding\
    \ the existence of sensing systems we can have: (i) irrigation\nwithout any consideration,\
    \ when the amount of water is not calculated or estimated, (ii) scheduled\nirrigation,\
    \ when the water is supplied according to the estimated needs in a period of year,\
    \ (iii) Ad\nhoc irrigation, when the amount of water is calculated based on the\
    \ sensors measurements. The vast\nmajority of the papers included in this section\
    \ propose to use pumps and valves to distribute the water\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n\

    \ to calculate the water needs.\nFrom the 89 evaluated papers in this section,\
    \ 83 include clear information of the proposed irrigation\nsystem, the other six\
    \ only mention that they include actuators for irrigation, see Figure 3. Those\
    \ 83\ninclude diﬀerent levels of detail, there are 49 papers that only indicate\
    \ that there are motor/pumps in\ntheir system (40 paper) or valves (nine papers)\
    \ without more detail. From those papers which oﬀer more\ndetails, 19 of them\
    \ include sprinklers (the most used system) [28–46], eight use drip irrigation\
    \ [4,47–54],\ntwo propose the utilization of sprayers [4,55], and the rest use\
    \ a very speciﬁc irrigation systems\n(robots [56], pivot [14], rain gun [57] or\
    \ it can be applied to multiple systems [58]). In conjunction with\nthe principal\
    \ irrigation system, three papers propose the use of a fogging system [41,43,51]\
    \ and two\npapers propose the use of fertigation in their systems [42,52].\nSensors\

    \ \nMost of the included papers in this section do not describe the target agriculture\
    \ system of their \nproposal. Nevertheless, there are 38 papers that include this\

    \ most used sensor in the systems is the soil moisture sensor, it is used in 76\n\
    papers (more details in Section 4). First, we will analyze the data from soil\
    \ and plant sensors. The soil\ntemperature is much less considered in these systems,\
    \ it is only measured in seven proposals. Attending\nto the soil characteristics,\
    \ in one proposal the authors use a sensor that monitored the nutrients of the\n\
    soil [80]. There are 14 proposals of IoT for irrigation management that include\
    \ a pH sensor. However,\nnot all of them specify if the pH sensors are for the\
    \ soil or for the water [31,42,49,54,68,70,74,75,81,82],\nonly four of them indicate\
    \ this (three for soil [66,67,72] and one for water [69]). Only four papers\n\
    consider plant monitoring, in two papers the measured parameter is the plant height\
    \ [64,83], using an\nultrasound sensor. In the other two cases, the leaf wetness\
    \ was considered in their system [46,84,85].\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n7 of 48\n\

    \ consider plant monitoring, in two papers the measured parameter \nis the plant\
    \ height [64,83], using an ultrasound sensor. In the other two cases, the leaf\

    \ [84] used a sensor based on optical \nsignals while [46] utilized a commercial\
    \ FC-37 sensor (Lydia Vogler, Peißenberg, Germany).  \nNow, the data from the\
    \ water sensor are presented. In this case, we will consider for the \ncommentaries\
    \ not only the data of the graphic (proposals with irrigation system) but also\
    \ the \ninformation of the paper which measures the water quality, having or not\
    \ the actuators for the \nirrigation system. The water level in the tanks is measured\
    \ in 17 [32,36,51,57,58,61,62,64,69,85–92] out \nof 88 papers that have a pumping\
    \ system. There are different methods to monitor the water level in \nthe tanks\
    \ and the most used is the one based on ultrasound [32,69,89], the resistive methodology\
    \ is \nused in one case [36], the rest of cases do not offer information of how\
    \ the data is measured. In the \ncase of sensors based on ultrasound methods,\
    \ the most utilized sensor is the HC-SR04 (Shenzhenshi \nguoyun dianzishangwu\
    \ youxiangongsi , Shenzhen, China, used in [69]). In addition, there are six \n\
    papers that do not include an actuator for the irrigation system even when they\
    \ have water level \nsensors [60,93–97]. There are nine papers where sensors for\
    \ monitoring water flow are utilized \n[14,31,42,45,50,64,75,76,82]. The sensors\
    \ used are only described in two cases, the commercial Gems \nFT110 G3/8 sensor\
    \ (Gems Sensors and Controls, Mumbai, India) is used in [75] and the YF-S402 \n\
    (Wuhan yingying yingying xinxi jishu youxian gongsi , Wuhan, China) in the proposal\
    \ presented in \n[76]. Both sensors are based on a Hall effect turbine. They have\
    \ different prices and similar \noperational ranges. The Gems FT110 G3/8 can measure\
    \ flows between 0.5 to 5 L/min. The other \nsensor, the YF-S402, is capable of\
    \ measuring flows between 0.3 to 6 L/min. Moreover, water flow \nsensors are used\
    \ in three other proposals that do not include actuators for irrigation systems\
    \ [5,98,99]. \nRegarding water quality, the water conductivity is monitored in\
    \ four proposals [51,68,69,75]. Only in \none case [75], the authors indicate\
    \ the used sensor. They use commercial sensors for monitoring pH \nand conductivity\
    \ from B&C Electronics (Carnate , Italy). \n  \nFigure 7. Monitored parameters\

    \ \nAdditionally, there are two papers without an actuator for irrigation systems\

    \ In this case, we will consider for the\ncommentaries not only the data of the\
    \ graphic (proposals with irrigation system) but also the\ninformation of the\
    \ paper which measures the water quality, having or not the actuators for the\
    \ irrigation\nsystem. The water level in the tanks is measured in 17 [32,36,51,57,58,61,62,64,69,85–92]\
    \ out of 88 papers\nthat have a pumping system. There are diﬀerent methods to\

    \ ultrasound [32,69,89], the resistive methodology is used in\none case [36],\
    \ the rest of cases do not oﬀer information of how the data is measured. In the\
    \ case of\nsensors based on ultrasound methods, the most utilized sensor is the\
    \ HC-SR04 (Shenzhenshi guoyun\ndianzishangwu youxiangongsi, Shenzhen, China, used\
    \ in [69]). In addition, there are six papers that\ndo not include an actuator\
    \ for the irrigation system even when they have water level sensors [60,93–97].\n\
    There are nine papers where sensors for monitoring water ﬂow are utilized [14,31,42,45,50,64,75,76,82].\n\
    The sensors used are only described in two cases, the commercial Gems FT110 G3/8\
    \ sensor (Gems\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n8 of 48\nSensors and Controls, Mumbai,\
    \ India) is used in [75] and the YF-S402 (Wuhan yingying yingying xinxi\njishu\
    \ youxian gongsi, Wuhan, China) in the proposal presented in [76]. Both sensors\
    \ are based on a\nHall eﬀect turbine. They have diﬀerent prices and similar operational\
    \ ranges. The Gems FT110 G3/8\ncan measure ﬂows between 0.5 to 5 L/min. The other\
    \ sensor, the YF-S402, is capable of measuring\nﬂows between 0.3 to 6 L/min. Moreover,\
    \ water ﬂow sensors are used in three other proposals that do\nnot include actuators\
    \ for irrigation systems [5,98,99]. Regarding water quality, the water conductivity\n\
    is monitored in four proposals [51,68,69,75]. Only in one case [75], the authors\
    \ indicate the used\nsensor. They use commercial sensors for monitoring pH and\
    \ conductivity from B&C Electronics\n(Carnate, Italy).\nAdditionally, there are\
    \ two papers without an actuator for irrigation systems that include in their\n\
    proposals a sensor for conductivity [98,100]. Nevertheless, no data regarding\
    \ the equipment used are\ngiven. Regarding the pH of water, it is monitored in\
    \ another three papers (apart from [69]) [99,101,102].\nIn one case [99], the\
    \ authors specify the used sensor, the Lutron Pe-03 (Lutron, Taipei, Taiwan).\n\
    The temperature of the water is measured in two proposals [51,69]. Only in one\
    \ case [69] did the\nauthors specify that the used sensor is the DS18B20 (Adafruit\
    \ Industries, New York, NY, USA). No other\nproposals evaluated in this survey\
    \ (having or not irrigation system) presented the use of temperature\nsensors\
    \ for the water.\nOn the other hand, with regard to the proposals that monitored\
    \ the atmospheric parameter,\nthe data is presented in Figure 8. Next, we are\
    \ presenting the importance of these sensors for irrigation\nsystems. No details\
    \ of which sensors are used in which papers are given in this section. This information\n\
    will be further discussed in Section 5. The air temperature is the most measured\
    \ parameter, it is\nmonitored in 58 papers. A total of 51 proposals include a\
    \ humidity sensor. Other parameters are less\nmeasured such as the rain, which\
    \ is measured in eight out of 89 papers that proposed an irrigation\nsystem, or\
    \ the wind, measured in only one paper. Meanwhile, there are 15 proposals that\
    \ consider the\nweather forecast. From those 15 proposals, 10 of them use the\
    \ data from the forecast in conjunction\nwith the data gathered by sensors and\
    \ ﬁve proposals use the weather forecast as the sole information\nfor weather\
    \ data/atmospheric parameters.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n8 of 48 \n[99,101,102].\
    \ In one case [99], the authors specify the used sensor, the Lutron Pe-03 (Lutron,\
    \ Taipei, \nTaiwan). The temperature of the water is measured in two proposals\
    \ [51,69]. Only in one case [69] \ndid the authors specify that the used sensor\
    \ is the DS18B20 (Adafruit Industries, New York, New \nYork, USA). No other proposals\

    \ of temperature sensors for the water.  \nOn the other hand, with regard to the\
    \ proposals that monitored the atmospheric parameter, the \ndata is presented\

    \ only the irrigation system as an actuator.\nThere are seven papers (8% of cases)\

    \ The use of three actuators is presented in seven papers, the same percentage\

    \ use four actuators [39,72], and in one case the use of ﬁve\nactuators is presented\
    \ [67].\nNext, we present in Figure 10 the description of the selected actuators.\
    \ Since we are considering only\nthe papers that include an irrigation system,\
    \ the most used actuator in the diﬀerent irrigation systems.\nTherefore, we do\
    \ not include the use of irrigation actuators in Figure 10. The most utilized\
    \ actuator is\nthe sound emitter, used in seven cases [32,49,58,59,61,66,103].\
    \ It is generally used as an alarm for the\nfarmers or as a dissuasive measure\
    \ to prevent the entry of animals into the farming lands. In second\nposition,\
    \ we found the use of artiﬁcial light systems. They are used in six cases [36,38,50,71,72,75].\n\
    The use of artiﬁcial light is mainly related to the generation of artiﬁcial photo-\
    \ periods to increase\nproductivity, but they can also be used for operational\
    \ purposes. Fans are included in ﬁve proposals\nand their use is related to modifying\
    \ the atmospheric conditions (temperature, humidity or even the\nbalance between\
    \ CO2/O2). The proposals that include the use of fans are [39,65,68,72,75]. The\
    \ use\nof ultrasonic sound emitter is found in four papers [32,51,64,65]. The\
    \ least utilized actuators in IoT\nirrigation systems are scarecrows [58,65,66],\

    \ birds and other types of animals to protect the crops, and heaters [28,65],\

    \ and in one case the use of \nfive actuators is presented [67].  \nNext, we present\
    \ in Figure 10 the description of the selected actuators. Since we are considering\
    \ \nonly the papers that include an irrigation system, the most used actuator\
    \ in the different irrigation \nsystems. Therefore, we do not include the use\
    \ of irrigation actuators in Figure 10. The most utilized \nactuator is the sound\
    \ emitter, used in seven cases [32,49,58,59,61,66,103]. It is generally used as\
    \ an \nalarm for the farmers or as a dissuasive measure to prevent the entry of\
    \ animals into the farming \nlands. In second position, we found the use of artificial\
    \ light systems. They are used in six cases \n[36,38,50,71,72,75]. The use of\
    \ artificial light is mainly related to the generation of artificial photo- \n\
    periods to increase productivity, but they can also be used for operational purposes.\
    \ Fans are \nincluded in five proposals and their use is related to modifying\
    \ the atmospheric conditions \n(temperature, humidity or even the balance between\
    \ CO2/O2). The proposals that include the use of \nfans are [39,65,68,72,75].\
    \ The use of ultrasonic sound emitter is found in four papers [32,51,64,65]. The\

    \ in diﬀerent papers included in this\nsurvey, there is an important parameter\
    \ that is crucial for irrigation scheduling. This parameter\nindicates the water\
    \ loss due to the evaporation from the soil and transpiration through the stomata\
    \ of\nplants; it is known as evapotranspiration (ET). Several authors measured\
    \ both terms—evaporation and\ntranspiration—separately, using diﬀerent sensors\
    \ to obtain the ET data [104]. It also can be estimated\naccording to the vegetation\
    \ and the climatic data by several mathematic models [105]. Some web-based\napplications\
    \ can estimate the potential ET given a location. For ET monitoring, remote sensing\
    \ is the\nbest option as many papers point out [106–108]. Among the possibilities\
    \ for ET monitoring with sensors,\nthe integration of soil moisture changes can\
    \ oﬀer evaporation data. Nonetheless, the measurement of\ntranspiration is more\
    \ complex; it can be estimated with the data of sensors that measure radiation,\n\
    leaf area index, and vapor pressure deﬁcit [109]. Due to the complexity of its\
    \ measurement, it is not\nincluded as a monitored variable in most of the papers\

    Most of those proposals use similar sensors based on the conductivity between\
    \ two electrodes.\nDiﬀerent models of the aforementioned sensor have been used\
    \ in the proposals (see Figure 13). The most\nused sensor, based on conductivity,\
    \ is the YL69 (SparkFun Electronics, Niwot, CO, USA). It has been\nused in nine\
    \ proposals [44,56,71,87,95,115–118]. This sensor is characterized by a low price\
    \ and it is\ncreated speciﬁcally to operate with Arduino (and similar nodes).\
    \ The output voltage goes from 3.3\nto 5 V and the output values are related to\
    \ soil moisture (0 to 300 for dry soil, 300 to 700 humid soil).\nNevertheless,\
    \ it is not possible to have a measure that indicates exactly the value of moisture\
    \ without\nperforming new tests and calibration of the sensor. The same range\
    \ of measure is found in the other\nused sensor based on the same principle, the\
    \ FC-28 (Uruktech, Baghdad, Iraq, used in [34,72,76]) and\nthe SEN0114 (DFRobot,\
    \ Shanghai, China, used in [46]). The S-XNQ-04 sensor (XNQ Electric Company\n\
    Store, Beijing, China), used in [55] has a similar operation principle. However,\
    \ it is composed of three\nelectrodes. In this case, the sensor output voltage\
    \ goes from 0 to 2 V and the sensor is capable of\nmeasuring the soil moisture\
    \ giving as a response the relative saturation moisture content expressed\nin\
    \ percentage (%). This sensor has an accuracy of 3% and it can measure from 0\
    \ to 100% of relative\nsaturation. It can operate from −40 to 85 ◦C.\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, x \n12 of 48 \nsensors goes from −40 °C to 85 °C and its accuracy\

    \ datasheet.  \n \nFigure 13. Number of papers that used different models of soil\
    \ moisture sensors. \nIn terms of sensors for soil nutrients, three papers include\
    \ in their proposals sensors for \nmonitoring this variable [5,80,102]; nonetheless,\

    \ time, the VH400 (Vegetronix,\nInc., Riverton, UT, USA), is utilized in [37,40,89,96,119,120].\
    \ These sensors can be used from 40 ◦C to\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n12 of 48\n\
    85 ◦C, but the accuracy and operational range of the sensor probe are not indicated\
    \ in its datasheet.\nThe operational principle of this sensor is based on the\
    \ measurement of the dielectric constant of the\nsoil using transmission line\
    \ techniques to measure the moisture in any type of soil notwithstanding\nsoil\
    \ salinity. The output voltage of this sensor goes from 0 to 3 V. This output\
    \ voltage is related to\nthe volumetric water content in the soil. The sensor\
    \ does not oﬀer a linear relationship between the\noutput voltage and the volumetric\
    \ water content, but the sensor can measure from 0 to up to 60% of\nvolumetric\
    \ water content in the soil. This sensor has a relatively low price and can be\
    \ implemented in\nArduino systems (and similar).\nA sensor with completely different\
    \ operational principles, the 200SS (HYPERION TECHNOLOGIES\nB.V., Delft, The Netherlands),\
    \ is used in two proposals [14,121].\nIt is a solid-state electrical\nresistance\
    \ sensing device that is used to measure soil water tension.\nThe 200SS has a\
    \ pair of\nhighly corrosion-resistant electrodes, as a resistive device, the resistance\
    \ of the sensor changes with the\nsoil moisture. The electrodes are embedded within\
    \ a granular matrix. The output values of the sensor\ngo from 0 to 199 centibars.\
    \ The higher the value of centibars the lower the water availability for the\n\
    plants. The system presented in [54] uses an SM300 sensor. This device is able\
    \ to measure two soil\nparameters (moisture and temperature). The SM300 measures\
    \ the soil moisture and temperature based\non the generation and propagation of\
    \ the electromagnetic ﬁeld into the soil. The sensors measure\nthe soil moisture\
    \ as the volumetric water content, the operating range goes from 0 to 100% and\
    \ the\naccuracy is ±2.5%. This sensor is manufactured by Delta-T Devices Ltd.\
    \ (Cambridge, UK). This sensor\nis not speciﬁcally created to be integrated in\
    \ an Arduino measuring system, even though it can be\nadapted since the output\
    \ voltage goes from 0 to 1 V.\nFinally, the system detailed in [122] used the\
    \ HA2002 sensor, but no information is available\non the internet about this sensor\
    \ in terms of operational principle nor range of measuring. The sole\ninformation\
    \ that was found was that the sensor is an HA2001 sensor manufactured by Handan\
    \ Dingrui\nElectronics Co., Ltd. (Handan, China).\nRegarding the sensors used\
    \ for monitoring the soil temperature, which are mentioned in [37,40,\n45,54,63,67,94,122,123],\
    \ the diﬀerent sensors are detailed in this paragraph. There are ﬁve papers that\n\
    do not specify the sensors used [45,63,67,94,123]. The other four proposals indicate\
    \ in the paper the\nsensors selected. Although in one paper no information could\
    \ be found about the sensor utilized [122],\nthe authors indicate that their system\
    \ includes the HA2001 sensor.\nIn other cases, the information of the selected\
    \ sensors is detailed. The proposal presented in [54]\nused an LM35 sensor. This\
    \ device is able to measure temperature. The operating range is −40 to\n+125 ◦C\
    \ and the accuracy is ±0.5 ◦C. The sensors oﬀer an analogic signal and it is manufactured\
    \ by\nTexas Instruments (Dallas, TX, USA). The proposals presented in [37,40]\
    \ selected the THERM200\n(Vegetronix, Inc., Riverton, UT, USA) to measure the\
    \ temperature. The operational range of these\nsensors goes from −40 ◦C to 85\
    \ ◦C and its accuracy is ±0.5 ◦C. The operation principle of this sensor is\n\
    not speciﬁed in the datasheet.\nIn terms of sensors for soil nutrients, three\
    \ papers include in their proposals sensors for monitoring\nthis variable [5,80,102];\
    \ nonetheless, not all of them indicate the used sensor. The only paper that\n\
    clearly indicates the utilized sensor is the proposal presented in [80] includes\
    \ an 1185 SunRom\ncolor sensor (Sunrom Electronics, Ahmedabad, India). This sensor\
    \ is based on RGB color detection,\nin [80] authors relate the color of the soil\
    \ with the nutrients. The pH of the soil is measured in four\nproposals [66,67,72,110].\
    \ However, none of these proposals indicates the selected device or equipment\n\
    in the paper.\n5. Weather Monitoring\nAn overview of the weather parameters monitored\
    \ in IoT irrigation monitoring systems and the\nmost utilized sensors to monitor\
    \ these parameters is provided in this section. The weather conditions\nare a\
    \ key factor both in irrigation needs and in the performance of crops. Figure\
    \ 14 shows the most\nmonitored weather parameters in the currently available smart\
    \ irrigation proposals. Temperature\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n13 of 48\nand humidity\
    \ aﬀect the evapotranspiration of the water in the soil. Air temperature is deﬁned\
    \ as the\nthermic level of the atmosphere and is usually measured in Celsius,\
    \ Fahrenheit or Kelvin degrees.\nIt is the most monitored weather parameter with\
    \ one hundred papers monitoring it. Humidity is the\npresence of water vapor in\
    \ the air. The amount of water vapor in the air is expressed in percentage (%).\n\
    It is the second most monitored weather parameter with 86 papers. Furthermore,\
    \ luminosity is paired\nwith temperature as direct radiation from the Sun raises\
    \ the temperature and leads to more water loss in\nthe soil. It is deﬁned as the\
    \ intensity or brightness of the light. It is measured in Lux. It is the third\
    \ most\nmonitored parameter with 28 papers. The amount of precipitation determines\
    \ whether the irrigation\nis needed or not and the amount of water to be employed\
    \ in the case of irrigation being necessary.\nIt considers any form of hydrometeor\
    \ that falls from the atmosphere and reaches the earth’s surface.\nFurthermore,\
    \ it includes rain and snow. A total of 14 papers considered precipitation monitoring.\n\
    Although temperature, relative humidity, luminosity, and precipitations are the\
    \ most important factors\nregarding IoT irrigation systems for agriculture, many\
    \ systems propose the monitoring of other\nenvironmental parameters. Table 1 details\

    \ industry. The SEN-08942 is a meteorology station manufactured\nby Sparkfun (SparkFun\
    \ Electronics, Niwot, CO, USA). It allows monitoring both wind speed and\ndirection\
    \ and it incorporates a pluviometer [46]. The PRD180 is comprised of a rain detecting\
    \ board\nwith two separate PCB tracks and a control module that provides a digital\
    \ and an analog output [48].\nThe operating voltage is from 3.3 V to 5 V. It is\
    \ manufactured by Elecmake (India). Like the PRD180, the\nYL83 (Vaisala, Vantaa,\
    \ Finland) is comprised of a series of conductive strands printed onto a Bakelite\n\
    plaque [76]. The water creates a short-circuit oﬀering a low resistance between\
    \ the lines connected to\nthe ground and the lines connected to the positive polarity.\n\
    The type of agriculture most concerned with air and wind as a parameter concerning\
    \ weather\nis greenhouse agriculture. For example, one of the aims of [68] is\
    \ the sanitation of the air of the\ngreenhouse from pathogens and chemical contaminants.\
    \ This is then closely related to the activation\nof the actuators necessary to\
    \ the regulation of the quality of the air. The contaminants that can aﬀect\n\
    the quality of the air are CO, CO2, O3, NOx, PM2.5, and PM10, among others [64].\
    \ In the context\nof agriculture, air contaminants are monitored with the use\
    \ of sensors that can be low-cost sensors\nsuch as the MQ135 (SHENZHEN INVENTOR\
    \ ELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGYCO., LTD., Shenzhen,\nChina), MQ131, MQ2 or MQ9 sensors\
    \ or commercial sensors that can be found in professional weather\nstations. The\
    \ MQ135 [64,143], used for benzene, alcohol, smoke, NH3, NOx and CO2 monitoring,\
    \ and\nthe MQ2 [64,95], used for gas monitoring (propane, hydrogen, and LPG),\
    \ are the most utilized low-cost\nsensors for air quality monitoring. The MQ131\
    \ is utilized for ozone, Cl2, NO2 monitoring [64] and\nthe MQ9 is utilized for\
    \ CO/combustible gas, methane, carbon monoxide and LPG monitoring [64].\nAnother\
    \ sensor that can be used to monitor CO2 is the CDM4161A (Toshniwal Sensing Device\
    \ Private\nLimited, Ajmer, India) [145].\nWind speed and direction may be of interest\
    \ to IoT irrigation systems such as for the proposal\nin [46], that utilized the\
    \ SEN-08942 sensor manufactured by Sparkfun. Barometric pressure can be of\ninterest\
    \ as well and can be measured by the BME280 sensor manufactured by Bosch [157].\n\
    Movement detection is often related to security measures or to the aim of scaring\
    \ animals to\navoid crop damage. The most utilized sensor for movement detection\
    \ is a passive infrared (PIR)\nsensor [42,95]. This sensor measures the infrared\
    \ light that radiates around the objects placed at the\nfront of the sensor. The\
    \ change in infrared radiation is converted into changes in voltage that trigger\n\
    the detection. It is often utilized for intrusion and pest detection. Ultrasonic\
    \ sensors are often utilized\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n18 of 48\nto detect movement,\
    \ such as the robot proposed in [65] that is able to perform some actions to scare\
    \ the\nanimals that may enter the ﬁelds. These sensors are comprised of a transmitter\
    \ and a receiver that\noperate at the 40 kHz frequency. Its range is from 10 cm\
    \ to 30 cm. Ultrasound at lower frequencies was\nutilized in [60] to repel the\
    \ animals. Insects may cause great damage to the crops, for that reason some\n\
    systems such as [45] include a pest warning functionality. The system in [133]\
    \ is able to even detect the\ntype of insect pests that are damaging the crops.\
    \ These features are often accompanied by a buzzer to\ngenerate an alarm when\
    \ intruders or animals are detected [61].\nDepending on the type of agriculture,\
    \ the values from the measures for each environmental\nparameter can be utilized\
    \ to determine the actions of diﬀerent types of actuators. It can be part of a\n\
    model like the one proposed in [72] where the on-agriculture stage gathers the\
    \ data on temperature,\nhumidity, light, moisture and wind speed in order to activate\
    \ or deactivate fans, artiﬁcial light, a cooler\nand water pumps. Many IoT irrigation\
    \ systems have both a manual and an automatic mode to control\nirrigation. In\
    \ [64], the amount of water released by the water pumps or the duration of the\
    \ irrigation\ncan be selected in the manual mode. For the automatic mode, a preset\
    \ value is utilized at the beginning.\nThen, the data is analyzed to determine\
    \ the personalized settings. The most utilized actuators to\nmodify the conditions\
    \ of the climate that aﬀects the crops or to protect the crops from animals and\n\
    intruders are presented in Figure 20.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n18 of 48 \n \nFigure\

    \ two types depending on the purpose of\nthe IoT devices. On the one hand, we\
    \ can distinguish the devices that function as nodes that transmit\nsmall amounts\
    \ of data at short distances and have low energy consumption. On the other hand,\n\
    there are devices that can transmit large amounts of data over long distances\
    \ that have high energy\nconsumption. Therefore, range, data rate, and energy\
    \ consumption are some of the most important\naspects to consider when deciding\
    \ which technology to use.\nIf the utilized standard is considered, there are\
    \ a large number of wireless standards that are used\nin the communications of\
    \ IoT devices. A general classiﬁcation can be established between devices\nthat\
    \ communicate at short or long distances. Short distance communication standards\
    \ usually reach\ndistances of up to 100 m. Long-distance communication standards\
    \ reach distances of kilometers.\nAlso, another type of classiﬁcation can be established\
    \ based on the employed communication\ntechnology. In this way, three categories\
    \ can be established. The ﬁrst category is formed by those that\nconnect utilizing\
    \ Ethernet or cable and WAN technology. The second category is comprised of those\n\
    that connect via WiFi and WAN technology. Finally, the third category is formed\
    \ by those that connect\nusing both low power WiFi and WAN technology.\nIf the\
    \ spectrum band used is considered, we can classify them into technologies that\
    \ use the\nunlicensed spectrum or the licensed spectrum. Unlicensed spectrum bands\
    \ are known as Industrial,\nScientiﬁc, and Medical (ISM radio band bands, and\
    \ are deﬁned by article 1.15 of the International\nTelecommunication Union’s (ITU)\
    \ ITU Radio Regulations (RR) [184]. The ISM bands can vary according\nto the region\
    \ and its permits. Its main advantage is its ease of installation and the main\
    \ drawbacks are\nrelated to safety deﬁciencies and possible interferences. The\
    \ licensed spectrum bands are assigned\naccording to the diﬀerent proprietary\
    \ technologies. They oﬀer greater security, greater coverage, and\nfewer interferences.\
    \ However, the cost of using a licensed band is higher.\nThe most utilized communication\
    \ technologies among the reviewed papers are presented in\nTable 6. In many of\
    \ the proposals that we have studied, the authors combine several communication\n\
    technologies instead of using one single protocol. As an example, it is very common\
    \ for authors to\nstart using either a wired or a wireless technology to connect\
    \ the sensors with the nodes, and then, use\na wireless technology to send data\
    \ from nodes to remote or cloud storage centers.\nTable 6. Most utilized communication\

    \ IoT irrigation systems for agriculture are going to\nbe presented.\n7.1. Big\
    \ Data Management and Analytics for Irrigation Optimization\nIoT systems, in general,\
    \ generate a great amount of data due to monitoring diﬀerent parameters\nin real-time,\
    \ and IoT irrigation systems generate big data as well. Therefore, it is necessary\
    \ to provide\nmechanisms to manage and analyze big data. Ahad et al. [202] comment\
    \ on the need for sustainable\nmanagement of big data to avoid overusing natural\
    \ resources. Using blockchain, powering IoT devices\nwith solar energy, selecting\
    \ useful data and discarding unnecessary and redundant data, employing\nclustering\
    \ techniques to reduce the volume of the information, implementing time-eﬃcient\
    \ algorithms\nand the utilization of sustainable resources as alternatives to\
    \ the components that are employed\nnowadays are some of the suggestions they\
    \ provide.\nAlthough the data gathered from the sensors is already a big source\
    \ of information, the analysis\nof this data is paramount to optimize the IoT\
    \ irrigation system according to the crop and the weather\nconditions. For this\
    \ purpose, Tseng et al. [203] presented a big data analysis algorithm to aid farmers\n\
    in the crop selection process. Their proposal satisﬁed the ﬁve Vs (volume, velocity,\
    \ variety, veracity,\nand value) of big data. They performed a 3D correlation\
    \ analysis that evaluated the irrigation cycle to\nidentify the irrigation practices\
    \ performed by the farmer. Then, they calculated the soil moisture content\nto\
    \ detect irrigation and to evaluate if the farmer applied pesticides or fertilizers.\
    \ This information was\ncoupled with data on the weather conditions and other\
    \ aspects of the soil to provide the farmer with\nthe cultivation risks of each\
    \ type of crop. Nonetheless, there are other technologies that are currently\n\
    being utilized to analyze the big data produced by IoT irrigation systems for\
    \ agriculture.\nArtiﬁcial intelligence (AI) is currently the type of technology\
    \ most companies are interested in for\nvarious purposes. In the case of irrigation,\
    \ the use of AI is tied to the optimization of the available\nresources such as\
    \ water, fertilizers or energy or to obtain information from the crops such as\
    \ the\npresence of diseases or the correct growth of the plants, vegetables, and\
    \ fruits. One of the techniques\nemployed to analyze the data gathered from the\
    \ sensors so as to perform decisions on the irrigation\nsystems is fuzzy logic.\
    \ Fuzzy logic has been employed to improve irrigation scheduling in greenhouses\n\
    and control the drainage implementing it on the controller of the system [100].\
    \ The fuzzy rules were\nprovided according to the water availability utilizing\
    \ the QtFuzzyLite software ((FuzzyLite Limited,\nWellington, New Zealand). Another\
    \ fuzzy logic controller is employed to determine the coverage\nerror for the\
    \ resources so as to determine if the eﬀective watering of the plants can be guaranteed\
    \ [96].\nThe system presented in [136] utilized fuzzy logic to determine the duration\
    \ of the irrigation process\nonce the soil moisture values go below the 20% threshold.\
    \ Light and temperature lead to the least\naccuracy in irrigation (40%) whereas\
    \ any combination with the soil moisture values reached an accuracy\nfrom 62 to\
    \ 81%. The authors conclude that the subsoil moisture sensor is the most important\
    \ sensor to\ndetermine irrigation. The irrigation time was predicted in [162]\
    \ as well, using the adaptive neuro fuzzy\ninterference system (ANFIS) to predict\
    \ the irrigation time. This fuzzy logic technique was implemented\nemploying the\
    \ MATLAB software. However, outdoor temperature and light are important to avoid\
    \ the\nevaporation of the water. Another irrigation system utilizes iterative\
    \ learning control (ILC) arithmetic\nto make decisions regarding the opening of\
    \ the water valves [67].\nMachine learning is another technique that is utilized\
    \ in irrigation systems to perform predictions.\nThe prediction algorithm in [120]\
    \ for soil moisture prediction obtained an accuracy of 96%. Prediction\ntechniques\
    \ can also be utilized to estimate the amount of available water for irrigation\
    \ such as the case\nof [119], where the authors employ Fisher’s LDA method for\
    \ that purpose. Water usage is predicted as\nwell in [50] employing regression\
    \ algorithms. The regression algorithms consider the temperature of\nthe environment\
    \ and the water ﬂow to produce a water consumption forecast that is then visualized\n\
    by the user through a mobile app.\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n31 of 48\nFeedforward\
    \ neural networks and the structural similarity index were employed in [204] to\n\
    develop an optimized smart irrigation system. The authors compared gradient descent\
    \ and variable\nlearning rate gradient descent optimization techniques to predict\
    \ soil moisture and they determined\nthat the latter was the best one. Furthermore,\
    \ a study on machine learning applied to agriculture so as\nto perform predictions\
    \ on irrigation was performed in [205]. Diﬀerent machine learning techniques\n\
    were applied to the data on the soil and the environment collected from jojoba\
    \ plantations. The authors\nconclude that the boosted tree classiﬁer was the best\
    \ classiﬁcation model was and the gradient boosted\nregression trees was the best\
    \ regression model. They had a 95% and 93% accuracy respectively.\nThe authors\
    \ suggest as well that diﬀerent feature-sets would be better for diﬀerent plots\
    \ as some\nconﬁgurations achieved better results for diﬀerent types of plots such\
    \ as organic ones. Furthermore, the\nmodels considerably reduced their accuracy\
    \ when deliberated soil drying was performed. Moreover,\nthe authors state that\
    \ the data on the weather and the saturation could be not considered without it\n\
    substantially aﬀecting the accuracy of the models.\n7.2. Low-Cost Autonomous Sensors\n\
    As we have seen in Section 2, the majority of the countries that dedicate more\
    \ eﬀort to researching\nIoT irrigation systems are countries where the farmers\
    \ cannot aﬀord commercial solutions. Therefore,\nmost of the solutions for irrigation\
    \ management are comprised of low-cost sensors and controllers so\nas to increase\
    \ the scope of the beneﬁts of utilizing smart irrigation systems. Apart from individual\n\
    sensors, some shields integrate several sensors and connectors for irrigation\
    \ and agriculture speciﬁc\nIoT systems such as the OpenGarden shield ((Libelium\
    \ Comunicaciones Distribuidas S.L., Zaragoza,\nSpain) [136]. It can be connected\
    \ to an Arduino UNO and it is comprised of an LDR, a DHT22 connector\n(SparkFun\
    \ Electronics, Niwot, CO, USA), a soil moisture connector, a hydroponics connector,\
    \ digital\nand analog pins, a DS18B20 connector (Adafruit Industries, New York,\
    \ NY, USA) and an antenna\nconnector. This type of solution allows the easy implementation\
    \ of low-cost smart irrigation systems.\n7.3. Sustainable Irrigation Systems\n\
    Most irrigation systems do not have access to the power grid, therefore there\
    \ is a need for\nalternative means of powering up the devices that conform the\
    \ system. Even irrigation systems with\naccess to the power grid may only receive\
    \ power during a constrained time period. In India, for\nexample, the system presented\
    \ in [29] determines when access to electricity is available to turn on\nthe irrigation\
    \ motors. This system was designed to help farmers when access to electricity\
    \ happens\nat irregular hours or even at night, when farmers may not be present\
    \ in the ﬁeld. To address the\nneed for alternative ways of powering the irrigation\
    \ systems in agricultural ﬁelds that are too far to\naccess the power grid, many\
    \ systems incorporate a solar energy functionality, making the system\nmore sustainable\
    \ [41]. Furthermore, the use of solar energy reduces the energetic costs which\
    \ is\nan advantage for irrigation systems intended for developing areas.\nConsidering\
    \ those reasons,\na total of 22 of the surveyed papers chose to utilize solar\
    \ energy to power their proposed irrigation\nsystem [4,38,41,46,50,56,63,66,69,88,90–92,96,99,101,140,145,171,178,181].\n\
    7.4. Frequency of the Data Acquisition\nThe frequency at which the parameters\
    \ are monitored may be diﬀerent for each proposal. Real-time\nmonitoring [31,71]\
    \ has been surging as the cost of the devices, whether they are processors, devices\n\
    for data storage or sensors, has experienced a considerable reduction. Some proposals\
    \ decide not to\nmonitor the parameters in real-time so as to reduce energy consumption.\
    \ Some authors have decided\nto take a measure every 10 s [58].\n7.5. New Forms\
    \ of Data Acquisition\nThe advances in technology as lead to new ways of obtaining\
    \ the data from the sensors deployed\nin the ﬁelds. One of the new ways of gathering\
    \ data from the sensor nodes is by utilizing drones [31].\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n\
    32 of 48\nDrones also allow obtaining new data that could not be obtained in other\
    \ ways such as aerial images\nof the ﬁelds.\nAnother new form of data acquisition\
    \ is the use of robots that can incorporate both sensors and\nactuators to perform\
    \ activities such as soil moisture sensing, weeding, spraying water or scaring\
    \ the\nanimals [65]. Robots can be utilized for the irrigation of precise areas\
    \ due to their ability to travel to\nthe desired location [38]. This robot is\
    \ able to measure soil moisture and include proximity sensors\nto avoid collisions.\
    \ The robot has a sprinkler system to irrigate the desired area. Furthermore,\
    \ the\nwireless robot in [66] is comprised of both environmental and soil monitoring\
    \ sensors and performs\ntasks such as water spraying, scaring animals and moving\
    \ through the ﬁeld. In order to improve the\nnavigation of the robots for irrigation,\
    \ the authors in [55] provided the robot with a coverage path\nplanning (CPP)\
    \ algorithm that has a map of the static elements and environmental data. The\
    \ robot\noperating system (ROS) was utilized to develop the control system of\
    \ the robot which is divided into\nthree layers. The ﬁrst layer reads the data\
    \ from the sensors and controls the actuators, the second\nlayer performs the\
    \ communication among the elements of the system and the third layer performs\
    \ the\ndecision making and the path planning. This robot performs irrigation as\
    \ a linear shower. Furthermore,\nthese robots can be powered by solar panels [38,66]\
    \ to provide them with more autonomy.\n7.6. Security in IoT Systems for Irrigation\n\
    Depending on the characteristics of the environment where the implementation of\
    \ the IoT system\nis carried out, securing the system may become a challenging\
    \ task as diﬀerent types of threats must be\nconsidered. On the one hand, all\
    \ the security issues of any IoT system can be applied to an IoT irrigation\n\
    system for agriculture. Therefore, current works with their focus on securing\
    \ IoT describes the security\nchallenges that IoT irrigation systems may face.\
    \ For example, organizations such as the Internet\nEngineering Task Force (IETF)\
    \ study the diﬀerent problems that aﬀect this. Furthermore, authors\nsuch as Garcia-Morchon\
    \ et al. [206] present in their work the following list of security threats and\n\
    managing risks: vulnerable software/code, privacy threats, cloning of things,\
    \ malicious substitution\nof things, eavesdropping attacks, man-in-the-middle\
    \ attack, ﬁrmware attacks, extraction of private\ninformation, routing attack,\
    \ elevation of privilege, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Regarding DoS\nattacks,\
    \ Kamienski et al. [50] highly stressed the importance of protecting the irrigation\
    \ system from\nDoS attacks or avoiding attackers from accessing the collected\
    \ data or the system with the intention of\ndamaging the crops.\nIn order to face\
    \ the above threats, it is necessary to apply the appropriate security measures,\
    \ but\nas new threats and attacks appear daily, [206] propose using methodologies\
    \ such as analyzing the\nbusiness impact of the attack, assessing the threats\
    \ considering their impact and probability, its impact\non the privacy of the\
    \ collected information and the process of reporting and mitigating incidents.\n\
    However, on the other hand, when considering just the currently available studies\
    \ on securing\nIoT irrigation systems speciﬁcally, it is possible to discern which\
    \ aspects of IoT security are prioritized\nfor this type of system.\nJimenez et\
    \ al. [207] identiﬁed the security threats speciﬁc to an intelligent wastewater\
    \ puriﬁcation\nsystem for irrigation. Apart from the previously mentioned security\
    \ threats [206], the authors of [207]\ncontemplate physical attacks that the IoT\
    \ deployment may face. The IoT devices must be protected\nfrom the weather and\
    \ possible animals that access the ﬁelds. However, strong weather conditions\n\
    such as ﬂoods or animals such as wilds boars may result in the IoT device being\
    \ damaged or lost.\nFurthermore, the IoT devices may also be damaged by the operators\
    \ when they are performing their\nactivities or be the aim of a person with malicious\
    \ intentions. Another threat to the devices deployed\non the ﬁeld is the possibility\
    \ of them being replaced to malicious nodes, providing the attacker with\naccess\
    \ to the network [29]. The deployed devices may also be susceptible to malicious\
    \ code and false\ndata injection, leading to wrong results and the malfunction\
    \ of the system. Sleep deprivation attacks\nare aimed at depleting the battery\
    \ of the devices. The deployed nodes are susceptible to booting attacks\nas well.\
    \ Furthermore, attackers may also perform eavesdropping and interfere with the\
    \ deployed\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n33 of 48\ndevices. The concern of securing\
    \ the physical devices deployed on the ﬁelds has led to many systems\nincorporating\
    \ PIR sensors, scarecrows, and buzzers to detect intruders, either humans or animals,\
    \ and\nto alert of their presence [59,208].\nPrivacy is another aspect to consider.\
    \ The data managed by IoT irrigation systems may not need as\nmuch privacy as\
    \ the data managed by other IoT applications such as those for health. In fact,\
    \ Jimenez\net al. [207] remark that it may not be necessary for the gathered data\
    \ of some irrigation IoT systems to\nremain private, but the correct performance\
    \ of the system must be ensured, which is avoiding DoS\nattacks. However, the\
    \ owners of the ﬁelds may be implementing new techniques they would prefer to\n\
    remain private or the water quality management system could be regarded as a critical\
    \ infrastructure\nas the produce that results from the ﬁelds irrigated with that\
    \ water would be consumed by people.\nTherefore, considering this aspect, Ahad\
    \ et al. [202] and Barreto et al. [209] remark the need for user\nprivacy, as\
    \ the obtention of this information may lead to attacks to the owner or the personnel\
    \ of the\nfarm. Ahad et al. [202] consider data and device privacy as well, because\
    \ of the need for guaranteeing\nthe ownership of the data to avoid repudiation\
    \ and ensuring data availability. Barreto et al. [209]\nremark on the burden that\
    \ could be originated from the exposure of the GPS locational data captured\n\
    by IoT devices as attackers may gain information on the location of the farm to\
    \ perform physical attacks.\nLastly, Ahad et al. [202] also comment on the need\
    \ for a secure storage system for the information,\nwith particular emphasis on\
    \ distributed data storage systems. Attacks such as SQL injections can lead\n\
    to the obtention of private information from storage systems [210].\nAs cloud\
    \ computing often goes hand in hand with IoT systems, threats to cloud services\
    \ may\ncompromise the IoT irrigation system as well. Flooding attacks and cloud\
    \ malware injection are some\nof the attacks that can be intentionally executed\
    \ to compromise the data and the performance of the\ncloud [210].\nRansomware\
    \ is another security threat that could aﬀect irrigation systems for agriculture\
    \ [209].\nAll the data regarding pesticides and the fertigation system could be\
    \ encrypted until a ransom is paid.\nFor this reason, having a back-up in a remote\
    \ location is greatly advised.\nBarreto et al. [209] also remark some security\
    \ threats that are not usually commented on when\ndiscussing the security of IoT\
    \ systems for agriculture. One of these threats is the damage that can be\ncaused\
    \ by social engineering as the users of the IoT irrigation system could provide\
    \ login information\nto people posing as technicians or click on malicious links\
    \ on their e-mails. The other threats are\nagroterrorism, cyber-espionage, mostly\
    \ related to accessing intellectual property or conﬁdential\ninformation regarding\
    \ aspects such as genetically modiﬁed crops.\nBlockchain is a new technique that\
    \ is being applied to secure IoT systems [210], which allows\nsecure data storage\
    \ and communication. In agriculture, it is mostly utilized to secure the supply\n\
    chain [211], although there are other proposals that use it to secure a greenhouse\
    \ [212] or to secure\nthe overall smart agriculture framework [213]. Regarding\
    \ IoT irrigation systems for agriculture,\nblockchain has been applied in [214]\
    \ to track and trace the information exchange of their proposed\nsmart watering\
    \ system.\n7.7. Common Architecture Designs for IoT Irrigation Systems for Agriculture\n\
    In this subsection, an overview of the most frequent architectures for these systems\
    \ is going to\nbe discussed.\nMulti-agent architectures are popular in IoT solutions\
    \ for irrigation management [175,180].\nThese types of architectures make a distinction\
    \ among the diﬀerent elements they are comprised of.\nTypically, the distinction\
    \ is made according to the layer of the architecture the elements are encompassed\n\
    in. For example, nodes positioned higher in the hierarchy may act as a broker\
    \ for those lower in the\nhierarchy [175].\nMost architectures are divided into\
    \ layers or functional blocks that represent the main actions to\nbe carried out\
    \ [215]. These blocks or layers can be considered as generic and are utilized\
    \ in most of the\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n34 of 48\navailable architecture designs\
    \ for IoT systems intended for irrigation management. The main elements\nof these\
    \ architectures are devices, communications, services, management, applications,\
    \ and security.\nIoT systems are comprised of devices located in a certain environment\
    \ to perform multiple\nactivities such as detection, monitoring, control, and\
    \ action. The devices must have interfaces that allow\ntheir connection with other\
    \ devices to transmit the necessary information. The data obtained through\ndiﬀerent\
    \ sensors will generally be treated and their results will be applied to diﬀerent\
    \ actuators. Then, it\nis necessary to transmit the monitored data and response\
    \ actions between the devices. Communication\nprotocols are used for this task.\
    \ In most cases, diﬀerent communication protocols are used working\ntogether on\
    \ the same IoT system. In order to perform activities such as device discovery,\
    \ device control\nor the analysis of the collected data, the use of services may\
    \ be necessary as well. The applications allow\nthe interaction of the user with\
    \ the system. From the applications, the user will be able to visualize\nthe information,\
    \ both obtained by monitoring and that extracted from the data once they have\
    \ been\nprocessed. On many occasions, the user can execute the actions that he\
    \ considers appropriate to the\nsituation presented by the data, the actions can\
    \ also be carried out automatically. Lastly, providing\nsecurity to the system\
    \ may also be considered.\nTraditionally, the IoT architecture has been considered\
    \ to be divided into three layers, which are\nthe perception, network, and application\
    \ layer. Later on, an intermediate layer placed between the\nnetwork and application\
    \ layers has been introduced in multiple studies. This layer, called service layer,\n\
    is employed to store and process data using cloud and fog computing. For the last\
    \ few years, authors\nsuch as Ferrández-Pastor [216] presented a new architecture\
    \ proposal, based on four layers: things,\nedge, communication, and cloud. In\
    \ these latest architectural proposals, the authors use the edge layer\nto locate\
    \ critical applications and perform basic control processes. Also, as indicated\
    \ by [216], cloud\n(internet/intranet) can provide Web services, data storage,\
    \ HMI interfaces or analytic applications.\nFigure 29 shows an image where one\
    \ can see the architecture models.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n34 of 48 \n \nelements\
    \ of these architectures are devices, communications, services, management, applications,\
    \ \nand security.  \nIoT systems are comprised of devices located in a certain\
    \ environment to perform multiple \nactivities such as detection, monitoring,\
    \ control, and action. The devices must have interfaces that \nallow their connection\
    \ with other devices to transmit the necessary information. The data obtained\
    \ \nthrough different sensors will generally be treated and their results will\
    \ be applied to different \nactuators. Then, it is necessary to transmit the monitored\
    \ data and response actions between the \ndevices. Communication protocols are\
    \ used for this task. In most cases, different communication \nprotocols are used\
    \ working together on the same IoT system. In order to perform activities such\
    \ as \ndevice discovery, device control or the analysis of the collected data,\
    \ the use of services may be \nnecessary as well. The applications allow the interaction\
    \ of the user with the system. From the \napplications, the user will be able\
    \ to visualize the information, both obtained by monitoring and that \nextracted\
    \ from the data once they have been processed. On many occasions, the user can\
    \ execute the \nactions that he considers appropriate to the situation presented\
    \ by the data, the actions can also be \ncarried out automatically. Lastly, providing\
    \ security to the system may also be considered.  \nTraditionally, the IoT architecture\
    \ has been considered to be divided into three layers, which are \nthe perception,\
    \ network, and application layer. Later on, an intermediate layer placed between\
    \ the \nnetwork and application layers has been introduced in multiple studies.\
    \ This layer, called service \nlayer, is employed to store and process data using\
    \ cloud and fog computing. For the last few years, \nauthors such as Ferrández-Pastor\
    \ [216] presented a new architecture proposal, based on four layers: \nthings,\
    \ edge, communication, and cloud. In these latest architectural proposals, the\
    \ authors use the \nedge layer to locate critical applications and perform basic\
    \ control processes. Also, as indicated by \n[216], cloud (internet/intranet)\
    \ can provide Web services, data storage, HMI interfaces or analytic \napplications.\

    \ -\n80 dBm for 50 m. The distance between underground devices reached approximately\

    \ proposal for an IoT irrigation system for agriculture. \n7.9. Future Challenges\
    \ of IoT Irrigation Systems \nThe Internet of Underground Things (IoUT) is a new\
    \ view of the IoT [221]. It consists of \ndeploying both underground and above\
    \ ground IoT devices that communicate among themselves \nwith underground-underground,\
    \ underground-above ground, and above ground-above ground \ncommunication. It\
    \ is especially useful and applicable to irrigation and precision agriculture\
    \ IoT \nsystems as the devices would not be impeding the work of machines and\
    \ farmers and it would reduce \nthe amount of physical damage the nodes deployed\
    \ on the fields may receive. Although WiFi \nsurprisingly allows underground-above\
    \ ground communication in short distances and depths above \n30 cm [222], it would\
    \ be necessary to study the performance of other existing protocols or even the\
    \ \ncreation of a new protocol that employs lower frequency bands to transmit\
    \ the information through \nthe soil medium.  \nThe use of LoRa is increasing\
    \ for irrigation and precision agriculture applications due to its long-\nrange,\
    \ which allows wireless communication to remote fields. However, the advances\
    \ in 5G may lead \nto a decrease in the interest in LoRa technology. On the one\
    \ hand, if the designed irrigation system \nproduces lower amounts of data, as\
    \ these types of systems present low variability in the data, LoRa \npresents\
    \ itself as a very good solution. However, on the other hand, for IoT systems\
    \ that require the \ntransmission of large amounts of data, 5G would solve the\
    \ problem of the limited amount of data \nthat LoRa can transmit. Considering\
    \ these aspects, a possible future is the use of LoRa and 5G hybrid \nwireless\
    \ networks to attempt in satisfying those needs [223]. \nThere are diverse opinions\
    \ on the existence and effects of climate change on earth. However, \nthere is\
    \ no doubt that many governments, companies and the citizens themselves are increasing\
    \ their \nawareness regarding sustainable consumption. This not only affects their\
    \ view on the energy \nconsumption of IoT systems for irrigation but also, the\
    \ origin of the components of the devices and \nthe impact of IoT devices on the\
    \ environment and the fauna of the area where they are deployed. \nTherefore,\
    \ the reduction in energy consumption and the use of alternative powering methods\
    \ will \ncontinue to be a research trend. Furthermore, it may be a challenge to\
    \ find new materials that are \nweather-resistant and do not increase severely\
    \ the cost of the devices, but the use of recyclable \nmaterials in some of the\
    \ elements of the IoT devices is to be expected [203]. \nAs it has further been\
    \ commented on Subsection 7 1 blockchain and AI will be incorporated into\nFigure\
    \ 30. Architecture proposal for an IoT irrigation system for agriculture.\nThe\
    \ ﬁrst layer is the Device layer, where all the devices that will perform the\
    \ functions of detection,\nmonitoring, control, and action are located. We would\
    \ have four types of nodes. The water monitoring\nnode would monitor water quality\
    \ to determine if the water is apt for the irrigation of the crops.\nThe soil\
    \ monitoring node would monitor soil moisture, soil temperature and other parameters\
    \ that\naid in the irrigation schedule decision process. The weather monitoring\
    \ node would measure air\ntemperature and humidity, precipitation, luminosity,\
    \ radiation, and wind parameters so as to aid in\nthe decision making process.\
    \ Lastly, the actuator nodes would perform the actions resulting from the\ndecision-making\
    \ process.\nThe second layer is the communication layer, comprised of three blocks.\
    \ The Hop-to-Hop\ncommunication block allows deﬁning data link layer technologies\
    \ and to transmit the frames that\ncontain the data of the device layer. From\
    \ this block the frames will be sent to the network communication\nblock, to reach\
    \ the remote locations. The routing function can be assumed in this block in mesh\n\
    networks, such as 802.15.4 networks. The end-to-end communication block is responsible\
    \ for delivering\nthe capabilities of the transport and application layers of\
    \ the TCP/IP model when communication\ncrosses diﬀerent network environments.\
    \ Finally, the network communication block is responsible for\nthe communication\
    \ (routing) between the networks, of the hop-to-hop at end-to-end blocks, using\n\
    the address, for example, IPv4 and IPv6, and the ID resolution. In addition, it\
    \ will be responsible for\nmanaging the QoS.\nThe next layer is the services layer,\
    \ which is comprised of three blocks. The services block includes\nthe IoT services\
    \ and operability for their discovery and search. The organization block performs\
    \ the\nassignment of the services according to the needs of the users or the available\
    \ resources. At last,\nin business environments that relate to IoT, the modeling\
    \ and execution of service block will be invoked\nfrom the execution of the applications.\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 1042\n36 of 48\nThere are two blocks, management and security,\
    \ that act on both the previously described\ncommunication and services layers.\
    \ The management block is based on the fault, conﬁguration,\naccounting, performance,\
    \ security (FCAPS) model and framework.\nThis is a model of the ISO\nTelecommunications\
    \ Management Network [220].\nThe security block guarantees both the security and\
    \ privacy of the systems and is comprised\nof four blocks. The authentication\
    \ block is responsible for the authentication of users and services.\nThe authorization\
    \ block manages access control policies. Furthermore, access control decisions\
    \ will\nbe made based on access control policies. The key exchange & management\
    \ block is used to achieve\nsecure communications between peers. Finally, the\
    \ trust & reputation block is responsible for scoring\nthe user and calculating\
    \ the level of trust of the service.\nThe last layer is the application layer.\
    \ It allows users to interact with the IoT system. From this\nlayer, users can\
    \ receive alarms, visualize the gathered data in real-time or activate the actuators\
    \ or\nactions that have not been programmed automatically.\n7.9. Future Challenges\
    \ of IoT Irrigation Systems\nThe Internet of Underground Things (IoUT) is a new\
    \ view of the IoT [221].\nIt consists of\ndeploying both underground and above\
    \ ground IoT devices that communicate among themselves\nwith underground-underground,\
    \ underground-above ground, and above ground-above ground\ncommunication. It is\
    \ especially useful and applicable to irrigation and precision agriculture IoT\n\
    systems as the devices would not be impeding the work of machines and farmers\
    \ and it would\nreduce the amount of physical damage the nodes deployed on the\
    \ ﬁelds may receive. Although WiFi\nsurprisingly allows underground-above ground\
    \ communication in short distances and depths above\n30 cm [222], it would be\

    \ and the citizens themselves are increasing\ntheir awareness regarding sustainable\
    \ consumption. This not only aﬀects their view on the energy\nconsumption of IoT\

    and do not increase severely the cost of the devices, but the use of recyclable\
    \ materials in some of the\nelements of the IoT devices is to be expected [203].\n\
    As it has further been commented on Section 7.1, blockchain and AI will be incorporated\
    \ into most\nIoT services [210], including those aimed at irrigation and precision\
    \ agriculture. These technologies\nprovide not only increased security but also\
    \ optimization to the management of the IoT systems.\nThis will lead to an increased\
    \ understanding of the crops and a faster way to characterize genetically\nmodiﬁed\
    \ crops and the eﬀects of new fertilizers and pesticides. Furthermore, it will\
    \ aid in optimizing\nand reducing water consumption and improving the new mechanisms\
    \ that are being proposed to\ndetermine if treated wastewater can be used for\
    \ irrigation and which crops can be irrigated with\nwastewater depending on its\
    \ composition.\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n37 of 48\nLastly, farmers usually have\
    \ a very small proﬁt and thus, these IoT systems may not be aﬀordable\nto them.\
    \ Therefore, the cost of IoT devices and the overall system implementation should\
    \ have a\ndecreasing tendency for these types of systems to have a commercial\
    \ future.\n8. Conclusions and Future Work\nWater management is paramount in countries\
    \ with water scarcity. This also aﬀects agriculture, as\na large amount of water\
    \ is dedicated to this use. The rising concerns about global warming have led\n\
    to the consideration of creating water management measures to ensure the availability\
    \ of water for\nfood production and consumption. Thus, the researches on water\
    \ usage reduction for irrigation have\nincreased over the years. In this paper,\
    \ we have provided an overview of the actual state of the art\nregarding IoT irrigation\
    \ systems for agriculture. We have identiﬁed the most monitored parameters to\n\
    characterize water quality for irrigation, soil and weather conditions. We have\
    \ also identiﬁed the most\nutilized nodes to implement IoT and WSN systems for\
    \ the irrigation of crops and the most popular\nwireless technologies. Furthermore,\
    \ the current trends in the implementation of IoT systems for crop\nmanagement\
    \ and irrigation have been discussed as well. We have provided a 4-layer architecture\n\
    proposal as well for the management of crop irrigation.\nAs future work, we are\
    \ developing a smart irrigation system that evaluates water quality prior to\n\
    irrigation based on the proposed architecture.\nAuthor Contributions: Methodology,\

    Abstract: Precision agriculture is a breakthrough in digital farming technology,
    which facilitates the appli-

    cation of precise and exact amount of input level of water and fertilizer to the
    crop at the required time for

    increasing the yield. Since agriculture relies on direct rainfall than irrigation
    and the prediction of rainfall

    date is easily available from web source, the integration of rainfall prediction
    with precision agriculture

    helps to regulate the water consumption in farms. In this work, an edge computing
    model is developed for

    predicting soil moisture in real time and managing the water usage in accordance
    with rain prediction. A

    soil moisture prediction hybrid algorithm (SMPHA) has been developed that revolves
    around the decision-

    making techniques with live environmental parameters including weather parameters
    for the prediction of

    soil moisture through the impact of precipitation. Numerous algorithms with the
    combination of regression

    + clustering are estimated, and it is inferred that XGBoost + k-means outperforms
    other algorithmic com-

    binations that is deployed in edge model. This model is used as an intermediary
    between the end IoT

    devices and cloud that results in the saving of computationally intensive processing
    performed on cloud

    servers. The servers located on a local edge network perform the developed algorithmic
    computations.

    Avoiding transmission over the cloud results in signiﬁcant latency, response time,
    and computation power

    savings and therefore increases the eﬃciency of data transfer. The proposed edge
    computing model is

    implemented in Raspberry Pi as an edge, Heroku as cloud, and edge nodes as the
    combination of Pi with

    actuators and sensors. The monitored data from Pi are stored in MongoDB webserver
    that is controlled by

    Web dashboard. Finally, the developed model is implemented in cloud and edge where
    the edge server

    implementation performs better in terms of latency, bandwidth, throughput, response
    time, and CPU

    memory usage.

    1 Introduction

    It is evident that agriculture always has a specialized role in the anthrophonic
    evolution and has been

    serving as an important economic factor for the growth of a country [1]. Around
    58% of the population

    depend on agriculture as the chief source of livelihood in India. The quality
    and productivity of agricultural

    products have declined over these years as several factors have inﬂuenced the
    crop productivity both

    directly and indirectly. Some major factors that aﬀect the crop production are
    climatic changes, global

    warming, and water scarcity [2]. The agricultural land’s productivity is aﬀected
    by the direct and indirect

    changes in climate [3,4]. The crop growth has been already aﬀected by the changes
    in climate incurred by

    global warming. The nutrition quality of soil, ground water level, sea, and ocean
    are aﬀected by the

    modiﬁcations in average temperature, rainfall, and extreme weather conditions
    such as hail storms, dust

    storms, heatwaves, etc. due to global warming [5,6]. Degradation of soil is primarily
    created by various

    methods including 93.7% by water erosion, 9.5% by wind erosion, 5.9% by salinity
    and alkalinity, etc.

    Further changes in climate would inﬂuence adversely the crop production [7]. Since
    water is an indispen-

    sable requirement for plants and cultivation, the high level of soil is eroded
    and thereby the fertility is also

    declined. Due to the ever-changing climate, water scarcity has become a huge problem.
    Drought-like

    conditions is already formed in several areas and thereby the present and conventional
    farming practices

    are not suitable. New and unique environment preserving techniques are the need
    of the hour [8].

    The conventional approaches in agriculture are enhanced by the advent of several
    advancements in

    technology [9]. These new improved methodologies ensure optimized utilization
    of resources, accurate

    forecast of water needs and environmental parameters, reduction of human intervention,
    etc. [10]. Conse-

    quently, the outcomes of crops in terms of yield and quality are higher with cost-eﬀective
    methods. One

    such booming technology is the Internet of things (IoT) [11].

    IoT is the collection of components embedded in the sensor for measuring and transferring
    data via

    network devices as sensed from pumps and tractors to weather stations. Primarily,
    IoT deals with the

    transmission and reception of data related to farms through devices using the
    Internet for prediction

    and providing decisions to the farmers. IoT-based methodologies has brought a
    changeover in agricultural

    patterns and farming approaches [12]. IoT devices can gather information about
    soil moisture, chemical

    properties, dam levels, livestock health, and weather details in real time. The
    information acquired from IoT

    devices facilitates the farmers in tracking farms periodically. Farmers can save
    time and money by

    responding faster to farm conditions. Cloud computing models integrated with on-ﬁeld
    agricultural sensors

    need to be incorporated for tackling the issue of processing huge voluminous data.

    One of the major challenges of IoT is the processing of huge datasets in a sequential
    way. Some of the

    key factors that need to be focused on this process are as follows: information
    about the type and nature of

    data, the way of acquiring the data, etc. The preliminary stage comprises acquiring
    the data and ingesting

    the data to the system. Substantial cognizance of data are achieved as the data
    pass through all the

    gateways where it is cleansed and transformed before entering into the system.
    In the near future, dynamic

    prediction of soil moisture and precipitation techniques are to be developed for
    smart irrigation systems.

    Therefore, a system is developed for eﬃcient and optimal utilization of fresh
    water in irrigation along with

    drip irrigation system. It aids in ﬁnding which one of the plants fails to get
    suﬃcient water. When the water

    supply is provided the next day, this delay should not disturb the system. It
    becomes important for the

    farmers to understand the optimal usage of water and fertilizers to bring out
    sustenance in the agricultural

    industry. Therefore, processing must be done for analyzing the data, so that patterns
    can be analyzed and

    planning can be done for the long term, accordingly. Hence, it gives a broad vision
    in deciding where the

    processing is to be done exactly. Therefore, it is obvious that not all data are
    crucial, and it provides a clear

    view of which data need to be stored, discarded, and retained for both long-term
    and short-term purposes.

    Thus, all these challenging issues require to be addressed and that is where storage
    technologies are

    actually highlighted. The poor quality of Internet access in developing nations
    makes the implementation

    quite challenging. An applicable solution to solve this problem is through edge
    computing where the

    essential data could be oﬄoaded from the cloud over the edge of the cloud, and
    this is the exact point

    where the approach of smart sensing with edge computing gets in.

    With the purpose of broadening the potential of edge computing and using it in
    the agriculture domain,

    a novel approach using machine learning (ML) methods is proposed for analyzing
    the data acquired by the

    IoT devices deployed at the farm. Here, the data acquired from IoT components
    undergo preprocessing and

    ML models on the edge nodes to analyze and assess the appropriate results for
    providing the best instruc-

    tions for controlling the actuators (e.g., light, pumps at diﬀerent locations)
    in the farms.

    This article presents an automated system, as shown in Figure 1, to predict the
    soil moisture using the

    ﬁeld information acquired from the self-designed sensor node deployed at the ﬁeld
    and the forecast

    information of weather via Internet. A unique algorithm has been developed that
    revolves around the

    IoT-enabled edge computing model for smart irrigation system

    

    633

    machine learning techniques for the prediction of soil moisture. Here, many algorithms
    with the combina-

    tion of regression + clustering was estimated, and it is inferred that XGBoost
    + k-means outperforms other

    algorithmic combinations, and therefore, it is deployed for the prediction of
    soil moisture in the proposed

    work. The proposed algorithm makes eﬀective irrigation decisions with optimized
    usage of water in a more

    accurate and reliable manner. The eﬀective decision-making refers to the process
    of predicting the rainfall,

    thereby reducing the water usage in advance by the proposed algorithm in accordance
    with the predicted

    rainy days. Through this automatic decision-making, over watering is avoided by
    saving the soil. The

    server-side software is developed with node-side connectivity using the information
    for visualization and

    decision support features. This proposed algorithm is implemented in edge to prove
    the eﬃciency of the

    edge server handling the automated system better than the cloud control. The performance
    of the decen-

    tralized edge-based architecture has been evaluated for downloading the hybrid
    algorithm from cloud in

    real time execution. The performance can be enhanced by adopting edge computing
    architecture and

    measured with the help of network parameters like latency, bandwidth, and response
    time. Edge computing

    capacity is also estimated using the CPU processor and memory consumption while
    executing the proposed

    algorithm with irrigation scheduling.

    2 Related work

    In ref. [13], a smart irrigation system not aﬀected by communication disconnection
    and delay is developed

    using edge nodes deployed at the farms. Environmental parameters have an intricate
    impact on the plant

    growth. It becomes necessary for evaluating multiple AI models simultaneously
    in an actual cultivation

    environment for comparing AI models under the same conditions. Due to the working
    of existing irrigation

    systems on the cloud, communication is instable in the concurrent evaluation of
    AI models. However, the

    instability does not induce an edge node in its performance.

    The factors such as type of plant, soil, climate, humidity, temperature, and soil
    moisture need to be

    considered for the irrigation system packed with potential smart decisions. The
    nature and type of plant,

    soil, and climate are queried by ontology (branch of metaphysics dealing with
    the nature of being), whereas

    other factors such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture are sensed by the
    sensor network. The

    trained ML model predicts the watering decisions based on ontology and other factors
    as mentioned earlier.

    Smart irrigation has three modules: (i) sensor network modules that sense the
    parameters impacting the water

    requirement by using sensors DHT22, light sensor BH1750, and HL-69 hygrometer
    for sensing the temperature,

    soil moisture, light, and humidity in air. (ii) Edge and IoT server’s module to
    send and receive data through

    HTTP requests. (iii) Training module in which KNN is applied on the sample dataset
    for training and decision-

    making regarding the water needs. Based on the input values, the trained model
    categorizes the input into ﬁve

    possible classes: highly not needed, not needed, average, needed, and highly needed
    [14].

    A decentralized smart irrigation approach is proposed for strawberry greenhouses
    in contrast to con-

    ventional cloud-based solutions for keeping the agricultural data at the edge
    of the network. A full-scale

    smart irrigation system in an actual strawberry greenhouse environment is developed
    after a small-scale

    smart irrigation networking prototype system and a reference architecture targeting
    edge data distribution

    for strawberry greenhouse applications are framed. A three-step industrial approach
    is formed for

    designing, implementing, and validating a solution for smart strawberry irrigation
    in greenhouses and

    keeping the corresponding data at the edge of the network at the same time: (i)
    A small-scale smart

    irrigation prototype solution with oﬀ-the-shelf hardware and software equipment
    is tested and evaluated

    on various types of plants for gaining useful insights for deployments on a large
    scale. (ii) A reference

    network architecture is designed for targeting smart irrigation and edge data
    distribution speciﬁcally for

    strawberry greenhouses. (iii) A large-scale system in an actual strawberry greenhouse
    environment is

    developed in Greece, incorporating the proposed reference architecture [15].

    Edge computing is proposed for addressing the issues by taking advantage of computing
    resources in

    the edge of the network. The issues such as an edge mobile device make it easier
    to achieve low end-to-end

    latency, high bandwidth, and low jitter to services located on the edge network.
    An edge can enforce the

    privacy policies of its owner prior to the release of the data to the cloud through
    edge analytics. If a cloud

    service becomes unavailable due to network failure, cloud failure, or a denial-of-service
    attack, a fallback

    service on a nearby edge can temporarily mask the failure. Cloud services, partial
    analysis, and control

    functions are extended to the edge nodes from the cloud data center. Edge nodes
    facilitate the timely

    monitoring of sensors in smart farming by the reduced latency and enhanced data
    transmission. Due to

    these factors, edge computing is applied through farming [16,17]. A three-tier
    open-source software plat-

    form we proposed by authors, and the platform enhanced the precision agriculture
    by introducing edge

    computing and fog computing. An network functions virtualization (NFV)-based approach
    is deployed for

    performing the local operational decisions at the edge level for mitigating the
    inﬂuence of network failures

    while using cloud data centers [18]. For control processing in smart farming,
    a platform enabling cost-

    eﬀective sensor/actuator network based on IoT, utilizes edge computing [19,20].

    The authors in ref. [21] predicted the soil moisture using a mathematical model
    that measures the

    values given by a sensor matrix on the ground. Due to the huge interval in measurements
    (10 minutes), the

    model presented estimated error by more than 10%. This methodology has incorporated
    the online

    approach by making the sensors to send data every minute to edge devices without
    time-based interruption.

    The authors of ref. [22] applied a combinative approach of using ﬁeld sensor network’s
    data along with

    weather forecast station’s data for the management of optimality in water conditions
    for the enhanced

    growth of grapes. The generated data are forwarded to a web server, which displays
    graphics without

    statistical analysis of such data. The analysis must be performed a posteriori
    by the user.

    The watering mechanism for a plant via IoT methodology is devised by the proposed
    smart irrigation

    model without acquiring any pre-processed data. A prototype application is developed,
    which gets adapted

    to the parameters needed in irrigation after a couple of human-made irrigations.
    With the usage of various

    ML algorithms, several tests are devised for manual and automated irrigations
    for the performance evalua-

    tion. After the evaluation using four diﬀerent ML algorithms such as logistic
    regression (LR), K-nearest

    neighbors (KNN), Gaussian naive Bayes (GNB), and gradient boosting regression
    trees (GBRT), it is found

    that GBRT outperforms other algorithms. To analyze the overall performance, a
    test bed for the sensor edge,

    mobile client, and the decision service on the cloud is established. Two diﬀerent
    indoor species are selected

    as test items for the prototype, namely, Peace lily and Sardinia. The outcomes
    were quite good, and it is

    inferred that the prototype has learned the patterns of irrigation and making
    decisions automatically with a

    high rate of accuracy [23].

    The authors from ref. [24] adopted the deep learning methodology for detecting
    the type and the

    category of the plant using an automated plant irrigation system. The water necessity
    of the plant is

    determined using the recognition of predeﬁned set of plant images and data set
    acquired from farm. It

    utilizes the database for fetching the irrigation information after the recognition
    process is completed.

    Modeling the training processes are time consuming as voluminous set of images
    needs to be stored.

    The authors in refs [25,26] incorporated ML methods in the irrigation decision
    support model using a

    pre-processed irrigation data set. A model is developed for learning the irrigation
    needs of any plants

    progressively rather than using a readily available dataset. Several ML algorithms
    are evaluated with their

    precision for concluding the irrigation decisions. Manual irrigations are performed
    two times before making

    precise decisions. Due to the dynamicity in model, data processing is done progressively,
    and it can be

    applied to several plants having varying irrigation conditions. There is a need
    for the learning model that

    can be trained by itself using a comparatively lighter learning process using
    environmental parameters that

    do not need larger storage in the system but need higher computation. From the
    aforementioned survey for

    making a precise decision with instant computation locally, edge computing needs
    to be integrated into the

    irrigation system. This article is directed towards presenting a platform that
    implies IoTs and edge com-

    puting in monitoring soil moisture via sensors, data communication between sensors
    and edge devices, and

    an Analytics-as-a-Service cloud. It analyzes the collected data in the form of
    a density map of soil moisture

    for denoting the areas in need of greater or lesser frequency of irrigation. Here,
    density map does not refer to

    the geographical point data by satellite mapping, and it actually denotes the
    point of dry area and watery

    area through soil moisture detection point. This point is averaged among areas
    of irrigation to be done and

    the irrigation process is controlled with prediction of rainfall using the proposed
    system.

    3 The proposed system

    The proposed learning model for irrigation is implemented in a prototype IoT system
    that has four compo-

    nents: (i) Edge node layer – This layer consists of sensors, actuator, and two
    microcontrollers. In this layer,

    edge node acquires the sensor data from the surroundings and controls the actuator
    for actuating water

    pumps to start irrigation. (ii) Edge server layer – This layer consists of Raspberry
    Pi that act as edge server

    and capable of multitask processing. Here, edge server controls the edge nodes
    for sending signal and

    receiving data at regular interval of time. It is also connected to the cloud
    server for receiving developed and

    trained machine learning model to be deployed and make irrigation decision for
    controlling edge nodes.

    (iii) Edge service layer – This layer is deployed in the edge server and it is
    responsible for controlling the

    whole system through a developed web dashboard. The dashboard has live feed data,
    control of edge

    nodes, and cloud services access. This service layer also has the control access
    of the proposed machine

    learning model. (iv) Cloud server layer – This layer composed of cloud services
    and cloud storage where its

    role is to train the machine learning model and store the data in database. It
    sends the trained proposed

    model to the edge server for decision-making regarding irrigation scheduling.
    The comprehensive inter-

    connections in the system are shown in Figure 2. The proposed IoT-based smart
    irrigation system includes

    ﬁve major components: ﬁeld deployed module, Web-based interface, Web API weather
    input, soil moisture

    prediction mechanism, and edge communication model.

    3.1 Field deployed module

    In the ﬁeld requirements, a wireless sensor network of the sensor nodes needs
    to be deployed as shown in

    Figure 3. Here, ﬁeld data collection device accommodates four diﬀerent sensors:
    Capacitive Soil Moisture

    Sensor V2.0, DS18B20 Water Proof Temperature Sensor Probe for soil temperature,
    ultraviolet (UV) Light

    Radiation, DHT11 – Temperature and Humidity Sensor Module, and GYML8511 Analog
    Output Ultra-Violet

    Light Sensor Module. An Arduino Mega connected to Raspberry Pi 4 Model-B read,
    the output of these

    sensors where the program is developed in Python for the Pi model to fetch the
    hourly data from sensors

    and store the data in MongoDB [27] database. It is then synchronized with the
    server database using the

    developed web service. A Wi-Fi-enabled Arduino controls the water pump connected
    to a relay switch.

    Figure 2: Components of the proposed system.

    Figure 3: Real-time prototype of the proposed edge model.

    IoT-enabled edge computing model for smart irrigation system

    

    637

    For the real time monitoring, a trigger is made for controlling the web service
    from the responsive web-

    based interface. The irrigation decisions are checked periodically by the proposed
    model performed in the

    server. The water pump is actuated, and irrigation process is started only if
    the server makes any irrigation

    decision. A wireless sensor network (WSN) [28] scenario with ZigBee [29] technology
    can be implemented

    for a large farming area in which several sensor nodes can be aﬃxed in the speciﬁed
    area and every sensor

    node possesses sensors similar to a standalone device. Then, the Arduino Mega
    reads the sensor output

    connected to ZigBee for transferring data to Gateway Node for aggregating the
    received data and storing it

    in MongoDB locally and also for transferring the data via web service to the edge
    server.

    3.2 Web-based interface

    The proposed framework consists of a web-based application to allow farmers visualize
    the growing data

    and interacting with the garden in real time. In addition, users can also be able
    to examine and analyze the

    historical growing data, if needed, through functionalities such as irrigation
    control, motor control predic-

    tion model deployment, and manual data entry implemented in this web application.
    Here, Node.js was

    chosen for developing the web application [30,31], while MongoDB [27] was utilized
    as the database system.

    Data stored in the database, which is deployed in the cloud, will be used for
    further data analysis in the

    future. The web application’s functions are designed following a software design
    pattern called model-

    view-controller (MVC) as shown in Figure 4. In the frontend, ChartJS is used to
    represent data through

    dynamic charts. The web application is also used as an interface to manage all
    the physical devices/

    actuators in the garden. To deploy the web-server to the cloud, a cloud platform
    as a service (PaaS), namely,

    Heroku, had been utilized. Heroku is a cloud platform that provides platform as
    a service (PaaS), facilitates

    the creation of applications and deploying these online rapidly [32,33]. It also
    enhances scalability and

    functionality by integrating several add-on services. The ﬁeld data are sent to
    the server by Raspberry Pi

    using this web service. This web service manages the network outage/ﬂuctuation
    during data synchroniza-

    tion from the ﬁeld device to the server by taking the help of ﬂag settings at
    the database level. The interface

    facilitates the scheduling of irrigation along with visualizing real time sensors
    and predicted soil moisture

    for upcoming days and precipitation information. By using the denoted threshold
    value of soil moisture

    suggested by agronomists, the irrigation can be scheduled by the user. The system
    maintains the threshold

    value depending on the predicted pattern of soil moisture and precipitation information.
    The process of

    irrigation is initiated automatically and stopped after the speciﬁed threshold
    value generated from the

    proposed algorithm of soil moisture when it is reached.

    3.3 Web API weather input

    The weather prediction data are collected by a web service developed in Python.
    The forecast data such as

    humidity, temperature, ultra violet index, precipitation, and cloudiness of web
    forecasting portals like

    Open Weather API are aggregated by the developed web service [34]. These portals
    provide the forecasted

    information in HTML, XML, or JSON format. The predicted data with JSON format
    are read by the developed

    web and stored in database at the edge server, which is concerned in the prediction
    algorithm. Also, these

    data are utilized as testing dataset in the ML model for predicting the soil moisture.

    3.4 Soil moisture prediction mechanism

    An algorithm for predicting the soil moisture based on data derived from ﬁeld
    sensors and weather fore-

    casting using the combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning
    techniques has been

    developed underpinned by regression algorithms and k-means clustering for estimating
    the diﬀerence/

    change in soil moisture owing to weather conditions. Many regression algorithms
    are compared against

    each other and infusing each of them with k-means to check the preciseness in
    mean square error (MSE),

    R2, accuracy and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for prediction of soil
    moisture of upcoming days

    with the help of sensor data and weather forecasting days. The information about
    soil moisture for the

    upcoming days and suggestions for irrigation in accordance with the prescribed
    levels of soil moisture and

    predicted precipitation values, thereby saving energy and water, is presented
    by the algorithm. The infor-

    mation generated from the device and the predicted values from the algorithm soil
    moisture prediction

    hybrid algorithm (SMPHA) are stored in the server.

    3.5 Edge communication model

    The communication protocols in the proposed framework are ﬂexible and transparent
    in nature for

    accepting both wired and wireless methodologies. For the maximum utilization of
    potentiality in edge

    computing components, the communication among various components in the edge-IoT
    system requires

    intense probing by using the versatility among the devices in network edges. For
    transferring the data

    gathered from pivot sensors, a communication technology such as Zigbee [35] is
    needed for the irrigation

    systems. Therefore, the communication component in the proposed work is classiﬁed
    into three main areas

    as shown in Figure 5. The Message Query Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol is
    used for the

    Figure 5: Proposed edge communication model.

    communication in the proposed system. The analysis in ref. [36] presented seven
    IoT messaging protocols

    (MQTT, CoAP, XMPP, AMQP, DDS, REST-HTTP, and WebSocket) as communication protocols
    that play a

    major role in smart farming. The authors have concluded that MQTT proved to be
    the most secure protocol

    after probing all the protocols with respect to latency, energy and bandwidth
    requirements, throughput,

    reliability, and security. Moreover, MQTT is secure in both end-to-end architecture
    and gateway server

    architecture. In an MQTT setup, a MQTT server termed as MQTT broker executes on
    the IoT solution [37].

    Under a common identiﬁer, a “publisher” and a “subscriber” link among themselves
    to this broker. In the

    IoT solution, publishers and subscribers are the IoT devices and IoT hubs or control
    devices, respectively.

    When the publishers have new data for recording, the data are published to the
    broker. The broker then

    ﬂags that it has new publisher data, and the corresponding data are read by the
    subscriber. Then, the

    subscriber analyzes the data and reacts accordingly.

    The ﬁrst level accomplishes with connecting the end users to system with the help
    of mobile or web-

    based applications through the Internet. The next level (cloud computing server)
    deals with the connection

    of web server and MQTT broker for directing the user requests and other components
    at the edge landscape

    or from the farms to the right cloud-based services like displaying the real time
    status of the farm for the

    users, triggering a new deployment of the updated ML model to the corresponding
    edge node. The third

    level (farming area) is directed toward the deployment of sensors and IoT devices
    (actuators) for commu-

    nicating with other components in the entire system.

    4 Deployment of soil moisture prediction hybrid algorithm

    The watering mechanism of the plant has diﬀerent approaches in the proposed model.
    Primarily, the system

    is trained with manual irrigations datasets during the process of learning with
    respect to suggestions

    deﬁned by agronomists. The model is trained to learn the needs of irrigation in
    the ﬁrst level of deployment

    in cloud without the inclusion of pre-processed data. After acquiring the required
    data and training, the

    proposed system is initiated to grasp the plant’s watering needs by undergoing
    plenty of manual irrigations.

    Thereafter, manual irrigation is not required and the system makes automated decisions
    in watering using

    the gathered data and the application of ML methods. The proposed model then decides
    the irrigation

    strategies automatically using ML methods without the need including collected
    datasets in the automatic

    irrigation process. The proposed model can be improved through the learning process
    when the number of

    precise irrigation inputs is provided to the model at each stage of training.

    The decision-making procedure is developed with two modules for irrigation strategies
    according to the

    soil moisture prediction for upcoming days. The ﬁrst module deals with training
    the model in cloud with

    manual irrigation datasets through steps such as data collection, data preprocessing,
    training, and model

    development. The system acquires values of air temperature (TH), soil temperature
    (SMT), soil moisture

    (SM), humidity (HU), and ultraviolet rays (UV) periodically from the physical
    environment in the data

    collection stage, which is essentially required for arriving at the watering decisions.
    Also, the time of

    performing the manual irrigation is recorded in the database. These data are timestamped
    and stored in

    as datasets to aid in making decisions for knowing the time of irrigation. In
    the next step of pre-processing,

    inconsistencies are eliminated and outliers caused by sensor errors are detected
    from the irrigation dataset,

    thereby helping in the removal of broken data. The training stage involves the
    application of supervised

    machine learning (ML) algorithms. Here the regression algorithms such as support
    vector regression (SVR),

    multiple linear regression (MLR), lasso regression (LR), decision tree regressor
    (DTR), random forest

    regressor (RF), and XG-boost regressor (XB) techniques are used for the deployment.
    The regression algo-

    rithms are trained using the collected datasets. Finally, through training, regression
    models are created,

    namely, SVR model, MLR model, LR model, DTR model, RF model, and XB model that
    are been combined

    with the second module for decision-making.

    The second module caters to the prediction of irrigation for upcoming days by
    infusing the weather data

    as an input to the regression trained models. The live datasets from the weather
    API for future prediction of

    640

    

    S. Premkumar and AN. Sigappi

    soil moisture variable are used. The dependent variables from weather forecast
    data like temperature (TH),

    humidity (HU), ultraviolet (UV), and precipitation (PC) are tested in the aforementioned
    model for soil

    moisture prediction. Then, the regression trained model is evaluated and deployed
    using the weather

    testing data for the prediction of soil moisture in accordance with the precipitation.
    After the prediction

    of data for the upcoming days, these developed regression models are combined
    with unsupervised ML

    algorithm named k-means clustering for estimating the changes incurred in soil
    moisture prediction due to

    the impact of weather conditions. Further, each regression models with k-means
    algorithm are evaluated

    for performances in terms of irrigation decision-making process as shown in Table
    1. The combined algo-

    rithms are estimated through MAPE, MSE, R2, execution speed, power consumption,
    and accuracy. The

    estimation and computation of these parameters are detailed by the authors in
    ref. [38].

    XGBoost + k-means (XB+k-means) approach provides more accuracy with less MSE comparatively
    and

    also the R2 with 98% in soil moisture prediction using combined approach is given
    in Table 1. It is evident

    that the proposed combination performs better when compared to other regression
    + k-means-based

    approaches. XB + k-means-based hybrid machine learning algorithm is applied in
    irrigation planning

    module on account of aforementioned performance metrices of ML. Although it performs
    moderately in

    terms of execution time and power usage, it is selected for the deployment in
    edge computing as it has

    better performed in terms of accuracy, R2, MSE, and MAPE metrices. It is observed
    that the prediction of soil

    moisture for the upcoming days from the proposed algorithm (XB+k-means) is nearer
    to the actual value as

    shown in Table 2, and hence, XB+k-means is selected for the implementation of
    SMPHA in edge-based

    irrigation scheduling.

    4.1 Hardware setup

    IoT system is crucial to handle, collect, and transfer the data to the computing
    nodes at the edge or in the

    cloud. These devices are connected to the edge nodes through wireless communication
    protocols like

    ZigBee. It is used in reducing the latency and loss of data. An Arduino micro-control
    unit controls the

    combined IoT sensors and actuators at the same part of a ﬁeld into a cluster,
    each connected to a Raspberry

    Pi that acts as an edge node in processing the gathered data and controlling the
    actuators. For example,

    Figure 2 shows an edge architecture with a Raspberry Pi connected to two components:
    Arduino Uno and

    Arduino Mega units via ZigBee connection. The ﬁrst Arduino Mega node is responsible
    for collecting data

    from sensors and the second one is for controlling the actuators in the ﬁeld.
    Depending on the sensor type

    with collecting Arduino unit, the sensors are connected via analog or digital
    PWM pins while controlling

    Arduino uno joins with actuators in the ﬁeld and controls (turn on/oﬀ) them in
    accordance with upper

    layers (from the edge web server). The trained (cloud) and deployed ML model in
    edge nodes provides the

    necessary instructions to the edge nodes.

    4.2 Web layer setup

    The deployment of web server assists the user in planning and managing the irrigation
    system. It visualizes

    the crucial information of factors like temperature of air and soil, UV, humidity,
    and soil moisture in live

    irrigation with real time updates in the form of various charts. In accordance
    with the selected ﬁeld, the web

    application redirects the user to the ﬁeld’s dashboard as shown in Figure 4. The
    dashboard consists of ﬁeld

    parameters as well as control signals for activating all the physical devices/actuators
    at the garden layer.

    These signals are denoted as switch buttons, and each switch controls (turn on/oﬀ)
    a particular kind of

    actuator (for instance, water pump to start and stop the irrigation). The user
    interface facilitates remote

    controlling of the ﬁeld by just clicking on the buttons as shown in Figure 4.

    4.3 Edge layer setup

    The edge node acts as a computing center where incoming data are analyzed and
    fed as the input vector to

    the ML model for processing and to return the control signals for activating or
    deactivating the actuators

    placed at the farm. Edge node processes the physical data (real time) at every
    end device such as the

    collected and processed data via the Raspberry Pi nodes presented in the proposed
    scheme. The prediction

    model is designed using TensorFlow API and trained, tested on Google Colab in
    this work. Amazon Web

    Service (AWS) oﬀers a library named Boto3 having many APIs to upload and download
    objects. After the

    development of model, it is transferred to Amazon S3, a service provided by AWS.
    The edge node utilizes the

    trained model from S3 for analyzing the sensed data acquired from garden’s sensors.
    The decision is

    delivered based on real time data analysis at the edge node and transmitted to
    Arduino nodes in the ﬁelds

    landscape immediately for controlling the actuators. In another ﬂow, the data
    collected from sensors are

    ﬁltered so as to keep only the modiﬁed data at the edge node before being sent
    back for mitigating the

    communication cost to the database in the cloud. These data are used in the updation
    of the ML model to

    enhance its eﬃciency.

    4.4 Analytics setup

    The main goal of this experiment lies in gathering the various physical parameters
    of a farming land via

    sensors and utilizing the fetched data along with weather forecast information
    for developing an algorithm

    using hybrid machine learning approach to infuse higher accuracy in predicting
    the soil moisture for the

    upcoming days. As discussed in Section 4, for the proper planning and provisioning
    of optimal irrigation,

    the algorithm provides a predictable estimate of soil moisture with the assistance
    of various statistical

    measures as shown in Table 1. The measures are adopted for estimating the appropriateness
    and error rate

    of the proposed algorithm. It is inferred from the experiment that, optimal irrigation
    is feasible using a good

    642

    

    S. Premkumar and AN. Sigappi

    estimation (close to the actual value) of the soil moisture (Table 2), with the
    support of ﬁeld data and

    forecast information, thereby utilizing the natural rain eﬃciently.

    The SMPHA ML model is interdependent on dynamic changes in weather environment
    where the

    models deployed on edge nodes need to change the controls accordingly after model
    gets trained con-

    tinuously. For the process of retraining, the trained model needs to be updated.
    The parameters such as TM,

    HU, ST, UV, SM about grown plants are logged for the training purpose, and these
    generated datasets are

    recorded from the already developed manual mode system [39]. The growth of the
    Indian Mundu Chilli [40]

    is taken for the observation from the ﬁrst stage to the last grown stage for 95
    days. While retraining the

    model, the training is carried in cloud without causing eﬀect to the functionalities
    at edge nodes. A signal is

    transferred to the corresponding edge server for triggering the task of updating
    the SMPHA model from the

    web server. At that time, the newly trained model is downloaded to replace the
    existing one at the con-

    sidering edge server. From then, the ML model at the edge server is called to
    be updated with the real-world

    knowledge and is ready for its garden controlling tasks (to apply in the next
    farming season).

    4.5 Work ﬂow

    The ﬂowchart in Figure 6 depicts the working of the proposed system based on the
    decision support system

    that is beneﬁcial for irrigation needed for the growth of vegetables. The chilli
    plant is grown in a growbag

    attached with sensors and Pi as shown in Figure 3 and monitored for 95 days of
    data collection. To bring out

    optimality in the irrigation system, features relating to climate, soil, crop,
    and ﬁeld infrastructure are to be

    considered. To provide several recommendations in the production of vegetables,
    decision support systems

    (DSSs) are designed, which process voluminous information [39]. This proposed
    work is the extension of

    soil moisture diﬀerences (SMD) model [41] developed for soil moisture prediction.
    The threshold values of

    soil moisture are used in the SMD model where the system schedules the irrigation
    date based on the

    predicted soil moisture and weather forecast (precipitation) information automatically
    using SVR+ k-means

    modeling. Therefore, in the extension of the aforementioned work, further more
    number of sensors are used

    to log soil moisture value, which is averaged in the proposed model. This model
    is developed in two

    divisions of ﬂowchart as shown in Figure 7, where both are interconnected. It
    is observed that the prediction

    of XB + k-mean approach provides better results as presented in Table 2.

    The ﬁrst phase of the ﬂowchart describes the hybrid algorithm for the soil moisture
    prediction (SMPHA)

    using the combination of XB + k-means algorithm. During the data collection step,
    the sensor data for the

    parameters, namely, TM, HU, ST, UV, and SM, are collected. During preprocessing,
    null values and outliers

    are removed and the preprocessed data are used to train the XG-Boost model. The
    developed model is then

    trained with variables of live weather features (TM, HU, UV, PC) obtained from
    Weather API for the

    prediction of SM data. These data are given as input to k-means clustering algorithm
    to predict the soil

    moisture, which is deﬁned as SMPHA value to be infused in the next phase of the
    ﬂowchart. The second

    phase of the ﬂowchart deﬁnes the automatic irrigation planning setup. The setup
    starts obtaining the soil

    moisture maximum (SMMax) and soil moisture minimum (SMMin) values in the dashboard
    for setting the

    maximum and minimum level of soil moisture. Then, the current soil moisture (CuSM)
    is sensed and

    compared against the threshold SMMin. If the resulting value is less than SMMin,
    the process proceeds

    with SMPHA. On the contrary, it stops the irrigation process by sending 0 to the
    relay. In SMPHA, the

    nearest precipitation date is selected and it is assigned to the predicted soil
    moisture (PSM). The SMMax is

    decided by ﬁnding the minimum of (PSM + SMMin, SMMax), and the predicted SMMax
    is further checked

    against CuSM with a condition if SMMax is greater the CuSM then it sends 1 to
    the relay as a signal to start

    irrigation. If the condition fails, then it sends 0 to stop irrigation. The process
    of automatic irrigation ends

    by forecasting the irrigation schedule in accordance with the live weather parameters.

    5 Experimental setup and evaluation

    The test bed is developed and deployed, and the data are collected for the analysis
    in irrigation manage-

    ment. Here, Heroku cloud platform is used to deploy the cloud web server. The
    same cloud is also installed

    at a local edge that is at two Raspberry Pi units equipped with Wi-Fi 802.11n
    connections to denote the edge

    nodes. JMeter application is used to get sequential accesses to the web page from
    various users for eval-

    uating the network parameters. The speciﬁcation of these servers is given in Tables
    3 and 4.

    We evaluated the performance of the proposed IoT-based smart farm on two diﬀerent
    platforms,

    namely, in the cloud and on the local computer to show the feasibility and the
    beneﬁt of the edge com-

    puting scheme. Further many parameters are considered for evaluation and discussed
    in the next section to

    show that edge deployment is better than cloud.

    5.1 Evaluation

    A hybrid machine learning methodology is used in evaluating the ﬁrst stage of
    the proposed model. The

    predicted value of the soil moisture is better in terms of their accuracy and
    error rate. From the comparison

    of the other ML algorithms as shown in Table 2, XB + k-means performs better and
    taken further to be

    deployed in edge and cloud to check its eﬃciency with each other. Therefore, for
    analyzing the eﬃciency of

    the edge server in accordance with the proposed hybrid algorithm SMPHA is evaluated
    in terms of the time

    taken to train the ML model in edge and cloud. In this experiment Raspberry Pi
    is used to train the SMPHA

    model with 196,400 rows, that is, input data sample size and takes around 1,710,000
    ms (approximately

    28.5 min). The same model when it is trained in Google Colab cloud environment,
    it takes 204,000 ms

    (approximately 3.4 min) as depicted in Table 5. The main purpose is to run the
    trained model on edge not to

    train the model at edge. So due to the lack of computing capability at the edge,
    it takes more time to train

    the model, but it can be ignored as it does not aﬀect the purpose of the proposed
    model. Here, edge is

    introduced to obtain the task of computing from the cloud (i.e., oﬄoading the
    task) by making the system

    more edge-oriented deployment. It can be accomplished rapidly as it requires only
    14 s to download a

    trained SMPHA model from the cloud to the edge node with a size of 3,101 kb as
    given in Table 5. The time to

    download varies according to the size of the trained model. So, from this process
    it can be inferred that

    downloading the trained model saves time when compared to training the model at
    the edge. Through this

    in real time, deployment of the trained SMPHA model in edge is better compared
    to deployment in cloud

    services. Furthermore, network parameters like latency, throughput, bandwidth,
    and response time are

    adopted to measure the performance improvements in edge computing.

    The performance metrices taken into account are latency, bandwidth, and response
    time [42]. The

    latency of an application is the product of two factors: computing latency and
    transmission latency. The

    time spent on data processing and transmission between end devices to cloud servers
    is termed as com-

    puting latency and transmission latency, respectively. The computational capacity
    of the system decides

    the computing latency as the network servers possess a considerable amount of
    capacity to make the data

    processing faster, whereas the sensors come with limited computing capacity. The
    latency in transmission

    is increased by the end devices and cloud servers. Bandwidth: As large number
    of sensors are deployed in

    IoT, data generated would be huge that consumes an intense range of bandwidth
    and leads to several

    problems such as delay in transmission and loss of packets. It becomes unacceptable
    for the data to be

    transferred directly to cloud servers without applying compression. Therefore,
    data preprocessing and

    aggregation are needed for IoT gateways before redirecting them to remote cloud
    servers. Then, the issue

    to be confronted is to control the traﬃc ﬂow by migrating data processing and
    aggregation tasks optimally

    to decrease the bandwidth needs of the end users while maintaining the data quality.
    Response time: The

    total response time is calculated by adding up transmission and processing time.
    The local deployment of

    the proposed model for controlling IoT-based irrigation are deployed on two modes:
    (i) Cloud mode: The

    developed SMPHA model is implemented in the cloud communicating with IoT sensors
    nodes directly to

    manage the irrigation process. The data are stored and processed at the cloud
    server itself where it uses

    Heroku platform. (ii) Edge mode – Raspberry Pi is deployed as an edge server that
    involves in processing of

    the SMPHA model controlling the IoT sensor nodes. Here, the data are stored and
    processed locally within

    the edge servers. This SMPHA model from both the edge and cloud does the job of
    controlling the actuators

    to initiate and quit the working of water ﬂow motors. Through this deployment
    in both the environments,

    performance of edge server and cloud server can be checked in terms of latency,
    throughput, bandwidth,

    and response time is shown in aforementioned graphs in Figures 6, 8, and 9. This
    performance metrices is

    not feasible to calculate while deploying in real time, so the aforementioned
    scenarios of two modes are

    virtually created by generating many request and response threads between the
    servers. This sampling,

    load test, and distributed testing are conducted through JMeter application [43]
    and also veriﬁed with

    Wireshark [44] in cloud servers. The test scenario is created here by data of
    sending and receiving sampling

    data between cloud to IoT sensors and between Edge to IoT sensors. The sampling
    data considered in this

    work refer to the approximate number of requests generated by Arduino to cloud
    and Arduino to Raspberry

    Pi that are calculated in real time. The test scenario is divided into 10 days
    of sampling data collected for

    each day. The evaluation results are depicted for latency and response times in
    10 days perspective. In

    latency parameter, edge service has decreased by an average of 77.85% time compared
    to the with cloud. In

    the same manner, the response time of edge service is also decreased by 74.09%
    time compared to cloud

    service. In throughput calculation, sampling data are calculated for an hourly
    basis for the 10 hours data in

    a day. From the hourly comparisons of throughput value, edge outperforms with
    67.17% high Mbps usage.

    Through this analysis as shown in Table 6, it is evident that the proposed edge
    computing methodology

    deployed in Raspberry Pi or in local computers outperforms the cloud-oriented
    approach.

    Finally, to illustrate the eﬃciency of resource management in edge computing,
    CPU and memory

    utilization are considered for the analysis as both factors rely on the service
    execution model and the

    computational needs of the services being ﬁred from oﬀ-loaders. Figure 10 depicts
    the utilization of CPU

    and RAM on the Raspberry Pi acting as an edge node in two cases: with and without
    the deployment of

    SMPHA model. However, the memory (RAM) utilization in both the cases (with and
    without deployment of

    an SMPHA model) is nearly the same which is around 31%. Comparatively RAM utilization
    does not have

    much diﬀerence in with and without SMPHA. It is worthwhile to note that, the CPU
    utilization is still much

    lower than the 50% of total CPU capacity in Raspberry Pi. Therefore, it becomes
    feasible for adopting edge

    server implementation in the proposed irrigation system.

    6 Conclusion

    This article proposed a novel approach to edge-based irrigation system to facilitate
    decision-making on

    watering the plants on scheduled time. The proposed approach applying IoT with
    an edge computing

    framework enables the farming system to adapt to the changes in environmental
    conditions automatically

    and eﬃciently. The process of automatic irrigation regulates irrigation according
    to the live weather para-

    meters for forecasting the irrigation process. Soil moisture prediction was performed
    using major regression

    algorithms that are again combined with k-means clustering for estimating the
    changes incurred in soil

    moisture prediction. These techniques were compared through metrics such as MAPE,
    MSE, speed, and

    power consumption from which XB + k-means was found to perform better. The XB
    + k-means algorithm

    was further used for the implementation of decision mechanism on the developed
    edge computing model.

    The proposed edge model saves the data communication cost and reduces the response
    time of IoT services.

    It can be deployed on existing devices on the network edges serving as edge nodes,
    thereby reducing the

    overall implementation cost of a large-scale IoT system. The edge-based approach
    was found to perform

    better than the cloud-based approach in terms of response time, latency, throughput,
    and bandwidth

    usage. Finally, the edge model was analyzed through CPU and memory usage while
    running with and

    without the algorithm. In both cases, the memory utilization is almost lower to
    total available resource of

    the edge device. From this, edge device can allocate its remaining resource for
    other computing services,

    which increases the eﬃciency of edge computing device. The number of end edge
    nodes can be increased

    according to the ﬁeld area and then to check the potency of the system.

    \ has provided sophisticated research and developments \nin the field of agriculture.\
    \ In agriculture field production, using environmental and deployment \nsensors\
    \ like DHT11, soil moisture, soil temperature, and so on, IoT has been utilised\
    \ to monitor \nfield conditions and automation in precision agriculture. The environmental\
    \ parameters, field \nevaluation, deployment parameters, and shortage of water\
    \ has become an unresolved task for \nagriculture monitoring. All of this leads\
    \ to insufficient production of the agricultural crop. To \neradicate the above-mentioned\
    \ problems, we proposed a system in the using an architectural \nmanner. This\
    \ system uses an NRF24L01 module with in-built power and low noise amplifiers\
    \ to \nenable a long-distance communication for transmission of the field information\
    \ about the current \ncrop situation to the farmers. This work is investigating\
    \ an appropriate, reasonable, and applied \nIoT technology for precision agriculture\
    \ by considering various applications of agriculture and \nexperiments. The proposed\

    1. Introduction \nIn recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor\
    \ Networks (WSN) have become \nincreasingly essential [1] in agriculture. IoT\
    \ is having abundant applications like agriculture, \nhealthcare, smart cities,\
    \ commerce, home automation, education, and the environment. These \napplications\
    \ [2] are developed by the IoT sensor cloud-enabled, edge computing, cloud \n\
    computing, and WSN.  \nAgriculture and soil monitoring is based on environment\
    \ and soil parameters. These have come \nfrom animal health, crop health, plant\
    \ health, soil health, soil ecosystem, climate balance, and \nhuman health. We\
    \ came to know about animal health by tracking movement. For proper \nirrigation,\
    \ there should be nutrients, fertilizers, and water requirements that lead to\
    \ better crop \nhealth, soil health, and plant [3] health. Weather assessment\
    \ comes under the climate balance and \nthe soil ecosystem is associated with\
    \ soil fertility and quality. Human health also plays a major \nrole in the agriculture\
    \ workplace as shown in Fig. 1.  \nA. Smart Agriculture Monitoring (SAM) \nIoT\
    \ can provide automation in agriculture monitoring systems with help of sensors,\
    \ actuators \nembedded hardware platforms, and cloud-enabled technologies like\
    \ big data and cloud \ncomputing. Generally, the IoT role in agriculture has been\
    \ transformed [4] to different domains \nsuch as water and soil management, crop\
    \ monitoring, etc. WSN also enables automation in the \nfield of agriculture with\
    \ energy harvested [5] nodes, hardware cost-effectiveness, and scalability. \n\
    \ \nFig. 1 Overview of the smart agriculture parameters \nB. Remote Monitoring\
    \ Systems using IoT \nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a promising approach for\
    \ remote monitoring and \ninterconnectivity of the proposed system in this scenario,\
    \ thanks to communication protocols, an \nopen-source cloud platform for experiment\
    \ results based on Application Programming Interface \n(API), visualization dashboards,\
    \ and [6] web development tools. \n2. Related Work \nEmerging technologies are\
    \ playing a crucial role in smart agricultural monitoring systems, \nprecision\
    \ agriculture, and smart irrigation with complete automation and design implementations\
    \ \nin the current scenario. Some of the existing works are discussed below. \
    \   \nNestor Michael Tiglao et al. [7] proposed an Agrinex system, which is used\
    \ for smart irrigation \nwith a low-cost design and has a mesh-based topology\
    \ framework. It consists of hardware like \nRF module (NRF24L01), sensors (Temperature\
    \ and Humidity, soil moisture), actuator (servo \nmotor), and embedded boards\
    \ (Arduino and raspberry pi). Sensor's data processed and \ntransmitted through\
    \ the ATMEGA328P microcontroller and then via a gateway (sink node) to \nthe server\
    \ or cloud with the help of internet connectivity. The user can able to access\
    \ the sensor \ndata from the cloud and also developed a web application for remote\
    \ accessing and visualizing \nthe sensor data in online mode. \nRaul Morais et\
    \ al. [8] explained the mySense concept which means that data handling of \nenvironment\
    \ for developing the agriculture practices. In this article, four-layered architecture\
    \ \nshows the systematic data collection towards the precision agriculture issues\
    \ is discussed. This \narchitecture is made of four important components such\
    \ as input components (sensors) and input \ncomponents (actuators), gateway (Arduino\
    \ Uno, Raspberry pi) and wireless sensor network, web \nand cloud services, and\
    \ applications of end-user. It enables the hardware platforms with cost-\neffective\
    \ design end products to monitor the agriculture applications. \nUélison Jean\
    \ L. dos Santos et al. [9] represented the agriculture prediction model which\
    \ gives \ninsight on anticipate problems and improves the production of crops.\
    \ This model has three major \ncomponents like LoRa module, the Time series model,\
    \ and ARIMA predictive model. With the \nhelp of this model, to eradicate the\
    \ crop defects and notifications are sent to the farmers \nregarding their filed\
    \ information. In this model, sensors data acquisition with time series to \n\
    provide accurate results in agriculture production to the farmers.    \nShadi\
    \ AlZu’bi et al. [10] proposed an internet of multimedia things in smart agriculture\
    \ \napplications. This article, mainly focussed on smart farming for the optimized\
    \ process of \nirrigation. Internet of multimedia things having three important\
    \ components like image \nprocessing, IoT sensors, and machine learning techniques,\
    \ these techniques are used in the \ndecision-making system for proposed irrigation.\
    \ In this project deep learning is also state of the \nart for achieving the optimal\
    \ decision-making smart irrigation system. \nKhalid Haseeb et al. [11] demonstrated\
    \ an IoT and WSN based energy efficient framework for \nsmart agriculture applications.\
    \ In this paper, IoT and WSN are used to perceive the crop \nconditions and precision\
    \ agriculture automation by using different IoT sensors and these IoT \nsensors\
    \ deployed in the field of agriculture. To improve crop yield production over\
    \ the smart \nfarming decision-making system and acquire sensor data about the\
    \ crops and plant. This \nproposed system concentrated on few important metrics\
    \ like communication range, SNR, system \nthroughput, power consumption, and packet\
    \ drop ratio.   \nSanjeevi et al. [12] focussed on smart farming and agriculture\
    \ monitoring using cloud \ncomputing, the Internet of Things, and wireless sensor\
    \ network. In this article, the proposed \nmethodology gives insight into network\
    \ efficiency, low latency, high SNR, MSE, and more \ncoverage area. Based on the\
    \ sensor data, the receiver module has performed the action regarding \nmotor\
    \ on/off operations for proper water usage to agriculture monitoring. Different\
    \ types of \nsensors and other components have been used in the hardware implementations\
    \ for the smart \nagriculture monitoring system. \nTable 1 shows the IoT and WSN\
    \ based smart agriculture monitoring systems with various \nwireless communication\
    \ technologies and different metrics considered. These systems ensure \ncost-effectiveness,\
    \ high flexibility, and fast deployment based on mesh topology configuration in\
    \ \nthe agriculture field. Most of the existing systems are used Wi-Fi and ZigBee\
    \ technologies for \ntransmitting the sensor data of the agriculture field to\
    \ the farmer.           \nTable 1 Shows the IoT and WSN based smart agriculture\

    \ technologies and Protocols \nIn this study, wireless communication technologies\
    \ and protocols are used for data transmission \nfor short and long-range distances.\
    \ IoT is having many wireless communication technologies as \nwell as protocols.\
    \ Apart from that some of them have been discussed for sending the data to a \n\
    cloud server. The wireless communication technologies like Wi-Fi, NRF24L01 are\
    \ used to \nnetwork connectivity to a range of about 100 m and 200m through a\
    \ router (wireless access \npoint) respectively, and as well as protocols like\
    \ MQTT, CoAP for providing the communication \nbetween the machine to machine\
    \ (M2M) and messages are sent to cloud.  \n3.4 NRF24L01 module \nNRF24L01 Module\
    \ consists of two libraries like RF24 and RF24Network for providing all \npackages\
    \ into the Arduino sketch. It acts as both transmitter and receiver to send the\
    \ data over \nthe network at a 200m distance. It has operated at 2.4GHz and the\
    \ data rate ranges from 250 \nKbps, 1-2 Mbps. The wireless transceiver NRF24L01\
    \ module is having an in-built Wi-Fi SoC \nantenna and a total of 8 input and\
    \ output pins. \n3.5 Field actuators \nIn the field of agriculture applications,\
    \ field actuators have been provided the controlling \nfunctions of devices. In\
    \ this scenario, filed actuators are like the Reay module, Motor module, \nand\
    \ LED indicator module. Based on sensor data, the action will be performed by\
    \ a particular \nactuator with an LED indicator. Field actuators are having few\
    \ important specifications \ndiscussed in table 4. \nTable 4 Shows the different\

    4. Proposed Architecture \nThe proposed architecture of a self-powered, real-time,\
    \ nrf24l01 IoT based-cloud enabled service \nfor smart agriculture decision-making\
    \ system consists of two sections such as Transmitter \nsection (Tx) and Receiver\
    \ section (Rx) as shown in below Fig. 4 and the wireless connection \nbetween\
    \ AWMU to WAMU as shown in below Fig. 5.  \nThe transmitter section (Tx) is responsible\
    \ for monitoring the agriculture field to get information \n(agriculture parameters)\
    \ from environmental sensors and deployment sensors (agriculture \nsensors). So\
    \ the physical layer comes into the picture and it senses all agriculture parameters\
    \ \nthrough sensors like temperature, humidity, moisture, and so on. It sends\
    \ the digital signal to \nanother above level. Data acquisition is a collection\
    \ of data from sensors deployed in the \nagriculture field. Once got completion\
    \ of the data collection process and will be processed the \ndata, the term is\
    \ called data processing which comes under hardware embedded platforms (IoT \n\
    gateway) along with wireless communication technologies for IoT, based on the\
    \ conceptual and \ncommunication layers. Through communication protocols like\
    \ MQTT and CoAP, only the \nmessages are transmitted from client to server based\
    \ on a set of rules for data in formats such as \nXML, JSON, CSV, and so forth.\
    \ These things have happened while the Internet is available at \nfarmers' place\
    \ and it comes under the Internet layer.    \nThe receiver section (Rx) is to\
    \ take care of the agriculture field information which is stored in the \ncloud\
    \ server repository (IoT-cloud) with the help of IoT security like API key (Application\
    \ \nProgramming Interface). So that data access from the cloud repository through\
    \ preconfigured \ndevices like mobile phones, laptops, and so forth. The accessing\
    \ layer is responsible for access \nthe data from the cloud through a farmer’s\
    \ mobile phone regarding agriculture data. The \napplication layer is built to\
    \ do completely automatic visualization through graphical \nrepresentation, monitoring\
    \ for real-time applications, and statistical analysis for data. IoT cloud \n\
    itself data storage and data analysis is done in it. By using some of the machine\
    \ learning \nalgorithms are used in IoT applications for data analysis. Finally,\
    \ IoT cloud platforms are \nproviding cloud services for data storage and analysis.\
    \ These cloud platforms are associated with \nthe architecture of IoT for providing\
    \ cloud services. \n \n \n \n \nFig. 4 Proposed architecture for the smart agriculture\
    \ decision-making system \n \n \nFig. 5 Wireless connection between AWMU to WAMU\
    \ architecture \n4.1 Agriculture Wireless Monitoring Unit (AWMU) \nAgriculture\
    \ Wireless Monitoring Unit (AWMU) is deployed in the field of agriculture. It\
    \ consists \nof environment sensors, agriculture sensors, hardware platform (Arduino),\
    \ energy harvesting \ncapability circuit for power supply, and wireless transmitter\
    \ module (NRF24L01). The sensors \nlike DHT11 (temperature and humidity sensor),\
    \ soil temperature, soil moisture sensors, and \nNRF24L01-Tx module are connected\
    \ to the microcontroller. The AWMU has transmitted the \ninformation to other\
    \ devices through wireless communication over a network with good internet \n\
    connectivity. In the agriculture field, each AWMU is communicated through Wi-Fi\
    \ connectivity. \nFinally, the filed information is sent through the IoT gateway\
    \ from AWMU to the receiver \nmodule.  \n4.2 Wireless Actuator Monitoring Unit\
    \ (WAMU) \nWireless Actuator Monitoring Unit (WAMU) is deployed in the field of\
    \ agriculture. It has 4 \nmodules such as 1. Relay module 2. Motor module 3. LED’s\
    \ indicator module 4. NRF24L01-Rx \nmodule and hardware platform (Arduino Uno),\
    \ energy harvesting capability circuit for power \nsupply. Based on sensor data,\
    \ which is coming from the AWMU then actuators are responded \naccordingly through\
    \ wireless communication over a network. Once it reaches the field \ninformation\
    \ to WAMU and it again sends to the server or cloud. In the agriculture field,\
    \ the \nWAMU is communicated through wireless communication connectivity to the\
    \ cloud. \n \n4.3 Field Estimation for Deployment Sensors  \nThe proposed system\
    \ consists of environment and deployment sensors that are employing in the \n\
    agriculture field and each sensor covers the different coverage area. To achieve\
    \ [30] the better \nconnectivity means more coverage area (above 1 acre) with\
    \ no data loss and long-range \ncommunication as shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7. And\
    \ also if the length (L) of the sub-field is low \nthen received sensor data is\
    \ more accurate, which means rises monitoring of agriculture field and \nreducing\
    \ the cost-effective of sensor deployment. So total agriculture field is dividing\
    \ into five \nsub-fields based on wireless connectivity of sensors in Eq. 1 and\
    \ each sub-field is having three \nAgriculture Wireless Monitoring Nodes (AWMN).\
    \ And also each AWMN contains 4 sensors \nthat are deployed in the agriculture\
    \ field. So that number of sensors selected in a particular \nagriculture sub-field\

    \ \nHeat Index (HI) is defined as the combination of air temperature (T) and air\
    \ humidity (H) values \nto regulate the equivalent temperature experienced by\
    \ plants or crops. In this process, the DHT11 \nsensor is connected to a microcontroller\
    \ (Arduino Uno) and it gives the sensors values like \ntemperature and humidity\
    \ (Environment parameters). Based on the sensor values, heat index \nmeasurement\
    \ [31] is calculated from Eq. 3 and it is used to good environmental conditions\

    \ \nIn this section, hardware implementation is discussed. The proposed system\
    \ consists of two parts \none is the transmitter part and the other one is the\
    \ receiver part. The transmitter and Receiver \ncircuits are connected wirelessly.\
    \ NRF24L01 module is used for wireless communication. The \nDHT11 sensor, soil\
    \ moisture sensor, soil temperature sensors, and NRF24L01 Transmitter \nmodule\
    \ are connected to the Arduino board at the Transmitter section. The receiver\
    \ circuit \nconsists of an NRF24L01 receiver module and a submersible pump (motor)\
    \ that is connected to \nArduino Uno. The soil moisture and soil temperature sensors\
    \ are deployed in the soil. The data \ncollected by this DHT11 sensor, soil moisture,\
    \ and soil temperature sensors are transmitted to the \nreceiver side circuit.\
    \ Some Threshold value is set at the receiver side microcontroller. If the \n\
    sensor received is below the threshold value then the motor will be in OFF condition\
    \ and if the \nreceived sensor is above the threshold value then the motor will\
    \ be turned ON and automatically \nirrigates the field. So, Depending on the data\
    \ received and threshold values, the submersible \npump (motor) will ON/OFF operations\

    \ consists of sixty four samples, which are sent as packets to the ThingSpeak\
    \ \ncloud platform. The data must be transmitted in 567.6 x10-6 seconds. So, for\
    \ the time being, the \nAWMU will be in a power-saving mode (idle). Because the\
    \ device operates on batteries, this will \nimprove power efficiency. Eq. 4, 5,\

    1. Introduction\nCitizenship education traditionally aimed to prepare young people\
    \ to take their place\nin adult society [1]. The values intended to be promoted\
    \ are those of democracy, with\na focus on human rights, a creative spirit, and\
    \ an eager critical sense, creating effective\nopportunities that involve young\
    \ citizens in solving their own problems. “Government of\nthe people, by the people,\
    \ for the people” remains the sovereign deﬁnition of democracy,\nas stated by\
    \ Winston Churchill’s speech to the House of Commons in 1947.\nThe Portuguese\
    \ Ministry of Education (ME) has recently published several docu-\nments regarding\
    \ citizenship education, more speciﬁcally, Portuguese Citizenship Education\n\
    Guidelines (PCEG) [2], National Education Strategy for Citizenship (NESC) [3],\
    \ and Sustain-\nability for Environmental Education Referential (SEER) [4]. PCEG\
    \ states, “The practice of\ncitizenship is a participatory process, both individual\
    \ and collective, that calls for reﬂection\nand action on the problems experienced\
    \ by each person and by society” [4] (p. 1), thus,\ndeﬁned to contribute towards\
    \ the development of a just and equal society. The NESC aims\nto contribute to\
    \ developing autonomous, responsible, and solidary citizens with others\nthey\
    \ interact with. It also seeks to lead young citizens to know and exercise their\
    \ rights\nand social duties, always respecting others. SEER, on the other hand,\
    \ kept in line with\ninternational policies to seriously address climate change,\
    \ such as the 1972 Stockholm\nConference; the 1975 Belgrade Conference; the 2000\
    \ United Nations (UN) Millennium\nDeclaration; the 2016 UN 17 Sustainable Development\
    \ Goals; The Paris Climate Conference\nSensors 2023, 23, 3070. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23063070\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2023, 23, 3070\n2 of 36\n(COP-21)\
    \ of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change; and recently, to reinforce\n\
    the 1972 principles, 2022 Stockholm +50 UN Conference. The SEER is a guiding document\n\
    for this theme implementation within the scope of Citizenship and Development\
    \ (CD)\nsubject that integrates the curriculum in the different cycles and levels\
    \ of education and\nteaching in Portugal. The main objective is to prepare young\
    \ students to exercise conscious\ncitizenship, be informed about current environmental\
    \ problems to effectively change atti-\ntudes and behaviors, and promote new environmental\
    \ values. This objective is aligned with\nStockholm + 50 Leadership Dialogue 1:\
    \ reﬂecting on the urgent need for actions to achieve a\nhealthy planet and prosperity\
    \ of all, which stresses the need for promoting environmentally\nconscious syllabi\
    \ and curricula [5]. Citizenship is the practice of someone playing an active\n\
    role in their own community. For example, volunteer work, garbage-cleaning campaigns,\n\
    local elderly care cooperatives, or involvement in decision-making about the municipal\n\
    budget. In the same line of thought, it is current practice for students to exercise\
    \ their right\nto choose where part of the school budget should be invested. Residents\
    \ should become\nmore involved in public life, so the role of government is to\
    \ consider community initiatives,\nso-called “government participation”. A new\
    \ way for citizens and government to work\ntogether is do-ocracy. Do-ocracy is\
    \ a kind of organizational structure where citizens choose\nwhich roles they will\
    \ play, as well as tasks, and carry them out; a do-it-yourself approach\nfosters\
    \ a sense of responsibility towards a common goal.\nCitizen Science (CS) is a\
    \ growing phenomenon that echoes citizens’ contribution to\ngenerating scientiﬁc\
    \ information, new knowledge, and understanding, a common name\nfor a wide range\
    \ of activities and practices that promote public awareness and involve-\nment\
    \ [6–8]. The design of CS activities in collaboration with citizens is a complimentary\n\
    science approach to traditional sensor-based collection. CS engages citizens in\
    \ data gather-\ning activities, community-based environmental monitoring, data\
    \ collection and interpre-\ntation, and providing answers to achieve full participation\
    \ in science and policymaking.\nCitizens work together in collective decision-making\
    \ to identify communal issues and ﬁnd\nparticipatory solutions, which enables\
    \ science to become more responsive to community\nneeds. Therefore, communities\
    \ can raise awareness and develop strategies and solutions to\nmitigate communal\
    \ issues based on the data gathered. Citizens assume different roles with\ndifferent\
    \ levels of engagement, from a simple contributory level, through collaborative,\n\
    or at a co-created level. In any of them, engagement can be top-down, led by the\
    \ project\nleaders, or bottom-up, guided by the participants themselves [9]. The\
    \ Internet of Things\nis a key enabler that provides a path to support data collection\
    \ activities in a real-world\nCS project in a Smart City approach, using low-cost\
    \ sensors for gathering and reporting\ndata and cloud storage for hosting and\
    \ storing data [10]. CS integration into school practice\ncan strengthen students’\
    \ science and environmental literacy and promote their citizenship\nidentity and\
    \ active participation competence. Overall, the study aims to explore the educa-\n\
    tional value of CS strategies developed within an educational scope and the potential\
    \ of\nthe Internet of Things to contribute towards participatory citizenship,\
    \ engaging citizens in\ncommunal issues, providing rich and detailed information,\
    \ and proposing and contributing\nto co-created solutions [11]. Retaining citizens\
    \ as volunteers is crucial to ensure their on-\ngoing long-term participation.\
    \ So, encouraging teachers to integrate CS into their teaching\npractice will\
    \ foster empirical evidence that citizen engagement can provide a local and\n\
    contextual dimension to communal issues, being able to educate and engage communities.\n\
    CS integration into school practice can strengthen students’ science and environmental\n\
    literacy and promote their citizenship identity and active participation competence.\n\
    While there is generally much to praise about the rise in acknowledging the need\n\
    for young citizens to exercise their rights and duties, the belief remains that\
    \ this is not\nyet entrenched in young citizens’ overall democratic involvement.\
    \ A lack of citizenship\nand engagement in community issues was revealed by a\
    \ recent study conducted by the\nauthors in a secondary school from the outskirts\
    \ of Aveiro, Portugal, during the 2019/2020\nschool year, regarding students’\
    \ participatory citizenship attitudes [12]. The exercise of\nSensors 2023, 23,\
    \ 3070\n3 of 36\nparticipatory citizenship should begin at an early age [13,14];\
    \ therefore, enhancing such an\nexercise in an educational context should be emphasized\
    \ and an object of study.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section\
    \ 2 presents an overview of\nthe related work. Section 3 describes the smart learning\
    \ environment and the technical\nset-ups of the proposed systems. Section 4 describes\
    \ the implementation of the designed\nsystems, data interpretation, and discussion\
    \ of evaluation results. Finally, Section 5 presents\nconclusions and future work\
    \ that needs to be addressed.\n2. Theoretical Framework\n2.1. Citizenship Education\n\
    Launched in September 2012, under the United Nations’ umbrella, the Global Educa-\n\
    tion First Initiative’s three main priorities are: (1) put every child in school;\
    \ (2) improve\nthe quality of learning; and (3) foster global citizenship. These\
    \ three pillars are the core\nof the 2015 United Nations advocated model, supported\
    \ by UNESCO, which are to be\nimplemented until the 2030–Education 2030 Agenda\
    \ and Framework [15]. The intercon-\nnected NESC and SEER are impacting the policy\
    \ visions and practices of ministries of\neducation around the world, which also\
    \ impacts how teachers work but requires measures\nto achieve a Global Citizenship\
    \ Education (GCE) [16]. According to UNESCO, GCE aims to\nenable students to assume\
    \ active roles, both in their local community and globally, which\nwill allow\
    \ the construction of more peaceful, tolerant, inclusive, and safe societies [17]\n\
    aligned with the objectives of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) and\
    \ the Sus-\ntainable Development Goals (SDG 4 on Education). UNESCO also points\
    \ to the sense\nof belonging to a larger community and common humanity as global\
    \ citizenship [18,19].\nThe World Conference on Education for All in Jomtien,\
    \ Thailand, on 5–9 March 1990, may\nbe considered the ﬁrst global education initiative\
    \ in the last decade of the 20th century.\nAbout 1500 delegates from 155 countries\
    \ and representatives of some 150 governmental,\nnon-governmental, and intergovernmental\
    \ organizations, including the United Nations\nEducational, Scientiﬁc and Cultural\
    \ Organization (UNESCO), United Nations Children’s\nFund (UNICEF), United Nations\
    \ Population Fund (UNFPA), United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP), and the\
    \ World Bank as key education stakeholders, attended the\nconference. Participants\
    \ in the conference adopted the World Declaration on Education for\nAll and a\
    \ Framework for Action to Meeting Basic Learning Needs, highlighting the need\
    \ to\ninvest in education aimed at universalizing primary education. This declaration\
    \ is in line\nwith Millennium Development Goals [20] (replaced by the SDGs in\
    \ 2015)—surely one of\nthe most important global development initiatives [21]—that\
    \ were to be achieved over the\nperiod 2000–2015.\nWestheimer and Kahne [22] call\
    \ attention to “participatory citizens” as those that\ntake in hand the concept\
    \ of the “good citizen”, and that can support democracy helpfully,\npinpointing\
    \ the need for educational programs to prepare students to engage in collective\n\
    efforts. Such a citizen “actively participates in the civic affairs and the social\
    \ life of the com-\nmunity at local, state and national level”, working together\
    \ for the common good, with a\nstrong collective faithfulness, to solve communal\
    \ issues [22] (p. 240). Amagir et al. provide\nevidence that “the development\
    \ of educational curricula that focus on the development\nof active citizenship”\
    \ [23] (p. 57) should be considered as early as possible. Citizenship\neducation\
    \ could be the right host as it seeks to engage students to be more active, informed,\n\

    \ IoT communication protocols.\nData gathered by sensors are sent to other IoT\
    \ devices or a gateway and analyzed lo-\ncally or sent to a cloud provider to\
    \ be further analyzed. In the end, as Hosseinzadeh et al. [29]\nrefer to, the\
    \ main objective of IoT is to “connect anything to any object, at any time, and\n\
    over any network/service”. Statista [30] forecasts an increase of three times\
    \ the number\nof connected IoT devices from 9.7 billion in 2020 to more than 29\
    \ billion in 2030. IoT is\nassumed by Nižeti´c et al. as “one of the key pillars\
    \ of the fourth industrial revolution” [31].\nOver the last few years, the IoT\
    \ has entered various sectors, so this network of sensors, actu-\nators, and smart\
    \ objects, whose purpose is to interconnect all things, has huge potential and\n\
    usefulness beneﬁts for the population [31]. IoT is used in many ﬁelds, such as\
    \ agriculture,\nsmart cities—including smart homes, smart grids, smart agriculture,\
    \ smart lighting systems,\nsmart transportation, smart healthcare, and augmented\
    \ reality (AR) [32–34], alongside\ntrafﬁc, healthcare, security, and retail. Still,\
    \ there are other ﬁelds, like education, where it is\nrelatively scarce [31].\
    \ For instance, in the agriculture ﬁled, IoT is often used in the process\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 3070\n5 of 36\nof crop nutrition monitoring, light, ph, temperature,\
    \ and humidity, using sensors that send\ndata from node to node to be processed\
    \ and to make decisions or can change other devices\nautomatically regarding system\
    \ decisions [25,31,35–37].\nThe “employment of IoT in education is still considered\
    \ at its early stages but is highly\nencouraged” [38]. As [39] state, the coming\
    \ years will have a huge increase of connected\ndevices, so this should be seen\
    \ as an opportunity for educational institutions to incorporate\nIoT in the school\
    \ environment [39–41], prepare students for the upcoming years’ challenges,\n\
    making learning relevant to students. IoT in education provides learning concepts,\
    \ such\nas e-learning, including media that transforms virtual classrooms into\
    \ signiﬁcantly more\nefﬁcient places [42]. Based on the already overloaded school\
    \ curricula, attention must\nbe paid to incorporating IoT skills to bestow a plethora\
    \ of skills and abilities to students.\nThe ideal would be to have stand-alone\
    \ courses to ensure enough time can be devoted\nto cover the various topics but\
    \ could also be offered in line with CD subject context in\na transdisciplinary\
    \ effort with Information Communication Technology (ICT) or even at\nschool projects/clubs.\n\
    High urbanization of cities and communities, alongside huge population increase,\n\
    presents societal challenges such as climate change. Technology can be a “game\
    \ change\nfactor” in sustainable development, as well as a facilitator of citizens’\
    \ resilience [43], pro-\nviding citizens with a sense of ownership of their surroundings\
    \ [44]. There is a need to\nchange, and the power “needs to be challenged” to\
    \ an “inclusive city” that is “governed\nby powerful place-based democratic institutions”\
    \ and create an equal society, instead of\nwhat is happening in an era of strong\
    \ globalization where “place-less leaders” are gaining\nground [45]. The aim is\
    \ to advocate the need for a look at the collective power exercised\nby the citizen,\
    \ an escape from the marketing approach, which treats people as consumers,\ntowards\
    \ a more democratic approach, which treats people as free and responsible citizens,\n\
    with the right to be heard, a citizen-oriented approach, as stated by Hambleton\
    \ [45].\nAs cities take advantage of emerging technologies, such as IoT, several\
    \ facets of day-\nto-day urban life are undergoing enormous transformations [46].\
    \ The capitalization of\ntechnologies by smart cities paves the way for citizens\
    \ to interact with cities’ physical infras-\ntructure, services, and many more\
    \ [40], transforming/fostering citizenship and enabling\ncitizens’ right to the\
    \ smart city. De Wall, Lange, and Bouw proposed The Hackable City re-\nsearch\
    \ project as innovators regarding the “hackable city”, which put forward collaborative\n\
    city-making approaches that empower stakeholders in an open and democratic community\n\
    and can be “hacked” or appropriated by their citizens towards a common public\
    \ good [44].\nHowever, who has the power and the means to name an issue and put\
    \ it on the\nagenda? Citizens may organize themselves in informal groups of neighborhood\
    \ residents\nrather than waiting for new solutions to come into view or with local\
    \ stakeholders around\nthe issues they deem urgent. Three distinct sets of smart\
    \ city visions were introduced by de\nWall and Dignum: the control room; the creative\
    \ city; and smart citizens—assuming that\ncitizens should be linked with new roles\
    \ and responsibilities, integrated into an ideological\nperspective that underlies\
    \ the notion of citizen-centered smart cities [43,47,48]. The notion\nof “smart\
    \ citizens” is opposed to the notion of the “control room” since it is not just\
    \ the\nperspective of a collection of infrastructures and services in a top-down\
    \ approach but\nrather a perspective of the community city, relying on citizens’\
    \ aspirations, problems, and\nskills, mobilizing themselves around common issues.\
    \ Arnstein [49] deﬁnes three levels\nof typology of participatory citizenship:\
    \ (1) citizen power; (2) tokenism; and (3) non-\nparticipation. Based on Arnstein’s\
    \ work, Cardullo and Kitchin [50] and Cowley et al. [51]\nhave explored different\
    \ roles of involvement of citizens in smart cities, but both indicate that\nmore\
    \ active roles for citizens are not necessarily a desired goal. Indeed, what roles\
    \ should\nbe assigned to citizens—students are the focus of this paper—based on\
    \ their individual\nchoices and meeting the common good? In this paper, collaboration\
    \ and co-creation in an\nopen and sharing process (bottom-up approach) are assumed\
    \ as the main role for students\nto assume, a citizen power form of participation\
    \ in partnership with teachers, parents, local\npower, and local stakeholders.\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 3070\n6 of 36\nAlmost all smart city infrastructures have sensors\
    \ built into their core. Being easy\nto handle, this wireless network of low-cost\
    \ and low power-consumption easy-to-use\nsensors covers a large area without any\
    \ large space requirements, based on its wireless\ncommunication capability. Low-cost\
    \ devices combined with advanced information systems\ncan reduce the cost of daily\
    \ life monitoring [52]. The enormous amount of data generated by\nthe countless\
    \ interconnected devices offer unique opportunities to solve urban challenges.\n\
    The use of these sensors, combined with applications for smartphones, is making\
    \ its path\nacross domains such as noise, air quality, or radiation monitoring\
    \ [53–55]. Air quality is a\nmajor concern in urbanized areas, so research on\
    \ air quality is huge [56–69]. The European\nUnion’s (EU) clean air policy is\
    \ based on three pillars: ambient air quality standards,\nreducing air pollution\
    \ emissions, and emissions standards for key sources of pollution.\nAccording\
    \ to the European Environment Agency (EEA), air pollution is Europe’s biggest\n\
    environmental health risk [70]. World Health Organization (WHO) [71] global air\
    \ quality\nguidelines regarding particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), ozone, nitrogen\
    \ dioxide, sulfur\ndioxide, and carbon monoxide states that millions of deaths\
    \ and the loss of healthy years\nof life reﬂect exposure to air pollution. The\
    \ report highlights that in 2020 in the EU, “96%\nof the urban population was\
    \ exposed to levels of ﬁne particulate matter above the health-\nbased guideline\
    \ level set by the WHO”. Setting pathways to cleaner air, water, and soil,\nthe\
    \ European Commission (EC) has placed air quality at the top of its priorities,\
    \ which is\nwhy it is committed to continuing to improve air quality in strict\
    \ alignment with EU air\nquality standards and WHO recommendations. Due to human\
    \ activities causing polluting\nemissions, Europe’s air quality has deteriorated\
    \ considerably. To ﬁght climate change,\nenvironmental pollution, biodiversity\
    \ loss, and unsustainable use of natural resources, the\nEC stated in 2021 the\
    \ zero-pollution vision for 2050 under the European Green Deal’s Zero\nPollution\
    \ Action Plan [72].\nThe second most damaging environmental threat to human health\
    \ in the modern\nday is noise pollution. WHO published noise guidelines to provide\
    \ recommendations\nfor protecting human health from exposure to environmental\
    \ noise [73]. According to\nthe report, in the EU, “at least 100 million people\
    \ are affected by road trafﬁc noise and in\nwestern Europe alone at least 1.6\
    \ million healthy years of life are lost as a result of road\ntrafﬁc noise”. Regarding\
    \ road trafﬁc noise, the WHO recommended reducing noise levels\nproduced by road\
    \ trafﬁc below 53 decibels (dB) and below 45 dB for night noise exposure.\nRecommendations\
    \ regarding railway, aircraft, wind turbine, and leisure noise are also\naddressed.\
    \ In a recent survey carried out by Ka´zmierczak et al. [74] in 2021 in Polish\
    \ cities\non 770 residents’ opinions on their perception of the city’s acoustic\
    \ environment, about\n85% of respondents stated that city sounds matter to them.\
    \ A Google form was sent out\nto a non-probability sample city resident via the\
    \ internet. The authors used an extensive\nsnowball sampling method to reach city\
    \ residents. Other studies have been conducted\naiming at smart cities’ noise-related\
    \ issues [75–81].\nThe increase in population in urban centers entails a huge\
    \ increase in waste production,\nwhich has certainly become a signiﬁcant challenge.\
    \ Urban waste and recycling management\ninclude, among other actions, maintaining\
    \ a healthy and clean city, production, transport,\ncollection, storage, sorting,\
    \ treatment, recovery, and disposal, so the collaboration of citizens\nis fundamental\
    \ [82–94]. The World Bank [82] predicted that by 2050 the annual solid waste\n\
    generation would reach around 3.40 billion tones. The report refers to the need\
    \ to make\ncitizens environmentally aware of reducing the amount of waste produced,\
    \ separating\nit, and placing it in appropriate containers. There is a close link\
    \ between the success of\nsustained solid waste management and public engagement.\
    \ Of the countries and cities\nstudied in Kaza et al. [82], several make waste\
    \ management information available to the\npublic. The most common types of available\
    \ information include collection schedules\nand waste drop-off locations, budgets\
    \ and fees, local statistics on waste generation and\ncomposition, and community\
    \ programs and recycling campaigns. Between Christmas and\nthe end of 2022, waste\
    \ collection in Portugal recorded high values, with residents of the\nLisbon Metropolitan\
    \ Area producing more than 21,000 tons and those in Porto exceeding\nSensors 2023,\
    \ 23, 3070\n7 of 36\n10,000 tons [95]. City councils deﬁne sweeping plans for\
    \ the city, with frequencies that vary\nin garbage collection and recycling according\
    \ to the characteristics of each zone and the\ntime of year. City councils are\
    \ often faced with unnecessary trips as some of the containers\nare empty or with\
    \ a load of less than 50%, thus being faced with an inefﬁcient process,\na great\
    \ environmental impact, and high costs for cities. There is a need for intelligent\n\
    technology to support the municipal solid waste management system.\nAli et al.\
    \ [85] identiﬁed solid waste management as critical in their study regarding\n\
    IoT systems smart waste bin monitoring for smart cities. Several comparison tables\
    \ are\nprovided regarding existing proposed systems in the market. From the analyzed\
    \ systems,\nfeatures such as cloud storage, real-time data, waste prediction,\
    \ GIS, and bin locations are\nprovided. Most systems are grounded at LoRa and\
    \ GPS/GSM communication, providing\nbin locations and allowing cloud storage.\
    \ All systems are Arduino-based microcontrollers\nand rely mostly on Java and\
    \ C++ software. Only one used the ThingSpeak platform and\nGoogle Map API. In\
    \ Mozambique, the MOPA (https://www.mopa.co.mz) (accessed on\n4 January 2023)\
    \ project engages citizens in waste management problems to report through\na digital\
    \ platform. Relaying these problems through an open-source map, the city council\n\
    will recruit micro-enterprises for waste collection. There are already alternatives\
    \ in the\nPortuguese market that make it possible to take advantage of the Internet\
    \ of Things and\nsensors to carry out integrated waste management (http://www.360waste.pt/indexpt)\n\
    (accessed on 4 January 2023). Garbage container real-time data is certainly an\
    \ added value\nfor the city and citizens, as one can take advantage of the information\
    \ gathered by sensors\nto determine which garbage container is full and cannot\
    \ be avoided.\nEven though some proposed system enables citizens to report collected\
    \ waste, there\nis a need to engage citizens from the early stage of the deﬁnition\
    \ of the system, i.e., in\na bottom-up approach [96]. Citizens are merely collecting\
    \ data (citizen-sense approach)\nbut not engaging from the early beginning regarding\
    \ issue deﬁnition, and in the last\nphase regarding analysis and strategies deﬁnition\
    \ to mitigate the issues, a citizen-science\napproach. Through citizens’ participatory\
    \ endeavors regarding waste and recycling, mu-\nnicipal management strategies\
    \ can be designed more effectively, so long-term outcomes of\nsuch strategies\
    \ would be achieved.\n2.3. Educational Project of the Target School\nAiming for\
    \ educational success and the formation of upstanding citizens with full\nrights\
    \ and duties, four major Areas of Intervention in the target school’s 2022–2025\
    \ Educa-\ntional Project (EP) [97] are selected. The EP is an instrument that\
    \ aims to bring together the\neducational community, focusing on improving students’\
    \ results, training for citizenship,\nand, lastly, the school’s self-evaluation\
    \ process. With a vision focused on the education\nof citizens of a world in fast\
    \ transformation, the EP aims to emphasize the work that\nhas been carried out\
    \ in the pursuit of equal opportunities, opening the doors to the local\ncommunity,\
    \ which allows the educational community to be involved in active participa-\n\
    tion, thus fostering a sense of belonging. In line with the NESC, the school highlights\
    \ the\nimportance of reinforcing the paradigm of partnerships with entities outside\
    \ the school, as\nwell as the articulation with local authorities and municipalities,\
    \ fostering the creation of\n(1) collaborative and networked practices and work\
    \ with an emphasis on sharing reference\npractices in Education for Citizenship;\
    \ (2) networking between schools; and (3) networking\nbetween schools and stakeholders.\
    \ To achieve such objectives, and for each main area,\ngeneral objectives and\
    \ the respective action strategies and measurement indicators were\ndeﬁned to\
    \ monitor and evaluate the results. Goal 2 of the “Assessment, Teaching and\n\
    Learning” intervention focuses on “Enhancing citizenship practices”. To achieve\
    \ this, seven\naction strategies and respective measurement indicators were deﬁned\
    \ (see Table 1).\nSensors 2023, 23, 3070\n8 of 36\nTable 1. Assessment, teaching,\

    \ in decision-making,\nspeciﬁcally in those that affect them. So, regarding Goal\
    \ 9, “Create opportunities for student\nparticipation in decisions about their\

    This section presents the research milestones and the description of the smart\
    \ learning\nenvironment as well as the design and implementation of CS strategies\
    \ at Smart School Lab.\n3.1. Research Milestones\nThe investigation began in the\
    \ 2018/2019 school year with the creation of the smart\neducational community.\
    \ The necessary steps for its creation were the following: (1) state-of-\nthe-art\
    \ literature review; (2) document analysis; (3) geomentors mobilization; (4) local\
    \ needs\nand contextual purposes regarding School and Municipality; (5) roles\
    \ and commitments.\nThe creation of the community started with the ﬁrst civic\
    \ co-creation workshop—“Smart\nSchools: civic co-creation of smart educational\
    \ communities”, where the project’s objectives\nwere discussed, and local issues\
    \ were raised. These questions formed the basis for the next\nphase of the project.\
    \ To participate in this workshop, 16 teachers from the target school of\nthe\
    \ study from different disciplinary areas signed up (see Figure 2).\nSensors 2023,\

    \ Education Action Plan (DEAP) 2021–2027 [101] designed\nto tackle emerging challenges\
    \ to delivering education. The two DEAP priority areas and\nactions are: (1) fostering\
    \ the development of a high-performing digital education ecosystem\nand (2) enhancing\
    \ digital skills and competencies for digital transformation. Each priority\n\
    area has developed a series of actions to achieve each goal. DEAP priority area\
    \ number\n1 has six series of actions, number 6 being “Implement Artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ and data usage\nin education and training”. Related to the use of extended reality\
    \ (XR) in education and\ntraining, this action focusses on developing a basic\
    \ knowledge of Artiﬁcial Intelligence to\nexploit its potential by citizens. Action\
    \ 10, on the DEAP priority area number 2, proposes a\n“Council recommendation\
    \ on improving the provision of digital skills in education and\ntraining”. The\
    \ major outputs will be: (1) improve the provision of digital skills in education\n\
    and training; (2) ensure that 65% of Europeans have at least basic digital skills\
    \ by 2025. To\nachieve “Digital Opportunity Traineeships”, action 12 ensures that\
    \ vocational education\nand training (VET) has “the opportunity to gain hands-on\
    \ professional experience in digital\nﬁelds demanded by the labour market”. In\
    \ Portugal, about 40% of learners in secondary\nSensors 2023, 23, 3070\n12 of\
    \ 36\neducation undertake a VET program, which leads to a double certiﬁcation\
    \ [102]. A great\nmajority of students who attended the SSL club come from VET.\

    \ on rethinking pedagogy, technology, and design in\nBrussels classrooms, supporting\
    \ the dissemination and expansion of innovative pedago-\ngies aided by Information\
    \ and Communication Technologies. These spaces privilege the\nstudent’s action,\
    \ which fosters motivation, creativity, and involvement in the individual\nand/or\
    \ collective construction of knowledge. SSL goals and strategies align with DEAP,\n\
    aiming to foster students’ and teachers’ digital skills and competencies regarding\
    \ digital\ntransformation, delivering 21st-century learning skills.\n3.3. Design\

    \ to intensively collect information on the toponyms of the streets,\nalleys,\
    \ gardens, and avenues of the municipality of the city under study. An active\
    \ learning\nenvironment was created under the theme of local toponymy to develop\
    \ students’ knowl-\nedge and collaborative abilities and to allow them to learn\
    \ in a dynamic and participatory\nway. Students who participated in data collection\
    \ with the Survey123 application designed\ngeoreferenced routes based on toponymy\
    \ (see Figure 8). The project constituted an excellent\nchallenge for knowledge\
    \ and dissemination of the land, a way of valuing the place where\none was born\

    \ mission is anchored in integral human development, as well as in\ndefense of\

    and emergency situations. This project aims at young people to be able to: (1)\
    \ analyze\nand critically question reality, evaluate, and select information,\
    \ formulate hypotheses, and\nmake informed decisions in their daily lives; (2)\
    \ be free, autonomous, responsible, and\naware of themselves and the world around\

    \ development and social intervention; (5) know and respect the fundamental\n\
    principles of a democratic society and the rights, guarantees, and freedoms on\
    \ which\nit is based; (6) value respect for human dignity, for the exercise of\
    \ full citizenship, for\nsolidarity with others, for cultural diversity; and (7)\
    \ reject all forms of discrimination and\nsocial exclusion. In a more simplistic\
    \ way, it is intended, then, that students: (1) aspire to\nachieve a job well\
    \ done, with rigor and overcoming challenges; (2) persevere in the face of\ndifﬁculties,\
    \ be aware of oneself and others; (3) have sensitivity; and (4) be sympathetic\

    \ the curriculum, an instrument that must\nconsider local realities. Management\
    \ must be coordinated between all those involved in the\neducational process,\
    \ in a close dialogue between teachers, students, families, and the local\ncommunity\
    \ focused on building knowledge that allows all students to achieve the skills\n\
    set out in the students’ proﬁles at the end of compulsory education [111]. The\
    \ Domains of\nCurricular Autonomy (DAC) thus constitute a curricular option for\
    \ interdisciplinary work\nand/or curricular articulation, whose planning should\
    \ preferably involve all disciplines,\nwhich will allow the mobilization of knowledge\
    \ from different disciplines/disciplinary\nareas. It is intended to develop interdisciplinary\
    \ and/or curricular articulation work that\nallows valuing the “transdisciplinarity\
    \ of learning, mobilizing different literacies ( . . . ),\npromoting scientiﬁc\
    \ knowledge, intellectual curiosity, critical and interventional spirit,\ncreativity\
    \ and collaborative work” [109].\nThe curricular integration of CS strategies\
    \ took place in two Design-Based Research\n(DBR) cycles. The ﬁrst moment was embodied\
    \ in the DAC moments, and the second cycle\nwas implemented in a Science, Technology,\
    \ Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM)\napproach, with the reﬁnement of\
    \ prior CS strategies designed, implemented, and analyzed\nin a co-creation process\

    \ The pre-\ntest students’ perceptions show a positive impact regarding their\

    \ and support a kennel\ngiving food”, and now they ﬁnd themselves “capable of\
    \ being more active in society”,\nso they should “exercise the right as a citizen\
    \ to help”. School remains the place where\nthey assume that they can have a voice.\
    \ Students also think that they should engage\nin troubleshooting community problems.\
    \ Nearly half of the students should help their\ncommunity solve local problems.\
    \ At a national level, only 40% feel the same way. Regarding\nthe involvement\
    \ in participatory citizenship activities during the 2020/2021 school year,\n\
    70% of the students have been involved in at least one activity. After implementing\n\
    the citizenship strategies, students are more aware of their civic duty and the\
    \ ability to\nbe interventionists in their community. The number of students that\
    \ were involved in\nparticipatory citizenship activities increased. The same happened\
    \ regarding helping with\nissues in several domains.\nRegarding the type of volunteer\
    \ involvement, CS could be classiﬁed as contributory,\ncollaborative, or co-created.\
    \ In contributory involvement, citizens merely contribute to data\ncollection\
    \ and eventually help analyze or disseminate the data. On the other hand, a col-\n\
    laborative approach will allow citizens to analyze samples and data and, sometimes,\
    \ even\nhelp design the study, interpret the gathered data, draw conclusions based\
    \ on the results\nand disseminate them. Finally, the co-creation approach allows\
    \ citizens to participate at\nall stages of the projects. They deﬁne the questions,\
    \ draw hypotheses, discuss the results,\nand answer questions. The EU-Citizen.Science\
    \ (https://eu-citizen.science/) (accessed on\n7 January 2023) is a European platform\
    \ for sharing CS projects. Many CS projects are\nregistered in Portuguese and\
    \ from other European countries, aiming to solve a local or\nnational problem.\
    \ The seven Portuguese projects are Explorator, GelAvista, Invasoras,\nCoAstro,\
    \ BioRegisto, MosquitoWeb, and GripeNet. They are all framed in the contributory\n\
    volunteer involvement ﬁeld. Regarding international projects, Crowd4SDG, Achieving\
    \ a\nnew European Energy Awareness (AURORA), Butterﬂy Migration, Hush City, or\
    \ Science in\nthe city, all, as with the Portuguese projects, citizens are merely\
    \ contributing to science. The\nCitiMeasure project (https://citimeasure.eu/)\
    \ (accessed on 7 January 2023) aims to raise\nawareness about citizens’ importance\
    \ in implementing citizen science initiatives in their\nlocal community. Focused\
    \ on a co-creation process, the project is grounded in three main\ninstruments:\
    \ comparability of air quality measurement initiatives, digital inclusion compe-\n\
    tencies, and citizen science initiatives’ inﬂuence on behavior and policy changes.\
    \ CitiAIR is\na tool provided by the project that brings together European projects\
    \ related to air quality.\nThe SmartAir (https://citimeasure.eu/initiatives/smartair/)\
    \ (accessed on 7 January 2023)\nproject is also referenced here with the main\
    \ missions of your measure/monitoring air qual-\nity, promoting smart/sustainable\
    \ mobility, and raising awareness/education on the issue of\nair quality. Certainly,\
    \ one of the main goals of the projects is to improve citizens’ quality of\nlife\
    \ and, eventually, to increase their scientiﬁc literacy. However, they do not\
    \ allow effective\ncitizen participation in local decision-making, just as not\
    \ being co-created by citizens; they\ndo not allow for an increase in the level\
    \ of citizens’ co-responsibility. By going through\nall the phases of the projects,\
    \ the students became more aware of communal problems\nas they gained a more comprehensive\
    \ knowledge of them. Not only did they recognize\nthe existence of the problems,\
    \ but they also discussed and found together with teachers\nand stakeholders the\
    \ best ways to mitigate them. Students also proceeded to analyze the\ncollected\
    \ data and disseminated the results among peers and even at the community level.\n\
    The construction of collaborative projects between the educational agents, starting\n\
    with the identiﬁcation of issues and the search for possible solutions, going\
    \ through the\nimplementation of the action plan, and ending with sharing the\
    \ results with the local\ncommunity, were catalyzers that fostered students’ participatory\
    \ citizenship. Indeed, CS\nstrategies aided by collective awareness platforms,\
    \ sensors, and micro-controllers, engaging\nlocal society in communal problems,\
    \ can contribute to a more effective dialogue between\nthe educational agents\
    \ and promote students’ participatory citizenship.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3070\n31\
    \ of 36\n4.3. Study Limitations\nThe data provided by the CO2 sensor outside the\
    \ school did not undergo signiﬁcant\nchanges in their readings, not meeting what\
    \ was expected to happen. The equipment\nwas eventually reconverted for internal\
    \ reading of the CO2 level inside the classrooms\nafter the breakout of the COVID-19\
    \ pandemic situation. Another limitation of the study\nis related to data communication\
    \ based on LoRa technology, which was not carried out\ndue to the inexistence\
    \ of LoRa Gateways in the target city of the study. Not being able to\ntake advantage\
    \ of LoRa long-distance communication, researchers opted for Wi-Fi and\nMQTT protocol\
    \ to upload data. Built on top of the TCP/IP, MQTT is a standard for IoT\ncommunications,\
    \ with low bandwidth consumption, efﬁcient distribution of information,\nand low\
    \ power consumption.\nIoT technologies have some seriously limited resources that\
    \ need to be addressed, such\nas energy, CPU power, and memory. The most challenging\
    \ one was energy consumption.\nData routing and transfer are of great importance;\
    \ in wireless communications, it consumes\nmore energy than processing. SmartGreen\
    \ and the SmartAir equipment have built-in\nrechargeable batteries that will be\
    \ recharged using a solar panel that should be installed\nlater this school year.\
    \ By default, the ESP32 module has built-in 4 MB ﬂash memory and\nmay also be\
    \ ordered with a custom ﬂash size of 8 or 16 MB. The data will be saved in the\n\
    ﬂash memory, even when the ESP32 resets or power is removed. Wi-Fi credentials\
    \ and\nvariables state, or any other type of data that needs to be saved permanently,\
    \ will be saved\nin the ﬂash memory. The ﬂash memory reading process is inﬁnite,\
    \ but the writing process\ncan only be done, in most devices, for about 100,000–1,000,000\
    \ operations.\n5. Conclusions\nThis study reports on CS strategies developed at\
    \ the curricular level, integrating com-\nmunal environmental issues in school\
    \ projects supported by the Internet of Things, aiming\nto foster students’ participatory\
    \ citizenship, promote the dialogue and communication\nbetween local actors, and\
    \ contribute to informing municipal education policies.\nStudents’ prior lack\
    \ of citizenship and engagement in community issues was addressed\nby new pedagogies\
    \ that contributed to developing autonomous, responsible, and solidary\ncitizens,\
    \ focusing on communal issues like climate change. Several documents recently\n\
    published by the Portuguese Ministry of Education reveal concerns about the lack\
    \ of\nwork done in the national public school about citizenship education. The\
    \ Portuguese\nCitizenship Education Guidelines, the National Education Strategy\
    \ for Citizenship, and\nthe Sustainability for Environmental Education Referential\
    \ are examples of this concern.\nMoreover, interdisciplinarity pedagogical practices\
    \ should include real-time data-gathered\nactivities with subsequent classroom\
    \ analysis and interpretation. The study’s ﬁndings\nsuggest that to build a bridge\
    \ for participatory citizenship, teachers should engage students\nin communal\
    \ environmental issues in a STEAM approach or under Domains of Curricular\nAutonomy\
    \ activities. CS strategies aided by collective awareness platforms, sensors,\
    \ and\nmicrocontrollers were catalyzers that fostered students’ participatory\
    \ citizenship. There\nwas a huge involvement of the parish council and municipality\
    \ in the training sessions and\nin the educational community awareness activities,\
    \ contributing to a greater articulation\nand concertation of agendas between\
    \ the school, municipality, and parish council. Several\nprojects were created\
    \ under the aegis of the Smart School Lab, which substantially improved\nthe quality\
    \ and sustainability of educational intervention projects.\nThe study was carried\
    \ out in a secondary school, so future work should target basic\neducation students\
    \ starting in the ﬁrst cycle of basic education. Regarding the IoT concept,\n\
    data privacy is always important, considering information published online [114].\
    \ Some\nsensitive data, such as the possibility of accessing the users’ location,\
    \ should be further\nstudied, including better data encryption. In addition to\
    \ the already mentioned issues,\nuninterrupted network connectivity, security-related\
    \ issues, and the physical safety of\nobjects are also a concern.\nSensors 2023,\

    20, 7163. Abstract Research has shown the multitude of applications that IoT,
    cloud computing and forecast technologies present in every sector. In agriculture,
    one application is the monitoring of factors that influence crop development to
    assist in making crop management decisions. Research on the application of such
    technologies in agriculture has been mainly conducted at small experimental sites
    or under controlled conditions. This research has provided relevant insights and
    guidelines for the use of different types of sensors, application of a multitude
    of algorithms to forecast relevant parameters as well as architectural approaches
    of IoT platforms. However, research on the implementation of IoT platforms at
    the commercial scale is needed to identify platform requirements to properly function
    under such conditions. This article evaluates an IoT platform (IRRISENS) based
    on fully replicable microservices used to sense soil, crop and atmosphere parameters,
    interact with third party cloud services, planning and scheduling irrigation as
    well as control of irrigation water control devices. The proposed IoT platform
    was evaluated during one growing season at four commercial scale farms on two
    different broadacre irrigated crops with very different water management requirements
    (rice and cotton). Five main requirements for IoT platforms to be used in agriculture
    at commercial scale were identified from implementing IRRISENS in rice and cotton
    production: scalability, flexibility, heterogeneity, robustness to failure and
    security. The platform addressed all these requirements. The results showed that
    the microservice approach followed in the platform is robust against both intermittent
    and critical failures in the field that could occur in any of the monitored sites.
    Further, processing or storage overload caused for any reason at one farm did
    not affect the performance of the platform regarding the other monitored farms.
    This paper also discusses how the microservice approach can address the data heterogeneity
    issue when crops with different management requirements are monitored. Since there
    are no shared microservices among farms, the IoT platform proposed here also provides
    data isolation maintaining data confidentiality for each user, which is relevant
    in a commercial farm scenario. Keywords IoT platform; microservice; smart agriculture;

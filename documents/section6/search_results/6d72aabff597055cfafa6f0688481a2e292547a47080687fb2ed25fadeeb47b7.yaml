    The concept of IoT caught attention in 1999, by means of Auto-ID center at MIT
    and its relevant market investigation publications. Basically, IoT is an integration
    of multiple devices which communicate, sense and interact with their internal
    and external states through the embedded technology that IoT contain [1]. IoT
    has become the megatrend for next generation technologies which can impact the
    whole business spectrum with extended benefits which are advanced connectivity
    of end devices, system and services. IoT offers appropriate solutions for multiple
    applications such as smart health care, smart cities, security, retail, traffic
    congestion industrial control and agriculture [3]. A significant amount of work
    has been done regarding IoT technology in agricultural area to develop smart farming
    solutions [4]. IoT has brought a great revolution in agriculture environment by
    examining multiple complications and challenges in farming [5]. Now a days, with
    the advancement of technology it has been expected that by using IoT agriculturalists
    and technologists are finding out the solution of those problems which farmer
    are facing such as shortages of water, cost management and productivity issues
    [6], [7]. State-of-the-art IoT technologies have detected all these issues and
    provide solutions to increase productivity while lowering the cost. Efforts made
    on wireless sensors networks enable us to collect data from sensing devices and
    send it to the main servers [8]. Data collected through sensors gives information
    about different environmental condition to monitor the whole system properly.
    Monitoring the environmental conditions or crop productivity is not only the factor
    for the evaluation of crop but there are many other factors which effect the crops’
    productivity, e.g. field management, soil and crop monitoring, movement of an
    unwanted object, attacks of wild animals, and thefts etc. [9], [10]. Moreover,
    IoT provides a well-organized scheduling of restricted resources which makes sure
    that the best use of IoT enhances the productivity. Figure 1 shows a schematic
    diagram showing the agricultural trends which provide easy and cost effective
    interactions through a secure and unblemished connectivity across individual Greenhouse,
    Livestock, Farmer, and Field monitoring. Whereby, the IoT agricultural networks
    using the wireless devices enable real time crop and animal monitoring. The figure
    shows that two sensor kits (Libelium Smart Agriculture Xtreme IoT Vertical Kit
    and Crop/Plant Monitoring Sensor Kit) have been implemented which monitor the
    soil moisture, leaf wetness, temperature, humidity, productivity, and air flow.
    While, MooMonitor sensor monitors the animal health, fertility, feeding, ruminating
    and resting. The agricultural servers, gateways, and agriculture database play
    an important role to store agriculture records and provide on demand agricultural
    services to authorized users. FIGURE 1. Agricultural trends. Show All As a whole,
    in agriculture field there are multiple applications, protocols and prototypes.
    IoT agriculture research trends include network platform, network architecture,
    applications, security, and challenges among others [28]–[30]. Moreover, in many
    countries and organizations over globe different IoT policies and guidelines have
    been implemented in agriculture field. However in IoT agricultural environment
    a reasonable amount of work has been done and there is a need of thorough study
    on IoT in agriculture context to understand the current research status. To transform
    agriculture technologies via IoT innovation this paper analyzes various issues
    and trends in IoT smart farming. In this research as a contribution following
    IoT agricultural techniques have been added from literature: Present major components
    of IoT based smart farming along with relevant technologies in Section II. Section
    III presents a rigorous discussion on network architecture of IoT that involves
    network architecture and layers, network topologies used; and devices and protocols
    used in agriculture IoT. Different application domains and relevant smart phone
    and sensor based applications have been discussed in Section IV. The security
    and privacy issues in IoT based agriculture have been discussed in Section V.
    The industrial trends have been discussed in Section VI that provides the details
    related to top technology industries investing in this area. The IoT agricultural
    policies made by different countries for the standardization of IoT based agriculture
    have been discussed in Section VII. This section also presents few success stories
    in this area. Lastly, the open issues and challenges to improve IoT based agricultural
    technologies from many aspects have been presented in Section VIII. SECTION II.
    Major Components and Relevant Technologies for IoT Based Smart Farming A. Major
    Components of IoT Based Smart Farming IoT based smart farming consist of four
    major components as shown in Figure 2. FIGURE 2. Major components of IoT based
    smart farming. Show All These four major components are physical structure, data
    acquisition, data processing, and data analytics. The physical structure is the
    most important factor for precision agriculture to avoid any unwanted happening.
    Whole system is designed in such a way which controls the sensors, actuators,
    and devices. A sensor performs multiple tasks like soil sensing, temperature sensing,
    weather sensing, light sensing, and moisture sensing. Similarly devices perform
    many control functions like, node discovery, device identification and naming
    services etc. All these functions are performed by any device or sensor which
    is controlled through a microcontroller. This controlling operation is performed
    by any remote device or a computer which is connected through the Internet. Data
    Acquisition is further divided into two sub components namely: IoT data acquisition
    and standard data acquisition. Whereby, the IoT data acquisition component consists
    of seven protocols that are Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Websocket,
    Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Node, Constrained Application Protocol
    (CoAP), Data Distribution Service (DDS), and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
    Depending on the requirements and condition more protocols can be used for the
    implementation of smart farming. Whereas, in the standard data acquisition ZigBee,
    WIFI, Long Range Wide Area Network (LoraWan), SigFox and ISOBUS protocols have
    been used. Data processing consists of multiple features that are image or video
    processing, data loading, decision support system, and data mining as shown in
    Figure 2. According to the system requirements any feature may be added that may
    work in parallel to provide other services. Data analytics consists of two main
    features that are monitoring and controlling. Monitoring involves three main application
    in smart agriculture that are Live Stock Monitoring, Field Monitoring, and Green
    house Monitoring. IoT enables farmers to monitor livestock via multiple sensors
    which are used to monitor different animal’s diseases like temperature, heart
    rate, and digestion etc [11]. Whereas field monitoring applications intend to
    report different conditions of field like soil richness, temperature, humidity,
    gas, pressure (air pressure and water pressure), and crop disease monitoring [12],
    [13]. A smart greenhouse design eliminates the manual intervention and measures
    different climate parameters by intelligent IoT devices and sensors according
    to plants requirements [14]–[16]. B. Iotagricultural Relevant Technologies A Large
    number of technologies are being used in IoT agricultural solutions due to which
    it is hard to make an explicit of all those due to which our discussion focused
    on several core technologies which have played a vital role to modernize the IoT
    agricultural services. 1) Cloud and Edge Computing Collaboration of IoT and cloud
    computing in agriculture provides pervasive access to shared resources. To meet
    various agricultural needs upon request over network and execute operations cloud
    computing plays vital role [17]. Cloud based software architecture has been proposed
    which process and retrieve information and agricultural tasks in a more accurate
    way [18], [19]. In the field of IoT edge computing is considered as a solution
    to facilitate data processing at the source of data generation which are sensors,
    actuators and many other embedded devices. Edge computing or fog computing are
    measured as the backbone of cloud computing. This technology is deployed according
    to the features and requirements of smart farming [20]. 2) Big Data Analytics
    and Machine Learning Big data consist of a large amount of essential which are
    generated by agricultural sensors. Big data analysis provides different and efficient
    crop monitoring methods at different stages [21]. A good systematic review on
    big data analysis in agriculture has been presented [22]. Neural networks are
    very famous because they provide optimal solutions at a very high speed. Intrusion
    detection has been realized by using advance principles and technology of neural
    network. On the other hand most important feature of neural network is that they
    provide detection module and data training [23]. By using deep neural networks
    an IoT based hydroponic system has been developed [24]. 3) Communication Networks
    and Protocols IoT agricultural network consist of different kinds of long ranges
    and short ranges networks for communications. Several IoT networks technologies
    help to design a crop or field monitoring sensors and devices [25]. Communication
    protocols are the backbone of IoT agricultural network system and applications
    [26]. They are used to exchange all agricultural data or information over the
    network. 4) Robotics Multiple Agribots have been developed for the purpose of
    smart farming which are minimizing the amount of farmers by increasing the speed
    of work through advance techniques. Agribots performs elementary functions like
    weeding, spraying and sowing etc. All these robots are controlled by using IoT
    to increase the crop productivity and efficient resource utilization. A multi
    sensor robotics approach has been proposed for characterization and ground mapping
    [27]. SECTION III. IoT Agricultural Networks IoT agricultural network or IoT network
    for agriculture is one of the vital elements of IoT in agriculture. It helps to
    monitor agriculture data and facilitate the transmission and reception of agriculture
    data. As shown in Figure 3, the framework consists of IoT agricultural network
    architecture, IoT agricultural network platform and IoT agricultural network topologies
    and protocols. FIGURE 3. IoT agricultural network. Show All A. IoT Agricultural
    Neworkt Architecture The IoT agricultural network is the main factor of IoT in
    agriculture field [31]. IoT Agricultural network architecture suggests an outline
    for the specification of an IoT agricultural network physical elements as well
    as their working principles, and techniques. Most of the IoT applications usually
    follow the four layer architecture (Network Layer, Application layer, Physical
    and Mac Layer and Transport Layer) due to the popularity and interoperability
    of IP as suggested by Naik [32]. After reviewing these four layers protocol we
    have also survey two more approaches that are IPv6 and 6LoWPAN as shown in Figure
    4. This layer is the final level of abstraction which allows the development of
    multiple user applications. At this layer deployed communication protocols monitor
    different agricultural parameters such as weather information, soil moisture values,
    irrigation monitoring etc. FIGURE 4. Layer structure of the 6LoWPAN. Show All
    1) Application Layer Due to the energy constraints and stringent computation involved
    by the IoT devices there are many lightweight protocols on application layer such
    as CoAP, MQTT, AMQP, and HTTP. These protocols can be increased or decreased according
    to the system requirement. CoAP protocol runs on UDP and works on the principle
    of request or response architecture [33]. AMQP protocol runs over the TCP protocol
    by following publish/subscribe architecture asynchronously and use TSL/SSL for
    security assurance. MQTT is a bandwidth-efficient protocol which uses little battery
    power and designed for receiving and transmitting sensor information [34]. HTTP
    is a well known web messaging protocol which based on the request/response architecture
    [35]. Runs over TCP and does not define any QoS, uses TSL/SSL for security purpose.
    2) Transport Layer This layer is also called host to host transport layer, and
    is directly transferred from IP to IoT domain. The main task of network layer
    is to collect and encapsulate the agricultural information which is obtained through
    sensor layer. There are two protocols that are transmission control protocol (TCP)
    and user datagram protocol (UDP). TCP is a connection oriented protocol which
    ensures the reliability of delivered data. TCP data transmission speed is low
    as compare to UDP. UDP is a connection less protocol which does not ensure reliability
    of data. Its data transmission speed is high as compared to TCP. Both of these
    protocols are used in different applications because their choices depend upon
    the requirements of application. 3) Network Layer This layer is an indispensable
    technology for precision farming and responsible to transmit agricultural information
    at application layer. IP is the major choice with the existing two versions that
    are IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 came into existence due to increasing the large number
    of addressable devices. Whereas, invention of IPv6 was expected which gradually
    establish on all networking devices. Routing protocol for Low Power and Lossy
    Networks (RPL) is considered as the main protocol while applying routing on 6LoWPAN
    [36]. RPL consist of distance vector routing protocol which uses Destination Oriented
    Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAG) to specify routes. To support different flows
    of traffic RPL modify itself according to network speed and acknowledge routing
    metrics such as status of the battery used in device, link quality, and higher
    computational cost exchange. 4) Adaptation Layer Adaptation Layer (AL) aim is
    to ensure the interoperability, and implement fragmentation, compression and reassembly
    mechanism. Although AL attained many advances but still there is a complexity
    for IPv6 supporting because its direct use on IoT devices is not considered reasonable.
    Usually clashes were seen with constraints which are associated with IoT devices.
    That’s why, 6LoWPAN made a big effort in order to decrease the limitations of
    IPv6 and make it suitable for IoT devices. Sensors and devices use IPv6 and 6LoWPAN
    to transmit data over IEEE 802.15.4 protocol in IoT agricultural network. 5) Physical
    and Mac Layers This is the bottom most layer in agriculture network archichture
    which is responsible to sense and actuate different agricultural parametrs. Within
    physical and MAC layer IEEE 802.15.4 is one of the most popular standard which
    was designed for low cost, low consumption and low complexity [37]. This standard
    was adopted by many protocols like Wireless HART, ZigBee and ISA100. IEEE802.15.4
    mainly operates in ISM band of 2.4 GHz. Furthermore, it also operate 915 MHz (in
    United Nations of American) 868 MHz (in European countries) and supports up to
    250 kbps data rates. However literature shows some significant limitation of later
    approaches, which are regarding to mobility and network formation [38]. EPC-Global
    (designed for RFID technologies) [39] and Z-wave (particularly designed for domotics)
    [40] have also been used as alternative of IEEE 802.15.4 to exchange information
    directly from internt protocol (IP). B. IoT Agricultural Network Platform IoT
    agricultural network platform refers to both the big data analytics model and
    cloud model. 1) Big Data Analytics Big data analysis applied to find out the required
    and meaningful information from the large amount of data from different data formates.
    The crop disease control and crop growth models build on the basis of farm data.
    Big data analysis also provides decision support services to farmers for crop
    productivity and optimal cost analysis. Figure 5 shows IoT agricultural network
    platform based on big data analytics. The proposed network platform consists of
    six components namely: i) Farmer/User experience, ii) Big Data analysis, iii)
    Sensing and monitoring, iv) Storage services, v) Communication protocols, and
    vi) Physical implementations. This platform provides access to the IoT backbone,
    and helps collecting information about soil fertility, weather conditioning, moisturization,
    and online crop monitoring etc. FIGURE 5. IoT agricultural network platform based
    on big data analysis. Show All a: Farmer Experience Farmer experience layer is
    designed to help the farmers to monitor crop productivity in multiple ways such
    as, for effective growth of crops farmers are awared by identifying the appropriateness
    of fertile selection. Climate conditions, crops growth conditions, soil quality,
    or cattle health monitoring helps the farmers to track the state of their business
    and mitigate the lower production risks. b: Predictive Analysis This analysis
    makes the whole environment smarter by the combination of smart farming market
    intelligence and IoT technology. The major task of predictive analysis is to analyze,
    explore and process the agricultural information for digital awareness. Predictive
    analysis is made to check the probabilistic chance of crop productivity up to
    the next season. Here different detecting devices are applied to check the, Crop
    disease, weather conditions, and estimate the profit/loss on the basis of crop
    productivity. Predictive analysis facilitates the farm to understand the optimal
    time for planting & harvesting and various farm management techniques. c: Multicultural
    Analysis Elaborates the multiple forms of agriculture. In this analysis big data
    analysis minimize the risk of crop destruction according to scientific ways. To
    enhance the growth rate of water featured Botanic Aquaculture layer is equipped
    with big data. Other multicultural techniques like Citriculture, Horticulture
    and Floriculture avail direct benefits when enabled with big data analysis. It
    is helpful for decision making related to crop or plants seasonal growth, and
    pest control. Vermiculture is used for the cultivation of earthworms. Arboriculture
    is basically used for the cultivation of woody plants. Olericulture is an application
    which is used for the prediction and measure the growth rate of different vegetables.
    d: Sensing and Monitoring Sensing and monitoring analysis is made by applying
    different sensing and monitoring devices. Sensors sense data and store the crop
    disease information. Data which is processed through multiple resources is automatically
    achieved by sensing layer. Ststistical analysis has been made on data received
    from sensors in order to actuate the disease. Farmers obtain necessary information
    such as ph value, temperature, soil moisture and humidity through web and message
    service. Real time image and video monitoring on data helps the farmer to gat
    timely and accurate information. e: Communication Protocols Communication protocols
    collect and encapsulate agricultural data. To process and transmit data by using
    these protocols have been considered as the nerve center of IoT in agriculture.
    These protocols consist of internet related technologies like WIFI, LoraWan and
    Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technologies. ZigBee is considered as the
    main enabler for communication over long distances when third party service providers
    such as Long-Term Evolution (LTE), CDMA or Global System for Mobile (GSM) are
    not available. f: Storage Services Farmers’ store crop related information to
    make better analysis in future and use stored information in multiple seasons
    for more productivity. g: Physical Implementations Multiple sensors, different
    types of actuators and microcontrollers are implemented physically to monitore
    different agricultural applications. Many other network equipments also implemented
    at physical layer like switches, routers and gateways are included. At this layer
    whole environmental conditions are sensed and then actuate according to a predefined
    instructions. Microcontroller plays the supervisor role and performs networking
    related operations and some other functionality which are done by sensors and
    actuators. An IoT based functional frame work is shown in figure 6. The functional
    framework shows that how agriculturists and farmers can access multiple databases
    with the assistance of support layer from application layer. Business layer contains
    all necessary operation which are important for any IoT farm. Data acquisition
    layer provides connection with session layer through IoT protocols like MQTT,
    AMQP and COAP etc. FIGURE 6. Functional framework for an agricultural information
    service model. Show All 2) Cloud Infrastructure Cloud provides a large amount
    of storage through large virtualized servers which are connected together to perform
    necessary action. A cloud based IoT design has been presented in [41] for precision
    farming. In which IoT techniques are applied to analyze and manage data from farms
    through sensors and devices to generate information for decision making. Design
    recommendations for IoT agricultural network on the basis of Cloud is shown in
    Figure 7. FIGURE 7. IoT agricultural network platform based on cloud. Show All
    Platform has been proposed on the basis of four layers which are Cloud Storage,
    Gateway, Fog Computing and hardware modules. Cloud storage layer centerlized the
    all agricultural related data such as weather related, soil, fertilization, crop
    and agricultural marketing in the cloud and provides on demand resources through
    networked infrastructure. Analyics resources and web services are also installed
    on cloud or internet which are accessible by cloud services. Most of the devices
    or sensors are not designed in such a way which can connect with internet for
    the purpose of data sharing. To resolve this data sharing problem local gateways
    are designed which act as bridge between all hardware devices and sensors for
    connectivity, security and controllability. Implementation of gateway in greenhouse
    or field improves the ability of automation and control the real time greenhouse
    monitoring system. Hardware modules and cloud services are distributed whereas
    resources are integrated through fog computing. Fog computing reduces the computational
    load of cloud and ensures the real time processing. Basic purpose of fog computing
    in this proposed network platform is to leverage the on demand scalability of
    cloud computing resources by taking the advantage of both cloud and edge computing.
    In hardware modules multiple actuators, sensors, microcontrollers and central
    processing unit have been implemented to monitor and sense various agricultural
    variables. Hardware modules are distributed in global or local networks and used
    to create services or processes. For the implementation of smart farming fast
    response time and capability to exchange information is necessary. Both of these
    requirements (fast response time and capability to exchange information) are fulfilled
    by two protocols that are Representational State Transfer (REST) and Message Queuing
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT). Instead of using big data center distributed system
    is more effective for smart farming because it breaks up large computation into
    easy and smaller tasks like: Crop, Temperature, nutrients, energy, climate, moisture
    of soil etc. C. IoT Agricultural Network Topology and Protocols IoT agricultural
    network topology shows the arrangement of multiple elements of an IoT Agricultural
    network and represents an ideal scenario for smart farming. Figure 8 described
    how heterogeneous computing grid collects necessary sensor data by using multiple
    sensing devices such as moisture sensor, humidity sensor, temperature sensor,
    gas sensor, ph sensor, ultra violet sensor etc and forms an IoT agricultural network
    topology. FIGURE 8. Conceptual illustration of IoT-based ubiquitous agricultural
    solutions. Show All This ubiquitous Agricultural solution transforms the storage
    capacity of multiple electronic devices like Smartphone, Laptops, and agricultural
    terminals into hybrid computing grids. Figure 9 visualize a scenario in which
    multiple crop parameters are monitored by implementing agricultural devices and
    sensors in all over the field. FIGURE 9. Farm remote monitoring in agriculture.
    Show All Sensed data is then analyzed and stored, and stored data from multiple
    sensors and devices becomes useful for aggregation. On the basis of aggregation
    and analysis agriculturists/farmer can monitor the different crop variables in
    all over the field from anywhere. Moreover, topology consists of a proper network
    configuration for the streaming of agricultural videos. For example figure 9 support
    the streaming of pests via an interconnected network with an internet protocol
    (IP), GSM, WiMAX and access service network gateway. 1) Low Power WSN Topology
    Figure 10 shows a topology in which low power wireless sensor network has been
    designed to monitor and control the various farming factors. In this topology
    ZigBee is being used for data transmission which consists of multiple end devices
    and router to propagate the information on larger distances. End devices which
    are scattered in the field consist of different kind of sensors such as temperature,
    gas, humidity, soil, Motion detector, PH, UV, PIR sensors and a microcontroller.
    FIGURE 10. Low power WSN topology. Show All End devices are directly connected
    to the router and controller, where controller communicates with base station
    by using serial port to analyze the received information. According to software
    monitoring perspective each end device is properly initialized and attached sensors
    are activated in an appropriate way. Once the sensors are activated then each
    device follows the router to connect in the same way according to which they have
    been designed. After confirmation end device may connect to the WSN by using identical
    key. Data which is collected through sensors is send to the base station which
    takes analysis on received data. When the sensors attached with end devices are
    being read then data is transmitted via ZigBee to the Controller or router. Major
    advantage of this net topology is its bi-directional communication by using ZigBee.
    2) IoT Protocols for Agriculture There are many IoT communication protocols which
    are widely used in agriculture for the purpose of smart farming. By using these
    protocols farmers can communicate in a more convenient way and make more efficient
    decisions for smart farming to enhance and monitor the growth of crop. Most common
    wireless protocols which are being used named: IEEE 802.11 WIFI, 2G/3G/4 G-Mobile
    Communications Standards, LoraWan, WiMax, Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks,
    Bluetooth, RFID, and ZigBee. Comparison of all these wireless protocols is given
    in Table 1. TABLE 1 Comparison of Existing Wireless Protocols a: IEEE 802.11 WiFi
    IEEE 802.11 is a compilation of communication standards Wireless Local Area Network
    that is 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n and 802.11ac. All these standards operate
    in different bandwidths that are 5 GHz, 2.2GHz, 2.4/5 GHz, 60 GHz and 5 GHz. Data
    transfer range of these standards is from 1Mb/s to 7 Gb/s. Its communication range
    is from 20 m to 100 m [42]. A wifi based wireless sensor network in IoT has been
    discussed for smart agriculture [43]. b: LoraWan LoraWan is a long range communication
    protocol which is developed by an open and non-profit association namely Lora
    TM Alliance. The main purpose of this LoraWan protocol is to assure the interoperability
    between multiple operators [44]. To improve agricultural productivity and anticipate
    the problems a framework has been presented in [45] whose component based on Lora
    and ARIMA technology. c: WiMax Data transfer range of Worldwide Interoperability
    for microwave access is from 1.5 Mb/s to 1 Gb/s. But now a days with the advancement
    of technology data transfer rate has been changed [46]. WiMax provides broadband
    multi access connectivity that includes fixed, portable, nomadic and mobile communication
    through wired or wireless connectivity. Both WiFi and WiMax technologies have
    been deployed in Ministry of Food and Agriculture, Ghana (MOFA) which enables
    user to connect either WiMax networks or building Wifi [47]. d: 2G/3G/4G-Mobile
    Communications Standards There are multiple generations of Mobile Communication
    Standards consist of Second Generation, Third Generation, and Fourth Generation.
    IoT devices Communicate by using these standards over cellular networks. Through
    the use of mobile communication farmer can detect temporal variability across
    their fiels and monitor crop yield, soil and climate conditions [48]. e: LR-WPAN
    Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks figure out the specification of high
    level communication standards like ZigBee. Data transfer rate of LR-WPAN consist
    of 40 Kb/s-250 Kb/s. The major property of this standard is that it provides low
    speed and low cost communication services [49]. LR-WPAN is mostly used for indoor
    agriculture such as home garden or in small farms. f: RFID RFID works on the principal
    by assigning a unique number individually to each object in order to record information.
    RFID consists of readers, host and tags where tags receive and transmit radio
    waves due to which it is also known as responder. RFI tags consist of active tags
    and passive tags which are available in different sizes and shapes. Passive tag
    is more advantageous as compare to active tag because it is cheap than active
    tags. Tags have unique ID number and environmental information such as moisture
    level, temperature condition, and humidity etc. These tags are embedded and attached
    in multiple objects to identify that object. g: ZigBee ZigBee is on the top of
    IEEE 802 standards created by ZigBee Alliance. It is a set of specifications for
    device to device network having low power data rates. With the advancement of
    technology and increasing the demand of throughput there is a need of faster and
    low power consumption technology. These requirements are fulfilled by more established
    technologies which provides faster data transfer. In agriculture environment IoT
    sensors sense the data and transfer it towards remote server. After sensing, collected
    data is analyzd for decisions making [50]. h: MQTT MQTT is a messaging protocol
    in IoT which is mainly designed for remote connections. It’s a bandwidth efficient
    protocol and uses little battery power. MQTT is used for continuous analysis and
    deploy a smart system for agriculture sector. A low cost web based IoT solution
    has been presented by using MQTT for monitoring, tracking and analyzing agricultural
    data and collect knowledge from field ambience and improve environmental conditions
    [51]. By using MQTT a low cost irrigation system has been proposed for receiving
    and transmitting sensor information [52]. i: SigFox It’s a low data rate and an
    ultra narrowband wireless cellular network which is appropriate for IoT and machine
    type communications [53]. To construct a geo location system SigFox network was
    used which localize animals pasture of the whole summer [54]. System proposed
    in [55] helps the farmers to locate their cattle’s position and increase their
    productivity. j: Bluetooth Bluetooth is a low power and low range Personal Area
    Network which is best for short range mobile communication. There are many IoT
    agricultural devices which are bluetooth enabled such as Farmnote Air gateway
    and color sensor work with bluetooth enabled sensors. Bluetooth has ubiquitous
    nature due to which it is considered as an appropriate technology for multi-tier
    agricultural applications [56]. SECTION IV. IoT Agriculture Applications IoT agriculture
    system applied as an array of wide variety of fields such as, Precision farming,
    livestock monitoring, and greenhouse monitoring. Agriculture applications have
    been categorized into three sections: IoT agricultural applications, Smartphone
    based applications and sensor based applications. IoT and sensor based applications
    categorization has been illustrated in figure 11 which is framed by reviewing
    the today’s available IoT solutions in agriculture. FIGURE 11. IoT structure in
    agriculture. Show All A. IoT Agricultural Application Domains There are number
    of IoT agriculture applications which are being used to create more efficient
    resources for agriculture productivity. Main domains of IoT agriculture applications
    are precision farming, livestock monitoring, greenhouse monitoring and agricultural
    drones. The following subsection consists of various types of agricultural applications.
    1) Precision Farming Precision farming helps the farmers to improve, automate
    and optimize all feasible directions in order to enhance the agricultural productivity
    and make cropping system smart [57]. Different IoT sensors are deployed to measure
    soil quality, weather conditions, moisture level, and effectively plan to optimize
    harvesting techniques. To enhance the crop production a correlation analysis between
    agricultural environment information and crop statistical analysis has been developed
    to collect crop data [28]. In [58] an IoT based platforms has been developed for
    precision agriculture and ecological monitoring. IoT based weather forecasts helps
    to optimize productivity and take anticipatory analysis to prevent the crop from
    damage. Multiple monitoring devices/sensors are used to predict pest behavior,
    plant or crop growth and address any pending pest issue before they damage crop.
    Ranchers use IoT based irrigation solutions to manage and analyze crop irrigation
    requirements. In [59] a remote agricultural monitoring platform has been presented
    on the basis of monitored data. A conceptual architecture based on cyber systems
    and software defined setworks has been presented in [60] for precision farming.
    IoT base Precision farming consist of multiple monitroing and controling applications
    such as climate conditions monitoring, soil patterns monitoring, pest and crop
    disease monitoring, irrigation, determine optimal time to plant and harvest and
    tracking/tracing. a: Climate Conditions Monitoring In agriculture it is the most
    important to monitor weather conditions continuously so that future activities
    can be planed accordingly. Weather stations are the most popular gadgets in the
    field of agriculture which are used to monitor different climte conditions. Weather
    parameters which are being monitored include temperature, humidity, wind direction,
    and air pressure etc. Located across the field, weather stations collect the environmental
    data and send it to the cloud server. Collected data is used for weather analysis
    to map climate conditions, and provide new insights to take required actions to
    improve agricultural productivity. US Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
    has been defined a weather related approach called Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA)
    which helps the user to transform agriculture system by identifying climate conditions
    [61]. A wireless sensor network has been deployed by using IoT technology to monitor
    weather changes by integrating the sensors and devices [62]. b: Soil Patterns
    Soil monitoring has become one of the most demanding practices in agriculture
    field for both industries and farmers. In soil monitoring there are many environmental
    issues which affects on crop production. If hese kinds of issues are identified
    data accurately then the farming patterns and processes can be understand easily.
    Soil patterns which are being monitored consists of Soil Humidity, moisture, fertilization
    and temperature. Soil humidity and moisture sensors are deployed to monitor the
    moisture content in soil [63]. An adequate amount of fertilization in the field
    also increase crop yield [64]. Soil monitoring test report increase crop productivity
    and recommends an appropriate fertilization solutions to farmer [65]. Moreover,
    identification of contaminated soil by using IoT technologies protect the field
    from over fertilization and crop loss. c: Pest and Crop Disease Monitoring Root
    causes of revenue and production losses are crop diseases. Due to the boom of
    IoT agricultural system has been changed into digital system which helps the farmer
    to make informed decisions. Prediction of crop diseases at early stages helps
    the farmers to generate more revenue by saving crop from pest attacks. IoT protect
    crop in multiple ways by detecting different diseases and prevent crop from animal
    attacks. An IoT based monitoring system has been presented in [66] to monitor
    the wheat diseases, pest and weeds. Crop raiding is the biggest issue due to contraction
    of cultivated land into different wildlife haunts. In [67] a monitoring and repelling
    system for the protection of crop against wild animals attack has been presented.
    Detection of crop disease at early stages is very challenging in the field of
    agriculture. Because to detect crop or leaf disease a team of experts is called,
    which is expensive and time taking process. Whereas, automatic detection of diseases
    is very beneficial, accurate and cheaper for farmer as compared to manual observation
    by experts. Image processing technique also plays a vital role for the earlier
    detection of plant disease [68]. A crop disease detection scenario has been shown
    in figure 12. FIGURE 12. Disease detection scenario. Show All Sensed raw data
    via sensing devices is converted into usable format via remote server and then
    stored into database which is displayed through a user interface. After getting
    data multiple data mining models are applied for disease (bacterial, fungal, viral
    etc) analysis. d: Irrigation Monitoring System IoT improve the current irrigation
    system in a more innovative way. A farmer can optimize irrigation system in multiple
    ways by monitoring weather conditions and soil conditions. IoT technology monitor
    irrigation system in four ways like weather forecasting data, control and monitor
    whole field from anywhere, Ethernet connection and WIFI. This modern irrigation
    system facilitates the farmers by installing multiple sensors, reducing farmers
    monthly irrigation cost, and limit water resources [69]. In [70] an intelligent
    irrigation management system has been presented by using Maching learning and
    open source technologies which sense different soil and weather parametrs. An
    IoT based Low cost irrigation system has been designed in [71] which uses HTTP
    and MQTT protocols to inform the user. Water quality is monitored by sensor nodes
    which are empowered with wireless communication. IoT technology measure both physical
    and chemical constraints of ph, dissolved, temperature, conductivity and oxygen
    [72]. Gathered data about water management system is viewed on internet by using
    cloud computing services. Recently multiple IoT irrigation platforms have been
    developed to control the water consumption in the field. In [73] a simple irrigation
    system has been developed by using WSN. In more advance system users can control
    the process of irrigation through cellular technologies. Likewise, system is proposed
    in [75] in which user transfer sensors data via cellular technologies to a database
    system. e: Determine the Optimal Time to Plant and Harvest IoT increase operational
    efficiency and enhance the crop productivity by determining the best possible
    time to harvest and plant. IoT amalgamate multiple existing technologies like
    cloud computing applications, end user applications, wireless sensor networks
    (WSN’s) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) to determine the accurate time
    of weeding and seeding [76]. f: Tracking and Tracing IoT provides informative
    data to agricultural companies for better decisions making such as planning, managing
    and connect with business partners intelligently by saving money and time. In
    growing environment soil, air, water, fertilizers, and pesticides conditions are
    monitored by RFID and Global Positioning System (GPS). GPS system is used to find
    the exact location of agriculture field and monitor various agricultural parameters
    by using wireless communication networks. In [77] an architecture has been develop
    which remotely monitor the soil condition and soil structure as per requirement
    of crops culture. In this structure ZigBee is connected with other devices like
    content management system (CMS), Global System for Mobile (GSM) and General Packet
    Radio Service (GPRS) by using Wireless sensor networks to monitor and realize
    real time data checking. GPS provides interface to interact with ARM (an intelligent
    monitoring system to achieve functions like SMS/MMS) and gives an alarm to farm
    manager when an unwanted changes occur and helps the farmers to take corrective
    action. Although it’s operational and maintenance cost is high but it is widely
    used in agriculture due to its exact location monitoring and tracking property.
    g: Farm Management System The adoption of smart farming is correspondingly increasing
    the amount of productivity by reducing the environmental impact but this smart
    farming technique can be possible via Farm Management System (FMS). FMS is a key
    element for processing, planning, and decision making for the purpose of smart
    farming [78]. An integrated FMS allows the farmers to monitor the entire where
    whole data is collected via WSN, GSM modules and microcontroller. An identifier
    is used on the sensors and devices in all over the farm which gives the proper
    knowledge of fertilization, weather data, automatic buffer zone width monitoring,
    and automatic detail record is generated according to per day activities of farm.
    This whole information is stored in the computer in standard format and can be
    accessible via cell phone or internet for further processing. To optimize the
    use of water resources an automated irrigation and monitoring system is used [73].
    Apart from irrigation system farm is also protected from pest and animal intrusion
    [66], [67]. h: Agricultural Drones Drones are defined as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
    (UAVs) which are being utilized in agriculture to improve various practices of
    farming. These flying devices are controlled remotely by remote control or autonomously
    programmed. Agricultural processes which are performed by drones are crop health
    assessment, spraying, screening, planting, scouting reports, measurement of nitrogen
    in wheat and analysis of soil conditions. Drones facilitate the farmers via integration
    with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping, and crop health imaging. Drones
    are mostly deployed in large farms where issues related to bacteria fungus are
    difficult to handle and require regular monitoring. In the area of agriculture
    pesticides and fertilizers are very important for crop yield [65], [66]. Agricultural
    drones are carrying out this job efficiently because of its high speed and effectiveness
    in the spraying operation. In addition they also deployed to monitor forests,
    livestock and aquaculture. An organization Precision Hawk is using drones for
    valuable data gathering through sensors for surveying mapping, and imaging of
    agricultural land. They perform in-flight monitoring, farmers enters the detail
    about which field to survey and select a ground resolution. An IoT based Farm
    management information system approch has been developed to meet the bussiness
    objectives [29]. Agricultural drones are integrated with GPS devices cameras and
    sensors to monitor crop health, like planting, crop spraying, screening and analysis
    of soil. There are many other advantages of drone’s utilization like crop health
    imaging, plant counting, amount of nitrogen in wheat, plant height, drainage mapping,
    and weed pressure etc. 2) Greenhouse Monitoring In greenhouse plants are grown
    under controlled environment. This glasshouse technology provides benefits to
    growing plants anytime anywhere by monitoring appropriate environmental conditions.
    Cultivation of greenhouse is more intense, therefore in terms of controlling and
    monitoring it requires high precision. To monitor environmental or weather conditions
    there have been several studies on the applications of WSN’s in greenhouse. Recent
    studies shows that how IoT can be implemented in greenhouse to minimize the human
    resources, accumulate energy and provides direct link of greenhouse from ranchers
    to customers. Most of the studies have focused only on remote monitoring and localized
    [14]–[16]. In addition, for the purpose of high precision there have been a lot
    of studies which integrates meta-processing structure with data to transfer it
    on remote infrastructures through internet. By applying well evaluated crop models,
    assessment of the crop status helps the ranchers to take better decisions [80].
    In Figure 13 a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has been implemented to monitor the
    greenhouse environment. Whole network is divided into multi parts which processes
    the data and gives feedback. FIGURE 13. WSN for monitoring greenhouse environment.
    Show All Data can be obtained by corresponding sensors and detectors and then
    transferred to the main server for processing. In physical implementation the
    major components are the sensors and network for accurate data transmission. Growers
    setup the different monitoring devices and sensors according to the specific requirements
    and track or record the required information. Agriculturists make better decisions
    by analyzing the received information and achieve specific goals by obtaining
    optimal data. There are many IoT based greenhouse applications such as water management,
    plant monitoring, and climate monitoring etc. a: Water Management To measure the
    exact amount of required water in greenhouses is a key problem. Smart sensors
    are implemented which are controlled by applying multiple IoT techniques to avoid
    from excessive use of water. In greenhouses water management is carried out by
    using automatic drip irrigation which works by following soil mositure threshhold
    that is set accordingly [81]. b: Plant Monitoring IoT sensors and cameras creates
    ideal environment for plants by monitoring the state of plants regularly and generates
    an alert if any problem is recognizable. On the other side, cloud based IoT solutions
    store the sensed data and view it periodically which is helpful for growers to
    ensure that all plants obtains ideal attention in the greenhouse [82]. c: Climate
    Monitoring There are many parameters which are combined to maintain and create
    an ideal environment for plants within strict limits such as, the maintenance
    of ventilation, temperature, carbon dioxide, and oxygen level. This can be made
    possible by deploying IoT enabled greenhouse where smart devices and sensors share
    their information for strong decision making [81]. 3) Livestock Monitoring Optimal
    environment or weather circumstances which absorbs excessive amount of climate
    conditions leaves negative impact on the productivity of animals that is a serious
    issue for many researchers [83]. Whereas, due to increasing the demand of high
    quality dairy products precision livestock also considered as the major concern.
    Each year ranchers lose a large amount of profit because of animals illness. But
    IoT based livestock management solutions helps the farmers to improve the farming
    principles, livestock conditions and dairy products [11]. Just like crop monitoring
    sensors, different livestock monitoring sensors are also attached to the animals
    to monitor their log performance. Livestock monitoring factors varies on the categories
    of animals under consideration such as conductivity of milk, pest attack, humidity,
    and water quality. By tagging RFID to individual animal allow farmers to track
    their location, thereby preventing animal from theft. Connected sensors and wearables
    in the livestock allow the farmer to monitor overall animals’ activities and data
    streamed to the cloud directly helps the farmers to identify the issues. Cowlar
    and SCR by Allflex are using smart agriculture sensors to monitor animals health,
    activity, temperature, nutrition and collect information on each individual as
    well as about the herd [84], [85]. In the field of livestock several studies have
    been realized. Wireless Sensor have been used which are most advantageous for
    large farm as well as for hazardous gas monitoring. An IoT based livestock scenario
    is shown in Figure 14. FIGURE 14. IoT based livestock scenario. Show All In the
    field different IoT sensing devices have been deployed to monitor the weather
    conditions via weather station and sense other activities in the field by all
    other data sources which have been implemented in the whole farm. Sensed data
    is stored on the cloud server, which user can use for decision making. User can
    interact remotely by using multiple smart devices (Laptops, Tablets, and Mobile
    etc.). Some IoT base applications of livestock monitoring have discussed below:
    a: Animal Temperature Monitoring Identification of disease symptoms and prevention
    is the major function for animal health monitoring. Normal body temperature of
    dogs is 38.3°C-39.2°C and cow’s is 38.5°C-39.5°C. When the body temperature is
    increased or decreased from the normal body temperature then it indicates that
    animal is suffering from any disease [86]. b: Heat Stress Level Heat stress decreases
    the cow’s milk productivity with same dietary input, due to which farmers face
    the cost production issues. In summer season moisture content becomes low due
    to which stress level in animals increased, because of this animal can also die.
    c: Physical Gesture Recognition Gesture analysis can be made by using IoT animal
    monitoring devices. Animal’s gesture behavior is classified into different groups
    such as in cattle, this behavior is consisting of two classes that are traveling
    and stationary. Traveling behavior consists of animal’s walking, running and grazing
    whereas stationary behavior is animal’s sitting, sleeping and standing. d: Rumination
    Rumination monitor the digested food by animal and it is detected by mounting
    a monitoring device in the animal’s (cows) nose. In this way farmer can get accurate
    indication about animal’s health. e: Heart Rate Measurement of heart rate is an
    indirect method which impacts due to the agitation and stress that cow have. Normal
    heart rate of cow is 43 to 84 bpm whereas calf’s normal heart rate is 100 to 140
    bpm. By using IoT devices and sensors heart rate can be monitored constantly.
    f: GPS Based Monitoring GPS system is used to obtain the specification of farm
    and sends the monitored parameters to central monitoring station by using wireless
    sensor network. To prevent animals from theft, wild attacks or weather conditions
    a repelling system has been provided by using wireless technologies like Zigbee,
    WIFI, and LoWPAN [88]. B. Agricultural Solutions by Using Smart Phones From the
    last few years it has been observed that integration of electronic devices with
    smartphones innovate the technology world and smartphones are taken as a driver
    of IoT. To make smart phones versatile in agriculture field various hardware and
    software have been designed. A good (but not complete) survey of smart phone apps
    providing agricultural solutions has been presented [98]. Figure 15 showing a
    classification illustration of smart phone apps for smart farming. Morever, there
    is a number of recent apps which are serving similar functionalties. All smart
    phone apps which are elaborated in figure 15 discussed in tabular form with a
    small description of each. These smart phone apps are not limited; developers
    from all over the world have developed many e-Farming apps therefore, this paper
    highlighted some selected apps which have been discussed according to their popularity.
    FIGURE 15. Smartphone applications for agriculture. Show All C. IoT Devices and
    Sensors in Agriculture In today’s modern world everything needs to be automatic
    with less man power by consuming less time. Sensor is such a device which can
    fulfill this requirement by detecting same input from the existing physical environment
    and responds back. User set some setting over sensing devices to perform their
    task without the involvement of human. There are some major IoT sensors like:
    Motion Detector, PIR, Soil Moisture, Temperature, Humidity, Barometric Pressure,
    Ultra Violet, PH, and gas sensor. In Table 3 various sensor based agricultural
    applications, their operations and IoT association have been discussed but table
    2 pay attention only on smart phone agricultural apps. TABLE 2 Smartphone Agricultural
    Applications Description TABLE 3 IoT Sensor Based Applications in Agriculture
    SECTION V. IoT Agricultural Security In the coming years agricultural sector is
    expected to witness the extensive acceptance of IoT and grow through the new e-farming
    IoT applications and devices. These agricultural applications and devices are
    expected to deal with a large amount of sensitive data. Due to the distributed
    nature of IoT a single security protocol is not sufficient therefore, leakage
    of information is a major security concern [107]. If we adopt IoT fully in the
    field of agriculture then it will be more critical to analyze and identify the
    distinctive features of privacy and security like different security requirements
    and threat models in the perspective of Agriculture. On the basis of literature
    some security issues has been presented in Figure 16. FIGURE 16. IoT security
    issues in agriculture. Show All A. Security Requirements IoT based smart farming
    security requirements are similar to standard security scenario. Therefore, to
    achieve a secure farming solution we have need to pay attention on the following
    security requirements: Confidentiality: Agricultural information or personal data
    relevant to it should be accessible only by authorized users. Integrity: Here
    integrity means received and stored data or content is not changed. Authentication:
    Authentication means peer devices should have an identity to which it is communicating.
    Data Freshness: It consists of key freshness and data freshness because IoT agricultural
    networks sometime provides varying measurements, therefore it is necessary to
    ensure that every message is fresh. Non Repudiation: Its means a node can never
    deny to send a message that sent earlier. Authorization: Here authorization means
    for network or any other resources only authorized devices are allowed. Self Healing:
    If any device in an IoT based agricultural network fail or out of energy then
    other devices in the network should be able to provide security to some extent.
    B. Security Challenges Security of IoT based smart farming mainly consists of
    three basic requirements that are Authentication, access control and confidentiality
    of the stakeholders. Whereas, at the perception layer network must be secured
    from external attacks and in the network layer aggregation of the data should
    be secured. Authorize specific entities ensures that only authorized user can
    access data from application layer [28]. The most common issue of security in
    the perception layer is physical security that is the security of hardware and
    information acquisition security [108]. Here physical security is very important
    because all the devices are deployed in an open field. That’s why a single security
    protocol is not enough because IoT devices may be implemented in a diverse environment.
    Another major security issue is leakage of information, this information consist
    of location and sensitive data. Security countermeasures consist of data encryption,
    jamming, blocker tags use, modification in tag frequency, and tag destruction
    strategy. There is a difference between sensor nodes and RFID tags that’s’ why
    while implementing encryption algorithm, intrusion detection policies, key distribution
    and routing policies, hardware restrictions should keep in mind [109]. In IoT
    concept data flows from an end device towards gateway, during this process data
    also uploaded to other platform such as cloud infrastructure. There are multiple
    security policies exist for sensor nodes like identity authentication, data filtering,
    cryptographic algorithm, data flow control mechanisms etc. Cheating, wiretapping,
    replay attacks and tampering are also security threats. Due to which, confidentiality,
    authentication and integrity should be must employed while data acquisitions phase
    [17]. C. Stack Challenges Middleware layer also plays a vital role in IoT to increase
    security. Middleware stands in between application layer and network layer which
    is responsible to process data and provide interface for communication between
    these layers. Middleware layer requires secure and confidential data storage.
    Secure transmission via wireless medium is very challenging in IoT deployment
    due to which IoT based architecture is at risk like vulnerability, denial of services,
    illegal access, and many virus injects. In this way data integrity and confidentiality
    is affected by such attacks. According to IoT vision application layer is one
    of the top most layers and closely related to the cloud due to its computation
    resources and storage nature. Security issue at application layer and cloud are
    very similar such as data security, backup, recovery and privacy. Therefore, access
    rights of the data, information and ownership for physical users, machines and
    organizations should manage and administered by a control mechanisms. D. Threat
    Model Both IoT agricultural devices and networks are at risk because of increasing
    attack surface. IoT agricultural threat model consist of three scenarios. First
    one is cloud networks, second is native networks expansion and third is cloud
    services. Threat may be generates from internal or external network. If an attack
    is arise from an agriculture device then it will be considered as one of the more
    severe attack. Because it is very difficult to detect the malicious device within
    the network. In addition an adversary may attack on an agriculture device and
    network and use power device like mobile, laptop or tablet or may be same kind
    of IoT devices to penetrate the network. E. Attack Taxonomy There are many types
    of attacks in IoT paradigm due to which an attacker may attack by adopting a method
    on future or existing IoT agriculture devices and networks. In IoT agricultural
    field threat may be tangible, predictable or unpredictable. In this paper existing
    and possible threats are classified on the basis of three key factors: which are
    Information Disruption, Host, and networks. 1) Attacks on the Basis of Information
    Disruptions Stored agricultural data may be analyzed or manipulated by a hacker
    to provide wrong information. Such attacks consist of Interruption (denial of
    services), Interception (threaten data privacy and confidentiality), Modification
    (unauthorized access to the agricultural data), Fabrication and replay. 2) Attacks
    on the Basis of Host Properties Host properties attacks occure in two forms namely:
    hardware compromise (attacker may attact on device program code data or keys and
    reprogram the devices with malicious code) and software compromise (attacker may
    take the advantage of software vulnerabilities and glitches like operating system,
    applications software and system software). 3) Attacks on the Basis of Networks
    Properties Two types of attacks can be arised on basis of networks properties.
    Namely: standard protocol compromise (to threat service availability like integrity
    and authenticity where attacker deviates from standard protocols) and network
    protocol stack (consist of different types of vulnerabilities). F. Reference Security
    Model for IoT Based Agriculture IoT agricultural paradigms are not yet strong
    but continued to build up due to which currently it is difficult to discover all
    possible threats and vulnerabilities in IoT agricultural field. However, when
    experts find the security solution to solve the apparent security threats at that
    point they should have the ability to mitigate the hidden security issues. To
    accomplish a security solution, security checks should be deployed with dynamic
    properties. Consider a framework in which security mechanism consist of different
    systems which can detect and prevent IoT agricultural system from attacks. Now
    consider, that an attacker generate a new type of attack on agricultural applications
    devices and networks to steal agricultural information integrity. In such conditions
    existing security techniques should indentify this new attack by using dynamic
    algorithm. A security model presented in Figure 17 has been discussed to resolve
    these issue. The model is illustrated with its three security systems: protection
    system is designed to mitigate the attack while, dignosing system collects activity
    data from agricultural applications, networks, nodes and analyzes detected agricultural
    data. Reaction system is designed to help the agricultural entities survive all
    types of attacks. FIGURE 17. An intelligent collaborative security model for smart
    farming. Show All FIGURE 18. Selected IoT agricultural products. Show All Whole
    system has been designed by following dynamic algorithms. To prevent from present,
    probable and hidden attacks this system has strong collaboration. Upon intrusion
    detection system issues an operation command and store in reaction system after
    that share their anomaly diagnosing experience with protection system to prevent
    from further attacks. Operation command receive response from identification service,
    reaction system remove the system failure risks and after that pass out its experience
    with other two systems that are protection and diagnosing systems. In this way
    a complete inter collaboration system is accomplished. SECTION VI. IoT Agricultural
    Industry Trends and Practices The IoT in agriculture field has experienced a burst
    of creativity, activity, venture capital firms and exciting entrepreneurs. The
    space becomes visible as an active group of large firms and new start ups that
    are willing to become the part of what may be a giant market and technologies.
    In this section an extensive record of some products and technologies has been
    provided for a good understanding of IoT position in agriculture field. 3D Crop
    Sensor Array with PAR Addon can be mounted on any location, to monitor temperature,
    humidity and carbon dioxide in the farm [110]. EC-1 Controller monitors the environmental
    conditions and then programs them to control the environment by turning off and
    on devices [111]. Arable Mark is the first device which links the global weather
    data within the field observations developed by Arable. With the unprecedented
    ground truth accuracy device makes informed decisions and deliveres real time
    monitoring information to the palm of user’s hand [112]. Growlink designed Growlink
    one controller to deliver smart farming experience. It has highest processing
    power and components quality to coordinate with multiple sensors and devices in
    all over the farm. This device is simply all in one and farmers can expand the
    system according to their requirements by adding additional microcontroller via
    IP networks [113]. Easternpeak offers an IoT GreenIQ agricultural device which
    control irrigation and saves water of your garden’s lawn from anywhere. Growers
    can save up to 50% outdoor water bills by using a GreenIQ smart sprinklers controller
    [114]. Grofit provides a climate monitoring device based on Bluetooth and its
    transmission range is up to 200 m in all over field. This device also provide
    data log which store maximum 30 days measurements. Growers can monitor air humidity,
    real time air temperature and sun radiations by using this device [115]. MeteoHelix
    weather station designed by allmeteo which provides reliable, stable and open
    meteorological solutions according to weather requirements. This weather station
    provides multiple features like temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, dew
    point, sun radiations, and solar radiations measurement [116]. Leaf Wetness sensor
    is developed by Smart Element which determine the wetness of leaf by electrical
    resistance on the surface of sensor. It is used to measure wet and dry time on
    the leaf surface [117]. Swip Track Micro locates any moving object in all over
    the field that may be any farming machine, vehicle or engines [118]. Waspmote
    Plug & Sense! Smart Agriculture Xtreme is a sensor node which provides more reliable
    and accurate information about weather. This sensor measures the wind and rainfall
    condition via optical technology. The presence of fertilizers and soil morphology
    can be analyzed through this sensor by measuring the oxygen level, water content,
    and soil water potential [119]. SKY – Lora Weather Station can easily communicate
    to nearby master sensor through LoRa [120]. This is suitable for those locations
    where there is nearby connectivity. This weather station can send data up to 600
    meter away to a master sensor which has WIFI connection. Pycno has been developed
    a Pulse IoT automation sensor which comes in a self-sustained package powered
    by a tiny solar panel [121]. Sensor is WIFI and LoRa enabled device which has
    multiprotocol port in the bottom. In future Pulse Automation Sensor and Pycno
    soil sensor will be integrated to actuate devices and talk with each other in
    the field. CropX Starter Kit – Soil Temperature 24/7 is a real-time soil-temperature
    monitoring Sensor. This sensor has direct cellular connection and better accuracy
    which provides advance sensing capabilities [122]. Some top technologies firm’s
    trends and directions are highlighted in Table 4. TABLE 4 IoT Agricultural Trends
    and Directions of Some Well Known Technology Industries SECTION VII. IoT Smart
    Farming Policies and Success Stories A. Policies Many countries have understood
    the importance of IoT and facilitating through its advance monitoring techniques.
    Government of different countries is seizing the IoT opportunity and investing
    maximum to boost up the crop productivity. Adaptation of IoT technology in different
    countries has been discussed in this section. 1) Australia Government of Australia
    has invested AU$ 134 million to boost up farming. Due to this large investment
    a center was created by a private company in Sidney to implement IoT technologies
    for Smart farming [150]. In 2014 an Innovative Network for Precision Agriculture
    System was established for the purpose of a collaborative frame work to create
    a national agenda in Australian agriculture. In terms of privacy and security,
    in 2015 an American farm Bureau took the lead in establishing a privacy and security
    set for farm data [151]. 2) Ireland Irish Farmer’s Association (IFA) Launched
    a program for agriculturists to reduce the cost, to improve the soil quality and
    guides the farmer how to save water and energy by adopting new technologies [8].
    When the farmers follow these instructions the results were very positive and
    encouraging. Companies saved almost 8700 euro, 10% reduction in green house gas
    emission, 21% savings in pasture management and 47% saving was achieved by Soil
    Fertility. In 2016 a nationwide SigFox network was launched by VT-Networks Ireland
    which provides solution for tracking security sensors and farm assets [153]. 3)
    France Ministry of Agriculture in France has become the partner of the Agriculture
    Innovation Project 2025. The basic aim of this project is to increase the strengthen
    of agricultural land, monitor the climate conditions and create incubators to
    improve agriculture field in France. Ministry of agriculture also share the collected
    data with farmer’s to propose new solution in the field of Agriculture [154].
    French agriculture is administrated by European Union (EU) rules and supported
    through a policy called Common Agriculture Policy (CAP). A new CAP framework was
    defined in 2015 at EU level for next five years which is beneficial for different
    agro ecology projects for farming. 4) China In 2016 china launched its 13th five
    years plan to integrate IoT in the field of agriculture to enhance profitability
    [156]. Project has been started in different eight provinces, with multiple products,
    technologies and 426 applications. Data was collected from multiple provincial
    and national level data centers. Moreover, NB-IoT App by Huawei company in china
    transforming the agriculture in a more efficient and an innovative way. NB-IoT
    provides low cost agriculture solutions as compare to cellular network where gateway
    implementation is not necessary. Huawei NB-IoT has large number of connections
    and wide coverage due to which it can resolve issue of scattered agricultural
    data [157]. 5) Malaysia Agricultural policy in Malaysia was established in two
    periods of time policy before and after independence 1948–1957 and 1957–2020 [158].
    The purpose of the policy was to enhance the growth of crop and decrease the poverty.
    Multiple solutions have been created by Malaysian Institute of Microelectronic
    System (MIMOS) which are best for agriculture development. A sensor named Mi-MSCANT
    PH has been developed by MIMOS to gather environmental data. An agricultural framework
    has been developed by MIMOS to integrate IoT technologies which create a bonding
    between suppliers, traders, and agricultural producers mutually in unified manners.
    This framework utilizes technologies named Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS)
    and WSN which automatically collect environmental data [159]. 6) USA USA has funded
    million Dollars to generate new agricultural technologies to fulfill the necessary
    requirements of energy and food. National Institute of Food and Agriculture worked
    on a project that is Internet-of-Ag-Things and develop sensing technologies for
    smart farming practices. The major purpose of this project is to develop precision
    technologies to enhance the efficiency of agriculture industries and make better
    use of water, fertilizers and organic food [160]. The U.S. Department of Agriculture
    (USDA) has started a project to address water management challenges and develop
    new solution for those issues which are affecting agriculture. Technology experts
    are using USDA datasets to improve and design agricultural services [161]. 7)
    Thailand In Thailand National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC)
    applying innovative IT technologies for the purpose of smart farming and their
    major focus is on four agricultural products including Rubber, Rice, Sugar and
    Cassava [162]. The major concern of this movement is to increase the agricultural
    productivity and facilitate the farmers in all rural areas of Thailand [163].
    Faculty of Science and Technology at Thammasat University developed an IoT-based
    irrigation control system which helps the grower to preset watering cycle timing
    in advance. A smart farm service provider namely; FarmD Asia was established in
    2015 to boost up the agricultural productivity by its flagship products. FarmD
    Asia has also designed a pesticides aerial drone which covers upto eight acres
    land in single fly. National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA)
    launched Agricultural System Integrator (ASI) program which was primarily designed
    for farmers to start and run smart farm successfully [164]. 8) India Different
    IoT policies have been formulated by Indian government in order to leverage the
    strength of their agricultural field in all over the world. Indians basic purpose
    is to monitor the earth density, soil conditions, temperature and alerts the farmers
    to control pest related issues. In 2015 a policy on IoT in India was released
    by Ministry of Communication and Information Technology to transform digital landscape
    by using IoT [165]. 9) Philippine Philippines have used the remote sensing techniques
    to increase the production of rice. They are also using ground data processing
    and satellite imagery techniques to generate more information on different agricultural
    conditions. University of Southeastern Philippines (USeP) proposed an intelligent
    solution to monitor crop heat stress by using IoT technology with the collaboration
    of Western Mindanao State University (WMSU). In this project research team is
    on the brink with an effective technology counter heat stress which helps the
    farmer to get maximum benefit with the fewest inputs [166]. B. Food and Agriculture
    Organization of United NATIONSNN Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations
    (FAO) is an e-agricultural organization which follows the international efforts
    to fulfill the deficiency of food in all over 130 countries worldwide. FAO predicted
    that there is a most probability that world population will reach 9.8 billion
    by 2050 therefore, it is necessary to increase the food production 70% by 2050
    to fulfils the growing demand of food through the utilization of IoT technology.
    Mitsubishi Corporation (MC) and Vegetalia, changing Japanese agricultural sector
    by their join forces through AI and IoT. By using tensiometer sensors Tevatronic
    develops an autonomous irrigation system which is placed in the ground near the
    plants for monitoring. From the last 74 years FAO has been changed the agricultural
    world by launching its top ten achievements given in table 5 [167]. TABLE 5 Top
    10 E-Agricultural Strategies of FAO C. IoT Agriculture Success Stories This research
    indicates that there have been several tools and techniques which helps the farmers
    to improve the crop productivity in a more innovative ways. Some IoT agriculture
    relevant technologies have been discussed in section I which provides additional
    tools to the farmers or agriculturists to increase the crop yield. Section III
    describes the different IoT and Smartphone based applications which facilitate
    the farmers to enhance the agriculture productivity by providing extended benefits.
    However over the globe governments are seizing the IoT opportunities in agriculture
    by making large investment. There are many pilot projects which reflects a great
    potential in the future of IoT in agriculture at country level such as china,
    India, Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan etc. Therefore, in this research we have also
    discussed the results of some pilot projects conducted and being executed in different
    countries. Table 6 prepresents the success stories of these pilot projects in
    different countries with the main IoT agricultural applications (precision farming,
    greenhouse, and livestock). TABLE 6 IoT Agriculture Success Stories SECTION VIII.
    IoT Agricultural Challenges Many researchers have worked on IoT agriculture system
    and solve multiple technological issues and architectural problems by implementing
    and designing various IoT agricultural solutions. Moreover, according to the research
    point of view in the literature, there are also several open issues and challenges
    which are needed to address successfully [57]. There are many challenges which
    are linkage with IoT smart farming deployment and applications. This research
    has identified some explored and unexplored IoT agricultural issues and challenges.
    A. Hardware Challenges Several challenges arise in IoT agricultural setup. First
    of all the equipments which exists at the perception layer are directly expose
    to harsh environmental experience such as, rain, high level temperature, extreme
    humidity, hard winds, and many other possible dangers which destroy electronic
    circuits. End devices works consistently for a long period by depending on inadequate
    batteries power resources. So, a suitable programming tools and less power potential
    is necessary because in case of any program failure instantly battery replacement
    is complicated especially in a large scale open field [144]. B. Networking Challenges
    These challenges are not only for the hardware implementations, but also exist
    at the network layer. Due to high cost of wiring, wireless communication is most
    important for the deployment of IoT based agriculture. Physical deployment shows
    that accepted transceivers performance is exaggerated by human presence, temperature,
    humidity and many other barriers inside the space where wireless device or node
    wants to communicate. Due to which there should use most reliable and robust technologies
    to transfer data according to the environmental challenges and rural conditions
    [8]. A detailed analysis on IoT agriculture networking challenges and issues is
    given [145]. C. IoT Agricultural Platforms IoT agricultural architecture is more
    complicated as compare to other IoT end devices and requires real time monitoring
    system with additional stringent requirements. For this a tailored computing platform
    is needed with run time libraries. A service oriented approach (SOA) can also
    take to build a suitable platform; such services can be exploited by using different
    API’s. In addition, appropriate frameworks and libraries should be developed so
    that agricultural developers can make resourceful use of available document, classes,
    codes and other useful data. D. Other Technical Issues 1) Interfernce To implement
    smart farming a large number of IoT devices are deployed for agricultural purpose
    that creates hindrance especially for those IoT devices which are using unlicensed
    spectrum like Sogfox, ZigBee, LoRa, and WIFI. These technical issues reduce the
    reliability and loss of data. Moreover, unnecessary interference can be eliminated
    by using IoT devices with licensed spectrum. But, among the IoT devices which
    are using cellular licensed spectrum the reprocess of non-orthogonal multiple
    access method can create hindrance because of restricted pilot assignment in cellular
    band. 2) Reliability In agriculture field mostly the IoT devices are deployed
    in an open environment. Due to which there may occur some inconsiderate environmental
    impacts which may cause the communication failure as well as degradation of deployed
    sensors. Therefore, physical safety of IoT devices and system is necessary to
    secure the expensive gadgets from unauthorized user and severe attacks like weather
    conditions or theft. 3) Scalability Billions of IoT devices have been increased
    gradually, due to which more devices are getting connected. Therefor, large number
    of gateways and protocols are needed to support IoT devices. Moreover, IoT agricultural
    back end databases and network applications should be reliable and scalable because
    with the addition of diverse application related operations becomes more complex.
    Therefore, design a highly scalable security scheme and an intelligent IoT system
    for each end device. 4) Resource Optimization Farmers need optimization of resources
    to measure how many IoT devices, gateways, size of cloud storage, and amount of
    transmitted data is required. Due to different farm sizes and variables like crop
    or livestock monitoring resource optimization has become challenging because there
    is a need of different sensors and devices to perform each function. Therefore,
    this will require complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to determine
    the resource allocation for maximum agriculture productivity. 5) Cost Analysis
    and Lack Knwoledge of Technology In the field of agriculture profit margin is
    very important, there is a need of stability the trade-off between the deployments
    of IoT enabling technologies. When an IoT system is deployed the cost of implementations
    are very high like IoT devices/Sensors, gateways, and base station infrastructure.
    After that maintenance cost also important for the use of central services which
    are necessary for IoT devices management, data collection, and information sharing
    among all other services. Moreover, the major factor of slowing IoT in rural areas
    is basically the lack knowledge of IoT and its applications. This is the main
    problem because majority of ranchers is uneducated and lives in rural areas. Therefor,
    it is most important to overcome these obstacles by educating farmers in order
    to generate more revnue [7]. 6) Deployment of LPWA Technologies There is a large
    number of IoT devices in Agriculture scenario, and such devices should liable
    to be heterogeneous in the context of their transmit, receive, sleep, and deep
    sleep along with others. In the terms of power requirements each communication
    layer confronts a supplementary challenge. For example, to confirm the service
    accessibility at MAC layer to find a low power device discovery protocol is a
    difficult task. 7) Universal Platform Adaptation of IoT in agriculture will shift
    from just specific crop to a standard platform which can support multiple smart
    farming applications for crop productivity. This standard platform creates a system
    which can be easily modified to support multiple agricultural applications ranging
    from monitoring to managing. This kind of platform will be free from any kind
    of geographical limitations work as an enabler in IoT agriculture system. 8) Mobility
    IoT agricultural network should have the capability to hold up and maintain the
    farmers mobility. So, that they can connect their farms from anywhere at any time
    [146]. 9) Quality of Service (QOS) Recent studies on QoS highlight that at each
    layer of IoT architecture QoS is required [147] [148]. The ability to make sure
    that devices which needs to transmit sensitive information will be capable to
    do this by using IoT technology without any barrier is still an open research
    issue. There is a need to do more work by providing a mechanism that guarantees
    QoS throughout IoT network layers. E. The Business Model IoT agricultural business
    approach is not still vigorous because it consists of a set of essential elements
    with the latest requirements like new operational policies and processes to transform
    the organizational structure. F. Organizational Challenges When talk about food
    organizations and agricultural sectors, is mean the exchange of information and
    goods transportation. IoT is renovating this whole business process by providing
    reliable and accurate delivery of all products and materials [1]. At the circumference
    of network to store and process the data cloud computing provides highest quality
    of services like efficient storage, computational resources, and application development
    tools for hardware diagnostic. That’s why cloud computing is an ideal accompaniment
    in the world of IoT technologies. At the end of the network a large amount of
    data is produced which needs high cost to transfer towards cloud in terms of latency
    and money [18]. Due to which it is a serious issue because of workload and optimal
    balancing. On the other hand fog computing also the cloud computing extension
    which expanding cloud technologies like tools, and the application development
    scope [149]. SECTION IX. Conclusion All over the globe researchers are exploring
    technological solutions to enhance the agriculture productivity in a way that
    complements existing services by deploying IoT technology. In this article, we
    have presented a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art for IoT in agriculture.
    To this end, we discuss agricultural network architecture, platform, and topology
    which help to access to IoT backbone and facilitates farmers to enhance the crop
    productivity. In addition, this article provides an extensive overview on current
    and continuing advances in IoT agricultural applications, devices/sensors, communication
    protocols and many innovative technologies. This research considers various IoT
    agricultural challenges and security requirements for the better understanding
    of IoT smart farming security. Furthermore, many important dimensions of IoT based
    agricultural including technologies, industries trends and countries policies
    have been also been presented to facilitate various stake holders. Government
    has started patronizing IoT in agriculture and it is anticipated that soon IoT
    in agriculture will revamp the conventional farming method. It is also clear that
    many big organizations have started investing and developing new techniques for
    farm management system using IoT. Finally, it is expected that this comprehensive
    survey results into a very useful piece of information for researchers, professionals,
    agriculturists and policy makers who are participating and working in IoT field
    and agricultural technologies. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

    \ has witnessed signiﬁcant advancements in\ntechnology, paving the way for improved\
    \ monitoring and management practices. One\nsuch technological innovation that\
    \ holds great promise is the use of Internet of Things (IoT)\ntechnologies for\
    \ monitoring crop health, growth, and yield prediction. The integration\nof IoT\
    \ devices, sensors, and data analytics offers new possibilities for farmers to\
    \ gain\nreal-time insights into their crops and make informed decisions for optimizing\
    \ agricultural\nproductivity [1,2].\nSustainability 2023, 15, 14541. https://doi.org/10.3390/su151914541\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\nSustainability 2023, 15, 14541\n\
    2 of 19\nAgricultural productivity cannot be overstated when it comes to the importance\
    \ of\ncrop monitoring. In order for farmers to make informed decisions concerning\
    \ irrigation,\nfertilization, pest control, and other agronomic practices, accurate\
    \ and timely information\nabout crop health, growth, and yield potential is necessary\
    \ [3]. There has been a long\nhistory of crop monitoring that relies on manual\
    \ observation and a limited range of sam-\npling methods, which often results\
    \ in inadequate resource allocation and a reduction in\nproductivity. This is\
    \ in spite of the fact that farmers have been able to access continuous\nand detailed\
    \ information about their crops as a result of IoT technologies, enabling them\
    \ to\npractice precision agriculture [4].\nIn agriculture, IoT technologies have\
    \ the potential to offer a number of beneﬁts. As a\nﬁrst step, IoT enables farmers\
    \ to collect real-time data on the health and growth of their\ncrops, allowing\
    \ them to gain valuable insights about them. This allows for proactive inter-\n\
    vention and timely adjustments in irrigation, nutrient application, and pest management\n\
    strategies. Secondly, IoT technologies enhance the accuracy of yield prediction\
    \ models\nby capturing detailed data on environmental conditions, crop physiology,\
    \ and growth\npatterns [5]. Accurate yield prediction enables better planning\
    \ and resource allocation,\noptimizing overall agricultural productivity.\nMoreover,\
    \ IoT technologies facilitate resource management in agriculture by optimiz-\n\
    ing the use of water, energy, and fertilizers. By monitoring soil moisture, temperature,\n\
    and nutrient levels, IoT systems can provide precise recommendations for irrigation\
    \ and\nfertilization, reducing waste and the environmental impact [6]. Additionally,\
    \ IoT-based\nmonitoring can help to identify pest infestations and diseases at\
    \ early stages, enabling\ntargeted interventions and minimizing crop losses [4].\n\
    The Vision 2030 of Saudi Arabia aims to diversify the country’s economy and reduce\n\
    its oil dependence. Agri-food sustainability is the focus of the plan. The achievement\
    \ of\nthese goals will be dependent on technological advancements and innovations.\
    \ The Centre\nfor the Development of Agricultural Techniques (CDAT) is a research,\
    \ development, and\ntechnology adoption center established to promote agricultural\
    \ research, development, and\ntechnology adoption. In order to achieve this aim,\
    \ advanced farming techniques must be\nimplemented, water resources should be\
    \ conserved, and agricultural productivity must\nbe improved. AgTech Investments:\
    \ There has been a lot of investment in agricultural\ntechnology startups and\
    \ innovations in Saudi Arabia. A large portion of these investments\nare targeted\
    \ towards fostering technological advancements in various aspects of agricultural\n\
    production, such as crop monitoring and the optimization of yield.\nThe objective\
    \ of this research is to explore the perception and adoption of IoT tech-\nnologies\
    \ for crop monitoring among farmers in Jizan, Saudi Arabia. Jizan, located in\
    \ the\nsouthwestern region of Saudi Arabia, is known for its diverse agricultural\
    \ activities and\nis a prime area for investigating the potential of IoT technologies\
    \ in improving farming\npractices. By understanding the perceptions, challenges,\
    \ and adoption intentions of farmers\nin Jizan regarding IoT-based crop monitoring,\
    \ valuable insights can be gained to enhance\nthe implementation and effectiveness\
    \ of these technologies in the local agricultural context.\nA major objective\
    \ of this study is to determine how much awareness farmers in Jizan\nhave regarding\
    \ the use of IoT technologies for crop monitoring and what the level of\nawareness\
    \ is. What are the perceived beneﬁts associated with adopting these technologies?\n\

    \ and adoption of IoT\nSustainability 2023, 15, 14541\n3 of 19\ntechnologies for\
    \ monitoring crop health, growth, and yield prediction among farmers in\nJizan,\
    \ Saudi Arabia, by understanding the awareness, beneﬁts, and adoption intentions\
    \ of\nfarmers regarding IoT technologies in the region.\n2. Literature Review\n\
    In recent years, IoT technologies have gained substantial attention for crop monitoring\n\
    due to the fact that they have the potential to revolutionize agriculture by enabling\
    \ the\nprovision of real-time data on crop health, growth, and yield prediction\
    \ [7,8]. This emerging\nﬁeld offers promising opportunities for farmers to optimize\
    \ resource management, enhance\nproductivity, and make data-driven decisions for\
    \ sustainable farming practices. However,\nthe adoption and successful implementation\
    \ of IoT technologies in agriculture depend on\nmultiple factors that can vary\
    \ across different regions and contexts.\nIoT technologies have been shown to\
    \ have a number of beneﬁts in agriculture in\nprevious research. In the study\
    \ conducted by [7] in a different geographical context, it was\nfound that farmers\
    \ were able to collect precise and timely information about environmental\nfactors\
    \ such as soil moisture, temperature, and other elements through the use of IoT-based\n\
    monitoring systems. This enhanced data availability allowed farmers to optimize\
    \ irrigation\nschedules, resulting in improved water efﬁciency and increased crop\
    \ yields. Similarly,\nref. [8] emphasized the potential of IoT technologies in\
    \ crop yield prediction, demonstrating\ntheir ability to integrate data from multiple\
    \ sensors and provide accurate predictions for\ninformed decision-making.\nIn\
    \ Pathmudi et al. [9], IoT is considered a modern technology comprising physical\n\
    entities that communicate over the Internet with one another. The Internet of\
    \ Things is\neverywhere. Globally, connected systems/organizations are driving\
    \ the growth of IoT\ndevices [10]. Ref. [11] developed an irrigation management\
    \ system that uses the Internet of\nThings. There was a discussion of various\
    \ IoT architectures, deployment models, sensors,\nand controllers that are used\
    \ in agriculture today, cloud platforms for IoT, irrigation\nscheduling software,\
    \ and machine-learning algorithms that allow us to predict real-time\nirrigation\
    \ water demand in the future [12]. A system of automated monitoring of the\nsoil–plant–atmospheric\
    \ continuum at a high spatiotemporal resolution is being developed\nto replace\
    \ the current labor-intensive, experience-based methods of agricultural decision-\n\
    making with a data-driven approach based on data collected by automated monitoring\
    \ [13].\nIt is proposed to develop an Internet of Things (IoT) framework that\
    \ consists of wireless\nsensor networks with intelligent algorithms based on an\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT) approach\nthat increases food production while combating\
    \ climatic change [14]. An IoT system\ncould be used for agricultural automation\
    \ and could be governed by a variety of protocol\ncommunications that are used\
    \ to describe its rules. Several factors must be considered\nwhen analyzing parameters\
    \ such as the speed at which data are transferred, the mechanism\nby which data\
    \ are transferred, the encryption level, range, latency, and number of items\n\
    controlled when analyzing parameters.\nIt has been proven that agriculturalists\
    \ and farmers can take advantage of the Internet\nof Things (IoT) not only in\
    \ order to enhance the efﬁciency with which they are able to\ngrow crops and to\
    \ make them more proﬁtable but also to improve their post-harvest\nprocesses and\
    \ the end users’ experience with agricultural products [15]. Furthermore, one\n\
    of the most effective uses of the IoT for agriculture involves implementing technologies\n\
    such as drones for agriculture through the use of the IoT [16], remote sensing\
    \ [17], smart\ngreenhouses [18], smart livestock management [19], computer imaging\
    \ [20], and efﬁcient\nclimate monitoring [21] as indicated in Figure 1.\nSustainability\

    can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence farmers’ attitudes, awareness, and willingness to adopt\
    \ IoT\ntechnologies for crop monitoring and management.\nUnderstanding the speciﬁc\
    \ factors that inﬂuence the adoption intentions of farmers in\nJizan is crucial\
    \ for the successful implementation and utilization of IoT technologies in the\n\
    region’s agricultural sector. Factors such as farmers’ level of awareness, perceived\

    \ support play a\nsigniﬁcant role in shaping their attitudes towards adopting\
    \ these technologies. However,\nthe literature lacks empirical evidence and insights\
    \ into these factors in the context of Jizan.\nTo address this research gap, this\
    \ study aims to investigate the perception and adop-\ntion of IoT technologies\
    \ for crop monitoring among farmers in Jizan, Saudi Arabia. By\nconducting surveys\
    \ and analyzing the collected data, this research will provide valuable\ninsights\
    \ into the speciﬁc factors inﬂuencing farmers’ adoption intentions and inform\
    \ the\ndevelopment of strategies to promote the successful integration of IoT\
    \ technologies in\nJizan’s agricultural practices.\n2.2. Level of Awareness of\
    \ IoT Technologies in Agriculture\nIt has become increasingly apparent in recent\
    \ years that IoT technologies can be used\nfor improving agricultural productivity\
    \ and efﬁciency. IoT technologies offer numerous\nopportunities for enhancing\
    \ crop monitoring, improving productivity, and optimizing\nresource management\
    \ in the agricultural sector. This section discusses the evolving level\nof awareness\
    \ among farmers and stakeholders regarding the potential beneﬁts of IoT\ntechnologies\
    \ in agriculture.\nUsing IoT technologies, the authors of [8] argue that farmers\
    \ will be able to make\nmore informed decisions regarding the allocation of resources\
    \ in order to maximize crop\nhealth and growth during the growing season. The\
    \ study highlights the importance of\ncreating awareness among farmers about the\
    \ capabilities and beneﬁts of IoT technologies.\nSimilarly, [30] emphasize the\
    \ role of IoT-based crop growth monitoring systems in enabling\nfarmers to monitor\
    \ key parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, and nutrient levels,\nleading\
    \ to improved crop management practices.\nIn a survey conducted by [31], it was\
    \ found that a majority of farmers had some level\nof awareness regarding IoT-based\
    \ smart agriculture. However, the study also revealed\nvariations in awareness\
    \ levels across different regions and farm sizes. This suggests the\nimportance\
    \ of tailoring awareness campaigns and educational initiatives to speciﬁc contexts\n\
    and target groups.\nThe authors discuss the importance of bridging the digital\
    \ divide and ensuring equal\naccess to information and resources related to IoT\
    \ technologies in agriculture. They empha-\nsize the need to address technological\
    \ literacy and provide adequate training and support\nto farmers to enhance their\
    \ awareness and adoption of IoT solutions.\n2.3. The Adoption of IoT Technologies\
    \ in Agriculture\nThe adoption of IoT (Internet of Things) technologies in the\
    \ agricultural sector has\ngained signiﬁcant attention in recent years. Farmers\
    \ are increasingly recognizing the\npotential beneﬁts of using IoT technologies\
    \ for monitoring crop health, growth, and yield\nprediction. This section explores\
    \ the adoption of IoT technologies among farmers and\nhighlights key factors inﬂuencing\
    \ their adoption decisions.\nA study conducted by [32] among farmers in the United\
    \ States found that 70% of the\nrespondents were aware of IoT technologies and\
    \ expressed a positive attitude toward their\nadoption. This indicates a growing\
    \ interest and acceptance of IoT technologies among\nfarmers.\nThe adoption of\
    \ IoT technologies is inﬂuenced by various factors. One crucial factor\nis the\
    \ perceived beneﬁts of using these technologies. Research by [30] demonstrated\
    \ that\nfarmers perceive IoT technologies as beneﬁcial for the real-time monitoring\
    \ of crop health,\nenabling proactive decision-making and optimizing resource\
    \ allocation. The ability to\nSustainability 2023, 15, 14541\n6 of 19\nobtain\
    \ accurate and timely information about crop conditions and environmental factors\
    \ is\nseen as a signiﬁcant advantage of IoT technologies [33].\nHowever, there\
    \ are also challenges associated with the adoption of IoT technologies\nin agriculture.\
    \ Limited technical knowledge and skills to operate IoT devices have been\nidentiﬁed\
    \ as a barrier to adoption [34]. Farmers may require training and support to\n\
    effectively utilize IoT technologies in their farming practices. Additionally,\
    \ concerns about\ndata privacy and security pose challenges to adoption. Farmers\
    \ want assurance that their\ndata will be protected and not misused [2,35].\n\
    Government support plays a crucial role in facilitating the adoption of IoT technologies\n\
    in agriculture. Policies and initiatives that promote the use of IoT technologies\
    \ and provide\nﬁnancial incentives can positively inﬂuence farmers’ adoption decisions.\
    \ Research by [36]\nshowed that farmers who perceived strong government support\
    \ were more likely to adopt\nIoT technologies.\nMoreover, the availability of\
    \ information and training resources is vital for successful\nadoption. Farmers\
    \ need access to reliable and relevant information about IoT technologies,\ntheir\
    \ beneﬁts, and how to effectively implement them. Training programs and workshops\n\
    can enhance farmers’ understanding and competence in utilizing IoT technologies\
    \ for crop\nmonitoring [37–39].\n2.4. Perceived Beneﬁts of IoT Technologies\n\
    The perception of beneﬁts of IoT (Internet of Things) technologies in agriculture\
    \ plays\na signiﬁcant role in determining their adoption. Farmers are increasingly\
    \ recognizing the\npotential advantages that IoT technologies offer for monitoring\
    \ crop health, optimizing\nresource allocation, and improving overall agricultural\
    \ productivity.\nReal-time monitoring and data collection: One of the key perceived\
    \ beneﬁts of IoT\ntechnologies is the ability to monitor crop conditions and collect\
    \ data in real time. IoT de-\nvices equipped with sensors can provide farmers\
    \ with accurate and up-to-date information\nabout soil moisture levels, temperature,\
    \ humidity, and other environmental factors. There\nis a growing need for farmers\
    \ to be given access to data in real-time so that they can make\ngood decisions\
    \ regarding irrigation, fertilization, and pest control and thus improve crop\n\
    health and maximize resource utilization [30,33].\nProactive decision-making:\
    \ IoT technologies enable farmers to take a proactive ap-\nproach to agricultural\
    \ management. By continuously monitoring crop health and environ-\nmental conditions,\
    \ farmers can identify potential issues or anomalies early on and take\nnecessary\
    \ actions to mitigate risks. For example, if a sensor detects a sudden drop in\
    \ soil\nmoisture levels, the system can automatically trigger an irrigation schedule\
    \ adjustment or\nsend an alert to the farmer, allowing for prompt intervention\
    \ and preventing potential crop\ndamage [34].\nYield prediction and crop planning:\
    \ IoT technologies also contribute to yield pre-\ndiction and crop planning. Through\
    \ data analysis and machine-learning algorithms, IoT\nsystems can generate insights\
    \ and forecasts regarding crop yield potential. This information\nenables farmers\
    \ to plan their harvesting, storage, and marketing activities more effectively.\n\
    Additionally, yield prediction helps farmers estimate their future produce, allowing\
    \ for\nbetter ﬁnancial planning and decision-making [36].\n2.5. Willingness to\
    \ Adopt IoT Technologies\nThe willingness to adopt IoT (Internet of Things) technologies\
    \ is a critical factor in the\nsuccessful implementation and integration of these\
    \ technologies in the agricultural sector.\nThis section explores the factors\
    \ inﬂuencing farmers’ willingness to adopt IoT technologies\nand the potential\
    \ beneﬁts associated with their adoption.\nPerceived usefulness: Farmers’ perception\
    \ of the usefulness of IoT technologies sig-\nniﬁcantly inﬂuences their willingness\
    \ to adopt them. Studies have shown that farmers\nare more likely to adopt IoT\
    \ technologies when they perceive them as valuable tools that\ncan enhance their\
    \ farming practices and decision-making processes. The perceived useful-\nSustainability\
    \ 2023, 15, 14541\n7 of 19\nness of IoT technologies stems from their ability\
    \ to provide real-time data on crop health,\noptimize resource management, and\
    \ improve overall agricultural productivity [30,33].\nPerceived ease of use: The\
    \ perceived ease of use refers to farmers’ perception of\nhow easy it is to learn\
    \ and operate IoT technologies. Farmers are more likely to adopt\nIoT technologies\
    \ when they perceive them as user-friendly and accessible. Factors such\nas the\
    \ simplicity of the interface, ease of installation and maintenance, and availability\n\
    of training and technical support inﬂuence farmers’ perception of the ease of\
    \ use. User-\nfriendly IoT technologies increase farmers’ conﬁdence in their ability\
    \ to adopt and utilize\nthese technologies effectively [2,34].\n2.6. Access to\
    \ Information and Training, Perception of Government Support\nAccess to information\
    \ and training, as well as the perception of government support,\nare important\
    \ factors that inﬂuence farmers’ willingness to adopt IoT technologies in our\n\
    targeted area. Here, we explore the impact of these factors on farmers’ adoption\
    \ decisions\nbased on recent studies conducted from 2020 onward.\nAccess to information\
    \ and training: Farmers’ access to relevant information and train-\ning on IoT\
    \ technologies is crucial for their successful adoption. Studies have shown that\n\
    farmers who have access to comprehensive information and training programs are\
    \ more\nlikely to adopt and effectively use IoT technologies in their farming\
    \ practices. Accessi-\nble information channels, such as agricultural extension\
    \ services, workshops, seminars,\nand online resources, contribute to farmers’\
    \ understanding of the potential beneﬁts and\nfunctionalities of IoT technologies.\
    \ Training programs that provide hands-on experience\nand technical knowledge\
    \ further enhance farmers’ conﬁdence and competency in utilizing\nthese technologies\
    \ [8,40].\nPerception of government support: Farmers’ perception of government\
    \ support plays\na signiﬁcant role in their decision to adopt IoT technologies.\
    \ When farmers perceive that\nthe government actively supports the adoption and\
    \ implementation of IoT technologies\nin agriculture, they are more likely to\
    \ embrace these technologies. Government support\ncan take various forms, including\
    \ ﬁnancial incentives, subsidies, policy frameworks, and\nthe establishment of\
    \ dedicated support programs. The perception of government support\ncreates a\
    \ favorable environment for farmers, instilling conﬁdence and reducing potential\n\
    barriers to adoption. It also signals the government’s commitment to the modernization\
    \ of\nthe agricultural sector and the promotion of sustainable farming practices\
    \ [6,41].\nIn our targeted area, the availability of relevant and up-to-date information\
    \ on IoT\ntechnologies through government initiatives and agricultural extension\
    \ services is vital.\nFarmers should have access to training programs that provide\
    \ them with the necessary\nskills and knowledge to effectively use IoT technologies\
    \ for crop monitoring. Additionally,\nthe government should demonstrate a supportive\
    \ stance by offering ﬁnancial assistance,\nsubsidies, and policy measures that\
    \ incentivize the adoption of IoT technologies in agri-\nculture. These efforts\
    \ foster a positive perception of government support, encouraging\nfarmers to\
    \ embrace IoT technologies and integrate them into their farming operations [42].\n\
    2.7. Research Gap\nDespite the growing body of research on the use of IoT technologies\
    \ in agriculture,\nthere is still a notable gap when it comes to understanding\
    \ the perception and adoption of\nthese technologies among farmers in speciﬁc\
    \ regions, such as Jizan, Saudi Arabia. Most of\nthe existing studies have focused\
    \ on general discussions of IoT applications in agriculture\nor have examined\
    \ adoption patterns in different geographical contexts [8,43]. However, the\n\
    speciﬁc factors inﬂuencing the perception and adoption of IoT technologies in\
    \ the context\nof Jizan’s agricultural sector remain largely unexplored.\nJizan,\
    \ located in the southwestern region of Saudi Arabia, has its own unique agricul-\n\
    tural landscape, characterized by speciﬁc climatic conditions, crop varieties,\
    \ and farming\npractices. These contextual factors can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence farmers’\
    \ attitudes, awareness,\nand willingness to adopt IoT technologies for crop monitoring\
    \ and management. Therefore,\nSustainability 2023, 15, 14541\n8 of 19\nit is crucial\
    \ to conduct region-speciﬁc studies to bridge the gap in knowledge and provide\n\
    insights that are tailored to the needs and challenges faced by farmers in Jizan.\n\
    By conducting a focused investigation on the perception and adoption of IoT tech-\n\
    nologies for crop monitoring among farmers in Jizan, this study aims to ﬁll this\
    \ gap in\nthe literature. It is hoped that the ﬁndings will allow us to better\
    \ understand the speciﬁc\nfactors that inﬂuence the adoption intentions of farmers\
    \ in Jizan. These factors include the\nfarmers’ level of awareness, their perception\
    \ of the beneﬁts, and their perception of the\nchallenges associated with IoT,\
    \ as well as their perception of the government’s support.\nThis knowledge can\
    \ inform the development of targeted strategies and policies to promote\nthe successful\
    \ implementation and utilization of IoT technologies in Jizan’s agricultural\n\
    sector.\nObjective and Hypothesis\nObjective 1: To examine the association between\
    \ farmers’ level of awareness of IoT\ntechnologies and their perception of the\
    \ beneﬁts.\nHypothesis 1. There is a signiﬁcant association between farmers’ level\
    \ of awareness of IoT\ntechnologies and their perception of the beneﬁts.\nObjective\
    \ 2: To assess the inﬂuence of perceived beneﬁts of using IoT technologies for\n\
    crop monitoring on farmers’ willingness to adopt these technologies.\nHypothesis\
    \ 2. The perceived beneﬁts of using IoT technologies for crop monitoring have\
    \ a signiﬁ-\ncant and positive inﬂuence on farmers’ willingness to adopt these\
    \ technologies.\nObjective 3: To explore the inﬂuence of access to information\
    \ and training, as well as\nthe perception of government support, on farmers’\
    \ willingness to adopt IoT technologies.\nHypothesis 3. The access to information\
    \ and training and perception of government support have\na positive inﬂuence\
    \ on farmers’ willingness to adopt IoT technologies.\n3. Methodology\n3.1. Research\
    \ Design\nIt is the aim of this research study to identify the factors that inﬂuence\
    \ farmers in Jizan,\nSaudi Arabia, to adopt Internet of Things (IoT) technologies\
    \ for crop monitoring using the\nquantitative method as part of the research design.\
    \ In quantitative research, numerical data\nare collected and analyzed in a systematic\
    \ way, with the objective of testing hypotheses\nand drawing objective conclusions\
    \ based on the statistical analysis of the data.\n3.2. Sampling Technique\nAn\
    \ examination of a representative sample of farmers in Jizan was conducted by\
    \ using\na sampling technique based on stratiﬁcation. Based on relevant criteria\
    \ such as farm size,\nfarming experience, and geographic location, the population\
    \ of the study was divided\ninto distinct strata, which were categorized according\
    \ to relevant factors. To ensure that a\nproportionally representative sample\
    \ of each subgroup was selected, a random sampling\nalgorithm was used within\
    \ each stratum in order to select participants.\n3.3. Data Collection\nData were\
    \ collected through a structured questionnaire administered to the selected\n\
    sample of farmers. The questionnaire consists of multiple-choice and Likert scale\
    \ items\nto gather both demographic information and respondents’ perceptions,\
    \ attitudes, and\nbehaviors related to the adoption of IoT technologies for crop\
    \ monitoring. The questionnaire\nwas pre-tested with a pilot group of farmers\
    \ to ensure clarity and validity.\nSustainability 2023, 15, 14541\n9 of 19\n3.4.\
    \ Data Analysis\nTo address the research objectives and test the hypotheses that\
    \ have been proposed,\nthe collected data have been analyzed using appropriate\
    \ statistical methods. In order to\nsummarize the demographic information and\
    \ the responses from the participants, descrip-\ntive statistics such as frequencies\
    \ and percentages were used. Correlations, associations,\nand yield predictions\
    \ were all examined by using inferential statistical techniques, such as\nreliability\
    \ analysis, correlation tests, and regression analysis.\nAccording to methodology,\
    \ we aim to gather reliable and representative data that can\ncontribute to a\
    \ comprehensive understanding of the factors inﬂuencing the adoption of IoT\n\
    technologies for crop monitoring among farmers in Jizan, Saudi Arabia.\n4. Results\n\
    Descriptive statistics were calculated to provide an overview of a variety of\
    \ charac-\nteristics related to the demographics of the participants, as well\
    \ as their perceptions and\nbehaviors in relation to the use of the IoT for crop\
    \ monitoring technologies. Frequencies\nand percentages were computed to present\

    \ to Table 1, the study speciﬁcally targeted farmers in Jizan, Saudi Arabia, as\n\
    the primary respondents. The total number of questionnaires distributed to farmers\
    \ for\ndata collection was 550. Out of the 550 questionnaires distributed, 500\
    \ questionnaires were\nreturned by the farmers. These results indicate that there\
    \ was a high response rate among\nthe farmers, with 90.91% of the questionnaires\
    \ being returned and providing valuable data\nfor the study. This suggests a good\
    \ level of engagement and interest from the farmers in\nthe topic of using IoT\
    \ technologies for crop monitoring in Jizan, Saudi Arabia. According\nto [44],\
    \ 70% or more is considered to be a good response rate and the response rate can\
    \ be\nconsidered as being excellent if that rate is greater than 70%.\nAccording\
    \ to Table 2 and a graphical representation of demographics analysis, the\nsurvey\
    \ included 500 respondents, of which 68.8% were male and 31.2% were female. The\n\
    participation of both genders indicates a diverse representation among farmers\
    \ in Jizan,\nSaudi Arabia. Among the respondents, 21.5% had an undergraduate degree,\
    \ 54.0% were\ngraduates, 19.3% held a master’s degree, and 5.3% had a Ph.D. The\
    \ majority of farmers in\nthe study had attained higher levels of education, indicating\
    \ a potential correlation between\neducation and the adoption of IoT technologies.\
    \ The distribution of farming experience\nshows that 36.0% of respondents had\
    \ no prior farming experience. Among those with\nSustainability 2023, 15, 14541\n\
    10 of 19\nexperience, 32.8% had 1 to 3 years, 19.4% had 4 to 5 years, 10.0% had\
    \ 6 to 7 years, and\nonly 1.8% had more than 7 years of farming experience. The\
    \ ﬁndings suggest a mix of\nexperienced farmers and individuals relatively new\
    \ to farming, providing insights into the\nperspectives of both experienced and\
    \ novice farmers regarding IoT technology adoption.\nThe marital status of the\
    \ respondents indicates that 20.8% were single, 53.8% were married,\n20.2% were\
    \ divorced, and 5.2% were widowed. The diversity in marital status reﬂects the\n\
    varied life situations of farmers and allows for a comprehensive understanding\
    \ of different\nperspectives on IoT technology adoption. Among the surveyed farmers,\
    \ 68.8% of males\nand 31.2% of females have adopted IoT technologies. This ﬁnding\
    \ highlights a potential\ngender disparity in the adoption of IoT technologies\

    \ perceptions and adoption patterns regarding IoT technologies for\ncrop monitoring,\
    \ health assessment, growth tracking, and yield prediction.\nAccording to the\
    \ results in Table 3, the topic of using IoT technologies to monitor\ncrop health,\
    \ growth, and yield prediction exhibits a relatively moderate mean, a relatively\n\
    high variance and standard deviation, and a good level of internal consistency.\
    \ The high\nvariance and standard deviation indicate a signiﬁcant degree of variability\
    \ in the data, and\nthe good internal consistency suggests that the measured items\

    \ have an internal consistency of 0.872. As a result, all factors\nare internally\
    \ consistent with each other. In order to verify the reliability of a test, a\
    \ good\nmeasure is a Cronbach’s alpha value of 0.7 or higher, which, when using\

    \ (r = 0.835\n**) for Hypothesis 1, which examines the relationship between farmers’\
    \ level of awareness\nof IoT technologies and their perception of the beneﬁts\
    \ of using these technologies for crop\nmonitoring. The correlation coefﬁcient\
    \ of 0.835 ** indicates a strong positive correlation\nbetween farmers’ level\
    \ of awareness of IoT technologies and their perception of the beneﬁts\nassociated\
    \ with using these technologies for crop monitoring. This suggests that as farmers’\n\
    awareness of IoT technologies increases, their perception of the beneﬁts also\
    \ tends to\nincrease. The strength of the correlation coefﬁcient suggests that\
    \ there is a substantial\nrelationship between these two variables. The positive\
    \ correlation implies that farmers who\nhave a higher awareness of IoT technologies\
    \ are more likely to perceive greater beneﬁts\nfrom using these technologies for\
    \ crop monitoring. This ﬁnding supports the hypothesis\nthat there is a signiﬁcant\
    \ association between farmers’ level of awareness of IoT technologies\nand their\
    \ perception of the beneﬁts. It indicates that farmers who are more aware of IoT\n\
    technologies are more likely to recognize the advantages and positive outcomes\
    \ associated\nwith implementing these technologies in their crop monitoring practices.\n\

    \ no signiﬁcant evidence to suggest that the variances\nbetween the groups are\
    \ different from one another. Furthermore, there is no strong reason\nwhy the\
    \ null hypothesis should be rejected, as the assumption of homogeneity of variance\
    \ is\nmet. These results are considered good because they imply that the variability\
    \ within each\ngroup is relatively consistent, which makes it more appropriate\
    \ to use statistical methods\nthat assume equal variances, such as the analysis\
    \ of variance (ANOVA) or t-tests.\nAccording to the results in Table 6, the correlation\
    \ coefﬁcient (R) represents the strength\nand direction of the relationship between\
    \ the independent variable (perceived beneﬁts) and\nthe dependent variable (willingness\
    \ to adopt IoT technologies). In this case, the correlation\ncoefﬁcient is 0.458,\
    \ indicating a moderate positive correlation between the perceived bene-\nﬁts\
    \ and willingness to adopt IoT technologies. The coefﬁcient of determination (R\
    \ Square)\nexplains the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that\
    \ can be accounted for\nby the independent variable(s). In this model, the R Square\
    \ value is 0.210, which means\nthat approximately 21% of the variance in farmers’\
    \ willingness to adopt IoT technologies is\nexplained by the perceived beneﬁts.\
    \ The adjusted R Square is a calculation that takes into\naccount the number of\
    \ predictors that are included in a model and calculates the adjusted\nR Square\
    \ value accordingly. A more accurate R Square in this case is 0.209, which is\
    \ slightly\nlower than the standard R Square in this case. As a result, it is\
    \ suggested that when taking\ninto consideration the other variables in the model,\
    \ the perception of the beneﬁts alone\nexplains about 20.9% of the variance in\
    \ farmers’ willingness to adopt IoT technologies. The\nSustainability 2023, 15,\

    \ values have around\nthe predicted values, or how much scatter they have around\
    \ the observed values. The\nstandard error of the estimate of farmers’ willingness\

    \ the amount of variance in the dependent variable (farmers’ willingness to adopt\n\
    IoT technologies) that is explained by the predictors (access to information and\
    \ training,\nperception of government support). In this particular case, the regression\
    \ sum of squares is\n3180.032, which is a signiﬁcant value. The amount of unexplained\
    \ variance in a dependent\nvariable is represented by the residual sum of the\
    \ factor of the square. By using this method,\nwe can measure the difference between\
    \ the observed values and the values predicted by\nSustainability 2023, 15, 14541\n\
    14 of 19\nthe regression model based on the observed data. According to this equation,\
    \ the residual\nsum of squares is 13,495.416, which is a signiﬁcant value. In\
    \ order to calculate the variance\nin the dependent variable, the total sum of\
    \ squares must be calculated. The sum of squares\nis calculated based on the regression\
    \ sum of squares and the residual sum of squares. This\nmeans that the total sum\
    \ of the squares is 16,675.448 in this case. There are degrees of\nfreedom that\
    \ serve as a measure of the amount of independent information that can be\ngathered\
    \ for estimation. In the regression model, the degrees of freedom for the predictors\n\
    are two, which is the number of predictors (access to information and training,\
    \ perception\nof government support). The degrees of freedom for the residual\
    \ are 497, which is the total\nnumber of observations minus the number of predictors.\
    \ The mean square is calculated by\ndividing the sum of squares by the degrees\
    \ of freedom. It represents the average amount\nof variance. The F statistic is\
    \ the ratio of the mean square for regression to the mean\nsquare for the residual.\
    \ It indicates whether the regression model as a whole is statistically\nsigniﬁcant.\
    \ In this case, the F statistic is 58.556. As a result of the F statistic, you\
    \ will be able\nto determine the signiﬁcance level (p-value). In other words,\
    \ it represents the probability of\nobtaining an observable F value by chance\

    \ the variance\nin farmers’ willingness to adopt IoT technologies. The predictors\
    \ collectively contribute\nsigniﬁcantly to the model, as indicated by the F statistic\
    \ and the associated p-value.\nTable 11 details the estimated coefﬁcients, standard\

    \ (access to information and training, percep-\ntion of government support) within\
    \ the regression model for Hypothesis 3 based on the\nestimation coefﬁcients.\
    \ In the case when all predictor variables have a zero value, the\nconstant term\
    \ represents the estimated intercept. There is a constant term in this case of\n\
    5.493. As a result, the t-value for the study is 3.682 with a p-value of 0.001,\
    \ indicating a\nstatistically signiﬁcant result. In terms of access to information\
    \ and training, there is a\ncoefﬁcient of 0.763. For the purpose of the analysis,\
    \ we are trying to estimate how much a\none-unit increase in AIT will affect farmers’\

    \ for a one-unit increase in AIT. This coefﬁcient has a\nt-value of 9.112 and\
    \ a p-value of 0.001 which indicates that the coefﬁcient is statistically\nsigniﬁcant.\
    \ This standardized coefﬁcient (Beta) of 0.387 suggests that the adoption of IoT\n\

    \ A coefﬁcient\nof 0.194 has been found for the perception of government support\

    \ of increasing farmers’ awareness of IoT technolo-\ngies in order to enhance\
    \ their perception of the beneﬁts and promote the adoption of these\ntechnologies\
    \ for effective crop monitoring. The perceived beneﬁts of using IoT technologies\n\
    for crop monitoring (PBIT) have a moderate positive relationship with farmers’\
    \ willingness\nto adopt these technologies. However, it is important to note that\
    \ the perceived beneﬁts\nalone explain only a portion of the variance in the willingness\
    \ to adopt, and there may\nbe other factors inﬂuencing farmers’ adoption behavior\
    \ that are not accounted for in the\ncurrent model. The ANOVA table indicates\
    \ that the regression model with the perceived\nbeneﬁts of using IoT technologies\
    \ (PBIT) as the predictor variable explains a signiﬁcant\namount of variability\
    \ in farmers’ willingness to adopt these technologies. The p-value\n(<0.001) suggests\
    \ that the relationship between the perceived beneﬁts and willingness\nSustainability\
    \ 2023, 15, 14541\n16 of 19\nto adopt IoT technologies is statistically signiﬁcant.\
    \ Overall, these ﬁndings support the\nsecond hypothesis, indicating that the perceived\
    \ beneﬁts of using IoT technologies for crop\nmonitoring have a signiﬁcant and\
    \ positive inﬂuence on farmers’ willingness to adopt these\ntechnologies. The\
    \ results suggest that highlighting the advantages and positive outcomes\nof using\
    \ IoT technologies can enhance farmers’ motivation to adopt them in their crop\n\
    monitoring practices.\nThe predictors (access to information and training, perception\
    \ of government support)\nhave a moderate positive relationship with farmers’\
    \ willingness to adopt IoT technologies,\nand they collectively explain a signiﬁcant\
    \ proportion of the variance in the dependent\nvariable. The regression model,\
    \ which includes the predictors (access to information and\ntraining, perception\
    \ of government support), is statistically signiﬁcant in explaining the\nvariance\
    \ in farmers’ willingness to adopt IoT technologies. The predictors collectively\n\
    contribute signiﬁcantly to the model, as indicated by the F statistic and the\
    \ associated\np-value. Overall, the coefﬁcient table provides information about\
    \ the estimated effects of\nthe predictors on farmers’ willingness to adopt IoT\
    \ technologies. The signiﬁcant coefﬁcients\nindicate that both access to information\
    \ and training and the perception of government sup-\nport have a positive inﬂuence\
    \ on farmers’ willingness to adopt IoT technologies, although\nthe effect of access\
    \ to information and training (AIT) is relatively stronger compared to the\nperception\
    \ of government support (PGS).\n6. Conclusions\nThe purpose of this study is to\
    \ make contributions to the understanding of how farmers\nperceive IoT technologies\
    \ and their adoption for crop monitoring among themselves. The\nﬁndings shed light\
    \ on the roles of these technologies in enhancing agricultural practices\nand\
    \ emphasize the need for further research and support in promoting their effective\n\
    implementation in the agricultural sector. The discoveries of the study show the\
    \ importance\nof increasing farmers’ awareness of IoT technologies to enhance\
    \ their perception of the\nbeneﬁts and promote the adoption of these technologies\
    \ for effective crop monitoring. The\nperceived beneﬁts of using IoT technologies\
    \ for crop monitoring have a moderate positive\nrelationship with farmers’ willingness\
    \ to adopt these technologies. However, it is important\nto note that the perceived\
    \ beneﬁts alone explain only a portion of the variance in the\nwillingness to\
    \ adopt, suggesting the presence of other factors inﬂuencing farmers’ adoption\n\
    behavior that were not accounted for in the current model. The predictors, namely\
    \ access to\ninformation and training and the perception of government support,\
    \ also have a moderate\npositive relationship with farmers’ willingness to adopt\
    \ IoT technologies. Collectively,\nthese predictors explain a signiﬁcant proportion\
    \ of the variance in farmers’ willingness to\nadopt. The regression model including\
    \ these predictors is statistically signiﬁcant, indicating\ntheir inﬂuence on\
    \ farmers’ adoption behavior.\n6.1. Decision\nAccording to the results, it is\
    \ recommended that IoT technologies be promoted to\nfarmers and highlighted for\
    \ the beneﬁts associated with their use. Agricultural IoT tech-\nnology beneﬁts\
    \ and practical applications can be explained to farmers through targeted\ninformation\
    \ dissemination and training programs. IoT technologies should also be im-\nproved\
    \ to ensure farmers have access to information and training to adopt and use these\n\
    technologies effectively. Additionally, government initiatives and policies can\
    \ foster a\nsupportive environment for IoT adoption among farmers. Farmers’ adoption\
    \ behavior\nmay not be captured by the current model. IoT technologies in agriculture\
    \ should be\nexplored further in future research. These variables include economic\
    \ considerations, social\ndynamics, and technological infrastructure.\nAs a result\
    \ of the study, we conclude that the key drivers of the adoption of IoT tech-\n\
    nologies for crop monitoring in Jizan, Saudi Arabia include raising awareness,\
    \ promoting\nperceived beneﬁts, and providing access to information and training.\
    \ To improve crop\nSustainability 2023, 15, 14541\n17 of 19\nhealth, growth, and\
    \ yield prediction, policymakers, agricultural extension agencies, and\ntech providers\
    \ can use these ﬁndings to develop strategies and interventions.\n6.2. Future\
    \ Recommendations\n1.\nIn-depth analysis of other factors: Conduct further research\
    \ to explore and under-\nstand additional factors that may inﬂuence farmers’ adoption\
    \ behavior towards IoT\ntechnologies in crop monitoring. Consider variables such\
    \ as economic viability, social\ndynamics, technological infrastructure, and regulatory\
    \ contexts. This will offer a more\ncomprehensive considerate of the barriers\
    \ and drivers of adoption.\n2.\nLongitudinal studies: Conduct longitudinal studies\
    \ to track the adoption of IoT\ntechnologies over time among farmers in Jizan,\
    \ Saudi Arabia. This will help to\nidentify trends, challenges, and opportunities\
    \ associated with long-term adoption,\nas well as to assess the impact of IoT\
    \ technologies on crop health, growth, and yield\nprediction.\n3.\nTailored training\
    \ programs: Develop and implement tailored training programs for\nfarmers in Jizan,\
    \ Saudi Arabia, focusing on building their skills and knowledge related\nto IoT\
    \ technologies. These programs should be designed to address speciﬁc challenges\n\
    and opportunities in the local context, making them more effective in promoting\n\
    adoption and maximizing the beneﬁts of IoT technologies in crop monitoring.\n\
    4.\nCollaboration and partnerships: Foster collaboration and partnerships among\
    \ key\nstakeholders, including farmers, agricultural extension agencies, technology\
    \ providers,\nand government entities. Such collaborations can help in knowledge\
    \ sharing, capacity\nbuilding, and the co-development of IoT solutions that are\
    \ relevant and practical for\nthe local agricultural sector.\n5.\nFinancial support:\
    \ Explore ﬁnancial support mechanisms, such as subsidies, grants,\nor loans, to\
    \ assist farmers in the adoption of IoT technologies. Financial incentives\ncan\
    \ help to alleviate the initial investment costs associated with acquiring IoT\
    \ devices\nand implementing the necessary infrastructure, thus encouraging more\
    \ farmers to\nadopt these technologies.\n6.\nDemonstration farms: Establish demonstration\
    \ farms or pilot projects in Jizan, Saudi\nArabia, where farmers can observe and\
    \ learn ﬁrsthand about the beneﬁts and prac-\ntical applications of IoT technologies\
    \ in crop monitoring. These farms can serve as\nliving examples to showcase the\
    \ effectiveness and economic viability of IoT solutions,\nencouraging other farmers\
    \ to adopt similar practices.\n7.\nPolicy and regulatory frameworks: Develop supportive\
    \ policies and regulatory frame-\nworks that facilitate the adoption and integration\
    \ of IoT technologies in agriculture.\nThis can include standards for data privacy\
    \ and security, streamlined approval pro-\ncesses for IoT devices, and policies\
    \ promoting open data sharing for research and\ninnovation.\nBy implementing these\
    \ recommendations, stakeholders can contribute to the broader\nadoption of IoT\
    \ technologies in crop monitoring in Jizan, Saudi Arabia, ultimately leading to\n\
    improved agricultural practices, enhanced productivity, and sustainable farming\
    \ systems.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, F.A.R., A.J., A.H., M.U.,\

    Get rights and content Highlights • The base concepts of soil water balance (SWB)
    models using the dual Kc approach are discussed. • The use of SWB, transient state,
    and crop growth and yield models is discussed. • The SIMDualKc model is taken
    as example and various extensions of the dual Kc are presented. • Trends for real
    time irrigation are discussed, including remote and proximal sensing data assimilation.
    • Future trends are analysed from the perspective of using remote sensing and
    cloud data. Abstract This study reviews soil water balance (SWB) model approaches
    to determine crop irrigation requirements and scheduling irrigation adopting the
    FAO56 method. The Kc-ETo approach is discussed with consideration of baseline
    concepts namely standard vs. actual Kc concepts, as well as single and dual Kc
    approaches. Requirements for accurate SWB and appropriate parameterization and
    calibration are introduced. The one-step vs. the two-step computational approaches
    is discussed before the review of the FAO56 method to compute and partition crop
    evapotranspiration and related soil water balance. A brief review on transient
    state models is also included. Baseline information is concluded with a discussion
    on yields prediction and performance indicators related to water productivity.
    The study is continued with an overview on models development and use after publication
    of FAO24, essentially single Kc models, followed by a review on models following
    FAO56, particularly adopting the dual Kc approach. Features of dual Kc modeling
    approaches are analyzed through a few applications of the SWB model SIMDualKc,
    mainly for derivation of basal and single Kc, extending the basal Kc approach
    to relay intercrop cultivation, assessing alternative planting dates, determining
    beneficial and non-beneficial uses of water by an irrigated crop, and assessing
    the groundwater contribution to crop ET in the presence of a shallow water table.
    The review finally discusses the challenges placed to SWB modeling for real time
    irrigation scheduling, particularly the new modeling approaches for large scale
    multi-users application, use of cloud computing and adopting the internet of things
    (IoT), as well as an improved wireless association of modeling with soil and plant
    sensors. Further challenges refer to the use of remote sensing energy balance
    and vegetation indices to map Kc, ET and crop water and irrigation requirements.
    Trends are expected to change research issues relative to SWB modeling, with traditional
    models mainly used for research while new, fast-responding and multi-users models
    based on cloud and IoT technologies will develop into applications to the farm
    practice. Likely, the Kc-ETo will continue to be used, with ETo from gridded networks,
    re-analysis and other sources, and Kc data available in real time from large databases
    and remote sensing. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Crop

    use assessmentSIMDualKc model 1. Introduction The current imbalance between water
    demand and supply in agriculture has driven the search for new equilibria through
    adopting modern technologies and management tools to optimize irrigation water
    use (Pereira et al., 2009; Pereira, 2017; Jovanovic et al., 2020). The successful
    use of these tools depends, however, upon their adaptation to prevailing social,
    economic, institutional, climatic, soil and other environmental conditions. Reducing
    the vulnerability of agriculture to climate change, and ultimately decreasing
    the risks associated to food security, requires integrated and sustainable water
    management, including the adaptation of cropping systems and management practices
    adopting an efficient use of both rainfall and irrigation water. The need for
    such sustainable water management practices is particularly critical considering
    the steady increase of global population and the limitations on availability of
    natural resources, particularly in vulnerable agricultural areas where water scarcity
    is of great importance (Smith, 2000; Pereira, 2017). Sustainable water management
    at farm level assumes an enormous relevance, namely in terms of adopting adequate
    irrigation schedules, that should lead to optimal yields and agricultural and
    irrigation practices that allow reducing but optimizing water use, particularly
    non-beneficial ones (Pereira et al., 2009, 2012; Jovanovic et al., 2020). Numerous
    irrigation scheduling simulation models have been produced and made available
    to support irrigation decision-making since the 80’s as reported in various international
    conferences (ASAE, 1981, 1985, 1990; Feyen, 1987; Pereira et al., 1992, 1995;
    Ragab et al., 1996; Smith et al., 1996). The reported irrigation scheduling models
    were often based upon crop evapotranspiration and yield-water relations proposed
    in FAO manuals 24 and 33 (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977; Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979).
    Reported soil water balance (SWB) models include steady state and transient state
    models. Steady state models solve the law of conservation of mass within a selected
    time step, generally a day, while transient state models contain the time variable
    explicitly and computations refer to the fluxes of water within and through the
    boundaries of the control volume of soil. The latter, highly exigent in terms
    of data and using mechanistic approaches to simulate soil water processes, often
    include mechanistic sub-models to simulate plant growth, predict crop yields as
    influenced by various environmental factors, and to assess the transport of salt,
    chemicals and pollutants that impact farm water use and sustainability. Steady
    state SWB models are less exigent in terms of parameterization and, when properly
    calibrated, are very accurate and easier to use for irrigation scheduling, as
    well as to assess the impact of changing environmental conditions on crops evapotranspiration
    and yield, which may be predicted when the model is associated to, or incorporates
    yield-water functions. A variety of tools, namely using hyperspectral reflectance
    data (Melton et al., 2012; Campos et al., 2017; Pôças et al., 2017; Saadi et al.,
    2018), can be used to support improved irrigation scheduling. More commonly, remote
    sensing vegetation indices may be used in combination with ground data after integration
    in current SWB model approaches (Olioso et al., 2005; Er-Raki et al., 2007; Santos
    et al., 2008; Vazifedoust et al., 2009; Pôças et al., 2015; Thorp et al., 2015;
    Corbari et al., 2019), although adopting a variety of data and integrative solutions.
    The current paper is focusing on steady state SWB simulation models having a known
    software and, mainly, when adopting the FAO56 method to determine ETc from the
    reference ETo and a crop coefficient. Particular attention is given to models
    that adopt the dual Kc approach due to the relevance of determining transpiration
    and soil evaporation, the former consisting of the beneficial consumptive use
    of water. Considering the vast panoply of innovation tools that support sustainable
    water use on farms, the overarching aim of this paper is to provide a review of
    the advances gained in modelling with the FAO56 method in the past two decades.
    The specific objectives of this paper are: (a) to discuss simple approaches to
    steady state water balance modelling in contrast with transient state, mechanistic
    soil water, crop growth and yield models; (b) to provide for an overview on models/software
    used to improve irrigation scheduling and management, with focus on dual Kc modelling
    with consideration of water scarcity and saving; c) to show examples of model
    applications and water use assessment based on the SIMDualKc model; and d) to
    analyze current trends and opportunities, focusing particularly on real time irrigation
    scheduling using modern information technologies. This article consists of various
    Sections. After the current Introduction, Section 2 refers to main concepts and
    calculation approaches of the FAO56 method and includes discussions on the one-step
    approach, transient state modeling, crop growth and yield prediction, and water
    use indicators. Section 3 presents an overview of SWB models aimed at improving
    irrigation scheduling and management, and Section 4 focuses on the dual Kc approaches
    taking the SIMDualKc model as an example for adopting and extending the use of
    the FAO56 dual Kc approach. Section 5 discusses real time irrigation scheduling
    and latest developments, namely related to the applications of remote sensing
    and internet platforms aimed at multi-users, while Section 6 presents the main
    conclusions and future trends. 2. Reference concepts 2.1. Crop evapotranspiration,
    crop water requirements and irrigation requirements The FAO56 method (Allen et
    al., 1998) uses the simple Kc-ETo approach to determine crop evapotranspiration
    as the product of a crop coefficient (Kc) and the grass reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) computed with the FAO Penman-Monteith equation (PM-ETo). The PM-ETo equation
    is derived from the Penman-Monteith (PM) combination equation (Monteith, 1965)
    when it was parameterized for the standard grass reference crop (Allen et al.,
    1994a,b, 1998). As analyzed in the next Section, the PM equation is often used
    for direct calculation of crop ET. The FAO56 method adopted the concept of standard,
    optimal crop conditions as the basis for tabularizing the Kc values, which consisted
    of a main difference to the previous FAO24 method (Pereira et al., 2015a). Thus,
    Kc and ETc in FAO56 refer to potential crop ET rates under optimal, well-watered
    crop production conditions, which often differ from the field and common practice
    where crop conditions are often not optimal due to insufficient or non-uniform
    irrigation, low crop density, less adequate soil and agronomic management and/or
    salinity. The tabulated Kc values in FAO56 or in the review papers (Jensen and
    Allen, 2016; Pereira et al., 2020a,b,d) refer to the standard climate and need
    to be adjusted to the local climate (eqs. 62 and 65 of FAO56). The potential ETc
    as computed from standard Kc values is then replaced by the actual crop ET, ETc
    act, and the standard Kc are replaced by the actual Kc act values, with Kc act
    =Ks Kc where Ks is a stress coefficient due to water deficiency or salinity effects,
    and that can be extended to other cultivation stresses. The concept of dual Kc
    was also adopted in addition to the traditional single one. The single Kc represents
    averaged soil evaporation (Es) and crop transpiration (Tc) from a cropped surface
    for typical frequencies of wetting. However, as noted by in the review by Pereira
    et al. (2015a), the single Kc only represents typical conditions that can vary
    with the wetting frequency by precipitation and irrigation, with the type of irrigation
    practiced and with crop management, namely the inter-row management in row crops.
    Adopting the concept of dual crop coefficient, Kc= Kcb+ Ke, where Kcb is the basal
    crop coefficient representing primarily plant transpiration and Ke is the evaporation
    coefficient that represents the contribution of evaporation from soil to total
    ET, the variation of both Es and Tc are considered independently. In view of this,
    the partition of ETc or ETc act into both these components as proposed by FAO56
    (Allen et al., 1998, 2005a) allows to better represent field and management issues
    when acting differently on Es and Tc. The two stage evaporation model of Ritchie
    (1972) is adopted for the calculation of Ke, which implies performing an independent
    water balance of the evaporation top layer of the soil. The FAO56 method is dealt
    in detail with the very recent reviews and updates of the single and basal crop
    coefficients (Pereira et al., 2020a through d). These reviews also focused on
    the accuracy of diverse ET measurement methods, namely the measurement of changes
    of soil water, eddy covariance, Bowen ratio energy balance, sap-flow, and remote
    sensing vegetation indices (Allen et al., 2011b; Pereira et al., 2020a,b). Crop
    water requirements (CWR, mm) consist of the seasonal amount of water required
    by a crop to achieve its potential production under a given environment. CWR correspond
    to the seasonal potential crop ET (ETc, mm) and added the seasonal leaching requirement
    (LR, mm) required to control effects of soil and water salinity in case of cropping
    in saline soils or when using salty water (including treated wastewater). LR is
    herein considered as part of the CWR given the importance for the crop yield and
    the soil environment to adopt appropriate salinity control. Salinity effects and
    related water management control measures were recently reviewed and discussed
    by Minhas et al. (2020). The net irrigation requirements (NIR, mm) consist of
    the amount of water that needs to be applied to the crop to fully satisfy its
    CWR when the water available through precipitation (P, mm), capillary rise (CR,
    mm) and soil water storage variation (SWvar, mm) are insufficient. NIR relative
    to the crop season, or to any selected time period, is given by the soil water
    balance as: (1) NIR = CWR – (P + SWvar + CR) + DP + RO where, in addition to variables
    previously defined, DP is deep percolation from the soil root zone (mm) and RO
    is runoff (mm), with all variables referring to the time period considered for
    the computation. The gross irrigation requirements (GIR, mm) for any time step
    is given as: (2) where BWUF is the beneficial water use fraction of the applied
    irrigation water (Pereira et al., 2012). BWUF is commonly referred as application
    efficiency when referring to the field, or combined conveyance, distribution and
    application efficiency when considering the operational losses in the conveyance
    and distribution canal and/or conduits systems in addition to application on the
    farm (Burt et al., 1997; Bos et al., 2005; Heermann and Solomon, 2007). 2.2. Computing
    the crop evapotranspiration: the one-step vs. the two-step approaches The Penman-Monteith
    combination equation (Monteith, 1965) may be used for computing crop ET as a one-step
    approach contrarily to the FAO56 method that adopts the two-step Kc-ETo product
    referred above. With the Penman-Monteith combination equation (PM-eq), crop ET
    is computed using the aerodynamic and bulk surface resistances of the crop; differently,
    with the FAO method crop ET is given as the product of the grass reference ET
    (ETo) by the crop coefficient (Kc). Kc represents the integrated differences between
    the considered crop and the reference crop in terms of aerodynamic and bulk surface
    resistances. ETo is derived from the PM combination equation parameterized for
    the grass reference crop. The Penman-Monteith combination equation (Monteith,
    1965) is generally written as (3) where λ is the latent heat of vaporization [MJ
    kg −1], Rn-G is the net balance of energy available at the surface [MJ m-2 d-1],
    (es-ea) represents the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) of air at the reference (weather
    measurement) height [kPa], ρ is mean air density [kg m-3], cp is specific heat
    of air at constant pressure [MJ kg-1 °C-1], Δ represents the slope of the saturation
    vapor pressure-temperature relationship at mean air temperature [kPa °C-1], γ
    is the psychometric constant [kPa °C-1], rs is the bulk surface resistance [s
    m-1], and ra is the aerodynamic resistance [s m-1]. The transfer of heat and vapor
    from the evaporative surface into the air in the turbulent layer above a canopy
    is determined by the aerodynamic resistance ra between the surface and the reference
    level above the canopy. That transfer is determined by the wind speed, the height
    of wind speed, air temperature and air humidity measurements, as well as crop
    height and canopy architecture (Perrier, 1982). The surface resistance rs for
    full-cover canopies is often expressed as a function of the stomatal resistance
    of a well-illuminated leaf (rl) and of the effective leaf area index (LAIeff).
    The use of the PM-eq for prediction of crop water requirements is difficult because
    crop height and canopy architecture change throughout the crop cycle, thus changing
    the framework for computing ra and rs, which also changes with rl, thus with leaf
    age and water availability conditions, as well as with LAIeff. In addition, for
    the same crop, ra and rs are influenced by differences among varieties, and crop
    management and irrigation practices. Moreover, resistances rl and rs are influenced
    by the climate and water availability, with rs increasing when soil water availability
    limits ET, the VPD increases and ra is higher; rs decreases when the energy available
    at the surface increases. According to Alves et al. (1998) and Alves and Pereira
    (2000), rs may be expressed as dependent of ra and of the weather variables as
    (4) where β is the Bowen ratio (the ratio between the sensible and latent heat
    fluxes). In this equation β plays the role of a water-stress indicator. This equation
    illustrates that the weather variables interact and their influences are inter-dependent,
    which adds to the difficulties in appropriately selecting rs, thus creating challenges
    in applying the PM-eq or “multi-layer” resistance equations such as the two-source
    Shuttleworth and Wallace (SW) equation (Shuttleworth and Wallace, 1985). Various
    applications of the PM-eq (Eq. 3) are reported in the literature and they show
    that the SWB is not required to consider water stress impacts since the parameterization
    of Eq. 3 takes into account the water stress, e.g. through the consideration of
    stomatal conductance or predawn leaf water potential (Rana et al., 1997, 2001;
    Zhang et al., 2011). However, Ortega-Farias et al. (2004, 2006) performed the
    adjustment to water stress using a normalized soil water factor, similar to the
    stress coefficient Ks described in the next Section, which computation requires
    a simple SWB. A few studies compared the PM-eq with the Kc-ETo approach (Lovelli
    et al., 2008; Irmak and Mutiibwa, 2009). The accuracy of ET estimates depends
    upon the parameterization of the PM-eq. The one-step PM and SW equations are excellent
    for ET simulation but they are basically used in research, while the two-step
    Kc-ETo is used both in research and to support field practice as per the recent
    reviews by Pereira et al. (2020a,b) and Rallo et al. (2020). The PM-eq (Eq. 3)
    is the base for the PM-ETo equation (Allen et al., 1994a,b, 1998), which for daily
    time steps computation takes the form (5) where, in addition to variables defined
    for Eq. (3), T is mean daily air temperature [°C] and u2 is wind speed [m s−1],
    with measurements at 2 m height. This represents a hypothetical crop with an assumed
    height of 0.12 m having a surface resistance of 70 s m−1 and an albedo of 0.23,
    closely resembling an extensive surface of green grass of uniform height, actively
    growing and adequately watered. This equation is also parameterized for hourly
    time steps (Allen et al., 2006). Kc represents an integration of the effects of
    three primary characteristics that distinguish the crop from the reference: crop
    height (affecting roughness and aerodynamic resistance); crop-soil surface resistance
    (related to leaf area, fraction of ground covered by vegetation, leaf age and
    condition, degree of stomatal control, and soil surface wetness); and albedo of
    the crop-soil surface (influenced by the fraction of ground covered by vegetation
    and soil surface wetness). It is defined through the ratio between potential crop
    evapotranspiration (ETc) and the reference ETo, thus (6) Kc = ETc/ETo The challenge,
    therefore, has been to summarize all referred differences relative to the PM-eq
    (Eq. 3) between the considered crop and the reference crop to just one parameter,
    Kc. Although, it was demonstrated (Pereira et al., 1999) that Kc values relate
    intimately with the ratios between ra and rs of the considered crop and the reference
    crop, which makes Kc a non-purely empirical parameter but a deterministic one.
    Though when using the two-step approach to compute crop ET, it is possible to
    achieve highly accurate estimation of crop ET, close to the accuracy obtained
    with the one-step PM-eq, despite the high requirements of the latter in terms
    of parameterization (Ortega-Farias et al., 2006; Lovelli et al., 2008; Irmak and
    Mutiibwa, 2009). 2.3. Soil water balance: the FAO56 method With the objective
    of managing irrigation in the day to day practice, instead of Eq. 1, the daily
    soil water balance applied to the entire root zone (Allen et al., 1998, 2007)
    may be expressed through computing the soil water depletion at the end of every
    day (Dr,i, mm), which is given as: (7) where Dr,i-1 is the root zone depletion
    at the end of previous day i-1 (mm), Pi is precipitation (mm), ROi is runoff (mm),
    Ii is the net irrigation depth that infiltrates the soil (mm), CRi is capillary
    rise from the shallow groundwater table (mm), ETc act,i is the actual crop evapotranspiration
    (mm), and DPi is deep percolation through the bottom of the root zone (mm), with
    all terms referring to day i. ETc act refers to both optimal and suboptimal crop
    and irrigation conditions, i.e., under full or deficit irrigation and/or diverse
    cropping practices. Solving the water balance equation (Eq. 7) requires soil water
    content observations (or their estimation from observed soil matric potential),
    which allow to estimate the root zone depletion Dr. A computational algorithm
    is required to perform a daily SWB, which is based upon the knowledge of soil
    hydraulic properties, the field capacity and wilting point ( FC and θWP, m3 m−3)
    of various soil layers down to the bottom of the root zone. To estimate runoff,
    deep percolation and capillary rise, appropriate algorithms are required as discussed
    by Liu et al. (2006) and Allen et al. (2007). RO, DP and CR cannot be just estimated
    when an accurate SWB is to be performed, thus appropriate computational approaches
    are required, including simple spreadsheet applications to just support irrigation
    scheduling. ETc act is computed as: (8) ETc act=Ks Kc ETo = (Ks Kcb + Ke) ETo
    which requires knowing the standard values of Kc and/or Kcb and the daily estimation
    of the stress coefficient Ks, as well as the adjustment to climate of standard
    Kc mid, Kc end, Kcb mid and Kcb end values (eqs. 62 and 65 of FAO56). Kc ini and
    Kcb ini values have to be determined as recommended by Allen et al. (1998, 2005a,2005b).
    Indicative Kc and Kcb values are tabulated by Allen et al. (1998), Allen and Pereira
    (2009), Jensen and Allen (2016) and updated by Pereira et al. (2020a,b) and Rallo
    et al. (2020). FAO56 expressed Ks as a linear function of root zone depletion
    Dr when depletion exceeds the readily available water, RAW (mm), in the root zone,
    thus: (9a) (9b) where TAW and RAW are, respectively, the total and readily available
    soil water (mm), and p is the soil water depletion fraction for no stress (Allen
    et al., 1998). TAW is defined as the available soil water stored in the root zone
    with depth zr (m), thus computed as 1000 (θFC - θWP) zr, and RAW corresponds to
    the readily available portion of TAW, thus RAW = p TAW. Updated values for the
    p fractions for vegetable and field crops are tabulated by Pereira et al. (2020a,
    b). The value for Ks due to salinity stress is discussed in FAO56 (Allen et al.,
    1998) and in the review paper by Minhas et al. (2020). Referring to Eq. 9, it
    may be deduced that when no water stress occurs (Ks = 1.0) then θ≥θp, i.e. the
    soil water content is not below the threshold θp, which corresponds to the soil
    water content when the soil water depletion equals the depletion fraction p for
    no stress [0 - 1]. Therefore, θp is assumed as the soil water content threshold
    for no-stress or full irrigation: (10a) A management allowed depletion (MAD) larger
    than p is selected when deficit irrigation is adopted, i.e., when the depletion
    fraction exceeds p. The respective soil water threshold is then θMAD < θp: (10b)
    Examples on using these thresholds are given in Section 4.4. When adopting the
    dual Kc approach, it is required to separately compute Kcb and Ke and two SWB
    are required, the one relative to the root zone for computing transpiration, the
    other relative to the top soil layer, from where evaporation occurs, to compute
    soil evaporation. A spreadsheet calculator was provided in Annex 8 of FAO56 (Allen
    et al., 1998). The computation of Ke is based upon the assumption that evaporation
    from the soil is governed by the amount of water available in the upper soil layer
    from where water evaporates, and the amount of energy available at the soil surface.
    The latter depends upon the portion of wetted ground surface exposed to radiation
    and the portion of total energy consumed by transpiration. Ke is then calculated
    as: (11) where Kr is the evaporation reduction coefficient [0-1], few is the fraction
    of soil surface wetted and exposed to solar radiation, Kcb is the basal crop coefficient
    representing transpiration, and Kc max is the maximum value for Kc following rain
    or irrigation (Allen et al., 1998, 2005a). Kc max depends upon mid-season climate,
    through the wind speed u2 (m s−1) and the minimum relative humidity RHmin (%),
    and upon crop height h (m): (12) where u2 = 2 m s−1 and RHmin = 45 % characterize
    the standard climate (Allen et al., 1998). The depth of water depleted from the
    few fraction of soil wetted and exposed (De, mm), is computed from the daily water
    balance of the upper 0.10 to 0.15 m of the soil as (13) where the subscript i
    refers to the day of estimation, Pi is the precipitation [mm], ROi is runoff [mm],
    Ii is the net irrigation depth [mm] that infiltrates the soil in the wetted fraction
    fw, (Ke ETo/few)i is the evaporation from the few fraction of the exposed soil
    surface [mm], and Ts i is the transpiration from the fw fraction of the evaporating
    soil layer [mm]. When De exceeds the readily evaporable water (REW), the evaporation
    rate decreases in proportion to the remaining water. Therefore, Kr (Eq. 11) is
    calculated as: (14a) (14b) where REW and TEW are respectively the readily and
    total evaporable water in the soil evaporation layer of depth ze (m), which depend
    upon the soil textural and hydraulic characteristics of that soil layer. Further
    details on the water balance of the evaporation layer are discussed by Allen et
    al. (1998, 2005a) and Rosa et al. (2012a, b). When the complete soil surface is
    fully wetted by precipitation or irrigation, the fraction few consists of the
    fraction of ground non-shaded by the vegetation (1-fc), thus few p = 1-fc, where
    fc is the average fraction covered by vegetation [0 – 1.0]. When only a fraction
    of the soil surface is wetted by irrigation, few i = min (1-fc, fw). These differences
    in few, thus in few Kc max (Eq. 11), evidence that it is required to compute separately
    Ke for the cases when rainfall and irrigation fully wet the ground, or when irrigation
    only partially wets the soil, e.g. under drip or furrow irrigation. Different
    few fractions then occur. A weighing coefficient for partitioning the energy available
    for soil evaporation depending upon fc and fw (Allen et al., 2005a, b; Rosa et
    al., 2012a) eases the daily Ke computation. The fraction fc should be observed
    in the field as reviewed by Pereira et al. (2020c); otherwise, it may be estimated
    according to Allen et al. (1998) as: (15) where Kc min is the minimum Kc for dry,
    bare soil, generally 0.15. The exponent "1 + 0.5 h" represents the effect of plant
    height on shading the soil and increasing the Kcb given a specific value for fc.
    (Kcb - Kc min) ≥ 0.01 for numerical stability. Eq. 11 is the base for partitioning
    ET. On the one hand, it shows that when the crop develops, from the initial to
    the mid-season stage, Kcb increases and the difference Kc max-Kcb therefore decreases,
    as well as the fraction few since fc also increases. Therefore, Ke decreases as
    much as Kcb and fc increase. Contrarily, during the late season Ke increases because
    Kcb and fc decrease. The rates of Kcb and fc variation, thus of Ke decrease or
    increase, change from a crop to another and with the management practices, with
    Kcb varying also with water and salinity stress (Ks, Eq. 9). On the other hand,
    Ke varies with the water amount available for evaporation, which depends upon
    Kr with the irrigation method and frequency of irrigation. The advantage of the
    adopted approach results from combining the variation of Kcb and Ke and adopting
    Kc max as the upper limit for Kcb+Ke. Therefore, there is the need for performing
    daily the water balance of the soil evaporation layer in addition to the root
    zone water balance, which increases the accuracy of computations. A discussion
    comparing the ET partition using the FAO56 dual Kc approach with that used in
    the popular AquaCrop model has been presented by Pereira et al. (2015b), which
    highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the FAO56 dual Kc approach. As referred
    by DeJonge and Thorp (2017), reported results with maize and cotton have shown
    that crop coefficient simulations with the dual “ETo-Kcb method better mimicked
    theoretical behavior, including spikes in the soil evaporation coefficient (Ke)
    due to irrigation and rainfall events and basal crop coefficient response as associated
    with simulated crop growth.” Consequently, the FAO56 approach has been implemented
    with the DSSAT Crop System Model (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017). 2.4. Soil water balance:
    transient state models Mechanistic approaches to the SWB commonly compute variably-saturated
    water flow as described by Richards’ equation: (16) where θ is the volumetric
    soil water content [L3 L−3], t is time [T], z is the vertical space coordinate
    [L], h is the pressure head [L], K is the hydraulic conductivity [L T−1], and
    S is the sink term accounting for water uptake by plant roots [L3 L−3 T−1]. The
    unsaturated soil hydraulic properties are often described with the van Genuchten-Mualem
    functional relationships (van Genuchten, 1980). These relationships require appropriate
    calibration. The sink term, S, may be calculated using the Feddes et al. (1978)
    approach where the potential transpiration rate, Tp [L T−1], is distributed over
    the root zone using the normalized root density distribution function, β(z,t)
    [L−1], and multiplied by the dimensionless stress response function, α(h, hϕ,
    z, t), that accounts for water and osmotic stresses. In HYDRUS-1D (Šimünek and
    Hopmans, 2009; Ramos et al., 2011) we have: (17) where Sp(z,t) and S(h, hϕ, z,
    t) are the potential and actual volumes of water removed from unit volume of soil
    per unit of time [L3 L−3 T−1], respectively, and α(h, hϕ, z, t) is a prescribed
    dimensionless function of the soil water (h) and osmotic (hϕ) pressure heads (0≤α≤1).
    The actual transpiration rate, Ta [L T-1], is obtained by integrating Eq. (13)
    over the root domain LR: (18) It is generally assumed that the potential root
    water uptake is reduced when water stress occurs due to deficit irrigation and/or
    osmotic potential resulting from soil salinity or the use of saline irrigation
    waters. While the Richards’ equation is commonly adopted in a variety of models,
    the sink term may be different from a model to another. For solving the Richards’
    equation, the formulation of the boundary conditions may be diverse. In SWAP (Vazifedoust
    et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2013), the upper boundary condition is determined by
    the fluxes of potential evapotranspiration computed with the PM-eq (Eq. 3). The
    model does not use the FAO56 method but it allows computing the actual Kc (Xu
    et al., 2013). Differently, with HYDRUS, the Kc-ETo approach is often used to
    define the potential ET flux at the upper boundary (Ramos et al., 2011); alternatively,
    Ramos et al. (2012) used the sum Kcb-ETo and Ke-ETo with Kcb and Ke obtained with
    a dual Kc partition tool. Transient state models may be calibrated purposefully
    for scheduling irrigation under selected conditions, e.g. the model SWB-2D for
    drip irrigated hedgerow orchards (Annandale et al., 2003). Transient state models
    usually perform the partition of ETc act with reference to the crop leaf area
    index (LAI), particularly when knowing its maximum values, LAImax. Because transient
    state models focus on the accurate simulation of water fluxes within and through
    the boundaries of the soil root zone, these models accurately compute DP and CR
    and, often also RO. When applied to rice, they can also simulate water depth in
    the paddies (Bhadra et al., 2013). These models may be used to parameterize steady
    state SWB models, e.g. the WAVE model was used to define the parametric DP and
    CR equations adopted in the model ISAREG (Liu et al., 2006) and later in SIMDualKc.
    Transient state models, since they are mechanistic models that accurately simulate
    the dynamics of transpiration, are commonly integrated with crop growth and yield
    models, e.g. SWACROP (Kabat et al., 1992) and SWATRER-SUCROS (Xevi and Feyen,
    1992). Currently, coupling of transient state and crop growth and yield models
    is commonly adopted, e.g. WOFOST and HYDRUS-1D (Zhou et al., 2012) or SWAP and
    EPIC (Xu et al., 2013). The advantage of transient state models is that soil water
    processes can be accurately described mechanistically, e.g. infiltration and water
    redistribution, root water uptake, deep percolation and capillary rise. However,
    the inputs of soil hydraulic properties, such as the soil water retention and
    permeability curves (respectively θ(h) and K(h) curves), are much more exigent
    than for simpler SWB models in terms of data acquisition and θ(h) and K(h) calibration.
    Often, the inverse model simulation needs to be adopted for their calibration
    before application. In addition, the vegetation parameters needed are much more
    complex than for FAO56-based SWB models. Therefore, these models are hard to parameterize
    and calibrate resulting more suitable for agronomic and irrigation research, and
    when assessing nitrates, chemicals and salinity dynamics in relation to crop growth
    and yield. Differently, the SWB models adopting the FAO56 methods are easier to
    use and appropriate to support practical irrigation scheduling and planning, as
    well as to assess the performance of irrigation management options. Along this
    line, the crop simulation models DSSAT-CSM, which basically require an accurate
    prediction of transpiration to predict biomass and yield accurately, recently
    adopted the FAO56 approaches (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017), namely the grass reference
    ETo and the FAO56 dual Kc approach. 2.5. Crop yields prediction and performance
    indicators for irrigation scheduling Knowledge of yield responses to water is
    required to construct irrigation scheduling models, namely aiming at developing
    appropriate irrigation schedules that cope with the variability of climatic conditions,
    water availability limitations, and the need to improve yields and economic returns.
    Crop growth models may then be used to predict biomass and yields in combination
    with predicted or assessed crop and irrigation management practices. The DSSAT-CSM
    models are often used for assessing yields when comparing irrigation management
    options (DeJonge et al., 2012; Thorp et al., 2014). By recently adopting the FAO56
    Kcb-ETo approach (Thorp et al., 2017), their use for assessing irrigation management
    options resulted easier to interpret. The crop growth and yield SWB AquaCrop (Raes
    et al., 2016) is also commonly used but, contrarily to the DSSAT models, its approach
    to calculating ET diverges from the FAO56 method. Another approach consists of
    coupling a crop model with a transient state model. e.g. WOFOST and HYDRUS-1D
    (Zhou et al., 2012) or SWAP and EPIC (Xu et al., 2013). These models may be very
    demanding in terms of parameterization and input data, but they are suitable when
    dealing with complex hydrologic and water quality conditions. Simple yield prediction
    approaches, such as the one by Jensen (1968), consist of a multiplicative parametric
    function that combines the effects of limited soil water on yield at various crop
    growth stages. Hanks (1974) developed the model PLANTGRO assuming that total dry
    matter production is directly proportional to the seasonal transpiration. For
    grain yield predictions, Hanks (1974) adapted the Jensen (1968) model and developed
    a multi-stage model (Hanks and Hill, 1980), while Stewart et al. (1977) assumed
    a linear dependence of the relative yield deficit from the relative evapotranspiration
    deficit, which is described as: (19) where Ky is the yield response factor, Ya
    and Ym are, respectively, the actual and maximum (potential) yields (kg ha−1),
    and ETc act and ETc are, respectively, the actual and potential crop evapotranspiration
    (mm) corresponding to the yields Ya and Ym. Ym may be observed or estimated. ETc
    act and ETc may be observed or computed with a SWB model. Ky values are tabulated
    for a wide range of crops (Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979) and they were updated recently
    (Minhas et al., 2020). Stewart et al. (1977) also proposed a multiple linear phasic
    model to account for the effects of water deficit during the vegetative, flowering
    and maturation stages using specific yield response factors (βi) for each stage
    i, which were tabulated by Doorenbos and Kassam (1979). Considering that transpiration
    is the ET component directly responsible for yield formation, and that various
    models perform the partition of ET, hence estimating transpiration, a modified
    version of Stewart’s model (Paredes et al., 2014) may be used to estimate Ya:
    (20) where Tc act and Tc are, respectively, the seasonal actual and potential
    crop transpiration (mm), thus replacing ET in Eq. (19). Research has shown that
    both Stewart’s global and phasic models predict yields with appropriate accuracy
    for evaluating irrigation schedules, namely when using Eq. (20) with Tc act data
    computed with the SIMDualKc model. Fig. 1a shows that maize yield predictions
    with Eq. (20) match well the yields observed in experiments carried out in both
    Portugal and Uruguay (Paredes et al., 2014; Giménez et al., 2016), and Fig. 1b
    shows a similar match of soybean yields relative to experiments developed in China
    and Uruguay (Wei et al., 2015; Giménez et al., 2017). Download : Download high-res

    (b0 - regression coefficient of a linear regression forced to the origin; R2 –
    coefficient of determination of the ordinary least squares regression, RMSE –
    root mean square error, NRMSE – normalized root mean square error). Water scarcity
    and global change lead irrigation water use to essentially aim at increased water
    productivity, water conservation and water saving. Water conservation refers to
    every policy, managerial measure, or user practice that aims at conserving or
    preserving the water resources and combating its degradation, namely focusing
    on its quality, while water saving aims at limiting or controlling the water demand
    and use, thus avoiding wastes and the misuse of water (Pereira et al., 2012; Pereira,
    2017). A comprehensive analysis on water conservation and saving measures and
    practices for a variety of agricultural uses was presented by Pereira et al. (2009,
    2012) and Jovanovic et al. (2020). Water productivity in agriculture (WP, kg m−3),
    also known as water use efficiency, may be generically defined as the ratio between
    the actual crop yield achieved (Ya) and the corresponding water use, which may
    refer to the total water use (TWU), hence including rainfall, to the irrigation
    water use (IWU), to the consumptive use (ETc act), or just to crop transpiration
    (Tc act). Therefore, different indicators result to assess diverse irrigation
    scheduling scenarios: (21) (22) (23) (24) where P is rainfall, CR is capillary
    rise or groundwater contribution, ΔSW is the variation in soil water storage in
    the root zone from planting to harvesting, I is the amount of irrigation, ETc
    act is the actual crop evapotranspiration, and Tc act is the actual crop transpiration,
    all expressed in m3 and referring to the crop season. Ya in Eqs. (21) through
    (24) may be observed, or may be estimated with a crop growth and yield model or
    with a simple water-yield parametric function as reported above. The meaning of
    indicators in Eqs. (21), (22), (23), (24) is necessarily different and indicators
    should be selected considering the actual farming objectives, the respective implications
    in terms of resource, environment and climate change, and the data availability.
    An application of similar WP concepts to olive orchards, including a related economic
    analysis, was recently discussed by Fernández et al. (2020). Improving WP could
    lead to water saving in irrigation but it requires the consideration of various
    factors. WP may be increased by minimizing the non-beneficial water uses such
    as percolation through the bottom of the root zone, runoff out of the irrigated
    fields, and losses by evaporation and wind drift in sprinkling. A high WP could
    be attained when increasing yields but, often, a higher WP is obtained when the
    crop is deliberately under-irrigated, thus when water stress is allowed in some
    less-sensitive crop stages; nevertheless, a yield reduction will then occur. 3.
    Overview of models aimed at improved irrigation scheduling 3.1. Soil water balance
    simulation models from FAO24 to FAO56 Many models have been proposed since the
    early 1980’s following the publication of FAO24 (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977),
    which has been the landmark in the domain of crop water requirements and irrigation
    scheduling. Model papers considered herein limit to those having an identified
    software, adequate reference to calibration and/or validation, and not referring
    to single uses only. In addition, since the objectives of the current review refer
    to FAO56 with focusing on the dual Kc approach and considering that transient
    state models are dealt in Section 2.4, the reviewed SWB refer to models using
    a Kc approach, mainly referring to FAO24 and to FAO56. Numerous SWB models have
    been developed since the 1980’s as early reviewed by Lascano (1991). Related articles
    were often presented in research reports or to scientific conferences (ASAE, 1981,
    1990; Feyen, 1987; Pereira et al., 1992, 1995; Smith et al., 1996; Ragab et al.,
    1996). These articles show a great variety of approaches, using the FAO Kc-ETo
    and/or transient state models, which received the preference of researchers by
    that time (Belmans et al., 1983). Developments also included landscape and turf
    grass irrigation. ETo equations were diverse because FAO24 (Doorenbos and Pruitt,
    1977) proposed various alternative equations. Howell et al. (1990) presented a
    first application of the Penman-Monteith grass reference equation proposed by
    Allen et al. (1989) when a commonly used ETo equation was the Penman equation.
    Without a common ETo definition and equation, standard Kc values could not be
    defined despite a consolidated set of Kc values was presented in FAO24 (Doorenbos
    and Pruitt, 1977) for numerous field, vegetable and woody crops. These authors
    proposed the well-known segmented FAO Kc curve but various curvilinear approaches
    were in use (e.g., Wright, 1982; HiIl, 1991). However, the segmented Kc curve
    was adopted by several authors (Howell et al., 1990; Combre and Kamieniarz, 1992;
    Teixeira and Pereira, 1992). Single Kc models of the 80’s and 90’s were often
    developed for application at farm level and evolved to support farm irrigators’
    communities. A first model has been developed with CIMIS, the California Irrigation
    Management Information System (Snyder, 1986), which keeps evolving nowadays and
    is based on a large grid of weather stations and a very large number of users
    (https://cimis.water.ca.gov/ accessed on 27 May 2020) and partners. Among the
    latter is the Satellite Irrigation Management Support framework (SIMS, Melton
    et al., 2012, 2020). The model CROPWAT (Smith, 1988, 1992) is paradigmatic since
    it consisted of a database built from FAO24 data (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977),
    a supplementary CLIMWAT weather database, a reference ET calculator and a water
    balance computational tool able to propose an irrigation scheduling calendar for
    the selected crop, soil and field. The model was updated after the FAO experts
    consultation on crop water requirements (Smith et al., 1991) and the publication
    of FAO 56, and has been successively upgraded. The version CROPWAT 8.0 has been
    recently released. BIdriCo (Danuso et al., 1995) is updated and is operating with
    real time weather data to support irrigation farmers of the Friuli Venezia Giulia
    region, Italy. IRRICANNE is an irrigation scheduling simulation model (Combre
    and Kamieniarz, 1992) designed to support sugarcane producers and was used for
    many years in the Island of Reunion. The model RENANA (Giannerini, 1995) was applied
    to support farmers irrigation scheduling in the Emilia-Romagna Region and evolved
    to a large-scale web based DSS, IRRINET, in use by farmers of various regions
    of Italy (Mannini et al., 2013), as well as to support irrigation water delivery
    (Genovesi et al., 2019). Three models early reported - IRSIS (de Goes Calmon et
    al., 1992), ISAREG (Teixeira and Pereira, 1992) and PILOTE (Mailhol et al., 1996)
    - were designed for both research and application in the field practice. IRSIS
    (Raes et al., 1988) was modified to produce BUDGET (Raes et al., 2006) that was
    further developed with extensions for improved water balance and yield assessment
    (Shrestha et al., 2010), then becoming the SWB basis of the crop model AquaCrop
    (Raes et al., 2016). ISAREG adopted the PM-ETo equation following the FAO Expert
    Consultation that decided its adoption (Smith et al., 1991). ISAREG was first
    modified to support real time farmers advising with the development of RELREG
    (Teixeira et al., 1995), later turning into a web based DSS, WEBISAREG (Branco
    et al., 2005), and developing GIS facilities, HYDROGEST (Mateus et al., 2007).
    However, since the Irrigation Associations did not develop local support to farmers,
    the model was used essentially for research after adoption of computational tools
    relative to DP, CR and salinity (Pereira et al., 2007, 2009). It is currently
    used in several countries, e.g. Brazil (Saraiva et al., 2017), Bulgaria (Popova
    et al., 2014) and China (Zheng et al., 2014). Meanwhile, ISAREG was the base of
    SIMDualKc (Rosa et al., 2012a), described in the next Section. PILOTE software
    has been continuously improved and it became a crop model with various capabilities
    including irrigation and crop management (Mailhol et al., 2004, 2018). CADSM (Walker
    et al., 1995) was the first distributed SWB model aimed at computing the aggregated
    irrigation demand at the command area of a collective irrigation system using
    the Kc-ETo approach. It was also one of the first models using the PM-ETo equation
    after it was proposed to a wide audience (Allen et al., 1994a,b). Similarly, the
    combined use of the ISAREG model and the paddy basins simulation model IRRICEP
    (Paulo et al., 1995) was adopted to simulate the demand hydrographs at the sector
    level in a collective irrigation system using the FAO methods (Teixeira et al.,
    1996). Buchleiter (1995) presented the model SCHED for scheduling irrigations
    with a center-pivot system. However, this type of approach is currently replaced
    by precision irrigation software, namely variable rate scheduling with support
    of wireless sensors (e.g. O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012). Hess (1996) reported on
    a microcomputer irrigation-scheduling model to be available for farmers since
    they were progressively adopting such computing facilities; however, with changes
    in hardware the approach was abandoned. The SIMDSS (Malano et al., 1996) was developed
    for practical irrigation scheduling and improved surface irrigation practices
    aimed at an integrated real-time management for pastures in SE Australia. MARKVAND
    was a DSS system for farmers use in Denmark, which software provides information
    on timing and volumes of irrigation as well as on the expected economic returns
    (Plauborg et al., 1996). Changes in technologies led to abandon these type of
    models. Models including the partitioning of ET into transpiration and soil evaporation
    were rare. The first was reported by Wright (1982) but his pioneer approach aimed
    at deriving Kcb when soil water evaporation could be considered nil, i.e. the
    soil surface was dry but transpiration was near optimal. The approach applied
    well to infrequent water applications but not to highly frequent wettings; however,
    data reported by this author have been fundamental in developing the FAO56 dual
    Kc approach (Allen et al., 1998). Tuzet et al. (1992) developed an approach where
    ET partition was supported by the observed LAI. Many researchers lately followed
    a LAI approach for partitioning ET. Further developments in using a dual Kc were
    initiated after publication of FAO56, mainly using its spreadsheet for calculation
    of Kcb and Ke, which still is used at present. A first SWB model relative to paddy
    rice using the Kc-ETo approach, the IRRICEP model, was reported by Paulo et al.
    (1995). The model required not only the calibration of Kc values but the calibration
    of soil hydraulic properties determining the computation of percolation adopting
    a Darcy approach, as well as lateral seepage to downstream paddies and drainage
    ditches. That model was later used by Mao et al. (2004) adopting the PM-ETo equation.
    Singh et al. (2001) modified the model SAWAH to adopt the Kc-ETo approach and
    a partition of actual crop ET based upon an empirical exponential function of
    LAI. Agrawal et al. (2004) developed a Visual Basic SWB model where the Kc-ETo
    is used, seepage is computed with the Dupuit approach and percolation is determined
    with a soil water simulation using partial differential equations distinguishing
    water ponded conditions and unsaturated conditions when intermittent irrigation
    is used. Transient state approaches for the ponded and the unsaturated conditions
    were also used by Khepar et al. (2000) when modeling intermittent paddy irrigation.
    A different approach is reported by Jeon et al. (2005), who developed PADDIMOD.
    In this model, surface drainage and percolation are estimated with parametric
    equations, which require parameters calibration. These referred models, despite
    posterior to the publication of FAO56, did not adopt the PM-ETo equation but FAO24
    equations. 3.2. Soil water balance simulation models after FAO56 This review focused
    only on SWB simulation models using the FAO56 Kc-ETo approach and which calibration
    and validation procedures are recognizable. Many other publications on SWB models
    not using the Kc-ETo method and not adopting the PM-ETo equation were not considered.
    The selected SWB models are presented in Table 1 for those using the single time
    averaged Kc, while Table 2 refers to the SWB models using the FAO56 dual Kc approach
    (see Section 2.3 above) or a similar approach where LAI replaces fc. Table 1.

    are used: Csalt – Salt concentration in the soil solution; ECe – Electrical conductivity
    of the soil saturation extract; ETsalt – Actual crop evapotranspiration affected
    by salinity; Ksat – Soil hydraulic conductivity at saturation. Abbreviations:
    n/r – not reported; seep – seepage. Single Kc models in Table 1 are diverse in
    terms of the target crops; these can be single annual crops, e.g. maize, wheat,
    cotton or paddy rice, or various annuals and/or perennials. They have in common
    the use of the FAO56 PM-ETo equation, in some cases also considering alternative
    temperature based methods, and the use of the stress coefficient Ks (Eq. 9), including
    modifications for paddies water balance. Models have a variety of base input parameters.
    Soil base parameters commonly include θFC and θWP, but θsat and Ksat may also
    be included when deep percolation and capillary rise are among the model outputs.
    Only one model (ISAREG) uses the input of electrical conductivity of the soil
    saturation extract (ECe, dS m−1) to compute the ET reduction due to salinity (ETsalt)
    as described in FAO56 and by Minhas et al. (2020). All reported models were calibrated
    and validated, generally using SWC data, a few using ETc act or Tc act (Consoli
    et al., 2016; Mancosu et al., 2016), and the ponded water depths in case of paddy
    rice (de Silva and Rushton, 2008; Inthavong et al., 2011). The model outputs are
    diverse but all models, in addition to ET, provide DP estimates. Several models
    also compute RO but CR is only provided by few models (Pereira et al., 2003; Shang
    and Mao, 2006; Chopart et al., 2007; Boegh et al., 2009; Consoli et al., 2016).
    Paddy water models outputs refer to the ponded water and to DP, seepage and drainage.
    References to the possible use of remote sensing data are very limited. SWB models
    using the dual Kc approach are referred in Table 2. As for single Kc models, they
    are diverse in terms of the target crops but most of them can be used with both
    annual and perennial crops. A few refer to annuals or only to specific crops (wheat,
    maize, groundnuts and paddy rice). All use the PM-ETo equation and the stress
    coefficient Ks (Eq. 9), including those modified for paddies. Models have a variety
    of base soil input parameters. Soil parameters commonly include θFC and θWP, a
    few θsat and Ksat, and some models (Annandale et al., 1999; Ragab, 2002) also
    have a transient state approach and require θ(h) and K(θ). Salinity base data
    on ECe are used in the AQUACROP and SIMDualKc models, while SALTMED and “SWB”
    use the salt concentration in the soil water. Models are calibrated and validated
    with SWC data but some models may be calibrated with ETc act or Tc act data (Rosa
    et al., 2012a, b; Campos et al., 2016); when they also predict actual yields,
    Ya data may also be used for calibration (Ragab, 2002; Raes et al., 2012). Model
    outputs are diverse but all models, in addition to ETc act and Tc act, provide
    for DP while a few also compute RO. The computation of CR is only available from
    the models SALTMED, AquaCrop, SIMDualKc and the model reported by Han et al. (2018).
    The paddy rice model RiceWCA (Yang et al., 2012) outputs are different from those
    referred before and include the predicted applied water, DP, seepage, and tail
    water runoff. A few models refer to the possibility of using remote sensing-retrieved
    data. This review recognized that few models are able to compute groundwater contribution
    from a water table as well as impacts of salinity. DSSAT crop models using Kc-ETo
    with the dual Kc approach (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017) could be added in Table 2
    but they are very different from the listed models and rarely used for irrigation
    scheduling. Farmers’ information models commonly using Kcb values derived from
    remote sensing vegetation indices, such as SIMS (Melton et al., 2012, 2020; Cahn
    and Johnson, 2017), consist also of a peculiar group of dual Kc models that require
    mention. For selecting the best crop irrigation schedules, the SWB models adopt
    user-friendly software that helps the users to handle data and, often, to compute
    indicators such as those referred in Section 2.5. Performance scenarios may be
    the object of ranking, e.g. when DSS approaches adopt multi-criteria analysis
    as discussed by Darouich et al. (2014, 2017), namely when the selection of irrigation
    schedules is tied to the performance of the irrigation method. However, the use
    of multi-criteria analysis is rare in irrigation scheduling and, commonly, only
    simple comparisons of indicators are used (Paredes et al., 2014, 2017a,b; Pereira
    et al., 2015b). 4. The dual Kc soil water balance approach using the model SIMDualKc
    4.1. Brief presentation of the model SIMDualKc is a quite unique software model
    that performs a daily soil water balance at the field scale (Rosa et al., 2012a,b)
    adopting the dual Kc approach to compute and partition crop ET into Tc and Es.
    Data inputs and model outcomes are described in Fig. 2 where the flowchart of
    the model is presented. In general, compulsory data inputs are common to other
    SWB models that adopt the FAO56 dual Kc approach, although requirements may change
    with the type of algorithms used in computations. Facultative data differ depending
    upon the specific objectives of the simulation. This is the case for data used
    to compute runoff, deep percolation, groundwater contribution, as well as effects
    of mulches and no-till planting, active ground cover, intercropping, and soil
    and water salinity. Naturally, model outcomes also differ depending on the modelling
    objectives. Download : Download high-res image (919KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Simplified flowchart of SIMDualKc model (modified from Rosa et al.,
    2012a). Model calibration consists of adjusting the influential model parameters
    within their reasonable ranges so that the model results are consistent with available
    observed data, thus estimation errors are minimized. The process of validation
    permits the verification of the goodness of fitting when the model is used with
    the set of calibrated parameters but with different, independent data sets, without
    tuning such parameters. Calibration and validation of models and appropriate goodness-of-fit
    indicators are a must for every model as discussed by several authors (e.g., Moriasi
    et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2012) and by Pereira et al. (2015b) relative to SIMDualKc.
    The calibration parameters of SIMDualKc consist of: Kcb and p relative to the
    various crop growth stages; Ze, TEW and REW characterizing the soil evaporation
    layer; the parameter CN relative to the runoff algorithm; and the parameters relative
    to the DP and CR parametric functions. Initial sets of these parameters are inputs
    to the model, which are improved through calibration. Soil water content observations
    are the most commonly used for calibration, e.g. Fandiño et al. (2012, 2015) for
    a vineyard and for hop for industry, Zhao et al. (2013) for maize and wheat, Wu
    et al. (2016) for a groundwater dependent grassland, and Paredes et al. (2017a)
    relative to pea for industry. Calibration may also be performed by comparing observed
    eddy covariance ET with model computed ETc act for field crops (Zhang et al.,
    2013; Tian et al., 2016) and citrus orchards (Peddinti and Kambhammettu, 2019),
    or by comparing observed sap-flow transpiration data with simulated Tc act (Paço
    et al., 2012, 2019; Qiu et al., 2015). Descriptions of the calibration and validation
    processes are provided in the cited applications. Various methods may be used
    to estimate accurately actual crop ET as reviewed by Allen et al. (2011b) and
    Pereira et al. (2020a,b). Methods include the measurement of the soil water content
    for deriving ET from the SWB, the measurement of ETc act using eddy covariance
    (EC) or Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB) systems, as well as the measurement
    of Tc act with sap-flow systems. All these methods are potentially very accurate
    as point measurements, and the EC and BREB are used in such a way that their footprint
    may span a relatively large area representative of the vegetation. EC is receiving
    the preference of many ET users, but measurements of the soil water content (SWC)
    and sap-flow continue to be largely used. Fig. 3a shows the comparisons of simulated
    and observed seasonal SWC data of a wheat crop used to calibrate SIMDualKc, and
    Fig. 3b shows a similar comparison of simulated wheat ETc act with EC observed
    data, both obtained at the same location in North China plain (Zhang et al., 2013;
    Zhao et al., 2013). The goodness-of-fit indicators resulted similar, i.e. there
    was no advantage of one calibration over the other, which means that a user may
    select the most convenient approach to calibrate a model if measurements of SWC,
    ETc act or Tc act are accurately performed. Download : Download high-res image

    vs. observed soil water content (adapted from Zhao et al., 2013) and (b) simulated
    vs. observed ETc act (adapted from Zhang et al., 2013). 4.2. Deriving crop coefficients
    Deriving Kcb and Kc from SWB simulations is a main capability of SWB models, e.g.
    SALTMED (Silva et al., 2012), which is quite common for vegetable and field crops
    as reported in recent reviews (Pereira et al., 2020a,b); however, it is uncommon
    for fruit trees and vines. In the case of evergreen trees and vines, a full crop
    coefficient curve requires that, in addition to the Kc and Kcb for the initial,
    mid-season and end-season, the Kc and Kcb values for the non-growing period are
    also known. Moreover, due to climate differences between the growing and non-growing
    seasons, the Kc and Kcb curves may be substantially different. Nevertheless, there
    are various examples of derivation of Kc and Kcb for orchards (e.g., Peddinti
    and Kambhammettu, 2019). As an example for evergreen woody crops, a study performed
    with irrigated olives in southern Portugal (Paço et al., 2019) is analyzed. Crop
    transpiration was measured with the sap-flow Granier method, which data provided
    for calibrating SIMDualKc, thus obtaining the best Kcb values for the initial,
    mid-season, end-season and non-growing periods. A few observations of ETc act
    with an EC system were also used for testing. The Kcb curve (Fig. 4) resulted
    in a FAO segmented curve with higher Kcb during the growing season, spring and
    summer, when irrigation was applied, and smaller Kcb in the non-growing period,
    when transpiration is naturally low. Differently, because it depends on soil evaporation,
    the time averaged Kc (=Kcb+Ke) resulted smaller during the active growing period,
    when Es and Ke were low because precipitation was reduced and drip lines were
    located directly in line with the crop and shaded by the crop canopy, thus irrigation
    was applied under trees’ shadow. Contrarily, Kc was larger in fall and winter,
    when rainfall occurred (Fig. 4). A segmented Kc curve resulted with low values
    by the mid-season and a Kcb curve with a higher value during the mid-season. The
    Kc curve changed with rainfall, with Kc mid and Kc in the non-growing season,
    which is higher when rainfall was larger (Fig. 4a) and smaller under dry conditions.
    Contrarily, the standard Kcb values did not change. When considering the daily
    Kcb act, changes occurred depending on the water stress of the olive crop. The
    daily Kc act changed a lot, causing the referred changes in the Kc curve. Download

    Standard and actual basal and single crop coefficient and soil evaporation coefficient
    curves for a super-intensive olive orchard in two contrasting rainfall years:
    a) wet year and b) dry year (Paço et al., 2019). Deriving Kcb and Kc from SWB
    simulations is also uncommon for forage crops managed with cuttings. The FAO56
    approach for Kcb and Kc of forages managed with cuttings consists of adopting
    a segmented curve for each cut (Allen et al., 1998). SIMDualKc has proved appropriate
    to support the derivation of Kcb and Kc under these conditions in an application
    to Tifton 85 bermudagrass in Santa Maria, Brazil (Paredes et al., 2018b). The
    cutting treatments were spaced according to selected cumulative growth degree
    days (CGDD), which varied among treatments. With this approach, shorter time spans
    between cuttings resulted in summer and longer ones in winter. Results for Kcb
    and Kc with cuttings at CGDD of 248 °C, which refer to six forage cuttings, and
    372 °C, with only four cuttings, are presented in Fig. 5a and 5b respectively.
    The computed time average Kc before the cuttings are 0.96 for the CGDD 248 °C
    and 0.97 for CGDD 372 °C while the Kc after cuttings, when the forage crop is
    shorter, decreased to 0.92 and 0.95, respectively. Reported time averaged Kc before
    and after cuttings are close due to abundant precipitation during the crop season.
    The standard Kcb before the cuttings are 0.93 for the treatment with CGDD of 248 °C
    and 0.94 for CGDD of 372 °C while Kcb values after cuttings were respectively
    0.83 and 0.84. Values for the standard Kcb would be more distinct if the forage
    height would be smaller after cuttings. Results show that the approach proposed
    in FAO56 for Kc and Kcb curves for forages managed with cuttings was applicable
    with SIMDualKc. Download : Download high-res image (381KB) Download : Download

    where cuttings were performed for cumulative growth degree days of (a) 248 °C
    and (b) 372 °C (adapted from Paredes et al., 2018b). 4.3. ET and crop coefficients
    of relay inter-cropping An approach based on light/shadow effects was used to
    estimate ETc act and its partition for crops cultivated in a relay inter-cropping
    system. The mutual effects of shading by the crops combined in an inter-crop system
    were estimated by considering the height of both crops and the fraction of ground
    covered by each crop throughout the crop season (Miao et al., 2016). This principle
    is based upon the approach of Allen and Pereira (2009) to compute Kcb for a fruit
    crop cultivated with active ground cover. Naming the first planted crop as dominant
    and the second as the subordinate crop, and considering their interaction, the
    Kcb of the intercrop (Kcb inter) may be estimated daily as (Miao et al., 2016):
    (25) where Kcb dom and Kcb sub are, respectively, the Kcb values of the dominant
    and subordinate crops when mono-cropped, and Kd dom and Kd sub are the density
    coefficients of the dominant and subordinate crops. Kd are computed as: (26a)
    (26b) where fsc dom and fsc sub are the fractions of the soil surface cropped
    with the dominant and the subordinate crops, respectively, and hdom and hsub are
    the heights of the dominant and subordinate crops, respectively. The max function
    in Eqs. (25) and (26) aims at considering that the conditions observed at earlier
    stages, Kcb dom > Kcb sub and h dom >h sub, may change with the growth of the
    subordinate crop, thus making Kcb sub > Kcb dom and h sub > h dom. For example,
    this is the case of the wheat-sunflower intercrop, where sunflower develops taller
    than wheat when the latter matures, thus Kcb sunf > Kcb wheat and hsunf > hwheat.
    The application of this methodology to a winter wheat-sunflower relay inter-cropping
    in Hetao, China, is illustrated in Figs. 6a and b, which show the Kcb, Kcb act
    and Ke relative to wheat and sunflower mono-cropped, while Fig. 6c shows Kcb,
    Kcb act and Ke for the inter-cropping of both. Fig. 6a shows that a small stress
    occurred for wheat while Fig. 6b evidences that sunflower was largely stressed
    during the mid- and late-season stages, thus indicating that a large irrigation
    should have been given early in the mid-season. The resulting potential Kcb of
    the inter-cropping system (Fig. 6c) was smaller than that of the crops when single-cropped,
    with Kcb act following the trends evidenced for both crops when cropped alone.
    The Ke values also followed the Ke curves of both crops but they were different
    because basin irrigation was used and water was applied to the entire field, including
    when the second crop was not sowed yet, thus producing high evaporation in the
    non-cropped parts of the field. Fig. 6c shows that four irrigations were applied
    to the intercrop, however too early for sunflower that, contrarily to wheat, exhibited
    large water stress during mid- and late seasons. This is a consequence of avoiding
    irrigation by the end-season of wheat. The example shows that the use of a calibrated
    model helps interpreting and evaluating the irrigation schedules of intercropped
    crops. Download : Download high-res image (580KB) Download : Download full-size

    wheat-sunflower in Hetao, upper Yellow River basin, China, 2011 (adapted from
    Miao et al., 2016). 4.4. Assessing alternative planting dates An important issue
    in developing irrigation calendars is assessing the impacts of changing planting
    dates. Such changes may be desired when anticipating planting dates may increase
    the probability of rainfall early in the season, or to avoid hot waves in the
    late season. This search of better planting dates may be performed with irrigation
    scheduling models and using a statistical analysis of weather time series, namely
    when supplemental irrigation is practiced, such as with small grains and grain
    legumes in the Mediterranean area. However, few examples are available in the
    literature and they mostly refer to the impacts on crop yields rather than on
    water requirements. Abi-Saab et al. (2014) provided a good example relative to
    sunflower and soybean cropped in Lebanon, while Montoya and Otero (2019) reported
    an application to soybean in Uruguay, in both cases using the AquaCrop model.
    A different approach, using BUDGET, consisted of performing an analysis of risk
    relative to maize planting dates (Kipkorir et al., 2007). Various supplemental
    irrigation schedules for malting barley for industry were assessed for two contrasting
    rainfall years (Pereira et al., 2015b; Paredes et al., 2017b) using a cultivar
    that adjusts to a wide planting period, from November to January. Center-pivot
    irrigation was used with depths of 8 mm per event and ceasing 25 days before harvest
    to prevent water-related diseases that could affect malt grain quality. Based
    upon the observed sowing dates, the following alternatives were considered: 16th
    and 30th of December, and 6th and 16th of January. These sowing dates were assessed
    in terms of impacts on the total water use (TWU), forecasted yields (Ya), and
    water productivity (WPtotal, Eq. 21) defined in Section 2.5. They were also assessed
    considering two contrasting rainfall years - wet (2013) and dry (2012) – and various
    supplemental irrigation scenarios: Sc. 1: Full irrigation as practiced by the
    farmer (MAD = p); Sc. 2: Very mild water deficit during the entire season (MAD = 1.10
    p, Eq. 10); Sc. 3: Moderate water deficit during most of the crop season (MAD = 1.20
    p), but very mild (MAD = 1.10 p) during flowering/grain filling; Sc. 4: Moderate
    water stress during the entire season (MAD = 1.20 p); Sc. 5: Rainfed. Fig. 7 shows
    the predicted TWU, yield and WP indicators for the four sowing dates and five
    irrigation management scenarios. The adoption of early sowing leads to a smaller
    TWU than late sowing, particularly in the wet year. In the dry year, differences
    in TWU among irrigation management scenarios are larger than those due to planting
    dates. Yields show to increase for the last two planting dates but, again, differences
    in yields are greater among irrigation scenarios. Under dry conditions, the use
    of supplemental irrigation to meet barley water requirements is essential since
    yields are much lower under rainfed conditions. Differences in water productivity
    are larger among planting dates and quite small among irrigation management scenarios.
    Combining information relative to these three indicators, it was identified that
    the best sowing dates are likely those around the first days of January. The mid-January
    date is discouraged because the crop cycle enters in a period of high water demand
    by the late season, which increases TWU and decreases WP. The consideration of
    economic criteria would also be beneficial. This example shows the usefulness
    of a SWB model in recommending best planting dates to help farmers’ decisions.
    This can also be based on weather forecasts that provide for anticipating crop
    growth conditions. Download : Download high-res image (347KB) Download : Download

    various sowing dates and alternative irrigation schedules relative to two contrasting
    rainfall years (adapted from Paredes et al., 2017b). 4.5. Assessing beneficial
    and non-beneficial water uses The analysis of the water use by a crop allows to
    perform the field water balances and assess the time dynamics of its input and
    output terms, thus determining which are the consumptive and non-consumptive uses
    of water and, likely more important, which uses and consumptions are beneficial
    or, contrarily, consist of water waste and losses (Pereira et al., 2012). Molden
    and Sakthivadivel (2011) applied similar water use concepts at the basin scale,
    and Lecina et al. (2010) used this type of assessment to evaluate improvements
    of surface and sprinkler irrigation at the project scale. An application at field
    scale aimed at maximizing beneficial water use and controlling the non-beneficial
    one using the DSSAT-maize model is reported by Jiang et al. (2016). An application
    of the SIMDualKc model to a malt barley cropped under center-pivot irrigation
    in Central Portugal (Pereira et al., 2015b) is used herein as example of assessing
    beneficial and non-beneficial water uses throughout the crop cycle. The model
    was calibrated using field data of the dry year 2012 and was validated with data
    of the wet year 2013. The various SWB terms for both years and four crop growth
    stages are presented in Table 3. Groundwater contribution was not included in
    the balance because the water table was below 10 m deep. Irrigation water application
    depths averaging 7 mm per event were adopted to prevent high water stress. Table

    DP – deep percolation, ETc - crop evapotranspiration, ETc act - actual crop evapotranspiration,
    Tc act - actual crop transpiration, Es – soil evaporation. The non-consumptive
    water use terms, runoff (RO) and deep percolation (DP), were about nil in the
    dry year. RO was 10.5 % of the seasonal precipitation (P) in the wet year while
    DP, a potentially recoverable resource providing for vadose zone and aquifer recharge,
    represented nearly 30 % of P. The consumptive use terms, Tc act and Es, respectively
    beneficial and non-beneficial, showed a similar partition in both years, with
    transpiration representing 77 % of ETc act in the wet year and 79 % in the dry
    year. Es was smaller in the dry year because there was insufficient water supply
    during the late season, with ETc act representing only 64 % of the potential ETc.
    This fact occurred due to irrigation cutoff 25 days before harvesting in both
    years, with stored soil water supplying the crop in the wet year but not in the
    dry year. Otherwise, differences in consumptive water use in both years are small
    and are due to the higher climatic demand in the dry year, when ETc was larger
    by 56 mm relative to the wet year. Performing water use assessment adopting this
    approach is uncommon but could be helpful when considering issues for water conservation.
    4.6. Assessing the groundwater contribution from a shallow watertable The assessment
    of groundwater contribution (GC) to crop water needs in the presence of a shallow
    water table is often performed with a transient state modeling approach (e.g.
    Ragab, 2002; Jovanovic et al., 2004; Acharya and Mylavarapu, 2015). Empirical
    functions are used by others, such as Yang et al. (2007), who computed GC as a
    function of the depth of the water table, the soil water storage and crop ET,
    which consists of a modification of the empirical approach proposed in FAO24 (Doorenbos
    and Pruitt, 1977). Differently, Liu et al. (2006) developed a parametric function
    for use in ISAREG and, later, with SIMDualKc, which parameters are calibrated
    during the process of model calibration (e.g., Cholpankulov et al., 2008). With
    this approach, GC is a function of the actual water table depth, the actual soil
    water storage in the root zone, crop evapotranspiration and potential (maximum)
    capillary rise, which depends upon the soil hydraulic characteristics that regulate
    the intensity of upward fluxes. Liu et al. (2006) proposed sets of default parameters
    relative to soil textural and hydraulic properties and that are improved through
    model calibration. The use of SIMDualKc to assess consumptive and non-consumptive
    water use by a groundwater dependent Leymus chinensis grassland in eastern Inner
    Mongolia, China (Wu et al., 2016) is selected as an example of groundwater contribution
    assessment in a wet landscape. The analysis focused on the wet year of 2008 and
    the dry year of 2009. The daily dynamics of P, Tc act, Es and GC (all in mm) during
    the growth season is presented in Fig. 8, which clearly shows that the upward
    fluxes from the shallow water table were the main fraction of the water supply
    to the studied grassland. GC is essential to meet the water requirements of this
    crop. GC was small when there was enough soil water for extraction by the grassland
    but increased when crop water demand was high and the SWC decreased. Comparing
    both years (Fig. 8), it is evident that Tc act was similar in both years because
    GC supplemented rainfall, thus becoming much higher in the dry year, when rainfall
    was insufficient. Considering that ground cover by the grassland was very large,
    Es depended on precipitation only, thus being higher in the wet year. Download

    Daily water balance of a groundwater dependent Leymus chinensis grassland in eastern
    Inner Mongolia, China, comparing a wet and a dry year with focusing on the groundwater
    contribution from a shallow water table (adapted from Wu et al., 2016). Results
    in Table 4 show that, despite rainfall in the wet year was nearly 3 times that
    of the dry year, ETc act were not very different in both years, and Tc act were
    quite similar because GC effectively supplemented the lack of rainfall. The ratios
    between GC and the total water supply (TWS, mm) were very distinct, with GC/TWS = 33
    % in the wet year and 59 % in the dry year. These ratios quantified well the relative
    importance of GC for the water supply of the considered grassland. The ratios
    between GC and actual transpiration also showed the role of GC in meeting the
    grassland water requirements since GC/Tc act increased from 46 to 63 % from the
    wet to the dry year. Table 4. The terms of the water balance of a groundwater

    irrigation scheduling Real time irrigation scheduling aims at optimizing the timing
    and amount of water applied in the day-to-day irrigation management. It requires
    combining a model with data streaming from diverse sources such as weather forecasts,
    soil and plant sensors, or remote sensing data. Models referred in Table 1, Table
    2 may be adopted for this purpose but they are generally used to support research.
    In the past, several attempts to adapt and use SWB for supporting real time irrigation
    have been performed. Teixeira et al. (1995) developed and tested RELREG, a model
    derived from ISAREG, that could be updated every day, and used weather data predicted
    around three days in advance. Other models were developed and in use at farm level,
    e.g. SCHED for center-pivot irrigation (Buchleiter, 1995) and, for application
    at large scale, models such as RENANA (Giannerini, 1995). The latter has been
    continuously updated and gave origin to IRRIFRAME and IRRINET, widely used in
    Italy (Mannini et al., 2013; Giannerini and Genovesi, 2015), which enter in the
    era of the cloud data models. In South Africa, a review of irrigation scheduling
    atmospheric-based computer models was published by Annandale et al. (2011). Computerized
    real-time irrigation scheduling revolved around a number of historic models such
    as BEWAB (pre-plant seasonal irrigation schedules based on target yields; Bennie
    et al., 1988), “SWB” (providing daily water schedules based on calculated ETc
    act; Annandale et al., 1999), PUTU (De Jager et al., 2001), and various specialized
    models for irrigation management of sugarcane (Singels, 2007). The adoption of
    scientific irrigation scheduling was investigated in a technical project by Stevens
    et al. (2005). The outcomes were that the uptake of scientific irrigation scheduling
    by farmers is low, it is highly dependent on many other day-to-day farming and
    business operations, and there is generally need for engaging dedicated managers,
    extensionists or consultants to run a scientifically-based irrigation scheduling
    program on commercial farms. There are several web-based tools that were purposefully
    designed for supporting farmers in real-time irrigation decision-making such as
    IRRINET (Mannini et al., 2013; Giannerini and Genovesi, 2015) in Emilia Romagna
    Italy, the California Irrigation Management System (CIMIS, https://cimis.water.ca.gov/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020), the Arkansas Irrigation Scheduler (AIS, https://irrigweb.uaex.edu/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020), or the Mississippi irrigation scheduling tool (MIST).
    The SAPWAT model, originally developed by Crosby and Crosby (1999) with several
    improved versions (van Heerden and Walker, 2016), is used to determine crop water
    requirements and water allocations in South African water management areas. Other
    models with diverse workflows and computational procedures are applied for supporting
    farmers decision making, namely integrating SWB models, but they are rarely the
    object of scientific publications or information about calibration. Examples are
    the IRRIGA SYSTEM© (https://www.irrigasystem.com/, accessed on 25 May 2020) used
    both in South America and in Europe, IrrigaSys (http://irrigasys.maretec.org/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020) used in Vale do Sorraia, Portugal, and Irristrat™ (http://www.hidrosoph.com/EN/index.html,
    accessed on 27 May 2020) also applied in Portugal for both orchards and annual
    crops. The developing field of information and communication technology (ICT)
    opened up a variety of opportunities for smart agriculture in general, and irrigation
    scheduling in particular, by making use of Internet of Things (IoT), satellites
    and drones, robotics and artificial intelligence to improve farming operations,
    management of irrigation schedules and fertigation, and to achieve better yields,
    quality of products and profits. Tzounis et al. (2017) provided a review of potential
    applications of IoT technologies in agriculture. The drivers for these technologies
    are large volumes of data that are generated in space and time, and commonly referred
    to as Big Data. Big Data can be defined as huge datasets (commonly in the order
    of magnitude of TB) originating from a diversity of sources that makes them difficult
    to be collected, stored and analysed by conventional tools and techniques (Chen
    and Zhang, 2014; Ylijoki and Porras, 2016). They can be categorized into structured
    data that can be easily stored in tabular format (e.g. soil and plant measurements,
    remote sensing georeferenced data), unstructured data (e.g. text, video, audio
    and images) or semi-structured data (e.g. emails and XML files) that are usually
    inconsistent to store and process in customary databases (Lee, 2017). In order
    to extract usable information from the variety of sources of information to the
    benefit of researchers, practitioners and farm managers, these data need to be
    processed through systems, such as machine learning, and packaged into tools that
    facilitate interpretation and decision-making. Systems of heterogeneous sensors
    and networks for collection and communication of data are commonly referred to
    as Internet of Things (IoT). Given the vast amount of information and storage
    space that is often required, the processing, storage and analyses of these data
    can be done via Internet servers and infrastructure that are specifically designed
    for this purpose (e.g. Cloud Computing) (Tzounis et al., 2017). Ultimately, data
    need to be packaged into information tools, prescriptive/predictive models and
    decision-support systems that can aid decision-making on farms. Depending on data
    volume and computing requirements, irrigation scheduling tools can reside on cloud-based
    platforms (Bartlett et al., 2015). This is particularly the case when the tools/apps
    require information from large databases, e.g. soil properties, climate, satellite-derived
    observations. In other instances, soil input and climatic data can be obtained
    from localized sources, e.g. soil measurements and weather forecasts, and all
    calculations can be performed in reasonable time with algorithms running in the
    background (e.g. Internet apps). Several examples of these IoT applications for
    irrigation scheduling were reported in the literature and described below. The
    IoT infrastructure provides the opportunity to replace models, such as the above-mentioned
    SCHED, with automation-model systems applied to lateral moving systems coupled
    with sensors that provide for variable rate irrigation and nutrients applications,
    thus moving from the simple water scheduling to precision agriculture (Han et
    al., 2009). A review on variable rate issues for sprinkler systems, including
    an analysis of sensor systems usable for such purposes, was recently proposed
    by O’Shaughnessy et al. (2016). Similar approaches are used with drip-irrigated
    horticultural crops (Perea et al., 2017) and woody crops (Fernández, 2017). Payero
    et al. (2017) developed a communication system for transferring wireless soil
    water sensors data to an open-sources platform (https://thingspeak.com, accessed
    on 25 May 2020), where data are hosted and visualized in the form of usable information
    to support decision-making. However, SWB models remain popular tools for supporting
    irrigation scheduling. For operational irrigation schedules, using real-time models
    requires daily updated actual weather data, which may not be fully available.
    Thus, alternative sources of climatic data have been tested showing good accuracy,
    such as the use of re-analysis data for estimating PM-ETo (e.g. Paredes et al.,
    2018a), or satellite derived climatic products as referred by Paredes et al. (2020b).
    Since weather forecasts generally provide for incomplete data sets (precipitation
    and temperature), computing ETo requires simplified approaches using temperature
    data only, namely the Penman-Monteith temperature (PMT) and the Hargreaves and
    Samani equation (HS-eq) (Paredes and Pereira, 2019; Paredes et al., 2020a). Thus,
    a main challenge in using models for supporting irrigation scheduling is to use
    short-term weather forecasts that could support real-time irrigation scheduling
    and, considering larger range forecasts, to plan irrigation in advance (Kusunose
    and Mahmood, 2016; Klemm and McPherson, 2017). Studies on the use of short-term
    weather forecasts to support irrigation scheduling focus more on precipitation
    than on climatic demand (ETo). The study by Cai et al. (2009) focused on the use
    of short-term weather forecast messages provided by the National Meteorological
    Institute of China for estimating ETo and supporting irrigation scheduling, showing
    the good adequacy particularly for estimation of crop ET using a SWB model. A
    similar but updated approach is reported by Zhang et al. (2018). Lorite et al.
    (2015) developed a methodology based on the use of weather forecast data from
    freely and easily accessible online information for determining irrigation scheduling,
    reporting good accuracy for ETo estimations. Other studies focus on evaluating
    the use of short-term forecasts for real-time decision support for irrigation
    scheduling in terms of net profit and water savings. Cai et al. (2011) assessed
    the use of rainfall short-term forecasts provided by the National Oceanic and
    Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Despite the imperfect forecasts, results showed
    net profit of up to 8.5 % as well as high water savings ranging from 11.0 to 26.9
    % when compared to modelled soil moisture information. The study by Hejazi et
    al. (2014) focused on the use of reanalysis-based short-term weather forecasts
    relative to rainfall and ETo for supporting irrigation decision-making, reporting
    on average an expected profit of up to 3 % and a water saving ranging from 4 to
    6 %. Jamal et al. (2018), using the Soil Water Atmosphere Plant (SWAP) model,
    reported an overall good performance of using probabilistic seasonal weather forecasts
    to support chickpea real-time irrigation scheduling. Differently, Linker et al.
    (2018), using the AquaCrop model for irrigation scheduling and yield predictions
    coupled with 4 to 6-day weather forecasts, reported an overall inadequacy of the
    forecasts for several locations (Denmark, Greece, Italy and Portugal) and crops
    (potato, cotton, tomato and maize); in addition, these authors also outlined that
    there was no considerable advantage of using those forecasts relative to historical
    average data. Overall, the use of short-term weather forecasts keeps being a bottleneck
    due to their uncertainty/inaccuracy. Combining SWB model predictions with plant
    indicators (Ferreira, 2017) and/or soil sensors, is also an option that has been
    investigated, e.g. Cancela et al. (2015) used SIMDualKc with an automatic control
    irrigation system supported by a low cost wireless soil moisture sensors network.
    Thus, these tools rely less on weather data, and more on soil and plant sensors,
    which calls for new approaches in using the FAO56 method. An example of such new
    approaches is the model reported by Schwartz et al. (2020) aimed at actual Kc
    for maize when deficit irrigation is used and non-uniform soils also affect the
    crop and the available soil water. The use of soil water sensors is recognized
    as having a great importance for the accuracy of modern SWB modeling approaches
    (El-Naggar et al., 2020). The use of canopy temperature sensors is also recognized
    as contributing to improved accuracy (Han et al., 2018). Remote sensing data provide
    the opportunity to model at large scale and they typically fall in the domain
    of Big Data. This includes both data originating from unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAV, Ortega-Farias et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2019) and satellites. Two main
    approaches may be considered: energy balance models and vegetation indices. Models
    such as SEBAL (Surface Energy Balance Algorithm of Land), TSEB (Two-Source Energy
    Balance) and METRIC (Mapping Evapotranspiration with Internalized Calibration)
    are quite accurate in assessing crop evapotranspiration from the energy balance
    (Bastiaanssen et al., 1998; Allen et al., 2011a; French et al., 2015; Dhungel
    et al., 2016). ET from remote sensing may also be used to derive Kc or Kcb values.
    Vegetation indices, mainly the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and
    the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), are often used to estimate Kc and Kcb
    values (Johnson and Trout, 2012; Pôças et al., 2015; Campos et al., 2017). Satellite
    Kc data are then assimilated into SWB models. Another issue is the assessment
    of crop stress indicators from remote sensing (Pôças et al., 2017), namely using
    UAV. The use of optical/thermal satellite imagery at farm level would also allow
    drawing water requirement maps and implementing precise irrigation (Hendrickx
    et al., 2016). Melton et al. (2012, 2020) described the SIMS framework that combines
    NASA’s Terrestrial Observation and Prediction System (TOPS), Landsat and MODIS
    satellite imagery, and a surface sensors network to map indicators of crop irrigation
    demand and to develop information products to support irrigation management and
    other water use decisions. Li et al. (2018) described and tested a new method
    for sequential data assimilation that allows integrating soil water content measurements
    into the Community Land Model (CLM) aiming to improve irrigation scheduling. Evaluation
    of the method was performed on several citrus orchards allowing to save on average
    24 % of water relative to the farmers’ irrigation schedules while the use of the
    irrigation schedules based upon the FAO56 SWB provided for similar average water
    savings of 22 %. The development of mobile and on-line applications (apps) has
    also been investigated, with support of cloud computing and IoT. This kind of
    tools allows to provide to farmers easy-to-use information (Car et al., 2012),
    particularly when the information is conveyed using text messaging service (SMS).
    Todorovic et al. (2016) described and evaluated an automatized decision support
    system (Hydro-Tech) available as an app; Hydro-Tech integrates FAO56 methods,
    including the SWB, with continuous soil sensor-based monitoring, short-term weather
    forecasts, remote monitoring of the water supply network, diverse tools for data-cloud
    processing, and an economic and eco-efficiency assessment tool for optimizing
    irrigation scheduling. Evaluations performed in farmers’ fields with diverse crops
    (vegetables and fruit orchards) in the Apulia region, Italy, showed potential
    water savings ranging from 5 % to 20 % relative to the schedules used by farmers.
    Goap et al. (2018) presented an IoT-based smart irrigation management system,
    available as an app, using machine learning technology to predict crop irrigation
    requirements when combining sensing soil moisture along with the forecasts of
    precipitation, air temperature and humidity. Good accuracy of soil moisture predictions
    was reported thus allowing improving irrigation scheduling. An irrigation scheduling
    app (Bluleaf®) was evaluated by Abi-Saab et al. (2019) using field observations
    and showing its accuracy for estimations of soil moisture content and leaf water
    potential along the wheat season. In addition, the tool was able to enhance water
    savings by almost 26 % relative to the farmer’s traditional schedule. The progression
    of the satellite-based SEBAL model into an operational tool for irrigation scheduling
    is of particular interest. The private venture eLEAF (https://eleaf.com, accessed
    on 25 May 2020) developed a number of applications of interest to irrigation scheduling,
    namely PiMapping®7 (Pixel Intelligence Mapping), CropLook for field crops, as
    well as GrapeLook and FruitLook for grapes and fruit trees in the Western Cape,
    South Africa. The applications are based on satellite information to produce evapotranspiration
    maps and data that farmers and practitioners can access through a web portal (https://www.fruitlook.co.za/,
    accessed on 25 May 2020). A similar service providing information that can be
    accessed with different devices is IrriSat (https://www.irrisat.com/en/home-2,
    accessed on 25 May 2020). The Portuguese Association of Horticulture also makes
    available to farmers an app for real-time irrigation advice, Manna Irrigation
    Intelligence (https://aphorticultura.pt/2020/01/13/manna-irrigation-intelligence-tecnologia-de-deteccao-remota/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020), which bases upon a SWB model, remote sensing data and
    weather forecasts. Advances in ICT provide great opportunities to make use of
    large volumes of data and sources (sensors, models, remote sensing, images, tweets,
    farmers’ knowledge and experience, etc.). For using the Kc-ETo approach, ETo may
    be estimated with reduced datasets using the PMT and HS-eq approaches which require,
    among other, ground observed data, gridded and reanalysis data, and/or Meteosat
    Second Generation products, as well as forecasted weather data (Allen et al.,
    2020; Paredes et al., 2020a, b). Kc data sets refer to the updated tabulated standard
    Kc and Kcb values (Pereira et al., 2020a,b) and to the use of the A&P approach
    to compute Kcb and Kc from fc and height (Allen and Pereira, 2009; Pereira et
    al., 2020c,d). The challenge is to streamline these diversely structured data
    into usable and reliable information. Although major advances have been documented
    in the literature, the level of uptake is still not widespread mainly due to the
    need to own devices, applications, costs of services, etc. Maintenance of these
    systems can also be expensive in terms of hardware (e.g. sensors exposed in the
    field), securing a steady power supply, network and software stability, data storage
    infrastructure, security and access control. Nevertheless, given the volume of
    usable information that can potentially be produced to optimize farming production,
    it can be expected that IoT will become a more and more prominent feature in smart
    farming. 6. Conclusions and recommendations The current review has shown that
    SWB models have an enormous potential for irrigation scheduling including the
    assessment of alternative crop management practices, as well as biophysical and
    economic indicators of crop water productivity. The FAO56 methodology adopted
    in SWB is very accurate with moderate data requirements; simpler SWB models have
    been adopted for supporting irrigation scheduling but likely at a greater risk
    of water balance inaccuracies, namely when deep percolation and capillary rise
    are not properly taken into consideration and when Kc estimation is less appropriate.
    Research users may also prefer to adopt mechanistic, high-input intensive models
    having capabilities to simulate crop growth and yield as depending not only on
    water, but also on nutrients and other practices. Trends for future also refer
    to the adoption of crop growth and yield models for irrigation scheduling, at
    least for research purposes; the adoption of the FAO56 method in the DSSAT models
    already performed (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017) consists of an excellent foundation
    for this purpose. Easy to parameterize and calibrate, field and crop-focused SWB
    models will likely continue to be used by farmers and farm advisers as well as
    using the cloud data facilities at the large scale. However, trends for IoT and
    cloud computing seem to lean towards simple crop ET computations, likely using
    the Kc-ETo approach. Then, ETo is likely estimated from temperature using the
    FAO56 recommended approaches (PMT and HS-eq), or is derived from reanalysis products,
    gridded data or Meteosat Second Generation products, as well as using forecasted
    weather data. Future trends are also envisaged with farmers using models with
    ready to use information through mobile phones and smartphone apps. This approach
    is easier to apply with IoT or cloud data. In fact, simpler models provide acceptable
    to good indicative information to support basic irrigation decisions while more
    complex models are difficult to be deployed for the variety of users in terms
    of crops and cropping practices and management. It is therefore recommended that
    IoT models use the FAO56 method, including the updated FAO56 temperature based
    ETo, and the updated data sets of Kc and Kcb, or with application of the A&P approach
    to estimate Kcb and Kc from the fraction of ground cover and crop height, that
    are well proved and tested at various locations. Innovation in cloud data and
    IoT models needs to enlarge the present focus on solving data acquisition and
    sensors management to the quality of crop and ET computations, since this approach
    may support attaining better water productivity and water saving, which are definitely
    relevant in terms of facing climate change. A main opportunity for future is the
    use of remote sensing and the integration of remotely-sensed data into the SWB
    and crop growth models. Two main approaches may be considered (energy balance
    models and vegetation indices) as well as diverse sources of information (satellite
    imagery, imagery obtained from drones and infrared thermometry measurements on
    the ground). The dual Kc approach is already used in remote sensing applications
    for estimating ETc of various crops, which compared well with the Kcb estimated
    using the SIMDualKc model for many crops. Thus, results show that for real-time
    irrigation management the Kcb derived from remotely sensed vegetation indices
    may be used to adjust SIMDualKc and similar models’ simulations in near real-time,
    particularly when using sensors from satellites with high revisiting frequency.
    An effective exchange between research and practice represents a great challenge
    in SWB models use and development. Research uses models to better and more accurately
    understand the processes relative to soil water fluxes and transport in the soil-plant-atmosphere
    continuum. Irrigators need that a SWB model responds to their need for knowing
    when and how much water to apply to a crop in a given environment and in a defined
    development stage. The users require timely and simple responses, very easy to
    interpret. SWB models for research and practice already are, and will keep being
    distinct. The question is therefore how and which information created from research
    shall pass into practice and which type of SWB will facilitate both new knowledge
    and its transfer to practice. Likely this requires that research considers transferability
    as a main option, but that freedom of research is not affected by the need for
    transferability of results. Is the development of more and more sophisticated
    models a need? Is scrutiny of field data quality a priority? Is the consideration
    of the energy balance, namely through crop coefficients, an essential approach
    in research? Is empirical research, with a minimal use of models to be continued?
    Would it be advantageous to bring into research the models used in practice? These
    are questions that future research should debate and substantiate. Declaration

    • The role of Internet of Things in arable farming is reviewed. • Internet of
    Things is leading arable farming to become data-driven. • Implementation and application
    are described in depth. • Challenges, corresponding solutions and potentials are
    discussed thoroughly. The Internet of Things is allowing agriculture, here specifically
    arable farming, to become data-driven, leading to more timely and cost-effective
    production and management of farms, and at the same time reducing their environmental
    impact. This review is addressing an analytical survey of the current and potential
    application of Internet of Things in arable farming, where spatial data, highly
    varying environments, task diversity and mobile devices pose unique challenges
    to be overcome compared to other agricultural systems. The review contributes
    an overview of the state of the art of technologies deployed. It provides an outline
    of the current and potential applications, and discusses the challenges and possible
    solutions and implementations. Lastly, it presents some future directions for
    the Internet of Things in arable farming. Current issues such as smart phones,
    intelligent management of Wireless Sensor Networks, middleware platforms, integrated
    Farm Management Information Systems across the supply chain, or autonomous vehicles
    and robotics stand out because of their potential to lead arable farming to smart
    arable farming. During the implementation, different challenges are encountered,
    and here interoperability is a key major hurdle throughout all the layers in the
    architecture of an Internet of Things system, which can be addressed by shared
    standards and protocols. Challenges such as affordability, device power consumption,
    network latency, Big Data analysis, data privacy and security, among others, have
    been identified by the articles reviewed and are discussed in detail. Different
    solutions to all identified challenges are presented addressing technologies such
    as machine learning, middleware platforms, or intelligent data management. Previous

    The global population and its food consumption are growing alarmingly quickly,
    while climate change effects are simultaneously complicating the challenge of
    ensuring food security in a sustainable manner (Godfray et al., 2010, Tilman et
    al., 2011). Data-driven agriculture is one of the main strategies and concepts
    proposed to increase production efficiently while decreasing its environmental
    impact (Foley et al., 2011). Data-driven technologies in general are quickly advancing
    with the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), and may become an important
    part of the future of farming (Brewster et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2016,
    Verdouw, 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Smart Farming, also called Agriculture 4.0
    or digital farming (CEMA, 2017), is developing beyond the modern concept of precision
    agriculture, which bases its management practices on spatial measurements largely
    thanks to Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Smart farming bases its management
    tasks also on spatial data but is enhanced with context-awareness and is activated
    by real-time events, improving the performance of hitherto precision agriculture
    solutions (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Additionally, Smart
    Farming usually incorporates intelligent services for applying and managing Information
    and Communication Technologies (ICT) in farming, and allows transverse integration
    throughout the whole agri-food chain in regards to food safety and traceability
    (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). IoT is therefore a key technology in smart farming
    since it ensures data flow between sensors and other devices, making it possible
    to add value to the obtained data by automatic processing, analysis and access,
    and this leads to more timely and cost-effective production and management effort
    on farms. Simultaneously, IoT enables the reduction of the inherent environmental
    impact by real-time reaction to alert events such as weed, pest or disease detection,
    weather or soil monitoring warnings, which allow for a reduction and adequate
    use of inputs such as agrochemicals or water. IoT eases documentation and supervision
    of different activities as well as the traceability of products, improving the
    environmental surveying and control in farms by the appropriate authorities. The
    IoT concept was introduced by Kevin Ashton in 1999 in relation to linking Radio-Frequency
    Identification (RFID) for supply chains to the internet (Ashton, 2009), but has
    no official definition. It implies, however, the connection of a network of “things”
    to or through the internet without direct human intervention. “Things” can be
    any object with sensors and/or actuators that is uniquely addressable, interconnected
    and accessible through the world-wide computer network, i.e. the Internet. The
    application of IoT in agriculture is advantageous because of the possibility to
    monitor and control many different parameters in an interoperable, scalable and
    open context with an increasing use of heterogeneous automated components (Kamilaris,
    Gao, Prenafeta-Boldu, & Ali, 2016), in addition to the inevitable requirement
    for traceability. As a result of IoT, agriculture is becoming data-driven, i.e.
    making informed real-time decisions for managing the farm, reducing uncertainties
    and inefficiencies, and as a consequence reducing its environmental impact. The
    application of IoT in agriculture, also called Ag-IoT (Zhai, 2017), AIoT (Zou
    & Quan, 2017), or IoF meaning Internet of Farming (Alahmadi, Alwajeeh, Mohanan,
    & Budiarto, 2017) or Internet of Food and Farm (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), has received exponentially increasing attention in the scientific
    community (Fig. 1). Even though the publications are mainly dominated by Asian
    scientists (Talavera et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016), in Europe several large scale
    international pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019), are aiming to implement IoT technologies in the agricultural
    industry in Europe. Similar projects elsewhere include the Accelerating Precision
    Agriculture to Decision Agriculture (P2D) project in Australia (Zhang, Baker,
    Jakku, & Llewellyn, 2017), which complement additional major investments with
    the aim to help farmers convert to smart farming (Higgins et al., 2017, Pham and
    Stack, 2018). Download : Download high-res image (95KB) Download : Download full-size

    searching criteria: (Internet of things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    Several reviews have been done on IoT in agriculture in the relatively short time
    period in which publications about the subject have emerged (Ray, 2017, Stočes
    et al., 2016, Talavera et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). In
    addition, review papers have been published with a focus on specific subjects
    related to IoT applied in agriculture, such as Big Data (Kamilaris et al., 2017,
    Wolfert et al., 2017), modelling (O''Grady & O''Hare, 2017), Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) (Jawad, Nordin, Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, 2017), food supply chain (Ramundo,
    Taisch, & Terzi, 2016), Internet of Underground Things (Vuran, Salam, Wong, &
    Irmak, 2018), chemical wireless sensors (Kassal, Steinberg, & Murkovi, 2018),
    or Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015;
    Kaloxylos et al., 2012). However, to the authors'' knowledge, no existing review
    has focused on arable farming, which has specific characteristics and challenges
    that differ from those in a controlled environment, i.e. greenhouses, or permanent
    crops such as fruit orchards. Arable farming poses particular challenges due to:
    • much larger farm sizes, which affect the design of the sensor networks, the
    data processing, analysis and extrapolation of limited stationary sensor data,
    and the consequent decision making with regards to actuators, vehicle logistics,
    etc.; • the larger farm sizes also imply that spatial data has a central role
    in arable farming, affecting the data processing, decision making and precision
    machinery employed to address in-field variability not at plant level as in most
    permanent crops, but at subfield level with automatic recognition and actuation
    (Zude-Sasse, Fountas, Gemtos, & Abu-Khalaf, 2016); • greater use of mobile sensors
    and other devices on vehicles, which have specific challenges. While other cropping
    systems may also use sensors and devices on operating machinery, arable farming
    often requires a fleet of vehicles to operate in a co-ordinated fashion. This
    creates issues particularly regarding network infrastructure (Martínez, Pastor,
    Álvarez, & Iborra, 2016), e.g. connectivity to the cloud of moving things that
    rely mainly on mobile networks, or vehicle to implement communication, which implies
    real-time interoperability between machines and devices from different manufacturers
    (Peets, Mouazen, Blackburn, Kuang, & Wiebensohn, 2012); • larger amounts of heterogeneous
    spatial data generated at different rates and from very disparate sources: stationary
    sensors, moving vehicles and implements, satellites, data from web services, etc.,
    which need to be intelligently integrated; • highly varying and uncertain environmental
    conditions, as annual crops are more susceptible to weather changes and other
    external factors than permanent crops, which are more resilient mainly due to
    their deeper roots (Zude-Sasse et al., 2016), or crops in controlled environments.
    This obligates the IoT system to handle both spatial and temporal data, increasing
    the complexity of the data processing as well as the decisions based on the data
    collected. • more diverse types of field tasks per growing season in arable farming,
    from soil preparation and crop establishment, through highly varying plant nursing
    tasks, to coordinated harvest, which increase the complexity and also the risks.
    The IoT in agriculture is a fast-developing field, which can make reviews obsolete
    quickly. This challenge can be overcome by focussing a critical view on the general
    principles, main application areas and identify the limitations and challenges.
    Summarising, the aim of the paper is to provide an up to date novel analytical
    review of the role of IoT in arable farming, with the following specific objectives:
    • Provide an overview of the current situation of IoT technologies deployed in
    arable farming. Focussing on the current use of communication technologies and
    protocols, the generation and analysis of data, and IoT architectures. • Outline
    the different applications and capabilities of IoT in arable farming. • Investigate
    the main challenges encountered by IoT enabling technologies applied to arable
    farming. • Present key potential fields of application where IoT could be employed,
    as well as future directions of the current trends. The remaining part of this
    paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the methodology used in this
    review paper. Section 3 provides an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies
    used in arable farming; Section 4 presents an outline of the current and potential
    IoT-based applications in arable farming; Section 5 discusses the challenges and
    solutions found in its implementation; and lastly, the review closes with Section
    6 in which future directions are summarised. 2. Review methodology In order to
    address the specific objectives identified above, the literature listing from
    the SCOPUS database of the last 11 years has been reviewed. More precisely, the
    timeframe investigated was from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2018, selected as
    the whole period in which any literature about the subject turned up in the studied
    database. SCOPUS was selected as the primary literature source as it is a key
    peer-reviewed research literature database. The specific keywords used in the
    search criteria where: (Internet of Things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    To ease the searching process, the keywords needed to be present in at least the
    title, abstract, highlights or keywords. Additionally, the articles had to be
    published in English. Articles concerning greenhouse, livestock or permanent crops
    were excluded from the survey, as were supply chain related articles. However,
    issues concerning traceability at farm level were included. The survey was performed
    in a systematic manner following three steps (see Fig. 2): • Firstly, a list of
    1193 articles meeting the search criteria mentioned above was retrieved from the
    database. • In the second step, by reading the titles, any article that was clearly
    not related to arable farming was excluded, leaving a list of 293 articles. •
    In the last step, a second screening was made by reading the abstracts, where
    articles outside the focus of this review were omitted. After this step, 167 articles
    were studied in detail, from which 69 articles were considered relevant, 27 as
    partially relevant, while the rest were considered of little relevance. Relevance
    concerned mainly the connection of the article to the subject studied. The content
    of a relevant article directly addresses the application of an IoT technology
    in an arable farming scenario. A partially relevant article studies a certain
    IoT technology in agriculture in a broader sense. In the distinction made regarding
    little relevant articles included off-topic, lack of novelty, as well as non-peer-reviewed
    articles that lacked scientific rigour, e.g. ambiguous information or absence
    of materials or methods description. Download : Download high-res image (208KB)

    The final 167 articles studied included: 77 journal papers, 88 conference papers
    and 4 book chapters, of which 19 were review papers. The final list of articles
    was complemented with other publications that expanded on some of the IoT related
    subjects and technologies mentioned in the studied articles, and did not contain
    the specified keywords. These were found by a targeted search for specific subjects.
    Lastly, in each article from the final list a special focus was made on the IoT
    technologies employed, the applications, the challenges encountered and, finally,
    on potential future perspectives. 3. IoT implementation in arable farming IoT
    has recently been gaining momentum in the farming industry as it can fulfil the
    urgent necessity for interoperability across brands, scalability and traceability
    (Kamilaris et al., 2016). Different technologies are implemented as IoT is still
    evolving, adapting to a great diversity of uses. To cover the range of technologies,
    protocols, standards, etc. employed, this review is addressing the layers in the
    IoT architecture. Three layers normally describe the architecture of the IoT in
    the literature reviewed (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Khattab et al., 2016,
    Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Na and Isaac, 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw,
    2016), though some authors divide it into more layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Ramundo et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Talavera et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2014),
    depending on their definitions. More than three layers can especially be relevant
    in IoT systems with edge or fog computing, where an edge/fog computing layer can
    be considered in between the device and network layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016). Even though the naming of the layers also varies depending on the author,
    there is nonetheless a general trend to divide the layers into device, network
    and application layers (Fig. 3). Thus, this has been the adapted structure in
    this review. The device layer consists of the physical objects (things) that are
    capable of automatic identification, sensing or actuation, and connection to the
    internet. The network layer communicates the data to a gateway (or proxy server)
    to the internet (cloud) by the use of communication protocols. And the application
    layer typically stores and facilitates access for the end-user to the processed/analysed
    information. Download : Download high-res image (222KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. IoT architecture represented by device, network and application
    layer, in which the middleware platform is not always present. The collected data
    experience diverse stages during their transition from sensors to cloud, interfaces,
    and occasionally actuators, and these stages have considerable influence on the
    technologies applied in an IoT context. Six main stages regarding data flow have
    been identified in the literature reviewed: sensing/perception, communication/transport/transfer,
    storage, processing, analytics, and actuation and display (Fig. 4). The order
    of the stages is different depending on the IoT setup employed and the computing
    techniques used, e.g. fog and edge computing processes the data before communicating
    it to the cloud, an example of its application in precision farming is given by
    Ferrández-Pastor et al. (2016); while cloud computing processes the data in the
    cloud, examples of this are given by Hernandez-Rojas, Mazon-Olivo, Novillo-Vicuña,
    and Belduma-Vacacela (2018) and Na and Isaac (2016). Nonetheless, sensing/perception
    is normally the first stage, where data are captured by sensors, then the data
    can follow different paths and does not necessarily go through all the steps listed.
    In summary, IoT data is identified to be gathered or generated through three main
    processes: machine generated, which come from sensing devices; process-mediated,
    i.e. commercial data coming from business processes; and human-sourced, recorded
    by humans and digitalised later on (Balducci, Impedovo, Informatica, & Moro, 2018).
    These different sources have an influence on how to process, analyse and use the
    data in IoT solutions, and this needs to be taken into account in the overall
    data acquisition planning process. Download : Download high-res image (171KB)

    in arable farming. 3.1. Device layer As mentioned above, the device layer consists
    of the physical objects (things) that are capable of automatic identification,
    sensing or actuating, and providing connection to the internet. Sensor devices
    measure and collect one or more parameters automatically and transmit the data
    wirelessly to the cloud. And, when the devices become actuators, they generally,
    in turn, receive data from the cloud in order to activate or deactivate some mechanical
    component, e.g. a valve in an irrigation system. The device layer is also often
    called perception layer (Tzounis et al., 2017, Zou and Quan, 2017), sensing layer
    (Na and Isaac, 2016, Wang et al., 2014), or physical layer (Ramundo et al., 2016,
    Talavera et al., 2017). The devices are constituted of a transceiver, a microcontroller,
    an interfacing circuit and one or more sensors and/or actuators. The sensor measures
    a physical parameter, e.g. air temperature that is interpreted and transformed
    into an equivalent analogue signal, i.e. electric voltage or current, which is
    then converted by the interfacing circuit, i.e. Analogue-to-Digital Converter
    (ADC), into a corresponding digital format. Afterwards, the microcontroller, sometimes
    also in the form of microprocessors or single-board computers (Talavera et al.,
    2017), collects the data in digital format from one or more sensors through the
    ADC, and sends them to the transceiver, i.e. a wireless communication module,
    which communicates the data to a gateway. A comparison of microcontrollers and
    single-board computers used in IoT in agriculture has been made by Ray (2017).
    In the case of edge computing, the microcontroller or single-board computer processes
    the data from one or more sensors before communicating them, with the intention
    of, for example, reducing the amount of data to be transferred to the cloud and
    accelerating the data processing (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et
    al., 2016). In fog computing the data are processed in the local area network
    level, i.e. in a fog node or IoT gateway (Ahmed, Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed,
    De et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018). When employing an actuator, the
    signal is received by the transceiver, communicated to the microcontroller, where
    it is then converted to analogue signal by a Digital-to-Analogue Converter (DAC),
    i.e. the interfacing circuit, or to a digital signal by a Digital-to-Digital Converter,
    and finally interpreted by the actuator, which acts in accordance to the signal
    received. In arable farming, when agricultural machinery data are used, i.e. data
    from sensors and devices mounted on tractors or other agricultural machinery,
    the data in digital format is normally collected and accessible through the Controller
    Area Network (CAN) bus in the machine, although in some cases some data are accessible
    through other ports (Oksanen et al., 2016, Peets et al., 2012). Machine and operator
    performance information is accessible through the Machine and Implement Control
    System (MICS) of the machine, which can also be accessed through the CAN bus data.
    MICS data are used to allow machinery operators and farm managers to monitor and
    potentially improve the efficiency of their machines, by employing e.g. smart
    alerts or recommendation systems (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015). Global Navigation Satellite
    System (GNSS) data, e.g. Real Time Kinematics GPS (RTK-GPS), are often also available
    through the CAN bus port, which allows, among others, vehicle monitoring and dynamic
    optimised route planning Edwards et al., 2017, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018. Many
    different sensors and actuators are employed in arable farming. The type of device
    used depends on the purpose of the system in addition to the technologies implemented
    in the system. And the number of devices is steadily increasing. The number of
    IoT device installations in farms is expected to increase globally from 30 million
    installations in 2015 to 75 million in 2020. Furthermore, data points generated
    per day and farm are expected to increase from 190000 in 2014 to over half a million
    by 2020 (Meola, 2016). It was also estimated that by 2018 there would be 10 billion
    IoT devices employed in agriculture. However, the great amount of data generated
    is often unused or underutilised (Bennett, 2015), e.g. in countries like Denmark
    with a relative high ICT adoption in farms, in 2016 only 2–5% of farmers worked
    actively with the data generated (SEGES, 2016). Even if data usage is still relatively
    low, it is expected to increase rapidly (Bennett, 2015, Wolfert et al., 2017,
    World Bank, 2017) An overview about how they are implemented for different purposes
    is presented in the Applications section. 3.2. Network layer The network layer
    communicates the data initially to an intermediary platform and eventually to
    the internet (cloud), and from there to, for example, employed actuators. When
    the data are transferred to the intermediary platform, it typically uses wireless
    communication technologies, for instance RFID, WSN with Zigbee, LoRa (Long Range),
    etc., and more recently Near-Field Communication (NFC) (Kassal et al., 2018, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). The intermediary platform
    is normally an internet gateway located in the vicinity of the connected devices,
    also including sometimes a proxy server, where the data are collected and occasionally
    processed in order to send the information further to the end user through the
    internet by the use of e.g. MQTT standards, or HTML or XMPP protocols. The use
    of Android smart devices or other operating systems is also increasing in popularity
    among agricultural applications, as they can be employed as a gateway for 3G and
    4G networks, and they frequently include other wireless communication technologies,
    e.g. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPRS and NFC. They also automatically conform to communication
    standards and protocols, in which way interoperability is increased (Balmos et
    al., 2016, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Gao and Yao, 2016, Hernandez-Rojas et
    al., 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). In addition, Android and other smart
    devices can include GNSS and RGB camera sensors, and can relatively easily be
    programmed for computing data and displaying Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications
    being able to straightforwardly update the software if necessary. In that manner,
    Android and similar smart devices are represented in all three IoT layers, i.e.
    sensing in the device layer, node or gateway in the network layer, and computing
    data and displaying GUI in the application layer. Furthermore, the automatic software
    updating possibilities of smart devices allow remote installation of updates with
    new functionalities, bug fixes, etc. and easily improve the interoperability of
    the system (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). Many different wireless technologies
    have been applied for diverse purposes in agriculture, depending on economic,
    accessibility and capability factors. Jawad et al., 2017, Ray, 2017 and Tzounis
    et al. (2017) have presented good overviews of the specifications of wireless
    communication technologies implemented in IoT in an agricultural context, which
    have been here collected in Table 1 and complemented with information from other
    relevant articles (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Elijah et al., 2018, Kassal et al.,
    2018, Sinha et al., 2017, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). The great variety of technologies,
    standards and frequency bands used exposes the relevant interoperability and application
    challenges found when applying IoT technologies. Potential communication standards
    for smart farming can be classified into short-range and long-range according
    to their communication distance, which determines their specific usability in
    different requirement settings. This is particularly the case in arable farming,
    where mobile network accessibility can be an issue in many rural areas, and where
    large farm sizes limit the use of some wireless technologies due to their reduced
    communication distance and due to the necessity to replace/recharge device batteries

    m 1 mW a Not yet publicly available. A WSN is formed by pervasive devices called
    motes or sensor nodes, which integrate sensors and actuators that communicate
    wirelessly forming a spatial network (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). In a WSN, base stations act as gateways forwarding
    the data to the cloud. Different communication technologies support different
    network node architectures, e.g. star, tree or mesh. Depending on the application,
    different wireless communication technologies are employed in a WSN as each has
    different node architecture possibilities, data rates, ranges, standards, among
    others, with the use of ZigBee, LoRa, Bluetooth/BLE, WiFi and SigFox being relatively
    common in agriculture. In arable farming, BLE has for example been employed for
    soil and air monitoring and irrigation control (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018);
    ZigBee was used in a WSN for monitoring soil conditions and actuating an irrigation
    system (Mafuta et al., 2012) and crop monitoring (Zhai, 2017); and LoRa for air
    and water temperature of rice paddy fields (Tanaka, 2018) and smart irrigation
    control (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018). In order to cover
    larger distances, GPRS is appropriate and has been used for irrigation control
    (López-Riquelme et al., 2017), and for remote maintenance of machinery (Miettinen,
    Oksanen, Suomi, & Visala, 2006). GPRS, or other technologies, such as LTE, or
    3G/4G, are also commonly used at the gateway to transmit data to the cloud. Regarding
    other less common communication technologies used in WSNs, RFID can be integrated
    into a WSN too by connecting the RFID tag readers to a radio-frequency transceiver
    (Costa et al., 2013). Passive and active RFID technologies are used to a great
    extent in agricultural research and industry (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), especially
    for animal production (e.g. Kamilaris et al., 2016), as well as vegetable or fruit
    product traceability (e.g. Kodali, Jain, & Karagwal, 2017); however, in arable
    farming only few examples have been found: e.g. RFID tags used for irrigation
    scheduling (Vellidis, Tucker, Perry, Kvien, & Bednarz, 2008), for agrochemical
    traceability (Peets, Gasparin, Blackburn, & Godwin, 2009), for vehicle monitoring
    (Sjolander, Thomasson, Sui, & Ge, 2011), and even on a prototype for soil temperature
    monitoring (Hamrita & Hoffacker, 2005). Regarding NFC, no concrete examples of
    NFC used in arable farming have been found in the literature reviewed. Finally,
    the latest generation of mobile communications, i.e. 5G, has higher data rates,
    large coverage areas, higher peak throughput, and also improved flexibility, which
    can open new possibilities and may solve some of the challenges encountered by
    many IoT solutions (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Marsch et al., 2016). 5G allows new
    options for monitoring rural areas with no previous infrastructure for Internet
    connection (Faraci, Raciti, Rizzo, & Schembra, 2018). 5G can also improve vehicle-to-vehicle
    or vehicle-to-anything communication in e.g. logistics solutions, due to its low
    latency and new frequency bands (Marsch et al., 2016). A challenge for the 5G
    networks will be the great increase in devices to support once IoT becomes a standard
    solution not only in agriculture, but also in any sphere of everyday life. 3.3.
    Application layer The application layer is crucial in an IoT context as it is
    this layer that actually adds value to the sensed and communicated data through
    directly controlling devices, supporting farmers'' decision making, etc. In this
    layer, several important services occur such as data storage, data analytics,
    data access through an appropriate Application Programming Interface (API), as
    well as possibly a user interfaced software application. The layer may also include
    middleware platforms that aid handling the heterogeneous cloud data improving
    interoperability. Data storage can be cloud based, i.e. on multiple servers, or
    more local based, where data are stored in different types of databases, depending
    on the application and design. Even if relational databases, such as Structured
    Query Language (SQL) databases (Gao and Yao, 2016, Goap et al., 2018, Ray, 2017,
    Wang et al., 2014), MySQL (Kaloxylos et al., 2014), or PostgreSQL (Mazon-Olivo,
    Hernández-Rojas, Maza-Salinas, & Pan, 2018) are employed in some of the reported
    applications in the reviewed articles, non-relational databases, such as Not only
    SQL (NoSQL), or also SPARQL, a semantic query language based database, are gaining
    attention due to their flexibility and scalability, especially when dealing with
    Big Data. Their ability to store and manage large amounts of heterogeneous data
    makes them suitable in many IoT agricultural contexts (Huang and Zhang, 2017,
    Kamilaris et al., 2017). Examples of NoSQL employed in agriculture are Cassandra
    (Huang & Zhang, 2017), Dynamo (Xian, 2017), HBase (Ray, 2017, Wang et al., 2014)
    and MongoDB (Martínez et al., 2016). An example of SPARQL has been given by Jayaraman
    et al. (2016). Data analytics can be achieved by cloud computing, where computer
    resources are managed remotely to analyse data, often Big Data, or by distributed
    computing, e.g. edge and fog computing. Cloud computing has the advantage that
    it provides high quality services that allow independent execution of multiple
    applications as if they were isolated, even if they are on the same platform,
    e.g. in data centres, which is especially relevant when dealing with Big Data
    (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Martínez et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017). However,
    cloud computing techniques mostly rely on general purpose cloud providers that
    do not comply with specific agricultural service requirements (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017) and can experience latency issues, which are not acceptable in IoT
    solutions where monitoring, control and analysis require fast performance (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2018). Examples of application of cloud computing related to arable farming
    are given by Khattab et al., 2016, Na and Isaac, 2016 and López-Riquelme et al.
    (2017). Khattab et al. (2016) present an IoT architecture with a cloud-based back-end
    where weather and soil data are processed and analysed for automatic activation
    of irrigation and spraying actions. Na and Isaac (2016) describe a human-centric
    IoT architecture with a list of cloud services, such as language translation,
    data simplification or updated market price information. And López-Riquelme et
    al. (2017) use FIWARE components for a cloud service for smart irrigation tasks,
    focussing on the benefits of using FIWARE as cloud provider. Regarding Big Data
    analysis and Big Data in general in an agricultural context, Kamilaris et al.
    (2017) and Wolfert et al. (2017) respectively have performed exhaustive reviews
    on the subject. The use of IoT middleware platforms is gaining interest due to
    its potential for solving different challenges found in the application of IoT,
    especially interoperability. IoT middleware platforms try to simplify the complex
    communication through the cloud due to heterogeneity of devices, communications
    and networks, by using enablers like standardised APIs and protocols (Jayaraman
    et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017). Examples of
    these are HYDRA, UBIWARE, UBIROAD, UBIDOTS, SMEPP, SIXTH, Think Speak, SensorCloud,
    Amazon IoT and IBM IoT, with focus on context aware functionality; SOCRADES, GSN
    and SIRENA, with more focus on security and privacy; Aneka, WSO2, PubNub, SmartFarmNet
    and FIWARE, with a wider services-oriented approach; and projects like IoT-A,
    OpenIoT, or ArrowHead (Gill et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2015, Jayaraman et
    al., 2016, Kamilaris et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016). Even if all these and more solutions are found in the IoT market,
    an intelligent middleware solution that addresses most issues observed in smart
    farming successfully is yet to be implemented (Jayaraman et al., 2016, Martínez
    et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). However, FIWARE (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    López-Riquelme et al., 2017, Martínez et al., 2016, Rodriguez et al., 2018) and
    SmartFarmNet (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Jayaraman et al., 2016) have been
    implemented effectively for precision and smart farming applications. In order
    to communicate data across platforms and IoT devices, ensuring interoperability,
    APIs are essential. These should adapt to evolving or new standards in order to
    ensure a longer life span, which may become a limitation if the APIs are not updated.
    It is through the APIs that data are made available for the IoT applications (e.g.
    Goap et al., 2018, Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018). These services may include tracing,
    monitoring, event management, forecasting or optimisation for agricultural activities
    and products. These applications related to arable farming are described in the
    next section. 4. Current and potential applications Multiple applications can
    be derived from the implementation of IoT in arable farming. These applications
    can always be conceptualised into the three IoT layers described previously, and
    are not to be confused with the application layer. Elaborations of the reviewed
    articles show that the applications have been differentiated and categorised as
    follows: monitoring, documentation, forecasting and controlling. Monitoring refers
    to timely sensing of very diverse parameters and is mostly the initial point of
    entry for other applications. Documentation covers the storing of sampled data
    for later use in e.g. farm management or traceability of produce. Forecasting
    employs different sources of data through precisely designed analytic methods
    for predicting concrete events. And controlling is the result of active monitoring,
    where processed data are used to automatically activate and control actuators
    in a predefined manner. A summarising table collects all the IoT applications
    in arable farming described in this chapter (Table 2). Most IoT-based systems
    include at least two of these applications and isolated applications are seldom
    seen. In addition, special attention has been paid to FMIS and associated decision
    support to improve operations and production processes involving vehicle positioning
    analytics, optimisation and logistics, which are key elements in arable farming
    (Bochtis et al., 2011, Bochtis et al., 2014) and have consequently got a section
    of their own. Table 2. IoT applications in arable farming. Applications Examples

    Automatic monitoring is the obvious first step in IoT applied to agriculture.
    Strategically placed sensors can automatically sense and transmit data to the
    cloud for further documentation, forecasting or controlling applications. Sensors
    are used to monitor crop parameters such as leaf area index (e.g. Bauer & Aschenbruck,
    2018), plant height and leaf colour, size and shape (e.g. Okayasu et al., 2017);
    soil parameters such as soil moisture (e.g. Brinkhoff et al., 2017, Kodali and
    Sahu, 2016) or soil chemistry (e.g. Kassal et al., 2018); irrigation water parameters
    such as pH and salinity (e.g. Popović et al., 2017); or weather parameters such
    as air temperature, air pressure, air relative humidity, rainfall, radiation,
    wind speed and wind direction (e.g. Yan et al., 2018). In addition, remote sensing
    can also be employed, i.e. instead of sensors placed in the field they are installed
    on satellites or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). However, these measurements mostly
    require some form of processing and interpretation as the values sampled are not
    directly related to the targeted parameters. An example of monitoring through
    remote sensing is the estimation of crop biomass and nitrogen content by the use
    of hyper- and multispectral images (Näsi et al., 2018), or the use of thermal
    remote sensing, which has been applied for e.g. irrigation scheduling or plant
    disease detection (Khanal, Fulton, & Shearer, 2017). Furthermore, agricultural
    machinery can also be remotely monitored, e.g. vehicle position and yield data
    (Oksanen et al., 2016), or machine performance (Miettinen et al., 2006). This
    is especially relevant with the increasing appearance of autonomous vehicles and
    robots in agriculture (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). Finally, at farm level the storage
    of crops can also be monitored to ensure the correct control of, for example,
    temperature and moisture, and avoid losses due to damage (Green et al., 2009,
    Juul et al., 2015). Environmental impact indicators should be integrated into
    farm monitoring applications, so that leaching (Burton, Dave, Fernandez, Jayachandran,
    & Bhansali, 2018), contaminants (Severino, D’Urso, Scarfato, & Toraldo, 2018)
    or emissions (Manap & Najib, 2014) are addressed too. 4.2. Documentation and traceability
    Collected operations and process data once stored can be used for documentation.
    Documentation is usually the natural application of monitored data but it must
    be noted that it can also include other types of sampled data, such as manually
    input or documentation of performed control actions (Sørensen, Pesonen, Bochtis,
    Vougioukas, & Suomi, 2011). The data are stored as raw data or as processed data
    at different levels. Documentation is essential for decision-making, controlling
    or analytics, and is an indispensable element in FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    Mapping is also a form of documentation where data are spatially projected onto
    a map. On-the-go sensors installed on vehicles and implements can be used for
    automated field mapping (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015), e.g. yield mapping used
    for later fertilisation planning (Lyle, Bryan, & Ostendorf, 2014), or soil mapping
    for site-specific amendment measures (Godwin and Miller, 2003, McBratney et al.,
    2003). Remote sensing can also be used for mapping crop development (Khanal et
    al., 2017, Näsi et al., 2018, Viljanen et al., 2018), or soil texture and residue
    coverage (Khanal et al., 2017). Remote sensing is becoming a popular tool for
    monitoring and mapping, but is yet to be proven feasible for all its potential
    applications. When documentation data sets extend beyond the farm level so that
    they can be traced throughout the supply chain, it is often referred as traceability
    and this notion is a key element in agri-food supply chain management as a measure
    to satisfy, for example, consumer demands (Bochtis and Sørensen, 2014, Pesonen
    et al., 2014). 4.3. Forecasting Forecasting is one of the fundamental functions
    for decision making that IoT brings to agriculture. Access to “real-time” data
    and historical data is used for forecasting events that require some form of action
    for managing successfully the crop or field operation. Therefore, both monitoring
    and documentation are important prerequisites for enabling forecasting. Forecasting
    is employed as preventive measures that require some action due to a predicted
    event, e.g. weeding, irrigating or harvesting. Machine learning and scientific
    modelling are examples of tools employed for forecasting. Different machine learning
    models have been employed, e.g. Artificial Neural Networks for forecasting maximum
    and minimum temperatures at field level (Aliev, 2018) or for estimating levels
    of phosphorus (P) in the soil (Estrada-López, Castillo-Atoche, Vázquez-castillo,
    & Sánchez-Sinencio, 2018); support vector regression method for forecasting soil
    moisture (Goap et al., 2018) or plant disease detection (Aasha Nandhini, Hemalatha,
    Radha, & Indumathi, 2017); gradient boosting for predicting irrigation recommendations
    (Goldstein, Fink, & Meitin, 2018); Bayesian networks and random forest for frost
    prediction (Diedrichs, Bromberg, Dujovne, Brun-laguna, & Watteyne, 2018); multiple
    linear regression and random forest in estimating yield and fertilisation requirements
    for forecasting harvest and fertilisation dates (Viljanen et al., 2018); or also
    for frost prediction using four different machine learning algorithms: decision
    tree, boosted tree, random forest, and regression (Moon, Kim, Zhang, & Woo, 2018).
    A rather different forecasting approach was employed by Jain, Sarangi, Bhatt,
    and Pappula (2018), where three different models, i.e. random forest, support
    vector machine and artificial neural network were used for forecasting diseases
    and at the same time for adaptive data collection from the network of nodes in
    order to reduce data traffic and energy consumption of the network. Summarising,
    IoT is allowing the sampling of large amounts of data, which can be employed as
    training data by the machine learning algorithms to build predictive mathematical
    models. Machine learning is opening new possibilities for effectively forecasting
    events in arable farming, which might change the very nature of decision making
    in agriculture. Scientific modelling has also been employed for forecasting in
    an IoT context, e.g. soil moisture dynamics and contaminant migration forecasting
    using soil sensor data and precipitation forecasts for irrigation scheduling (Severino
    et al., 2018); fungal disease forecast in winter wheat (El Jarroudi et al., 2017)
    and barley (Mäyrä, Ruusunen, Jalli, Jauhiainen, & Leiviskä, 2018); or forecasting
    field trafficability and workability for field operations (Edwards, White, Munkholm,
    Sørensen, & Lamandé, 2016). These modelling tools have an important role in agriculture
    as they are conscientiously developed and validated by the scientific community,
    and can forecast events for which machine learning models are very limited. There
    is also considerable potential for integrating existing and acknowledged modelling
    tools such as the soil-crop-atmosphere system model DAISY (Abrahamsen & Hansen,
    2000) or the soil erosion model RUSLE (Renard, Foster, Weesies, & Porter, 1991)
    into an IoT solution. Many of these solutions can make agriculture in general,
    and arable farming in particular, more resource efficient, e.g. through smart
    irrigation, as well as environmentally friendly, e.g. by smart pest and disease
    management. 4.4. Controlling In IoT, controlling is the result of active monitoring
    in an automated system, where the monitored variables are automatically adjusted
    to, for example, predefined thresholds. Forecasting can also play an important
    role in controlling. This is, for example, the case in smart irrigation systems,
    where irrigation is activated before drought damage in the crop is recognised,
    thus reducing yield losses. Goap et al. (2018) employed real-time sensing of soil
    moisture and soil temperature in combination with weather forecasts to control
    a fully autonomous irrigation scheme. Sensors on-the-go installed in tractors
    and implements can also be used to control e.g. variable rate fertilisation (Peets
    et al., 2012), site-specific weed control technologies (Christensen et al., 2009),
    or in-row cultivation controlled by plant patterns in precision seeding (Midtiby,
    Steen, & Green, 2018). Controlling is crucial in smart farming as it allows the
    automation of systems, especially considering the operations of autonomous vehicles
    and robots in the fields (Bechar & Vigneault, 2016), where site-specific actions
    and sensing-based safety systems will play an important role, e.g. for in-field
    obstacle detection for autonomous vehicles (Christiansen, Nielsen, Steen, Jørgensen,
    & Karstoft, 2016). 4.5. FMIS FMIS can be defined as systems that store and process
    farm-related collected data and provide decision supporting tools for farm management
    (Paraforos et al., 2016). FMIS assist farmers in the execution and documentation
    of farm activities, their evaluation and optimisation, as well as in strategic,
    tactical and operational planning of the farm operations (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    FMIS are consequently systems that can encapsulate all the applications previously
    described, and are vital elements in smart farm management. However, the adoption
    of FMIS targeted to the new IoT technologies is slow. A study published in 2015
    showed that most FMIS architectures used at that time had been designed in the
    1980s by researchers. This may explain why most FMIS currently have a structure
    and an architecture that is not suitable for distributed and service oriented
    decision support required for supporting precision agriculture and smart farming
    solutions, e.g. 75% of FMIS are still PC-based, and functionalities regarding
    traceability, quality assurance and agronomic best practice estimate are still
    missing or in their initial development stages in most commercial FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al., 2015). FMIS are key in smart farming and they should support
    automatic data acquisition, monitoring, documenting, planning and decision making
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). The latest research on IoT-based FMIS is expected
    to become part of the commercial FMIS available in the near future and will cover
    different needs across the supply chain and needs of IoT-based agriculture as
    a whole, as well as complying with standards ensuring interoperability between
    systems. In addition, decision support systems (DSS) are essential in dealing
    with Big Data and assisting the farm manager in management and decision making
    in tasks such as farm financial analysis, business processes or supply chain functions
    (Fountas, Carli et al., 2015, Kaloxylos et al., 2012). In order to design an up-to-date
    FMIS, it is beneficial to make preliminary use of dedicated system analysis methodologies,
    such as soft system methodologies (SSM), for identifying required changes and
    constraints and proposing solutions, followed by a later hard system modelling
    for designing the required specifications and components of the system (Sørensen
    et al., 2010, Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015). It is also necessary to base FMIS
    on the cloud as it allows interconnection with diverse additional services (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). This development points out the inevitable need for standardisation
    of APIs in order to achieve interoperability among applications and services as
    part of the FMIS. New technologies such as distributed management systems can
    also enhance the capabilities of FMIS to a great extent (Fountas, Sørensen et
    al., 2015). Furthermore, the introduction of agricultural moving robots in the
    near future, as well as the wireless and automatic control and monitoring of agricultural
    machinery, also needs to be considered in the design and development of FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al, 2015, Paraforos et al., 2016). The future FMIS will also be capable
    of emulating farmers different work habits, as the system will automate certain
    tasks previously performed by farmers, which will require additional training
    (Sørensen et al., 2011). Consequently, it is important to provide supportive adoption
    and transition strategies for conventional farming to convert into smart farming
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). Examples of current FMIS employed in arable farming
    are offered by different technology providers: machine manufacturers, institutions
    or targeted private companies. Some manufacturers provide their own farm management
    tools, such as Agricultural Management Solutions (AMS) from John Deere, or Precision
    Land Management (PLM) from New Holland. Across brands some FMIS have a more local
    approach, e.g. the Dutch Akkerweb developed by Wageningen University and Research,
    while other commercial solutions have a global approach, e.g. 365FarmNet, Agworld
    or FarmWorks. 4.6. Vehicle navigation, optimisation and logistics Navigation systems
    are widely used in arable farming with the successful implementation of auto-steering
    systems in tractors and harvesters. However, IoT-based solutions are still in
    their early stages. IoT-based field operation monitoring (Oksanen et al., 2016)
    or monitoring of motor and machine performance (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015) have been
    effectively implemented on harvesting operations. Commercial examples of agricultural
    telematics are Trimble''s Connected Farm, AGCO''s AgCommand, John Deer JDLink,
    New Holland''s PLM Connect or CLAAS’ telematics; however, they are all closed
    systems, which limits greatly the possibilities of the IoT technologies, especially
    interoperability (Oksanen, Piirainen, & Seilonen, 2015). Regarding optimised route
    planning, pre-planning harvest operations based on field data using simulation
    models can improve the harvest capacity of the vehicle or fleet saving working
    hours as well as fuel consumption (Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Bochtis and Sørensen,
    2009, Busato et al., 2007, Jensen et al., 2012, Zhou et al., 2014). However, field
    complexity and vehicle fleet size can become major hurdles for the algorithms
    employed (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019, Skou-Nielsen et al., 2017). The accessibility
    of field and harvest data can be eased by IoT technologies that allow automated
    data collection and sharing via common communication protocols and standards,
    in interoperable data formats, with compatible data model hierarchies; however,
    this is not always the case (Tzounis et al., 2017). IoT also allows cloud or fog
    computing to be employed to solve the high computational requirements of these
    route planning models (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019), even though the computing can
    also be achieved at the edge (Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Data communication
    costs, latency problems and unstable mobile connectivity may pose important challenges
    for route planning applications that rely only on cloud computing, making mobile
    edge computing more adequate and robust for these systems. Nevertheless, true
    IoT-based dynamic route planning is still in its infancy but gaining increasing
    attention, especially with the arrival of agricultural robots (Bechar and Vigneault,
    2016, Kayacan et al., 2015). Concerning its application, until recently, harvest
    logistics has employed field sampled data, i.e. boundaries, obstacles, gates,
    etc., to optimise the route of the vehicles involved in the operation statically
    (e.g. Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Jensen et al., 2012), where the complete routes
    of all vehicles are planned a priori. Nevertheless, these plans often do not comply
    with real-world challenges as they do not adapt to variating inputs, e.g. vehicle
    speed changes or in-field yield variations, or to unforeseen situations, e.g.
    machine breakdowns, eventual out of field delays, non-trafficable wet spots, undefined
    obstacles, etc. There is consequently the need to integrate route optimisation
    and operation logistics in IoT systems, where the optimisation can adapt dynamically
    to varying input and unforeseen events. It is only in the last few years that
    harvest logistics really started adapting dynamically to parameters such as vehicles''
    behaviour or in-field yield variations (Edwards et al., 2017, Seyyedhasani and
    Dvorak, 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Today, new possibilities for optimising
    infield operations arrive with the large amount of data available via internet,
    e.g. remote sensing data or other collected spatial data. These could be adaptive
    planning based on trafficability maps for reducing soil compaction or avoiding
    vehicles getting stuck in wet spots; or selective harvesting based on predicted
    grain quality maps, which is expected to increase the value of the crop harvested.
    5. Challenges and solutions When implementing IoT in arable farming, as well as
    in other contexts, diverse challenges limit or affect the performance of the systems
    employed. The challenges identified in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5) can indicate
    which areas need to be taken into account when designing an IoT-based system or
    point out areas that require further research. However, the results presented
    in the figure are indicative and do not necessarily describe the importance of
    the challenges included, especially because of the multiple applications and implementation
    designs that are conceivable in arable farming. Any of the challenges can become
    crucial in different setups, and are therefore described. In addition, all challenges
    can be related to or have consequences for other challenges. Download : Download

    of challenges mentioned by the literature reviewed, divided by time periods and
    grouped in IoT layers. Interoperability, in general, is a major hurdle in the
    application of IoT. There are different dimensions related to it: technical, syntactical,
    semantic and organisational (Serrano et al., 2015, Veer and Wiles, 2008). Technical
    interoperability refers mostly to the communication protocols which affect the
    hardware and software components implemented. Syntactical interoperability is
    usually related to data formats, their syntax and encoding. Semantic interoperability
    concerns the interpretation of data contents, i.e. the meaning of the information
    exchanged. And organisational interoperability involves intercommunication of
    meaningful information across organisations regardless of information systems
    and infrastructures in a world-wide scale. As interoperability is such a generic
    term, in this section, technical interoperability has been addressed as part of
    the communication protocol challenge, syntactical and semantic interoperability
    have been included under the data heterogeneity challenge, and organisational
    interoperability have been described under the scalability challenge. 5.1. General
    challenges 5.1.1. Revenue and affordability Often the investment for establishing
    an IoT-based solution is high and as such challenging for small-scale farmers,
    while larger farms can more easily acquire IoT-based technologies when investing
    in new equipment (Brewster et al., 2017). The uncertainty regarding required costs,
    e.g. fuel or water allocations, and selling prices of the product give little
    margin for many farmers for investing in new technologies (Higgins et al., 2017).
    Trust plays an important role when investing in IoT systems, and relieving the
    perceived risks by demonstrating the revenues from their adoption is essential
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Jayashankar et al., 2018). For example, in Europe
    70% of all fertilising and spraying machinery is equipped with at least one precision
    agriculture technology, but only 25% of farmers actually use precision agriculture
    components on their farms (Say, Keskin, Sehri, & Sekerli, 2017). Technology providers
    need to increase the perceived value by demonstrating the financial return from
    IoT in order to diminish the perceived risk of adoption many farmers have. Technology
    providers need also to provide robust tools that are aligned with farmer needs
    and practices in order to gain acceptance and trust of IoT technologies. These
    technologies need to reduce the workload, assist in decision making and improve
    the efficiency of the targeted practice. Additionally, technology providers need
    to develop interoperable and flexible solutions that can easily be integrated
    and comply with accepted standards. Governments can also incentivise IoT adoption
    by policies and regulations, especially regarding documentation and traceability
    as ICT eases paperwork and bureaucracy. A reduction in the percentage of mentions
    regarding this challenge (see Fig. 5) could indicate that IoT is being more adopted
    in arable farming. In addition, IoT is likely to reshape the arable farming business.
    The implementation of monitoring and control of farming operations are generating
    substantial amounts of valuable data that are essential for the business of technology
    providers. The way farmers will dive into the data economy, i.e. connecting their
    data to work in vertical and horizontal networks beyond the farm, will have an
    effect on their business models, as well as on the business models of technology
    providers. The point of view of the farmer''s business regarding IoT has not been
    fully addressed in the literature reviewed and will require further investigation.
    5.1.2. Data heterogeneity The diverse data sources and sensor manufacturers imply
    use of different unit systems, data structures and nomenclatures in different
    data formats, which result in reduced syntactical and semantic interoperability
    among IoT environments. Sensor data can be encoded in binary, or represented in
    formats such as json, xml, text (e.g. csv), shapefile, or even proprietary formats.
    The heterogeneity of data types and formats can also affect the performance of
    a protocol employed for communicating the information. Furthermore, this challenge
    becomes critical in situations such as system integration or sharing data with
    other systems (e.g. FMIS), which could imply developing data conversion tools
    or even redesign of the IoT setup. The use of standardised formats can help with
    this challenge. Some attempts have been made at producing standards or standardised
    formats that cover the great heterogeneity of agricultural data, e.g. ISO 11783
    (ISOBUS) developed by the Agricultural Industry Electronics Foundation (AEF) for
    tractors and agricultural machinery, which is very relevant in arable farming
    (Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015, Miettinen et al., 2006, Oksanen et al., 2015,
    Peets et al., 2012) or AgroXML developed by the Association for Technologies and
    Structures in Agriculture (KTBL) mainly for FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014, Köksal
    and Tekinerdogan, 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Peets et al., 2012). These
    are now being integrated by the non-profit organisation AgGateway through the
    ADAPT framework and SPADE project for seamlessly communicating agricultural machinery
    data to FMIS, trying to enhance the existing standards and as a consequence improve
    interoperability (Brewster et al., 2017). A drawback of comprehensive data models,
    which try to describe all attributes of agricultural data, is that they become
    too cumbersome to handle in many applications. Finally, the use of middleware
    platforms applicable in smart farming, e.g. FIWARE or SmartFarmNet, can also reduce
    the problems caused by data heterogeneity (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Ferreira
    et al., 2017, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). 5.1.3. Scalability
    and flexibility Organisational interoperability is a key element concerning scalability
    and flexibility (Serrano et al., 2015, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). Many
    of the systems described in the literature reviewed are centralised, closed, difficult
    to integrate in other existing platforms or difficult to implement on larger scales,
    different farming systems or geographical areas. They are also challenging to
    integrate beyond the farm level and across the supply chain in order to provide
    agri-food safety and traceability. The use of standardised dynamic protocols,
    such as SOAP protocol (cloud-based infrastructures with extensible ontologies
    that cover the broad and diverse agricultural production systems and environments),
    fast and reliable APIs (e.g. RESTful) and middleware platforms applicable for
    smart agriculture, such as FIWARE with its generic enablers, are tools that are
    employed to achieve organisational interoperability and make the system developed
    more scalable and flexible (Ferreira et al., 2017, López-Riquelme et al., 2017,
    O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). Service-Oriented Architectures
    (SOA) also bring possibilities to effectively integrate ecosystems through open
    and standardised interfaces, increasing organisational interoperability (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014, Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Kruize et al., 2016, Pesonen et al.,
    2014, Sørensen and Bochtis, 2010). Scalability and flexibility may also refer
    to WSNs in the literature, to their capacity to support an increasing number of
    devices/nodes, with the network architecture, the gateway and protocols used being
    the main constrains (Elijah et al., 2018). This challenge has been considered
    under the network size challenge. 5.1.4. Robustness and fault tolerance Many different
    factors can affect the overall robustness and fault tolerance of a system. Robust
    wireless connectivity is an important limitation in many setups (Oksanen et al.,
    2016, Vuran et al., 2018). In the design of an IoT-based solution dealing with
    faults, errors and unforeseen events need to be taken into account in order to
    ensure the reliability of the system. Many of these issues are related to the
    other challenges presented here and can be handled at the device level, but also
    need to be thought of in the overall IoT system design (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    Ray, 2017). 5.1.5. Complexity The agricultural system is complex and can be challenging
    to work with. It is complex not only because of the multifaceted nature of the
    physical, chemical and/or biological processes in the soil-crop-air system, but
    also because of the technical complexity of hardware and software interacting
    with it. Depending on the novelty of the IoT technology implemented and the background
    of the developer and user, the systems can become more or less complex. For example,
    software and hardware incompatibilities can challenge its implementation and integration
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016), as well as many other challenges, e.g. the great
    field task diversity in arable farming, that can add complexity to the system.
    Technical knowledge can become a major hurdle for the implementation of IoT in
    farms, and it is therefore important that user-friendliness and plug-and-play
    basis have a high priority for the technology providers (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Zou and Quan, 2017). Complexity should be an issue for the technology provider
    and not for the customer. In addition, the co-created development and implementation
    of IoT systems in agriculture by a multi-actor approach is needed to overcome
    the complexity at different levels of integrating IoT in agriculture. Good examples
    of this are the European Union supported research and development efforts through
    multi-actor large-scale pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Verdouw et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019). 5.1.6. Lack of products In the early stages of precision
    agriculture and IoT in agriculture, products that integrated agronomy and ICT
    engineering were lacking, which hindered their adoption (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Kitchen and Roger, 2007). The large scales and diversity of environments
    in arable farming can challenge the products used even more than in controlled
    environments, as they are to be modelled to describe larger areas, send information
    through larger distances and be exposed to harsher environments. Even if Figure
    5 shows lack of references in the last couple of years, it is still relevant for
    some applications, e.g. for in-situ real-time soil nutrient sensing is still a
    real challenge, especially regarding calibration (Bünemann et al., 2018, Marín-González
    et al., 2013). 5.2. Device layer challenges 5.2.1. Power consumption The use of
    wireless devices has major advantages over wired systems, as they are more economical
    to establish and can cover much wider areas. However, their power consumption,
    with limited battery life, is a major drawback of many wireless systems, and needs
    to be accounted for. This issue is so important that it is the main identified
    challenge in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5), especially for WSNs (Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tan and Panda, 2010). The large distances to cover in arable farming make
    wireless devices indispensable, and solutions to reduce their power consumption
    and/or extend their battery life are required. These solutions can include energy
    harvesting, low power consumption sensors and communication technologies or power
    efficient management. Energy harvesting techniques can include solar cells, micro
    wind turbines or other interesting solutions which have been well described by
    Tuna and Gungor (2016) and Jawad et al. (2017). The power consumption of the communication
    technologies and sensors employed are also to be considered in the design of the
    IoT solution as there are big differences between devices (Balmos et al., 2016,
    Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). Choosing low power sensors
    and communication devices needs to be taken into account when designing the IoT
    system (Estrada-López et al., 2018). Low power wireless technologies, such as
    BLE, have low power consumption but also low communication range, while Wi-Fi
    has somewhat higher communication range, but much higher power consumption (Table
    1), however data rates and other parameters are important factors to consider
    too. ZigBee and LoRa have been identified as appropriate candidates for many farming
    applications (Jawad et al., 2017). Power efficient management techniques of WSNs
    include sleep/active schemes, e.g. duty-cycling algorithms (Ahmed, Abdalla et
    al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Alahmadi et al., 2017, Balmos et al., 2016,
    Dhall and Agrawal, 2018, Temprilho et al., 2018); data mitigation schemes, e.g.
    data aggregation (Abdel-basset, Shawky, & Eldrandaly, 2018) or data compression
    (Moon et al., 2018); energy-efficient routing schemes, e.g. mobile sinks by the
    use of UAVs (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018,
    Uddin et al., 2018); and other combined solutions, e.g. LEACH, a cluster architecture
    with Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based MAC protocol and data aggregation
    scheme (Kamarudin, Ahmad, & Ndzi, 2016), or dynamic power management by combining
    sleep/active states with dynamic data rates schemes (Estrada-López et al., 2018).
    Jawad et al. (2017) have provided a good overview and description of WSN power
    efficient management techniques. Lastly, techniques such as edge computing may
    have higher power requirements on the device, making cloud computing more desirable
    if power consumption is a constraint in the projected IoT solution. On the other
    hand, mounting sensors and devices on agricultural vehicles and implements allows
    connection to the power supply of the vehicle and as a consequence eliminate power
    consumption as a limiting factor. The type of sensors that are mounted on vehicles
    and their implements is quite limited, being currently mainly camera-based (e.g.
    Midtiby et al., 2018, Steen et al., 2012). Nevertheless, there is for example
    potential in employing sensors on the coulters of seed-drills for mapping soil
    properties (Nielsen et al., 2017), or other on-the-go sensors for mapping soil
    or crop variations (Peets et al., 2012). 5.2.2. Harsh device environment The natural
    environment in which sensors and other devices are placed can greatly challenge
    their functionality and longevity. Harsh weather conditions, e.g. large temperature
    variations, intense rainfall or prolonged high humidity can cause water condensation
    inside devices and consequently provoke corrosion and short circuits (Bauer &
    Aschenbruck, 2018). Sensors and other devices situated close to the ground experience
    exposure to dust, mud, or even corrosive chemicals, e.g. agro-chemicals, which
    can seriously damage the performance of the device or cause its total failure
    (Aliev, 2018, Bauer and Aschenbruck, 2018). Underground chemical sensors are also
    exposed to soil chemical and biological processes that deteriorate the sensors
    and can mislead the measurements, requiring unfeasible maintenance and re-calibrations
    (Burton et al., 2018, Kassal et al., 2018). Choosing adequate casing that does
    not interfere with the functionality of the device and also tolerates the environment
    they are located in is essential in the design of the IoT system. Sensors are
    also developed for different conditions, and need to match the system''s minimum
    requirements. RFID tags have been reported to perform flawlessly under extreme
    conditions and environments (Costa et al., 2013, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011);
    however, RFID technology is quite limited in its applications in arable farming,
    and suitable sensors and communication devices are therefore primarily dependent
    on the application and design of the IoT system. 5.3. Network layer challenges
    5.3.1. Latency, throughput and rate The large amounts of data generated in IoT
    applications do not only cause problems regarding data storage or handling, but
    also latency problems that reduce the throughput of the network employed. In arable
    farming, latency problems can be of great importance in some IoT solutions, e.g.
    in WSNs where high latency implies higher power consumption of a node (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017), or in dynamic optimised route planning in vehicle logistics, which
    requires rapid responses to deviations in the route plan (Villa-Henriksen et al.,
    2018). For reducing latency problems, fog and edge computing can be employed,
    as these computing techniques decrease latency and network congestion (Elijah
    et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018), e.g. data compression at the edge
    reduces the large volumes of data communicated through the network (Moon et al.,
    2018). In addition, the use of lightweight protocols can also reduce latency problems,
    e.g. LP4S for sensors (Hernández-rojas, Fernández-Caramés, Fraga-Lamas, & Escudero,
    2018), or MQTT messaging protocol, which has a faster throughput than HTTP and
    works well for bandwidth limited networks (Estrada-López et al., 2018). The communication
    rate is important to have in mind when planning the wireless communication technology
    to implement, e.g. 5G can handle high-rates, while SigFox or IEEE 802.15.4-based
    protocols are for low-rates (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton,
    Gotta et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). The throughput of the network affects
    the communication rate, and the communication rate also influences the power consumption,
    which equally has to be carefully considered. Fast response to events is achieved
    by data processing techniques such as data merging (Tanaka, 2018), data compression
    (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018), or dynamic and complex event
    processing rules for conditioning input data and immediately acting accordingly
    (Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018). These processes can be on the cloud or at the edge,
    i.e. devices. Finally, test-bed analysis prior to implementation of the network
    can simulate communication rates and possible latency and throughput issues (Stewart,
    Stewart, & Kennedy, 2017). 5.3.2. Wireless link quality A low wireless link quality
    affects greatly the QoS of an IoT system as it ends in unreliable communication
    between nodes (Klaina, Alejos, Aghzout, & Falcone, 2018). This can be caused by
    multipath propagation (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), background noise (Mazon-Olivo
    et al., 2018), routing problems, e.g. packet collision or limited band width (Jawad
    et al., 2017), or even by harsh environmental conditions, which affect the transceivers
    and the quality of the data transmitted (Elijah et al., 2018). Adequate design
    and testing of the network are crucial for avoiding or reducing this challenge.
    However, techniques such as channel access methods, e.g. TDMA, can improve the
    link quality by reducing packet collisions (Temprilho et al., 2018). Regarding
    testing, the calculation of signal strengths in real-time on the base station
    helps estimating the wireless link quality of a WSN when establishing the system
    (Klaina et al., 2018). Packet loss characterisation can also be used to assess
    the wireless link quality of a connection (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018,
    Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018). Additionally, blind entity identification
    can also help estimating the wireless link quality of a network (Mukherjee, Misra,
    Raghuwanshi, & Mitra, 2018). 5.3.3. Communication range The different wireless
    communication technologies have very diverse ranges, which need to be accounted
    for when designing the IoT solution, together with other factors such as data
    rate, power consumption, communication protocols or costs (Table 1). In arable
    farming, due to the larger farm sizes and because of the employment of mobile
    sensors and devices on vehicles, this challenge becomes even more critical. Furthermore,
    relying on the approximate communication range of a wireless technology can be
    misleading, e.g. WiFi is often described to have 100 m range, but a test analysing
    the packet delivery ratio with respect to distance to gateway shows packet losses
    at ≥ 60 m (Giordano, Seitanidis, Ojo, Adami, & Vignoli, 2018), while in another
    test using WiField devices, 2.6 km range was claimed to be reached still having
    reliable internet connection (Brinkhoff et al., 2017). Testing the communication
    range is therefore important for some settings. In addition to the choice of wireless
    technology, network topology in WSNs, such as mesh topologies can also increase
    the communication range by using nodes to communicate with the central node (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018). Reduced range due to obstacles
    or topography is addressed in the propagation losses challenge later. 5.3.4. Communication
    protocols Differences in communication protocols can cause technical interoperability
    issues, which can lead to connectivity and compatibility issues among the hardware
    and software employed (Stočes et al., 2016). Network protocols are separated into
    diverse layers forming a protocol stack, where tasks are divided into smaller
    steps (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). In the infrastructure
    layer, some wireless standards that define communication protocols are commonly
    used by different wireless technologies, e.g. IEEE 802.15.4, which is used by
    ZigBee or 6LowPAN among others, or 3GPP, which is used by GPRS, LTE or 5G among
    others (see Table 1). In the application layer, standards such as HTTP (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Kaloxylos et al., 2014), MQTT (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016, Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018) or XMPP (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018)
    are commonly used in IoT applications in arable farming. Adequate protocols are
    especially relevant and challenging in vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and crucial
    in arable farming. Different standards in different layers require careful planning
    of the whole IoT solution, as they are not always compatible and can also have
    an effect on the data formats used, or sensors and gateways employed (Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018). Middleware platforms can ease the integration of diverse protocols
    and standards by offering enough abstraction levels so that this diversity is
    effectively managed (O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Tuna et al., 2017). Edge computing
    can also ease technical interoperability issues as a local computing layer is
    created to process data and create control rules before sending the data to the
    cloud (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). 5.3.5. Network management Managing a WSN
    can imply battery change, software updates, calibration of sensors, replacement
    of devices and similar maintenance activities that can be very time-consuming.
    Smart mobile devices, e.g. smart phones, can make remote software updating possible,
    and can sometimes even be used for updating some other IoT devices (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016). Using energy efficient devices and communication techniques can
    also be employed to extend the battery life of devices (Jawad et al., 2017). Some
    sensors may require recalibrations with a certain periodicity, which has to be
    accounted for in the projected IoT solution (Kassal et al., 2018). Nonetheless,
    the management of the network is always to be considered when implementing IoT
    solutions in arable farming, where distances and number of devices/nodes can be
    vast. 5.3.6. Network size WSN configuration schemes have a maximum number of sensor
    nodes per gateway that the network can handle, i.e. the network size. According
    to the analysis of the reviewed literature, network size is being identified more
    often in the last two years (see Fig. 5), which seems to indicate new possibilities
    for exploiting the capabilities of WSNs. Network size depends on the wireless
    communication technology employed and can affect other parameters, such as data
    latency or scalability of the network (Balmos et al., 2016). Network topologies
    can also influence the network size and vary from simple star network (e.g. Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018) to more advanced multi-hop mesh networks (Ahmed, Abdalla et al.,
    2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Langendoen et al., 2006) that can increase the network
    size by using network nodes as relays to reach a central node and gateway. Optimisation
    algorithms have been used to find the best spatial distribution of WSN nodes,
    and therefore to assist in the optimisation of its network size (Abdel-basset
    et al., 2018). 5.3.7. Propagation losses Even though propagation losses can become
    a big problem for WSNs in application areas like fruit orchards and tree plantations,
    in arable farming hedges, trees, big rocks or sheds, as well as pronounced topography,
    like hills and valleys, can also block, diffract or scatter the signal reducing
    the communication range and causing data packet losses. Additionally, weather
    conditions can also degrade the wireless connectivity propagation of signals (Jawad
    et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Stewart et al., 2017). To avoid or reduce
    these problems, adequate planning of the location of the sensor nodes, the antenna
    height, the communication protocols and the network topology is necessary. Regarding
    network topologies, mesh networks compared to star networks can reduce propagation
    losses as well as increase communication range (Kamarudin et al., 2016, Ruiz-Garcia
    and Lunadei, 2011). Moreover, propagation modelling can help planning, reduce
    communication tests and ensure Quality of Service (QoS) for heterogeneous wireless
    networks (Jawad et al., 2017, Stewart et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Klaina
    et al., 2018, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011). 5.4. Application layer challenges
    5.4.1. Data analysis Data analysis can in some cases become an important challenge,
    especially when dealing with Big Data, which is data in such amounts, heterogeneity
    and complexity that they need new data management techniques for analysis (Wolfert
    et al., 2017). Agricultural Big Data are worthless unless analysed; however, analysis
    can be very challenging because of the volume, diversity, and quality (e.g. errors
    and duplications). This is especially challenging in arable farming, where larger
    amounts of heterogeneous data are generated at diverse rates and from very different
    sources. The literature reviewed show an increased identification of this challenge
    in the last two years compared with the previous 6 years (see Fig. 5). This evolution
    might be caused by increased access and use of agricultural Big Data in recent
    times (Kamilaris et al., 2017, Pham and Stack, 2018). Techniques for lowering
    data dimensionality can ease the analysis by applying feature reduction models,
    which reduce data size by eliminating unnecessary data dimensions (Sabarina &
    Priya, 2015). Cloud computing provides the flexibility and scalability necessary
    for Big Data analysis, where numerous users operate simultaneously with the large
    and complex datasets (Gill et al., 2017). Likewise, cloud platforms are perfect
    for storing such large amounts of data, where NoSQL databases can store and manage
    these large unstructured datasets (Kamilaris et al., 2017). The analysis of Big
    Data can potentially be used, for example, for policy-making, reducing environmental
    negative impact, improve food-safety, as well as improved farm management and
    production, benefiting the different stakeholders involved (Kamilaris et al.,
    2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). Another facet to data analysis is the growing use
    of machine learning techniques, which are being used for exploring Big Data and
    identifying important factors and their interrelationship that affect agricultural
    production systems like, for example, identifying diverse patterns (e.g. crop
    development stages, weeds or diseases) as part of machine vision systems (Bacco,
    Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018, Reshma and Pillai,
    2018). In these cases, the model is built upon a sample of data, often called
    training data, whose size and quality directly affects the final model. Choosing
    the adequate approach for building the model with the available data is also essential
    for the success of the IoT solution. 5.4.2. Data security and privacy Even though
    data security and privacy do not constitute a high challenge in the literature
    reviewed, they are certainly major concerns for the farmers, i.e. the suppliers
    of data and also end-users of the technology developed, who have little trust
    in service providers'' use of data (Jayashankar et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2017).
    Also, data ownership needs to be taken into consideration as raw data and processed
    data in IoT systems have different ownership and are accessible by different actors,
    affecting the necessary requirements for data security and privacy (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). Research and development focus has been on sensing, processing,
    controlling and computing, while less effort has been devoted to solving security
    threats, risks and privacy (Tuna et al., 2017). Other issues like cost effectiveness
    in, for example, cloud services are also affecting the security of the data, which
    eventually affects the whole privacy and security of the IoT solution, as low-cost
    services have lower security (Dhinari, Newe, Lewis, & Nizamani, 2017). Technology
    providers should prioritise data security and privacy in their business models.
    The availability of privacy and security technologies that are dynamic enough
    to support the vast numbers and variety of stakeholders, as well as the complexity
    of the network, is still a major challenge that needs to be overcome (Verdouw,
    2016). Many solutions are being employed to reduce data security and privacy issues
    in each of the IoT layers of the system, e.g. encryption algorithms, intrusion
    detection mechanisms, authentication, secure routing protocols, anonymisation,
    etc. (Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Middleware platforms are employed
    to add a security layer between network and applications, which can include confidentiality,
    anonymity and security to the system (Rodriguez et al., 2018, Serrano et al.,
    2015, Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Additionally, newer technologies
    such as blockchain are aiming to solve many of the challenges related to privacy
    and security as well as transparency of the IoT. In agriculture, it is mainly
    being applied in the food supply chain (Bermeo-Almeida et al., 2018). Blockchain
    make sense for IoT platforms where large amounts of confidential data are handled.
    5.4.3. Data quality and availability Some of the challenges previously described
    have a direct influence on data quality, e.g. propagation losses, wireless link
    quality, robustness and fault tolerance. Anomaly detection and similar methods
    have been employed to identify faulty data before analysis (Cadavid et al., 2018,
    Lyle et al., 2014). The poor quality of data or its limited availability can limit
    many applications that involve Big Data analytics, modelling and machine learning,
    which can affect or even compromise the success of some IoT solutions (Balducci
    et al., 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). In these setups,
    and specifically in arable farming, many datasets are integrated from different
    sources and sensors, and the quality or scarcity of some data can become a major
    hurdle to overcome. Ensuring quality and availability of the data before starting
    such a project is required. Even if it is not always possible to gather all the
    data necessary to develop models, perform correct analytics or train machine learning
    algorithms, scientific assumptions (Severino et al., 2018), data augmentation
    (Diedrichs et al., 2018) or simulated data (Wolanin et al., 2019) are used to
    help or solve the encountered challenge. 5.4.4. Context-awareness (metadata) Context-awareness
    is an important and distinctive feature of Smart Farming as compared to Precision
    Farming, because it automatically includes descriptive data from e.g. fields,
    sensors, machines, i.e. metadata. Metadata can include information about the date
    and time, node identification number, data of calibration, height and position
    information, or even descriptive data about an experiment objective, field, machinery,
    crop genotype or soil information at the sensor placement (Jayaraman et al., 2015).
    Metadata about sensor nodes in the system are crucial for providing contextual
    information so that correct data analysis can be performed (Jayaraman et al.,
    2016, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness helps computing techniques to decide what
    data is to be analysed, and consequently easing the computations, and the lack
    of this data complicate data analysis substantially. This is especially relevant
    in arable farming, where the system has to handle both spatial and temporal data
    and make decisions based on the data collected. The use of standards, formats
    and middleware that support metadata is therefore important to have in mind during
    the planning of an IoT solution (Peets et al., 2009, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness
    facilitates new business models and strategies for data analytics and DSS software
    providers. 6. Conclusions and future perspectives A literature review of current
    and foreseeable IoT technologies and systems in arable farming was carried out.
    This has included an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies, an
    outline of the current and potential applications, and a thorough description
    of the challenges and solutions. From this survey, the role smart mobile phones
    play is highlighted, especially Android devices, which are employed in different
    ways for a wide diversity of applications, due to their availability, connectivity,
    interoperability, programmable ease and computational power. The introduction
    of 5G networks in the near future will enhance the capabilities of smart mobile
    devices due to their enhanced performance. The intelligent management of WSN as
    well as the capabilities of improved communication technologies can also solve
    some of the challenges IoT-based solutions are experiencing. The role of middleware
    platforms and generic enablers are expected to gain acceptance and importance,
    as they can solve system integration issues and interoperability challenges. In
    general, regarding challenges, interoperability is a main challenge throughout
    the whole IoT architecture, where development and/or acceptance of standards and
    protocols is required to ease the issues encountered by many IoT implementations.
    Furthermore, challenges such as revenue and affordability of IoT systems, the
    power consumption of wireless devices, latency and throughput problems during
    data transfer, as well as the complexity of data analysis, and data privacy and
    security have been identified in the reviewed literature as of high importance,
    and academic research should direct their resources toward solving or reducing
    these issues. Technology developers need to ensure that the solutions create a
    real benefit for farmers and are available and applicable for both large and small
    producers. How IoT generated farm data will affect the business models of farmers
    requires further investigation as it is not fully addressed in the literature
    reviewed. The combination of intelligent power efficient systems with power harvesting
    technologies should guarantee longer battery-life of wireless devices. Computing
    data at the edge, i.e. on the devices, as well as lightweight protocols can reduce
    network latency and capacity/throughput problems. The emergence of Big Data is
    posing significant challenges for data analysis, as the complexity and heterogeneity
    of the huge data sets require the application of new analysis techniques beyond
    those traditionally used. Techniques such as lowering data dimensionality, cloud
    platforms and cloud computing, including machine learning algorithms, can help
    in this area and new innovative solutions are expected to be developed. Finally,
    technology producers have to guarantee privacy and security of the data handled
    throughout all the layers by employing different secure methods without compromising
    the user-friendliness of the solutions employed. Middleware platforms can help
    improving the privacy and security of IoT solutions, and techniques such as blockchain
    can assist with privacy and security problems of IoT platforms when dealing with
    Big Data. In the near future, interoperable and service-oriented FMIS that are
    integrated in the supply chain with intelligent analytic tools will take over
    some of the management and decision-making tasks of farmers and advisors, which
    will require training for farmers to adapt to this type of FMIS. Key decision
    support functions include farm financial analysis, business processes, or supply
    chain functions, which will gain importance with Big Data analytics. In addition,
    DSS for vehicle logistics will grow in importance as a way to optimise field operations
    using route planning and sensor-based site-specific applications. Finally, the
    introduction of autonomous vehicles and robotics in arable farming in the near
    future is expected to completely change arable farming operations and production
    praxes requiring fully adopted IoT capabilities. Acknowledgements This work was

    computing technologies have revolutionized every sphere of 21 st century humans.
    IoT technologies and the data driven services they offer were beyond imagination
    just a decade ago. Now, they surround us and influence a variety of domains such
    as automobile, smart home, healthcare, etc. In particular, the Agriculture and
    Farming industries have also embraced this technological intervention. Smart devices
    are widely used by a range of people from farmers to entrepreneurs. These technologies
    are used in a variety of ways, from finding real-time status of crops and soil
    moisture content to deploying drones to assist with tasks such as applying pesticide
    spray. However, the use of IoT and smart communication technologies introduce
    a vast exposure to cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities in smart farming
    environments. Such cyber attacks have the potential to disrupt the economies of
    countries that are widely dependent on agriculture. In this paper, we present
    a holistic study on security and privacy in a smart farming ecosystem. The paper
    outlines a multi layered architecture relevant to the precision agriculture domain
    and discusses the security and privacy issues in this dynamic and distributed
    cyber physical environment. Further more, the paper elaborates on potential cyber
    attack scenarios and highlights open research challenges and future directions.

    According to the United Nations (UN), the world population is expected to exceed
    9 billion people by 2050, growing by almost a third of the current population
    [1], [2]. Such an increase in the population demands a boost of almost 70 percent
    in the food production rate, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization
    of the United Nations.1 This rapidly growing population also introduces a variety
    of other problems such as increasing competition and exploitation of land, water
    and other natural resources. These issues present an urgent need to reduce the
    dependence of food system on our environment. Consequently, the need for an evolutionary
    agricultural paradigm to keep up with growing demand of food and crop production
    is necessary to guarantee a sustainable development [3]. Smart farming technologies2
    and precision agriculture3 [4] are gaining more attraction for their potential
    to fulfill such an increasing demand and meet global food supply needs. Smart
    farming technologies involve integration of technology and data driven agriculture
    applications to increase crop yield and quality of food products. There are numerous
    smart farming use cases [5]–[7] present globally indicating the impact of this
    new paradigm of practicing agriculture. As an example, the use of remote sensors
    placed in the soil for measuring blueberry irrigation in Chile has reduced the
    volume of water used in farming by 70 percent [8]. In India, farm data has been
    used to predict and prevent crop diseases, which reduced the risk associated with
    the failure of crop production [9]. Similar data driven approaches have helped
    fruit farmers in Slovenia effectively fight against pests.4 Smart farming, however,
    goes beyond primary production. In fact, it has impacted the complete food supply
    chain, by employing big data analytics to provide useful insights about the entire
    farming process [10] by facilitating real-time operational decision making, and
    revolutionizing existing agriculture business models. Smart farming enhances conventional
    farming practices by introducing on-field smart sensors and devices. These sensors
    and devices work in a synergistic manner to provide efficient farming experiences,
    as well as, an improved crop yield. Although beneficial to the productivity of
    the industry, the use of heterogeneous, internet-connected devices has exposed
    potential cyber attacks and vulnerabilities in the agriculture sector. These attacks
    introduce the ability to remotely control and exploit on-field sensors and autonomous
    vehicles (tractors, aerial vehicles, etc). Potential agricultural attacks can
    create an unsafe and unproductive farming environment. For example, exploits that
    have the ability to destroy an entire field of standing grown crops, flood the
    farmlands, over spray pesticides using smart drones, etc. can cause unsafe consumption
    as well as economic deterioration. Such attacks in a large coordinated manner,
    also referred to as agro-terrorism [11], also have the potential of disrupting
    the economy of an agriculture-dependent nation. A report [12] released by the
    U.S. Department of Homeland Security extensively elaborates various cyber threat
    scenarios in precision agriculture, further emphasizing the need for research
    in this critical domain. The Agriculture industry adds 6.4 percent of the world’s
    economic production with a total of $5,084,800 million.5 Agriculture, food, and
    related industries contributed $1.053 trillion to U.S. gross domestic product
    (GDP) in 2017.6 At the same time, United State’s farms contributed $132.8 billion
    of this sum which is almost 1 percent of GDP. Agriculture contributed 1.2 % to
    the European Union’s (EU) GDP in 2017 whereas EU’s agricultural industry added
    gross value of EUR 188.5 billion in 20177 at a record high. Out of 226 countries,
    nine countries have agriculture sector as the dominant sector in their economy.
    The U.S. food and agriculture system has a total economic impact of $7.06 trillion8
    and one-fourth of the overall jobs in the country are connected to it. Most countries
    globally export agricultural products. As a result, cyber vulnerabilities can
    have a significant impact on global food security. A sophisticated agro-terrorism
    attack on a (large) exporting country like the U.S. could harm the health of millions
    of consumers world-wide. In addition, attacks could reduce confidence on domestic
    consumption and destroy the United State’s status as a trusted food exporter.
    A report released in 2018 by the Council of Economic Advisors,9 “The Cost of Malicious
    Cyber Activity to the U.S. Economy” suggests the agriculture sector as one of
    the 16 critical infrastructure sectors that are important to both the U.S. economy
    and national security for which cyber protection is particularly important. It
    also reported that the agriculture sector experienced 11 cyber incidents in 2016.
    According to the World Health Organization,10 420,000 people die every year from
    food-related illnesses and 600 million people fall ill as a result of food contaminated
    with bacteria, viruses, toxins or chemicals. A cyber attack on the food ecosystem
    targeted at farms, transportation system, or food processing industrial control
    systems (ICSs) may increase these numbers exponentially. Other important industries
    like energy, financial or healthcare have understood the need for resilient infrastructure
    and have hardened their defenses. However, the food and agriculture industry is
    still a low hanging fruit for threat actors. Food Protection and Defense Institute
    (FPDI) at the University of Minnesota has discovered that food industry ICSs may
    be distinctly vulnerable to cyberattacks.11 Food industry operations technology
    personnel, in particular, those responsible for operating and maintaining ICSs,
    are experts trained in food and production safety production and not in cybersecurity.
    This presents a huge gap between employing smart farm technology and securing
    it correctly and persistently. If not continuously monitored, cyber attacks on
    smart agriculture technologies can have grave implications on several stakeholders
    in the ecosystem. These groups include farmers, end consumers, food processing
    industries, agriculture co-operatives, livestock, government agencies and nations
    critically dependent on agriculture. Figure 1, shows an end to end interaction
    among various entities involved in smart farming ecosystem. Physical sensors and
    livestock in the field generate data and receive command operations via user applications.
    These on-farm devices are connected to gateway supported edge nodes, which help
    enable in-farm device communication, filter sensor data and real time agronomy
    analytics. At the same time, data lakes in the cloud hold a large amount of data
    and information including but not limited to, environmental information (e.g.
    soil moisture level and fertility status), monitoring information (e.g. sensors
    and smart machinery status), energy management data, and other sensitive information.
    In terms of security and data privacy, it is needless to say that manipulation
    and leakage of such data, as well as the impairment of physical equipment and
    software systems, can induce serious consequences. FIGURE 1. A model of end-to-end
    interaction between various stakeholders in smart farming. Show All Extensive
    research on secure IoT devices [13]–[15], smart vehicles [16]–[19], drones [20],
    [21], edge cloud [22]–[24], wireless communication [25]–[27] is already available
    and might be extended to the smart farming ecosystem. However, most of the time,
    research is conducted on these technologies without consideration of the environment
    they are used. The dynamic smart farming environment, has unique characteristics
    such as farm equipment, labor sharing, and operational decisions, influenced by
    environmental conditions. Domain specific issues such as like location, user skill
    set, insider threats, generated data, need smart-farming-specific security mechanisms.
    The development of smart farm technologies therefore, demands further research
    before wide adoption in the community. The current state of the art and our review
    (discussed in Section V) on smart farming, demands further research in security
    and privacy aspects of this evolving domain. As the research, on cybersecurity
    for smart farming is in its infancy, our objective in this review is to provide
    a holistic view of cybersecurity developments in smart farming. In this paper,
    we discuss current threats, analyze potential cybersecurity attacks, review the
    existing scattered security research, and summarize open research challenges in
    the smart farming field as illustrated in Figure 2. FIGURE 2. A roadmap of cybersecurity
    research and challenges in smart farming. Show All This paper has the following
    key contributions: It provides an overview of smart farming focused multi-layered
    architecture, highlighting multiple entry points and communication across layers.
    It identifies potential cybersecurity issues in smart farming and illustrates,
    scenario specific cyber attacks, which have been categorized into data, network,
    supply chain, and other common attacks. It presents an extensive evaluation of
    the current cybersecurity research, countermeasures in smart farming, and also
    enlists the focus, contributions and weaknesses of current research works. It
    provides a clear view of the open security research challenges in different areas
    including next generation network security, trustworthy supply chain and compliance,
    adversarial machine learning and AI, and access control, trust and information
    sharing. The remainder of this paper is as follows. Multi-layered architecture
    for smart farming is discussed in Section II. Section III elaborates security
    and privacy issues, whereas Section IV discusses different attacks on the smart
    farming ecosystem including the supply chain side. Existing research and state
    of the art in smart farming security is discussed in Section V. Section VI highlights
    open research challenges and possible approaches to solutions. Finally, Section
    VII draws conclusion to this research paper. SECTION II. Smart Farming Landscape
    & Architecture Figure 3, depicts a multi layer architecture for the smart farming
    ecosystem. The proposed architecture adapts and extends widely discussed IoT and
    Cyber Physical System (CPS) multi-layer architectures [28]–[31]. These architectures
    recognize the use of cloud and edge services, and the infinite capabilities provided
    by them to fully harness the data generated from smart devices at the physical
    layer [32]–[37]. Our smart farming architecture, also reflects different user
    applications which can be envisioned at various layers. It also considers, vast
    amounts of data collected at edge or cloud layers, and highlights the need for
    various multi-cloud or edge-cloud scenarios. Overall the architecture consists
    of four layers: Physical layer, Edge layer, Cloud layer, and Network Communication
    layer. The latter spans across all three previous layers and connect them. FIGURE
    3. Multi layer smart farming architecture. Show All A. Physical Layer The bottom
    layer in the architecture comprises of real physical sensors and gateway devices
    which are spread across agriculture farms or in greenhouse buildings. These devices
    include drones flying in the air, autonomous tractors, sensors embedded in livestock,
    or hub devices installed to provide communication among smart objects or with
    a central cloud. These devices are responsible for data sensing and based on the
    information gathered, help in actuating other devices to realise various smart
    farming use cases. They collect real time information about weather conditions,
    soil moisture level, or cattle’s body temperature, which can be sent to the edge
    or cloud supported intelligent decision making systems to provide recommendations
    and enable automation. For example, data gathered from soil moisture sensing device
    in the field, after getting processed in the edge or cloud, can help in determining
    the amount of water needed at the farm, optimize irrigation schedule and offers
    a convenient experience to the end farmers. B. Edge Layer This layer is near to
    the end-users and end-devices for local real-time computations and decisions.
    It reduces the computation load off the centralized cloud layer and also the network
    load. Edge computing layer consists of multiple edge nodes. Each node represents
    a gateway that include services such as: data capturing, security monitoring and
    detection, prediction and real-time decision support. Data capturing services
    include, data aggregation, filtering, encrypting and encoding of real-time data
    streams. Prediction services usually rely on machine learning models trained on
    the central cloud and deployed on the edge layer. They are used to predict and/or
    categorize certain events related to plant or livestock such as, prediction of
    crop yield, categorization of plants or livestock health, predictions about the
    amount of fertilizer and water needed for a patch of land, so as to maximize yield,
    or estimating soil erosion. Security monitoring and detection mechanisms can be
    deployed for real-time monitoring of anomalous events and classifying these events
    as malicious or benign. This includes services like, anomaly detection and device
    failures prediction. C. Cloud Layer Precision Agriculture (PA) and cloud computing
    paradigms offer advances to enhance PA connectivity. The cloud layer is generally
    virtualized in data centers and communicates with the other layers using the Internet.
    Generally, these cloud layer platforms follow the Platform as a Service (PaaS)
    architecture model where the users can focus on running applications and importing
    their data. The PaaS provider runs and maintains a data broker that collects data
    being pushed in from the edge layer and saves these records in a Distributed File
    System (DFS). This stored data is used by analytic software to mine knowledge.
    This data analytics component computes insights and these are pushed to the end
    user through a client application running on the users’ machine. Popular farm
    equipment manufacturers like, John Deere,12 Farmers Business Network,13 etc. have
    created several cloud based products that help users monitor various sensors and
    vehicles used on a farm. These PaaS systems generally run on popular cloud computing
    platforms like Amazon Web Services,14 Google Cloud,15 etc. The way these farming
    PaaS systems are built using these popular cloud computing platforms also introduce
    various security challenges in smart farming ecosystem. D. Network Communication
    Layer The common theme for most, if not all, current technologies is “connectivity”.
    With a growing need for a boundary-less Internet, the idea of a network of smart
    devices has become a reality. This concept, known as the Internet of Things (IoT),
    allows connected devices to be monitored, controlled, and shared data among each
    other. This data can be analyzed and used by multiple applications. In smart farming,
    as shown in Figure 3, the network layer not only facilitates edge and physical
    layer connectivity, but also provides an interface for them to interact with the
    cloud layer. From exchanging soil temperature through a peer-to-peer sensor communication
    system, to sending farm monitoring data to the cloud data stores through high
    speed mobile networks such as 5G [38], or updating the farmer about corp quality
    via a wireless adhoc topology [39], network layer offers a means of communication
    to bind all other layers. Network layer has two main responsibilities in a smart
    farming system. Firstly, there are diverse set of heterogeneous devices in every
    layers of a smart farming system. The network layer provides a secure and efficient
    network stack where, wire, wireless and mobile sub-networks can communicate in
    a compatible and cross-layer manner. The second responsibility of the layer is
    to preserve connectivity and therefore, increase availability. From bigdata processing
    systems used to analyze collected data to individual sensors that collect information
    from the field, this layer is needed for system-wide cyber communication. Real
    World Smart Farming Use Cases: The proposed smart farming architecture is constructed
    based on multiple literature and real world smart farming use cases. It can be
    viewed as a general smart farming architecture that satisfies most of the use
    cases. However, it should be noted that not all use cases will include all four
    layers as proposed in the architecture. Blackhills Farm in New Zealand, a 400-hectare
    property with over 2000 cattle and 800 sheep, has adopted the use of SCADAfarm16
    system which allows the owners to remotely monitor water and energy consumption,
    location of irrigators, soil moisture measurements and real-time weather information.
    The farm uses Schneider Electrics’s EcoStuxture IoT architecture17 which corresponds
    to our physical layer and sensors. It also utilizes Microsoft Azure18 IoT suite
    with communication provided by the Vodafone New Zealand cellular network which
    corresponds to the cloud and network layer in out framework. Similarly, a 7,000-acre
    farm at Beltsville Area Research Center, was developed by the United States Department
    of Agriculture (USDA) to act as a testbed for smart farming technologies. The
    farm was equipped with a physical layer including sensors, drones and IoT-enabled
    farm equipment for a public-private program called Farmbeats [5]. The farm adopts
    a two-layer hybrid network: a layer based on TV White Spaces [40] technology for
    connectivity over long range which connects the farmer’s home Internet connection
    to IoT base stations on the farm, and a layer based on Wi-Fi technology which
    connects smart sensors to the IoT base stations. Such IoT base stations (gateways)
    are equivalent to the edge cloud layer (Figure 3) in our proposed general architecture.
    Additionally, the data collected at the IoT stations are pushed to the cloud layer
    which employs AI algorithms for data analysis. Another usecase is a revolutionary
    step towards smart crop health monitoring. A group of researchers19 along with
    local farmers are developing a distributed airborne monitoring system to detect
    possible zones of crop damage or nutrient deficiency at a 492-acre farm in in
    North Carolina, United States. In order to accommodate rapidly-growing food demands
    and increase the quality and quantity of agricultural production, it is necessary
    to improve farming management practices and technological developments in agricultural
    fields. Accordingly, unlike traditional crop management methods that use farmers
    or ground vehicles for assessing crop health status, this collaborative smart
    farming project is using autonomous technology to perform aerial monitoring of
    agricultural fields to save time and money, while preventing damage to crops.
    In this project, a group of drones which monitor the field are working in the
    physical layer, as depicted in Figure 3. Drones communicate with each other through
    network layer, using which they also send collected data and images to land processing
    bases (i.e. the edge layer in our proposed architecture) for initial data cleaning
    and pre-processing. Finally, pre-processed data is sent to the cloud layer for
    storing and knowledge extraction functionalities. SECTION III. Security & Privacy
    Issues The adoption of sensor based technologies and cloud supported smart applications
    in agriculture has unleashed opportunities for adversaries to orchestrate cyber
    attacks. Therefore, it is important to first understand major security and privacy
    issues in smart farming domain before discussing specific cyber attacks. In this
    section, we will elaborate these issues in detail followed by attacks in the following
    section. A. Data Security & Privacy In a smart farm, an enormous amount of complex,
    dynamic and spatial data gets generated from many heterogeneous sensors, devices
    and equipment. Leakage of such information either through unauthorized access
    or by an insider can cause potential threats. For example, leakage of agriculture
    anti-jamming devices information can help an attacker bypass these security measures,
    while leakage of soil, crop, and agriculture purchase information can cause severe
    economic losses to farmers, if such information is used by competitors or hostile
    actors. On a larger scale, aggregating important agricultural information on a
    particular country is also a potential threat. As such data security and privacy
    is a very important requirement and one of the primary objectives to ensure the
    reliable operation in a smart farming ecosystem. Data on the Edge: Smart farms
    leverage Internet of Things (IoT), state-of-the-art communications (e.g., 5G),
    and artificial intelligence. Such systems mostly require fast response times,
    than those of a traditional model in which data is transmitted to a centralized
    data center (e.g., cloud) for processing and results are returned to a user. As
    such, the need of edge cloud is on the rise. Although moving data processing and
    analytics to the edge enhances agility and efficiency, to say the least, it also
    imposes huge security risks due to the increased attack surface primarily because
    of the highly diverse use of IoT devices which are usually not built with security
    in mind. This gives attackers an easy entry point to the network since remote
    access to the edge layer, in most cases, is essential. Additionally, finding the
    IP addresses of edge endpoints become an easy task especially when considering
    websites like Shodan,20 a search engine for all IoT connected devices. Beside
    directly compromising IoT devices or edge endpoints to gain access to the smart
    farm network, an indirect attack to compromise third parties is also a potential
    risk. As an example, smart farms often use third party agronomy analytics to analyze
    the collected data which can be used in many research areas such as plant biology
    and genetics, agriculture economy, supply forecasts, and disease predictions.
    Those parties might be given direct access to smart farm data on the edge for
    real-time analytics. An attacker might phish for such third parties, compromise
    their systems and inject malicious software to redirect the data sent to external
    servers for data theft. Such attacks are very hard to detect, since attackers
    are using legitimate stolen third party credentials. B. Authorization & Trust
    In smart farming applications, connected entities including autonomous tractors,
    flying drones, on field sensors etc. communicate and interact with each other,
    and issue command and control operations to provide automated and efficient experience.
    Such communication can be direct machine to machine or via a cloud or edge assisted
    network which can support Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT21), Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP22) or other IoT communication protocols. In either
    case, it is essential to ensure that the messages are sent from a trusted authorized
    entity, rather from a malicious adversary. This exchange of information, like
    moisture level of soil, information about crop yield, cost of fertilizer, or sensitive
    data about the livestock like health, current location, breeding decision information
    and other farm related private data sent to the cloud or to a third-party application
    must be authorized by the owner of the field or a concerned party. Livestock are
    important part of agriculture, and a big component of a farmer’s income. Sensors
    can be embedded in the cattle [41]–[43] which can monitor their health and can
    be used to remotely inject medicines or enable preventive actions from a doctor.
    Even in case of livestock purchase, buyer can be given temporary access to the
    data of an animal they are interested in, which can help them analyse it before
    purchase. As these animals are kept in monitored environments, remotely controlling
    the temperature or making adverse conditions in barn can affect the yield of animals,
    and can also result in epidemics and widespread disease. Over the air (OTA) updates
    for the equipment’s firmware must be from a trusted party, a bad software patch
    received for a critical agriculture equipment can curtail a farmer from using
    it at the needed time of harvesting and planting. Cross cloud and multi cloud
    trust models [44], [45] are needed when entities associated at different cloud
    providers interact and access data remotely. In case of a mechanic trying to diagnose
    an engine of an autonomous tractor, or a doctor trying to access data of a cattle
    located in a private cloud, trust levels need to be established so as to enable
    such access. Several access control models have been proposed for IoT [46]–[58]
    like systems, however their feasability in dynamic smart farming is still to be
    investigated. Proper authorization is needed for a farmer to issue a command,
    to a smart water sprinkler, or to fetch the latest readings from a soil moisture
    sensor. Farm rivalry can exploit such connectivity to the sensors, and may flood
    a farmer’s field, or make it parched. Usually in farms, labor is hired on a temporary
    basis mostly at the time of harvesting and sowing, therefore, temporary access
    to smart equipment can be delegated to on field workers for non-critical operations.
    It may be the case that a critical operation, like running an autonomous tractor
    on the field, or flying a drone over the field to spray pesticides may need multi
    level authorization. C. Authentication & Secure Communication One of the most
    important aspects of security and privacy in smart farming is authentication of
    connected devices. Devices need to be authenticated first in order to get connected
    to various services on a smart farming system. They are usually low power devices,
    with limited processing power, memory, and storage, so legacy public-key infrastructure
    (PKI) authentication mechanisms cannot be considered as feasible solutions. Alternatively,
    secure lightweight multi-factor authentication protocols which are offered as
    a service [13], [59] are more realistic solutions in a smart farming network environment.
    In fact, an intermediary Certifying Authority (CA) can facilitate the authentication
    of a connecting device [60]. Such authentication mechanisms do not consume devices’
    limited resources for authentication processing, but also unauthorized devices
    will be prevented from connecting and accessing the network in an efficient way
    [61]. Moreover, devices may sometime join or leave different layers of a smart
    farming ecosystem. This entails dynamic authenticated mechanisms that apply authentication
    on demand to ensure that only legitimate devices are allowed to have access to
    different services spanning over different layers. Providing end to end secure
    communication in a smart farming setting requires securing the communication between
    devices in a particular layer and also securing the inter-layer communication
    [62]. While cryptography-based solutions prove their effectiveness in securing
    both intra-layer and inter-layer communications, employing them on constrained
    IoT devices is a big concern. There are, however, limited attempts to apply lightweight
    cryptography solutions to a smart farming ecosystem [14]. Additionally, quantum-based
    cryptography for a secure end to end communication for IoT devices is under active
    investigation [63] as a futuristic solution. However, the feasibility of such
    solutions have not been evaluated in real world scenarios. D. Compliance and Regulations
    Smart farming and precision agriculture raises various legal issues, which remain
    partially unanswered. The following are some of the major issues in this area.
    1) Contracts and Agreements A smart farm involves different parties like the farmers,
    the cloud service providers, the networking infrastructure providers, to name
    a few (See Section II). These different parties need to negotiate and agree on
    various parts of contracts [12], [64]. These contracts include data privacy, security
    and intellectual property protection clauses. Data protection is essential for
    the development of smart farms and is a major part of these contracts. Such contracts
    between interested parties are crucial to protect the value and confidentiality
    of the data as an important asset. Farmers who use smart farming tools also need
    to negotiate in advance finer elements of these contracts. For example, which
    party shall be responsible in case data processing and analysis lead to wrong
    decisions affecting different downstream tasks in the pipeline. Another important
    contractual element example is the decision involving use of self-driving tractors,
    which are subject to the set of obligations applicable to self-driving cars. In
    this scenario, strong compensation and limitation of liability clauses may help
    the farmers. 2) Data Security and Privacy Farmers who deploy smart infrastructure
    fear that their data might be stolen by competitors or be publicly released. Hence,
    data security is crucial and agreements with technology providers should include
    specific clauses. Although most smart farming techniques process non-personal
    data, linking of such information to a particular personally identifiable information
    (PII) poses serious concerns [12], [64]. For example, data of livestock directly
    referring to their owner; crops conditions linked to farmers’ personal details.
    In this case, privacy clauses should be included to prohibit personal data processing
    to a certain degree. Further issues may arise when smart farming equipment, such
    as drones or tractors, have the functionality to monitor their users [12], [64].
    3) Intellectual Property (IP) An important question from a compliance perspective
    is who owns the data collected on a smart farm. This is specially important as
    data privacy laws cannot solve this issue. As per the current regulatory setup,
    data itself cannot be protected, however copyright provisions can be utilized
    to achieve high level of safeguards. Most farmers include IP protection clauses
    [64] in contracts that they create with smart farming technology providers [12].
    4) Regulatory Agriculture and livestock production is a highly regulated industry.
    Various countries across the globe have many laws, regulations, and supervisory
    authorities [65]–[67]. These touch upon specific compliance requirements for producing
    and selling of products. Such compliance can be achieved easier by using smart
    farming technology that help farmers and regulators track, audit, and inspect
    every step of the production pipeline. 5) Cyber Insurance Cyber Insurance allows
    victims to protect themselves from various cyber risks. However, cyber insurance
    policies in agriculture have lagged in the coverage of cyber incidents and events.
    Most of the current available agriculture based cyber insurances are very ambiguous
    and limited in their coverage [64]. SECTION IV. Smart Farming Ecosystem Cyber
    Attacks This section elaborates possible cyber attacks in smart farming ecosystem.
    We have categorized attacks into four different classes as shown in Figure 4.
    We have discussed data specific and network specific attacks orchestrated on smart
    farms including IoT based farming sensors. We have also explored cyber attacks
    from the supply chain side to highlight the vulnerabilities as more and more systems
    get connected to the internet and generating sensitive data. FIGURE 4. Smart farming
    ecosystem cyber attacks. Show All A. Data Attacks 1) Insider Data Leakage Farmers
    fear leakage of confidential data the most among other threats as it can be used
    against them in the commodity market. An insider (like a disgruntled employee)
    can leak such data to intentionally cause harm or sell data for money. For example,
    a former engineer at Allen and Hoshall was able to access the company’s data over
    a period of two years.23 Data this employee accessed included engineering schematic,
    project proposals, and marketing information which had an estimated value of $500,000.
    2) Cloud Data Leakage Smart farming data is very sensitive and can reveal a lot
    of confidential agriculture and economic information about the entire country.
    Cloud data centers are distributed across the world and, in some instances, virtual
    machines might be placed in data centers located in different countries. Data
    might be less secure if it is stored in data centers in other countries. These
    countries could place less strict security requirements on companies. Additionally,
    their governments might also intercept or collect that data stored on servers
    within their own jurisdictions. For these reasons, countries have started adding
    laws for sensitive data localization. For instance, China has placed a new cybersecurity
    law24 into effect in 2017 stating, among other things, that personal data must
    be stored on domestic servers. As such, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon
    started taking steps to transfer control of Chinese data to Chinese firms. 3)
    False Data Injection Attack In this attack, an attacker attempts to change/falsify
    data that contributes to important real-time decisions, with the assumption that
    adversary has the knowledge of the system and its configuration. For example,
    injecting false information about the soil moisture level will result in over
    watering and, in turn, damaging the crops. 4) Misinformation Attack In this attack,
    the aim is to endanger data integrity. An attacker may release false data about
    a smart farm claiming the outbreak of a disease in crops or livestock. Such false
    data reports mimic the form of an actual report released by the targeted smart
    farm. As a result, it will take a lot of time, effort and money to prove that
    the released report is false. B. Networking and Equipment Attacks 1) Radio Frequency
    (FR) Jamming Attack In many cases, smart farming equipment rely on radio frequency
    communication, like cellular or satellite networks. A smart farming equipment
    often use global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) to improve efficiency with
    products and techniques such as path planning, auto steering, seeding and spray
    rates. GNSS is achieved by combining GPS with real time kinematics (RTK) technology
    to enhance the precision of real-time position data. Attackers may jam GNSS for
    malicious purpose by deploying many distributed low power jammers to disrupt GNSS
    over wide areas and, in turn, prevent smart farming equipment from functioning
    properly. 2) Malware Injection Attack One of the most prevalent threats to smart
    farming is malware injection attack [68], where an attacker injects a malware
    into a connected smart device. Malware is a very common threat in large scale
    systems since, in most cases, it acts and propagates through the system automatically,
    hence making it a very attractive target to attackers. Precision agriculture is
    being adopted widely, meaning that more farms are connected to the internet. Typically,
    most of these farm deployments use similar software components (e.g., usage of
    LoRa25 and ZigBee26). As a result, a malware that infects a particular smart farm
    will most likely infect other farms with similar deployments. The damage caused
    by malware comes in many shapes and types. Malware can steal information about
    the consumption of agricultural materials, purchase information of fruits, vegetables
    and livestock, data about agricultural machinery etc. It can also recruit smart
    devices as part of a botnet which will be used for committing malicious acts controlled
    by an attacker. Further, malware can hinder the functions of physical smart equipment
    which, in turn, can have a devastating effect on a particular crop harvest or
    farm area. 3) Denial of Service Attack IoT devices used in smart farming environments
    can always be used to launch large scale denial of service (DoS) attacks [69]
    similar to what happened in 2016 using Mirai botnet [70]. In that occasion, an
    army of dummy CCTVs was exploited to launch one of the biggest DoS attacks that
    happened recently. There are usually a large number of inter-connected nodes and
    groups in a farm, and thus, similar type of attacks are possible in context of
    smart farming. These attacks not only can disrupt normal functions of different
    modules in an individual farm but also can be leveraged to interrupt legitimate
    cyber services in other domains. 4) Botnet With IoT everything is capable of getting
    connected to the internet. In smart farming ecosystem, there are many IoT related
    devices at each architectural layer. These devices are prone to attacks and can
    then be controlled by a central malicious system. This forms a so called ‘Botnet
    of Things’ [71]. A zombie army of infected farm IoT devices [72] can easily be
    used to infect many other networks through different mediums and hence a smart
    farm may turn out to be an internet of vulnerabilities for cyber criminals. Smart
    farm devices are not built with security as a concern and even if they do, users
    usually neglect the basic steps of setting adequate cybersecurity defense mechanisms.
    5) Side Channel Attack Attacks which have their roots in gaining information from
    how a system is implemented rather than what weakness exists in the system implementation
    are called side channel attacks. Smart farming is one of the IoT use case and
    hence it inherits some common IoT vulnerabilities including side channel attacks
    [73]. In such attacks, there are different channels which can be exploited by
    attackers. In timing channel attacks, for example, computation time along with
    cache miss and cache hit timing patterns are among those attacks vectors which
    can be exploited by adversaries. Hardware glitching in forms of voltage fluctuations
    and variances in system clock period during execution tasks are other possible
    attack channels. Other channels for launching a successful attack are power consumption
    patterns, possible electromagnetic leaks or even sound and acoustic channels.
    C. Supply Chain Attacks The entire agriculture ecosystem and the notion of ‘farm
    to plate’ involves several entities which work in tandem to provide quality food
    to the end consumer in a just-in time environment. This supply chain system [74]
    starts from the farm, which produces raw material that, in turn, is stored and
    processed by the food industry. The processed food is packed and sent to distribution
    retailer from where the end customer purchases processed goods. With IoT technology
    at each stage of the supply chain, it introduces potential cybersecurity threats
    since a security breach in just-in-time distribution system could also have a
    serious cascading effects on the entire supply chain. The massive scale of attacks
    like WannaCry27 ransomware, and the recent spate of ransomwares in cities28 across
    the US, suggest that even a breach or data freeze at a single inter-dependent
    entity will be enough to disrupt the whole chain and possibly the economy of a
    country. An attack on the agriculture equipment and fertilizer provider companies
    could potentially disable critical connected machinery needed at a prime time.
    It could manipulate the amount of nutrients in the fertilizers [64] which could
    seriously destroy the crops rather than nourishing them. The smart devices can
    be infected by malware which are controlled and commanded remotely. In such a
    scenario, large scale attacks can be orchestrated on all the smart farms utilizing
    those compromised machinery resulting in massive disruption in the sector. Needless
    to say that the suppliers of such machinery might loose trust and confidence of
    their customers. Such smart machinery needs dynamic calibration to determine the
    distance at which seeds need to be planted or the amount of fertilizers to be
    sprayed based on historical crop data. This calibration related information is
    uploaded in the machine software over-the-air (OTA), which suggests that deliberate
    uploading of false information to the machine software can have larger scale impact.
    US Foods29 has more than 250,000 customers which purchase supplies, will be affected
    badly if US Foods IT infrastructure is hit by a ransomware or a cyber attack disrupting
    its computer assisted facility and impacting critical processes. Temperature and
    conditions under which the produce is transferred is an important factor to maintain
    the freshness of the product. Smart monitors ensure that products are processed
    and packed at appropriate temperatures. Adversaries can manipulate these sensor
    readings or issue a command to change the temperature that could result in inappropriate
    temperature conditions for produce, which can impact the end consumers as well
    as the entire supply chain. These attacks are not limited to direct stakeholders,
    but for example, contaminated water from a compromised water treatment facility
    used in irrigation can destroy the whole crop field. Even attacks on smart grid
    due to sudden surge in demand and grid overloading can result in blackout which
    in-turn can spoil the stored produce in large storage houses, inducing huge losses
    to the supplier. Blockchain30 based solutions have been proposed to ensure the
    provenance of the food products in the chain, which offers transparency and assure
    quality of the food. However, the entire cost to use this system will not be clear
    unless widely adopted [75]. Smart farming goes beyond agriculture where livestock
    sector is also considered an important part. An attack on this sector can also
    have massive disruptions, where a malicious actor can publish false data about
    a disease outbreaks or unapproved genetic modifications of crops. Similarly, sensors
    and smart devices in the buildings where these livestock are kept can be attacked
    or altered to change the temperature, which can put to harm the entire livestock
    on the farm. Also, for livestock feed products, if an IT system monitoring the
    ingredients of the feed is compromised, it can potentially lead to wide-spread
    contamination in livestock which can easily reach humans as well. D. Other Relevant
    Attacks 1) Compliance and Regulation Food production and farming are a highly
    regulated industry with different countries having multiple national agencies
    monitoring food production. In the United States, Environment Protection Agency
    [65] and the Department of Agriculture [66] enforce various regulations and industry
    standards. In the European Union, Department of Agriculture and Rural Development
    [67] undertakes this responsibility with similar authorities in other countries.
    These federal authorities issue compliance directives to ensure quality food production.
    With the advent of smart farming technology these agencies are relying more and
    more on data produced by farm based sensors. An adversary attacking a smart farm
    can specifically inject false data that will then impact various compliance certification
    processes. This certification process if invalidated, can impact a nation’s food
    supply, affect crop price, etc. The complex smart farming ecosystem, creates a
    broad attack surface that needs to be protected to ensure data integrity. 2) Cyber
    Terrorism The increased use of digital interconnected system in agriculture sector
    brings new opportunities for terrorists to attack places that previously were
    too remote or difficult to strike. Cyber terrorism is a relatively low-cost venture
    with high payoff potential, making the risks of agro-terrorism too large to ignore.
    Therefore, it is important to find solutions that guarantee trust and transparency
    within smart farming concept, as well as protect critical resources. 3) Cloud
    Computing Attacks Cloud is a very diverse, decentralized, heterogeneous and powerful
    ecosystem. The enormous amount of distributed resources make the cloud a hard
    target. However, with the introduction of new cloud concepts (e.g., on-demand
    services, auto-scaling, and self provisioning), attackers have used such resources
    in their favor and, in turn, cloud has become one of the most desirable targets
    to attacker. For example, with the introduction of auto-scaling in cloud, a large
    part of the virtual machines hosted on cloud are similarly configured. If one
    of the virtual machines is vulnerable, it is highly likely that all auto-scaled
    virtual machines are vulnerable as well. As such, a malware that infected one
    virtual machine can propagate to other virtual machines quickly. The infected
    machines can be employed as a part of global botnets which, consequently, can
    be used to launch a large scale distribute DoS (DDoS) attacks enough to hinder
    the functionality of cloud. For example, in 2018, a large scale DDoS attack was
    launched on github resulting in a record-breaking sudden traffic increase to 1.35
    terabits per second. Inevitably, DDoS attacks are becoming more frequent, more
    powerful and more sophisticated. A large scale DDoS attack with an overwhelming
    number of requests, packets or messages can deny services to smart farms, thereby
    paralyzing the brain of smart farms. Further, DDoS attacks might not be specifically
    targeting smart farms’ virtual machines. Even though, an attack might be directed
    at a different target, if virtual machines used by smart farms are on the save
    physical server, it will naturally block off other’s traffic as well. SECTION
    V. Existing Research Table 1 summarizes state-of-the-art research, challenges
    and contributions with respect to security and privacy issues in smart farming.
    We have categorized the literature into different subsections based on the focus
    areas they address. TABLE 1 Projects and Research Addressing Cybersecurity in
    Smart Farming A. Cyber Attacks, Threats and Proposed Solutions Researchers and
    federal agencies have started gauging the impact cyber-attacks as more and more
    farmers and communities are adopting technologies in the farms. The U.S. Department
    for Homeland Security released a report [12] which emphasizes the importance of
    precision agriculture (PA) and associated cybersecurity threat and potential vulnerabilities.
    The report highlights the confidentiality, integrity, and availability model of
    information security in farming. It defines different technologies involved in
    PA including in-farm devices, location and remote sensing technologies, machine
    learning, etc. It briefly discusses the impacted groups by the misuse of technologies
    in farming including farmers, livestock producers, and also industries that support
    or rely on agriculture. This report also discusses hypothetical threat scenarios
    on real life examples. Another promising work [76] highlights the vulnerabilities
    and risks due to introduction of technologies in the field of precision agriculture.
    This thesis work illustrates data collection and related empirical study, however
    falls short of security solutions in the domain. The work from Jahn [64] discuss
    implications of using smart devices in the agriculture sector. The authors make
    strong argument about how the lack of a cyber insurance framework is going to
    have a big impact on various agribusinesses. They also highlight the fact that
    a regulatory response is needed to protect the interests of farmers who adopt
    the use of smart devices. Barreto and Amaral [77] use empirical methodology based
    on the analysis of information and experiences collected in the Internet Security
    Alliance,31 the European Cyber Security Organization32 and the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology33 to highlight security challenges in smart farming.
    Some major threats discussed include security and privacy issues, social engineering,
    denial of service, cyber-espionage agroterrorism, ransomware etc. The research
    also highlights a security framework to enable farmers to better understand security
    implications. However, the paper is unable to discuss open research issues, and
    challenges to secure the environment without evidence of how the discussed attacks
    are orchestrated in the domain. Peer to Peer (P2P) is a network paradigm which
    has use cases in smart farming communication. The device authentication methods
    in this type of communication, however, rely heavily on public key infrastructure.
    Although the system is trustworthy, it puts unnecessary computation load on resource
    constrained smart farm IoT devices participating in a secure P2P communication.
    Accordingly, authors in [78] proposed a lightweight device authentication solution
    in which session keys and public keys are combined to expedite the encryption/decryption
    tasks. It results in a fast and light-weight authentication solution which is
    a good fit for smart farming communication purposes. Additionally, West [79] introduced
    a framework to understand vulnerabilities in emerging technologies and the use
    of such technologies in a smart-farming-specific environment. The framework goal
    is to quantify the degree to which the use of smart farming new technologies are
    vulnerable to cyber-attacks. It uses the common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS)
    for the threat prediction model assessment. The work shows the trade-offs between
    technology maturity and adaptation in the smart farming environment which can
    lead to system compromise. The approach in the paper uses three parameters: basic
    parameters, temporal parameters and environmental parameters for constructing
    a CVSS score. Basic parameters indicate the intrinsic and severity of a vulnerability,
    whereas temporal parameters indicate how a vulnerability might change and affect
    the system over time due to technical changes. Environmental parameters reflect
    the specifications of a vulnerability present in a smart-farming-specific environment.
    Although CVSS score has become a standard in the industry for understanding the
    severity of vulnerabilities and prioritizing their patches, it has some shortcomings.
    Smart farming is a diverse environment with many connected devices and systems.
    CVSS score deals with individual vulnerabilities and fails to accurately capture
    impact of connections within the entire system. B. Blockchain Related Research
    Recently, the usefulness of blockchain in domains other than cryptocurrency and
    financial transactions has been acknowledged [93]–[95]. Agriculture and food supply
    chain is one of the domains in which blockchain technology has shown its capabilities.
    Accordingly, the authors in [81] study overall implications, challenges and potential
    of existing blockchain-based projects in the field. Besides, it critically reviews
    maturity of such projects and elaborates on possible barriers and challenges,
    which hinder acceptability of such projects among farmers and existing cyber farming
    systems. Lin et al. [80] also focused on the use of blockchain technology for
    food safety. Authors created a system that tracks and monitors food production
    cycle, including the processes of raw materials, cultivation/breeding, processing,
    transporting, warehousing, and selling. The system also uses various IoT based
    sensors to replace manual recording and verification with sensor based verification.
    Other works [82], [84], [96] focused on providing case studies of using blockchain
    and smart contracts in smart farming. Awan et al. [82] proposed a framework based
    on IoT and blockchain technology for agriculture product tracking life cycle.
    They used smart contracts to eliminate the involvement of middlemen or third-party
    intermediaries and as such increase credibility and trust. The authors implemented
    a use case based on their proposed framework which included 120 IoT nodes and
    20 blockchain producers. Further, they validated their system based on it’s throughput
    considering different block sizes. However, this work has several drawbacks. Very
    few related works are included and comparison to other works in the literature
    is lacking. Additionally, the authors didn’t include much details about the nature
    of workload used in their experiments and they failed to add a baseline benchmark
    for the validation results for a fair comparison. Patil et al. [84] proposed a
    light-weight security framework for smart greenhouse farms based on blockchain.
    Every IoT node can elect cluster head leader which helps preventing a single point
    of failure in case an attacker targets the leader node. Additionally, the authors
    provided discussion of the security threats on their proposed framework following
    the traditional confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA) triad model
    as well as their corresponding attacks. Although, this work is interesting, the
    framework is conceptual with no implementation or experiments. Further, the paper
    didn’t include related work nor a comparison to other proposed frameworks. Besides
    proposing blockchain-based frameworks and implementations [97], real world use
    cases of blockchain in smart farming are discussed in the blockchain research
    institute article [83]. In this work, authors explore applications of blockchain
    beyond the typical financial use cases in agriculture. Accordingly, they focused
    on three classes of applications: food safety, sustainable agriculture and the
    local economy and agriculture finance. The authors accompanied each class of applications
    with real world use cases. However, these use cases are discussed on a very high
    level aspect with no implementation details or results. C. AI and Machine Learning
    Assisted Work The advent of new age technologies such as artificial intelligence
    (AI) and machine learning (ML) not only facilitate the adaptation of advanced
    analytics in smart farming, but also create an ecosystem for improving the cybersecurity
    of services. Fusion of these technologies enable farmers to achieve higher average
    yield and better price control over their products in highly competitive markets.
    Design and implementation of a low cost IoT based security monitoring system have
    been proposed by Shabadi and Biradar [85]. The system focuses on physical layer
    of smart farming where it collects data from sensors. This data is sent to a controller
    where data is analyzed to make decisions like activating the actuators for water
    sprinkler in the farms. The proposed work is focused more on implementing the
    basic functionalities of smart farming than addressing security and privacy issues.
    It is very limited to simple threshold based decisions, like, if the soil temperature
    is above a certain threshold, then activate water sprinkler. Real time security
    monitoring for a remote farm is another current application of ML in smart farming.
    In scenarios where real time monitoring and notifications are paramount to farm
    and cybersecurity, the image(s) detected through a surveillance system can be
    processed by open-source computer vision programming supported by AI. For example,
    Abuan et al. [86] proposed a neural based face recognition system which is able
    to be invariant to changes in illumination for background and illumination conditions
    through a neural network training. The agricultural and farming industries have
    been widely influenced by the disruption of the IoT. However, the impact of the
    IoT is limited in countries with less penetration of mobile internet. The boom
    of low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN) in the last decade, with technologies
    such as LoRa or NB-IoT, has mitigated this by providing a relatively cheap infrastructure
    that enables low-power and long-range transmissions. Nonetheless, the benefits
    that LPWAN technologies have the disadvantage of low-bandwidth transmissions.
    Therefore, the integration of edge and fog computing, moving data analytics and
    compression near end devices, is key in order to extend functionality. By integrating
    AI at the local network layer, referred as edge AI, authors in [87] proposed a
    system architecture and implementation that expands the possibilities of smart
    agriculture and farming applications with edge and fog computing using LPWAN technology
    for large area coverage. In another research work [88], Support Vector Machines
    (SVM) along with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are used to create an integration
    platform for big data analysis for smart farming. Such a platform not only expedites
    processing huge amounts of data collected from farms and livestocks, but also
    gives smart farming stakeholders the ability to detect and respond against possible
    cyber attacks more efficiently. D. Other Relevant Literature Chi et al. [89] present
    a framework for cybersecurity approaches in precision agriculture and discussed
    challenges of using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) in digital virtual farms. They
    also present a framework for secure data capture. Security challenges in agrifood
    sector has been extensively discussed in [90]. The report provides an overview
    of emerging technologies in smart farming. Most smart farms are data-driven with
    respect to automating agriculture processes, decision making, and predictions.
    It also raises important questions of how important is data security? How risk
    assessment is done considering the entire supply chain? Who should take responsibility
    and who should be involved? The report serves to raise awareness addressing the
    importance of cybersecurity in agrifood sector. Authors in [98] provide an overview
    of cross-section of cybersecurity in food and agriculture sectors. They also discuss
    cyber-terrorism, policies, and plans. Spaulding and Wolf [99] detail the needs
    for educating farmers about various cybersecurity threats. Authors in [100] show
    the impact of cyber attacks on smart farming infrastructure via simulations using
    NETA with OMNET++ framework. Huning et al. [101] created a system to enable privacy
    preserving crowd sourcing techniques to estimate different smart farming parameters.
    Cybersecurity perception is also changing among farmers and agribusiness owners.
    Geil et al. [91] conducted an assessment of cybersecurity practices in the United
    States agriculture industry. Insights from their work reflect that over half of
    the respondents have been victims of a computer security incident, demonstrating
    that even individuals working in agriculture can be impacted by cybersecurity
    incidents. Cyberbiosecurity [92] is a multidisciplinary domain consists of cybersecurity,
    bio-security, and cyber-physical security. It discusses how current and emerging
    information technologies affect the cybersecurity of large portion of U.S. economy
    which is based on food and agriculture (i.e. Bio-economy). As Peccoud et al. [102]
    discuss, food and agricultural sectors are immensely diverse and require advanced
    technologies and efficiencies that rely on computer technologies, big data, cloud-based
    data storage, and internet accessibility, at the same time are vulnerable to cybersecurity
    incidents. Based on our literature review, it can be emphasised that, there is
    a dearth of security related research done in smart farming domain. There are
    numerous unanswered important security questions and open research challenges
    as discussed in the following section. SECTION VI. Open Challenges and Research
    Areas This section discusses open research challenges for improving security and
    privacy in smart farming ecosystem, as well illustrated in Figure 5. These open
    problems have been divided into four subsections as follows. FIGURE 5. Open research
    challenges and future directions for cybersecurity in smart farming. Show All
    A. Access Control, Trust & Privacy Perspective The multi-layered architecture
    discussed in section II recognizes possibilities of cyber threat challenges, which
    needs to be addressed by extending and adapting current access control foundational
    research, as well as developing sophisticated access control solutions to assist
    dynamic and agile environments in cyber-physical systems like smart farms. In-farm
    and cross farm operations need authorized interaction among sensors and labor/farmers
    working at multiple farms operating different sets of smart devices. What kind
    of operations they can do must be checked, which may require single level or multiple
    level access control depending on the risk factor associated with the operation?
    For example, consider sowing the field with autonomous tractor as compared to
    turning ON an irrigation system during the rainy season. Delegation and revocation
    of access rights to operate on a farm must be automatically performed based on
    the contract agreement, for example, in case temporary labor hired during harvesting
    season. Such access control requirements need further investigation to be adopted
    in such dynamic environment. The notion of trust can also be developed where labor
    who has worked earlier or an equipment borrowed from a ‘known’ old friend may
    have higher trust level as compared to machine and manpower hired from co-operative
    market. Self-configurable AI assisted smart access control policies need to be
    developed in a sharing-dominated CPS domain like smart farming. Cyber physical
    systems introduce the notion of virtual objects (which can be created in cloud
    or edge environment) corresponding to real physical sensors. An important challenge
    here is the location of cyber entities created as a part of connection with cloud
    or edge environments, for example, AWS device shadows34 or Microsoft Azure device
    twins.35 Research needs to determine: a) how cyber entity will move from one cloud
    (or edge) to another if the corresponding device is borrowed from one farmer to
    another? b) how the control of virtual entities will be delegated to the lending
    farmer, whether both the farmers need to use same application? c) how the applications
    will allow to delegate access for machine operation? d) Can the virtual objects
    or equipment across farms communicate with each other, whether at the physical
    level or using the virtual entities? If it is the virtual entity across different
    accounts in the same cloud provider, how such interaction will take place? In
    case it is across different cloud providers, how cross cloud and federated cloud
    environments will ensure such trust levels? Suppose in case a farmer has borrowed
    an equipment from a friend farmer, will the original owner be able to have access
    to it, or the access will be completely revoked? Is it possible to control a device
    through different remote clouds? All are relevant questions in smart farming domain.
    Further, how to establish trust mechanisms among different cloud service providers
    which the farmer is using for services and alerts? Manufacturer of the device
    may hold digital twin [103] and the cloud used by farmers will get data from on-field
    sensor and the cloud provider via pre-defined and signed negotiations. Such negotiations
    can also define what kind of data will be shared with required permissions of
    the owner farmer. Another important question is, how to establish trust between
    physical sensor objects? One approach is sensors at the same farm trust each other
    more for the shared information as compared to sensors across different farms.
    IoT and CPS specific cross cloud access controls and related security models are
    still in infancy stage and need more attention. Livestock and animals also have
    sensors embedded, which require appropriate authorized access. However, current
    literature does not provide strong access control mechanisms that can restrict
    such operations and secure critical data sharing from cattle and livestock at
    the farm. These wearable and health monitoring devices are attached to livestock
    and collect sensitive data, which can be used by adversaries to control the animal
    or even effect the sale/purchase of a cattle, for example, having the information
    about which cow is having low milk production. Efficient access controls [104]–[106]
    are needed to safeguard such sensitive data in cloud, which needs more research
    considering the spate of breaches heard every now and then. Usually in case of
    wearable IoT devices, a human which has the device controls what kind of data
    he/she wants to be shared. However, it is not in case of livestock which has a
    master (like the owner of the farm or caretaker) to decide control. Also, as a
    cattle is sold/purchased and moves from one owner to another, relevant data sharing
    security policies need to be specified and will require automatically configured
    information sharing. Studies [107], [108] have shown vulnerabilities in human
    used fitness devices, however, such studies and research are still an open challenge
    in case of livestock devices. Since data is collected from smart devices spread
    across farms, different applications require to access to this data. Consequentially,
    it is important to limit the sharing of data across applications and across nearby
    friend farmers, who may also get some value or receive alerts for their farms.
    How and when to share such information requires adaptive security policies to
    control and supervise data transferred by sensors to the cloud platform. Further,
    if data is sharing across multi cloud systems, cross cloud trust also needs to
    be addressed. Appropriate attribute based fine grained access controls [109],
    [110] and privacy preserving schemes need to be deployed to ensure confidentiality
    of the data. Evidently, farmers must decide the level and type of data sharing
    needed to ensure the privacy of critical information. B. Data Perspective The
    most noticeable feature of smart farming is its communication ability between
    the smart devices, resulting in an unprecedented amount of generated data [7],
    [111]. This provides many challenges as discussed in section III and open doors
    for several research opportunities. Machine learning is an attractive solution
    for processing big data, and implementing effective security solutions. Insider
    data leakage detection has always been a daunting task as users already have legitimate
    access to the system, making it hard to detect and predict such attacks. Several
    research works have been conducted on insider data leakage [22], [112], [113];
    however, none has been targeting smart farming settings. Further investigation
    is needed to understand the possibility of adopting insider data leakage defense
    mechanisms into smart farming and whether unique characteristics of smart farming
    can help to improve these mechanisms. Smart farms are highly connected systems,
    which allow malware to easily propagate through the network infecting all interconnected
    devices. An interesting question is how to detect malware in smart farming IoT
    environment, especially considering all heterogeneous devices in place. For instance,
    a malware detection technique that works against a malware that infects smart
    farming equipment might not work against malware that infects edge or cloud systems
    since the malware’s end goal is different. Many AI assisted malware detection
    techniques [114]–[120] are proposed and used in practice; however, there are no
    smart-farming-specific malware detection techniques that consider the context
    and environment in which smart farms reside. Smart farms generate diverse and
    vast amount of unstructured data. It is almost impossible for one party to analyze
    and make use of the entire datasets. For this reason, threat information sharing
    is a viable approach for data security. For instance, each smart farm can employ
    a malware detection technique; however, it is guaranteed that none of these employed
    techniques is comprehensive enough to catch all types of malware. Information
    sharing between smart farms can prove very useful. It can be used as an asset
    to share threat information about attack patterns or malware that was detected
    by collaborating smart farms. In a similar case, if a deployed detection technique
    in a farm detected supplied water with high toxin content, it is relevant to share
    that information with nearby farms who may also be impacted by similar issue.
    This can save analysis cost and money for every participating smart farm as it
    prevents doing work that someone else already did before. What kind of data, meta-data
    or analysis can be shared remains an open question and what kind of threat information
    sharing process can be used remain an open question for resource constrained farmers.
    Smart farming is an emerging field, so it is highly likely to encounter zero-day
    attacks which have not been detected before. Anomaly detection [121]–[125] is
    a very appealing solution against such attacks. Anomaly detection techniques look
    for any abnormal behavior that deviates from the pre-established database of normal
    behavior. These normal behaviour profiles are constructed based on collection
    of historical observations and patterns. Building smart farms behavior profiles
    is a challenging task since their behaviors are so dynamic in nature. External
    factors are a major reason for this dynamism. For example, less irrigation is
    needed during a rainy weather than dry weather which will cause a different behavior
    for irrigation systems. Can weather forecast information be used as an indication
    of such change of behavior? What kind of data contribute to building smart farms
    behavior profiles? Do some data fields weigh more than others? These are all open
    research questions that need to be investigated. Detection mechanisms are used
    to detect faulty and compromised sensors by monitoring the data sent for any tampered
    or abnormal values. Employing a simple threshold based mechanism can easily be
    bypassed by an attacker, so in most cases, more sophisticated machine learning
    based mechanisms need to be deployed. However, smart attackers can still bypass
    these models by (1) exploiting the sensors and a little tweaking of data sent
    by these sensors just to lead the machine learning model in place to misclassify/mispredict
    the outcome (such attack is called adversarial machine learning attack), and (2)
    poisoning the model during training phase by injecting bad data into the model’s
    training database, and in turn get it to learn something it shouldn’t. Some research
    addressed mitigation against adversarial attacks; however, it is not clear whether
    these technologies can be adopted to smart farming domain which is very dominant
    on changing environment conditions. Another open research challenge is to create
    various artificial intelligence systems that collect and parse Cyber Threat Intelligence
    (CTI36) about smart devices, software, cloud systems etc. used in the smart farming
    ecosystem. These systems have been developed to collect CTI in other areas [126]–[129]
    and need to be extended to ensure coverage of various smart farming devices, equipment
    and software. C. Network Perspective Cybersecurity threats to smart farming and
    its devices include a diverse range of security risks due to certain characteristics
    of the underlying networking and communication technologies which are used in
    the domain. First, both virtual and physical communication environments get connected.
    Many IoT devices in a smart farm system are capable of functioning on the data
    they receive from their respective environments which shortens the distance between
    virtual and physical systems. While convenient for the users, it allows cyber
    threats to convert to physical consequences more quickly, thereby having a bigger
    impact. Second, devices and layers involved in a smart farm system create a complex
    communication environment. Hyper connected farming environments exist due to the
    growing availability and diversity of IoT devices. ‘Complex’ in this context means
    that large number of devices are working in a single smart farm environment such
    that dynamic interactions between them are possible. This complexity expands the
    capabilities of an environment, but at the cost of a wider attack surface. Smart
    farming like other emerging technologies is embracing new networking paradigms
    to tackle today’s sophisticated attacks. Software defined network (SDN) [130]–[132]
    is one such promising networking revolution. Through decoupling control plane
    from data plane and giving credit to network programmable, it offers interesting
    technical capabilities to network providers. This causes an intense adaption of
    SDN in almost every fields of networking, from data center networks to WANs, wireless,
    5G and recently IoT. Using SDN in smart farm networking is attracting to both
    academia and industry for certain reasons. SDN supports both physical and virtual
    networking scenarios very well. It also offers a reliable way of practicing networking
    in highly diverse and naturally heterogeneous smart farms networking environment.
    Moreover, using SDN, smart farms are able to form a holistic view of all the connected
    devices along with how they interact in a near real time manner. Such a holistic
    view not only improves agility, scalability, and manageability of smart farm networking
    but also empowers a large smart farm network to enforce robust security counter
    measure against possible sophisticated cyber attacks. It is important to research
    further the adaptability of SDN and other 5G related next generation communication
    technologies in smart farming and precision agriculture domain. SDN can enable
    smart farms to get the most benefit out of complex machine learning and AI algorithms
    to automate network management of large number of sensors, wireless and wired
    networks used in a smart farming ecosystem. It also facilitates implementing advanced,
    cross-layer network security solutions which are very time and resource consuming,
    if not impossible, otherwise. Finally, SDN expedites edge networking and hence
    cloud-based security-as-a-service delivery model becomes a more approachable solution
    in large smart farming deployments. D. Compliance and Supply Chain Perspective
    With the ubiquitous use of sensors, automated drones, blockchain, artificial intelligence
    integration, different agricultural businesses are falling back on compliance,
    regulation and cyber insurance to protect themselves [64]. With the development
    of targeted malware and other cyber threats, the entire food supply chain is at
    risk [12], [64]. A hostile actor specifically interested in disrupting the supply
    chain can target various organizations and companies that supply raw material
    to farms or process food for the end user. A potential solution to this problem
    is to develop industry standards that enable trust between various raw material
    suppliers and downstream food processors [64]. The development of these standards
    enforced by national governments through regulation, has been slow. One example
    of such a shortcoming, is the existence of a few cybersecurity standards for the
    many smart devices used in the food supply chain. Various legislation are being
    introduced to set ‘minimal cybersecurity operational standards for internet connected
    devices’. In specific cases where various governments do not wish to regulate
    these interactions, it is up to various agriculture businesses to protect themselves
    by asking their supply chain to ‘self-regulate’ cybersecurity best practices [64].
    Such developments can be pushed through market demands, competitive pressure,
    etc. The food supply chain also lacks robust cyber insurance policies. With the
    constant development of smart applications, AI, smart farming equipment, etc.
    cyber insurance providers are unable to predict and quantify various cyber risks
    involved in these systems. Specific research needs to be done so as to develop
    standard legal jargon and metrics to quantify cyber risk in smart farming. These
    will help create robust cyber insurance markets for precision agriculture. Various
    systems [133]–[136] also need to be built to make it easier for the end users
    to understand and parse these complex legal documents, cyber insurance policies,
    agreements, contracts, etc. Research on these open challenges will help wide adoption
    of precision agriculture technologies. SECTION VII. Conclusion The proliferation
    of smart devices with communication and sensing capabilities have unleashed plethora
    of user services, and at the same time made tasks more convenient and efficient
    for humans. However, wide adoption of such internet connected devices and data
    driven applications across various domains have raised security and privacy issues,
    making these systems vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This paper discusses such cybersecurity
    challenges in smart farming and elaborates open research questions. The paper
    first outlines a multi-layer smart farming architecture illustrating different
    entities pertinent to real time use-cases supported by edge and cloud environments.
    Based on the architecture, the paper outlines security and privacy issues and
    highlights different attacks scenarios in smart farms as well as scenarios affecting
    the entire food supply chain. Thereafter, this article surveys the state-of-the-art
    research and acknowledges important works related to cybersecurity in the domain.
    Finally, the paper illustrates several open challenges and research problems pertinent
    to security and privacy aspects in precision agriculture. We envision this paper
    will simulate research to solve platitude of security and data privacy issues
    in fast growing and economically important smart farming sector. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    1. Introduction\nPrecision Agriculture (PA) is a whole-farm management approach\
    \ using information technology,\nremote sensing and proximal data gathering. These\
    \ technologies have the goal of optimising returns\non inputs while potentially\
    \ reducing environmental impacts. Farmers and agronomists have already\nbegun\
    \ employing technologies in order to improve the efﬁciency of their work. Sensors\
    \ placed\nin greenhouses allow farmers to obtain detailed data on real-time as\
    \ variables such as soil and\nambient temperature, irrigation water and soil conductivity,\
    \ soil and irrigation water PH, nutrient\ncomposition data, irrigation water properties,\
    \ etc. These data can be transmitted and analysed using\ncommunication technologies\
    \ and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) paradigms could be applied. Farmers use\ntheir\
    \ smartphones to remotely monitor their crops and equipments and to run some statistical\
    \ data.\nAll of these techniques help make up PA. Nowadays, the farmers are using\
    \ resources developed by\ninformation and communication technologies. These ﬁrst\
    \ resources are easy to use but they are general\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731; doi:10.3390/s18061731\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n2 of 21\npurpose and, therefore,\
    \ not adapted to the speciﬁc needs of each farmer. In this work an user-centred\n\
    method is proposed to design intelligent and adapted services where each farmer\
    \ decides its own\ninstallation using edge and fog paradigms (distributed computing)\
    \ on Internet of Things technologies\n(Figure 1). This method is designed on different\
    \ use cases and tested in an automated greenhouse as\nan example of utility. The\
    \ work is an expanded version presented in [1]. This paper is organized as\nfollows:\
    \ Section 2 reviews precision agriculture scenarios, how to use centred design\
    \ methodologies,\nIoT technologies and their deployment, the capabilities and\
    \ potential of edge and fog computing\nparadigms in these scenarios. Different\
    \ greenhouses are analysed and farmers are consulted. Section 3\nproposes a method\
    \ to deploy distributed IoT architecture using edge and fog nodes that offer a\
    \ set\nof new resources that can be used in any type of installation which facilitates\
    \ the involvement of\nthe farmer. In Section 4, experiments including services\
    \ on edge and fog nodes, connected by IoT\ncommunication protocols, are performed.\
    \ Finally, Section 5 provides conclusions and future works.\nFigure 1. Agricultural\
    \ System.\n2. Related Works\nAlthough more complex deﬁnitions exist, the simple\
    \ description of the PA is a way to “apply the\nright treatment in the right place\
    \ at the right time” [2].\nPrecision agriculture comprises a set\nof technologies\
    \ that combine sensors, information systems, enhanced machinery and informed\n\
    management to optimize production by accounting for variability and uncertainties\
    \ within agricultural\nsystems. It is a farming management concept based upon\
    \ observing, measuring and responding to\ninter and intra-ﬁeld variability in\
    \ crops [3]. Methods and technologies to decide how, where and when\nto use sensors\
    \ and machinery should involve all the main actors: that is, farmers and information\n\
    and communication technicians. User-centred methods and IoT communication technologies\
    \ applied\non precision agriculture are revised in this section. Finally, different\
    \ greenhouses are analysed and\nfarmers are consulted.\n2.1. User-Centred Design\
    \ Models\nIn PA context, User-Centred Design (UCD) describe a design process where\
    \ farmers inﬂuence the\nprocess of how the design takes shape. There are several\
    \ ways in which the user (agricultural specialist)\ncan be involved in the process.\
    \ This term describes a set of methods to create models on which\ndesign adapted\
    \ solutions. The user-centred design process works against subjective assumptions\n\
    about user behaviour. It requires proof that the design decisions are effective.\
    \ If user-centred design is\nproperly done, applications becomes an outcome of\
    \ actively engaging users. Therefore, any design\ndecisions that were made by\
    \ observing and listening to them will not be based on personal preferences.\n\
    User experience (UX) is one of the many focuses of UCD. It includes the user’s\
    \ entire experience with\nthe product, including physical and emotional reactions.\
    \ UCD is objective and often relies on data\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n3 of 21\n\
    to support design decisions [4]. According to [5], user centred design is a development\
    \ method that\nguarantees that product, software or web site will be easy to use.\
    \ The International Usability Standard\n(ISO 13407) [6], speciﬁes the principles\
    \ that underlie user centred design:\n•\nRequirements gathering, understanding\
    \ and specifying the context of use\n•\nRequirements speciﬁcation, specifying\
    \ the user and organisational requirements\n•\nDesign, producing designs and prototypes\n\
    •\nEvaluation, carrying out user-based assessment of the site\nThe design is based\
    \ upon an explicit understanding of users, tasks and environments. Users are\n\
    involved throughout design and development. The process is iterative. The design\
    \ is driven and\nreﬁned by user-centred evaluation. The design addresses the whole\
    \ user experience. The design team\nincludes multidisciplinary skills and perspectives.\n\
    2.2. Internet of Things: Architectures and Protocols\nIot is developed using architectures\
    \ based on layers capable of connecting a huge number of\ndevices with each other\
    \ and with the established services. The basic model of IoT has a 3 layer\narchitecture\
    \ which are of Perception, Network and Application Layers. IoT faces several challenges,\n\
    especially in the ﬁeld of privacy and security, so to overcome these issues new\
    \ standard architectures\nneed to be more focused on many essential factors like\
    \ Quality of Services (QoS), data integrity,\nsustainability, conﬁdentiality,\
    \ etc. The IAB (Internet Architecture Board) has published the RFC\n7452 document:\
    \ Architectural Considerations in Smart Object Networking. This document offers\n\
    guidance to engineers designing Internet-connected smart objects. A Request for\
    \ Comments (RFC),\nin the context of Internet governance, is a type of publication\
    \ from the Internet Engineering Task Force\n(IETF) and the Internet Society (ISOC),\
    \ the principal technical development and standards-setting\nbodies for the Internet.\n\
    Table 1 illustrates different works that apply the layer model in the\nIoT architecture.\n\

    \ Network, Application [7,8]\n4\nThings, Edge, Network, Application [9]\n5\nBusiness,\
    \ Application, Service, Object abstration, Objects [10]\nIoT needs protocols adapted\
    \ to the new requirements. Traditional protocols are extended and\nnew protocols\
    \ are proposed offering different options on different contexts. IoT has now a\
    \ wide\nrange of applications. A smart devices can have wired or wireless connection.\
    \ As far as the wireless\nIoT is the main concern, many different wireless communication\
    \ technologies and protocols can be\nused to connect the smart device such as\
    \ Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6), over Low power Wireless\nPersonal Area Networks\
    \ (6LoWPAN), ZigBee, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Z-Wave and Near Field\nCommunication\
    \ (NFC). They are short range standard network protocols, while SigFox and Cellular\n\
    are Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN).standard protocols. In [11] a review and\
    \ comparison of\ndifferent communication protocols in IoT is realised. This comparison\
    \ aims at presenting guidelines\nfor the researchers to be able to select the\
    \ right protocol for different applications. Table 2 illustrates\ndifferent protocols\
    \ used in the architecture layers.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n4 of 21\nTable 2.\

    Choosing the most appropriate protocol depends on several facts of which most\
    \ important are:\nenvironmental conditions, network characteristics, the amount\
    \ of data to be transferred, security levels\nand quality of service requests\
    \ [12]. CoAP network is primarily a one-to-one protocol for transferring\nstate\
    \ information between client and server while MQTT is a many-to-many communication\n\
    protocol for exchanging messages between multiple clients. CoAP runs over UDP\
    \ which means\nthat communication overhead is signiﬁcantly reduced. If constrained\
    \ communication and battery\nconsumption is not an issue, RESTful services can\
    \ be easily implemented and interact with the Internet\nusing the worldwide HTTP\
    \ [13]. If the targeted ﬁnal applications require massive updates of the same\n\
    value, MQTT protocol is more suitable. In this work different protocols (MQTT,\
    \ HTTP, Bluetooth, WiFi,\nLTE, ...) can be used to develop proposed architecture.\n\
    2.3. Internet of Things Technologies Applied on PA Scenarios\nAdvance in electronics,\
    \ computing and telecommunications are allowing the development of\nnew devices\
    \ (sensors, actuators and computing nodes) with wireless communication capabilities,\n\
    installed at any location, smaller, energy efﬁcient, autonomous, more powerful\
    \ and low cost [14–18].\nIoT works using user-driven service modeling is proposed\
    \ in [19]. Low-cost IoT devices that need\nto gather and transmit sensor data\
    \ and receive remote commands is shown in [20–22]. IoT uses the\nconnection between\
    \ devices to improve their efﬁciency and user experience, being the communication\n\
    one of the main elements for a proper IoT network. A review of the most common\
    \ wired and wireless\ncommunication protocols, discussion of their characteristics,\
    \ advantages and disadvantages as well as\na comparison study to choose the best\
    \ bidirectional sensor network composed by low power devices is\nrealised in [23].\
    \ Previous works show the degree of development of IoT technology, which has also\n\
    been experienced in precision agriculture in recent years.\nIoT technologies are\
    \ proposed in PA scenarios. In [24] this paradigm is analysed as a solution in\n\
    precision farming. IoT Smart farming application include farm parameters tracking,\
    \ monitoring, ﬁeld\nobservation and storage monitoring. The work Internet of Things\
    \ Platform for Smart Farming [25]\npresents a platform based on IoT technologies\
    \ that can automate the collection of environmental, soil,\nfertilisation, and\
    \ irrigation data; automatically correlate such data and ﬁlter-out invalid data\
    \ from\nthe perspective of assessing crop performance; and compute crop forecasts\
    \ and personalised crop\nrecommendations for any particular farm. This platform\
    \ (SmartFarmNet) can integrate virtually any\nIoT device, including commercially\
    \ available sensors, cameras, weather stations, etc., and store their\ndata in\
    \ the cloud for performance analysis and recommendations. An evaluation of the\
    \ SmartFarmNet\nplatform and the experiences and lessons learnt in developing\
    \ this system concludes the paper.\nSmartFarmNet is the ﬁrst and currently largest\
    \ system in the world (in terms of the number of\nsensors attached, crops assessed,\
    \ and users it supports) that provides crop performance analysis\nand recommendations.\n\
    In [9] a greenhouse with hydroponic crop production was designed, developed and\
    \ tested using\nUbiquitous Sensor Network monitoring and control on Internet of\
    \ Things paradigm. The experimental\nresults showed that the Internet technologies\
    \ and Smart Object Communication Patterns can be\ncombined to encourage development\
    \ of Precision Agriculture. They demonstrated added beneﬁts\n(cost, energy, smart\
    \ developing, acceptance by agricultural specialists) when a project is launched.\n\
    Other related work is shown in [26] with Zig Bee technology: Artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ and decision\nsupport approaches have been developed. This work develop technology\
    \ for real-time monitoring\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n5 of 21\nof citrus soil moisture\
    \ and nutrients and the research on the integration of fertilization and irrigation\n\
    decision support system. The results showed that the system could help the grower\
    \ to scientiﬁcally\nfertilize or irrigate, improve the precision operation level\
    \ of citrus production, reduce the cost and\nreduce the pollution caused by chemical\
    \ fertilizer. A review into the state-of-the-art of Big Data\napplications in\
    \ Smart Farming is performed in [27]. Malche et al. [28] proposed a prototype\
    \ IoT system\nfor water level monitoring which can be implemented in future smart\
    \ villages in India. Manufacturers\nof the agricultural sector highlights the\
    \ importance of IoT in [29–32]. PA is effectively a suite of\nmethods, approaches\
    \ and instrumentation that farmers should examine in detail to decide which is\n\
    the most suitable for their business.\n2.4. Internet of Things, Cloud and Machine\
    \ Learning Evolution: Edge and Fog Computing Paradigms\nInternet of Things (IoT)\
    \ aims to bring every object (e.g. smart cameras, environmental sensors,\ncontrol\
    \ appliances, machine learning analysis) on line, hence generating massive amounts\
    \ of data that\ncan overwhelm storage systems and data analytic applications.\
    \ Cloud computing offers services at\nthe infrastructure level that can scale\
    \ to IoT storage and processing requirements. However, there are\napplications\
    \ such as sensor monitoring, control and analysis response that require low latency\
    \ therefore,\ndelay caused by transferring data to the cloud and then back to\
    \ the application can seriously impact\ntheir performances. To overcome this limitation,\
    \ Fog and Edge computing paradigms have been\nproposed, where cloud services are\
    \ extended to the edge of the network to decrease the latency and\nnetwork congestion\
    \ [33]. Both fog computing and edge computing involve pushing intelligence and\n\
    processing capabilities down closer to where the data originates from pumps, motors,\
    \ sensors, relays,\netc. The key difference between the two architectures is exactly\
    \ where that intelligence and computing\npower is placed:\n•\nFog computing pushes\
    \ intelligence down to the local area network level, processing data in a fog\n\
    node or IoT gateway\n•\nEdge computing pushes the intelligence, processing power\
    \ and communication capabilities of an\nedge gateway or appliance directly into\
    \ devices like programmable automation controllers (PACs)\nWith IoT implementation\
    \ now becoming more widespread, devices will generate a lot of data at\nthe end\
    \ of the network and many applications will be deployed at the edge to process\
    \ the information.\nCisco Systems predicts that an estimated 50 billion devices\
    \ will connect to the Internet by 2020 [34–36].\nSome of the applications they\
    \ run might require very short response times, some might involve private\ndata,\
    \ and some might produce huge quantities of data. Cloud computing cannot support\
    \ these IoT\napplications. Edge and Fog computing paradigms, on the other hand,\
    \ can do so and will promote\nmany new IoT applications.\nThe work done in [37]\
    \ concludes that the wireless sensor and actuator networks based on Edge\ncomputing\
    \ are experiencing fast development and opportunities in the post-Cloud era, and\
    \ are used\nin more and more applications. In [38] a Fog Computing Based on radio\
    \ access networks is proposed\nfor smart-cities services.\n2.5. Automated Technologies\
    \ in Greenhouses\nDifferent greenhouses in the south east of Spain have been visited\
    \ to analyse the type of installation\nand to ask expert users. The greenhouse\
    \ with the highest level of automation showed a complete\nnumber of sensors and\
    \ actuators; however, not all the sensors could be related. There are two large\n\
    subsystems in self-assembled greenhouses that are not interoperable. These subsystems\
    \ install different\ntypes of control and technologies:\n•\nIrrigation and nutrition\n\
    •\nAir conditioning and ventilation.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n6 of 21\nIn these\
    \ facilities, an ambient temperature sensor of the air conditioning system is\
    \ not related to\nan irrigation water temperature sensor of the irrigation system.\
    \ Figure 2 shows different automated\ngreenhouses where main subsystems are listed.\n\
    Figure 2. Automated greenhouses: main subsystems in current facilities.\n3. User\
    \ Centred and Computing Method Model: Distributed Computing Architecture Based\
    \ on\nEdge and Fog Nodes\nThe current agricultural facilities are divided in subsystems\
    \ (irrigation, light, climate, soil, crop\nand energy) that are not interconnected.\
    \ Industrial logic programmable controllers and specialised\nsensors give basic\
    \ automation services in each subsystem. Internet and electronic devices (smartphones)\n\
    provide new functionalities based on information access, control and monitoring.\
    \ Human interfaces\non smartphones connected to web servers are examples of new\
    \ services developed over the past years.\nAgricultural technician and farmers\
    \ have knowledge that can be converted on expert rules for device\ncontrol. These\
    \ rules are programmed and implemented on actual programmable devices; however,\n\
    they are static rules which means that do not evolve when new conditions occur,\
    \ neither do they\nadapt to the singularities of each installation. The farmer\
    \ has to decide how to set the rules: what pH\nthe irrigation water must have,\
    \ how much water should be programmed in irrigation process, etc.\nAlso, each\
    \ rule only has effects in a subsystem (irrigation, climate), there is no interoperability.\n\
    Considering this context, new facilities design and development method are proposed\
    \ in this\nwork. The aim is that the farmer participates in the automated activities\
    \ and that the subsystems\nbecome interoperable. A method that implement automatic\
    \ rules and automate the decision making\nconsidering the behaviour of the installation\
    \ itself are also proposed. The phases of the proposed\nmodel are shown in Figure\
    \ 3.\n•\nAnalysis: two kind of users are identiﬁed in this phase (agriculture\
    \ user expert and ICT technician).\nExpert users in agriculture are interviewed\
    \ to deﬁne main processes to control. All these issues are\nrelated with ICT expert\
    \ in a participatory design. The results of this ﬁrst approach are the things\n\
    required to design services and control. In this phase an user-centred methodology\
    \ captures the\nfarmer requirements.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n7 of 21\n•\nDesign:\
    \ the model is based on an architecture with three levels: edge, fog and cloud\
    \ services.\nIn this phase an adapted architecture using these levels is designed.\
    \ The adapted architecture is\nshown in Figure 4.\n•\nIntegration and data analysis:\
    \ Installation and Integration subsystems are developed in this phase.\nData analysis\
    \ is proposed to design machine learning services based on expert rules with farmer.\n\
    •\nStart up, measure and feedback: Test and feedback are launched.\nThe ﬁrst expert\
    \ rules\nare integrated with farmer supervision.\nNew rules are designed with\
    \ feedback processes.\nAutomatic and adapted rules are developed using artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence systems with machine\nlearning platforms.\nFigure 3. User centred\
    \ model based on design and integration of edge and fog communication levels.\n\
    Cloud services and machine learning processes are integrated using this method.\n\
    Figure 4. Architecture: communication levels with different functionality.\nSensors\
    \ 2018, 18, 1731\n8 of 21\n3.1. User-Centred Analysis and Design\nThere are two\
    \ cases treated:\n•\nAgricultural installation with some automated facilities\
    \ already installed\n•\nNew agricultural installation\nThe method is the same\
    \ for both. Expert users in agriculture are interviewed to deﬁne new\nprocesses\
    \ to control. In this ﬁrst approach, the things (objects) required, their relationships\
    \ and the\npotential services are detected. Once objects and services have been\
    \ detected, they must be related\nto the necessary communication and control technologies\
    \ (IoT protocols). Human Interfacing are\nadjusted. Expert rules and intelligent\
    \ services are analysed (Edge and Fog computing proposal). Finally,\nthe installation,\
    \ maintenance and operation methods are designed. All this is designed between\
    \ user\nagricultural technician and information technologies expert.\nThe results\
    \ of this ﬁrst approach are the things required to design services and control.\
    \ A ﬁrst set\nof sensors, actuators, variables, processes and controllers are\
    \ designed considering production facility.\nThis set of objects will be considers\
    \ like things in the next stage.\nIn this description, a thing is formed by an\
    \ object/entity and a context with data associated.\nEach thing has a n-tuple\
    \ data structure (ID, time, date, location, relations, state) where ID, data,\n\
    location, relations with other things and states are deﬁned. Table 3 represents\
    \ different things.\nExpert users design control rules using the things deﬁned.\
    \ These control rules are part of control\nprocesses (climate, soil, irrigation,\
    \ crop, energy or image) that are distributed in different embedded\nsystems connected\
    \ to the network (intranet/internet). Things are a virtual representation of all\n\
    available resources that can be deployed in the different subsystems of the installation.\n\
    At this level all objects/things are recognized by designers. Basic control algorithms\
    \ of all\nsubsystems are designed.\nTable 3. Things context designed in smart\
    \ control processes.\nObject/Thing\nContext\nSensori\n(ID, time, date, location,\
    \ relations, state)\nActuatori\n(ID, time, date, location, relations, state)\n\

    \ date, location, relations, state)\nControlleri\n(ID, time, date, location, relations,\
    \ state)\n3.2. Integration: Architecture Development\nIn the previous phase objects\
    \ and their relationship with basic algorithms has been designed.\nAn architecture\
    \ adapted to the facility available is developed in this phase. Requirements are:\n\
    1.\nInterconnection and data access of all subsystems data\n2.\nFacilities and\
    \ resources to implement expert rules\n3.\nConﬁguration, operation and modiﬁcation\
    \ processes\nIoT and AI paradigms provide resources to propose an innovative architecture\
    \ that can be used in\nnew smart precision agriculture services. Edge computing\
    \ used on control devices and fog computing\nnodes installed on local network\
    \ provide powerful technologies to implement conﬁguration, operation\nand improvement\
    \ processes.\nIoT protocols provide resources to capture and communique all subsystems\
    \ data. Each subsystem\nis composed by objects/things (sensor/actuator) that can\
    \ be connected and processed using nodes on\nsensor networks with IoT protocols.\
    \ The requirements established for PA scenarios are:\n•\nStandard and interoperable\
    \ communication protocols to develop open and reusable applications.\nSensors\
    \ 2018, 18, 1731\n9 of 21\n•\nLow-power consumption of all devices installed improve\
    \ the establishment and development.\n•\nEasy access and maintenance. Users are\
    \ not specialized in information technologies. It is important\nto improve its\
    \ acceptability.\n•\nSupport the integration of new smart modules (modularity\
    \ and scalability software and hardware).\n•\nNon-proprietary hardware-software\
    \ to reduce dependencies.\n•\nLow cost devices selection increases the level of\
    \ penetration.\nIoT protocols are designed to work on communication scenarios\
    \ and requirements established.\nThey are optimised for control and two-way open\
    \ communication channels. In these works [39–41]\nMessage Queuing Telemetry Transport\
    \ (MQTT) protocol is proposed as communication paradigm\nbetween sensors, actuators,\
    \ communication nodes, devices and subsystems. Some of the features that\nmakes\
    \ it especially suitable for this project are:\n•\nMQTT is a publish-subscribe\
    \ messaging protocol developed for resource-constrained devices [42],\na model\
    \ already in use by enterprises worldwide, and can work with legacy systems.\n\
    •\nAll messages have a topic path composed of words separated by slashes. A common\
    \ form is\n/place/device-type/device-id/measurement-type/status. The subscribers\
    \ may use wild-cards to\nsubscribe to all measurements coming from a speciﬁc class\
    \ of device.\n•\nThe bandwidth requirements are extremely low, and the nature\
    \ of the protocol makes it\nvery energy-efﬁcient.\n•\nThe programming interface\
    \ is very simple, and the client memory footprint is small, making it\nespecially\
    \ suitable for embedded devices.\n•\nThree Quality of Service (QoS) levels provide\
    \ reliable operations [43].\nUbiquitous networks allow an n-to-m nodes communication\
    \ model. Any node is able to query\nand be queried by other nodes. In addition,\
    \ any node may play the role of a base station (skin node)\ncapable of transmitting\
    \ its information to remote processing places using a gateway device. USN local\n\
    nodes can use and process local data, with a gateway these nodes have a global\
    \ accessibility and\nthey offer extended services on an IoT scenario.\nLocal and\
    \ global access over the same node\n(sensor/device/actuator) has different possibilities\
    \ and beneﬁts. Whereas a local data processing\nis necessary in basic process\
    \ control (security, system start-stop, etc.), global processing (analytic)\n\
    can be used in pattern detection and information generation. In this sense, the\
    \ proposed platform\nuses both technologies combined: different USN over a local\
    \ network area (intranet) connected to\ncloud-IoT services (internet). A computing\
    \ layer in local area, called edge computing, will serve as\ninterface between\
    \ control processes and cloud-services. This layer will be able to process data\
    \ before\ncommunicating to cloud.\n3.3. Data Analysis: Edge and Fog Computing\
    \ Conﬁguration\nThe development of edge and fog computing can be understood in\
    \ three phases:\n•\nConnection: Numerous heterogeneous, real time connections\
    \ between terminals and devices\nwill serve edge computing, as will automatic\
    \ network deployment and operation. Additionally,\nsecurity, reliability, and\
    \ interoperability of connections should be guaranteed. An application of\nthis\
    \ phase is remote automatic soil parameters and ambient conditions data reading\n\
    •\nData treatment on edge computing devices: In this phase, data analysis and\
    \ automatic services\ndevelop new capabilities that are implemented on the new\
    \ edge nodes. Applications of this\nphase can be data ﬁltering, predictive calculation\
    \ of climatic data, classiﬁcation services or\ndetection events\n•\nServices on\
    \ fog computing nodes: Enabled by technologies such as AI and IoT communication\n\
    protocols. Fog computing nodes carries out smart analysis and computing, as well\
    \ as implementing\ndynamic, real-time self-optimization, and executing policy\
    \ adjustments. Applications of this phase\nare prediction of water consumption,\
    \ smart detection or unattended production\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n10 of 21\n\
    Figure 5 shows the architecture implemented using edge and fog nodes. When automated\n\
    subsystems are already installed it is necessary to interleaved embedded devices\
    \ (edge-nodes) between\ncontrollers and sensors/actuators. This devices maintain\
    \ the initial services and allow to initiate\na supervised learning process. New\
    \ algorithms are tested and approved on edge and fog nodes.\nIn Figure 6 different\
    \ services are proposed on each node.\nFigure 5. Architecture proposed on facilities\
    \ already automated: edge nodes interleaved between\ndevices already installed\
    \ and fog nodes that interconnect all subsystems.\nFigure 6. Architecture implemented:\
    \ services proposed.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n11 of 21\n3.4. Test and Feedback\
    \ Developing\nIn machine learning systems the output is not ﬁxed. It will change\
    \ over time as the solution\nknows more and as the model on which the machine\
    \ learning system is built evolves as it is fed more\ndata. This forces the testing\
    \ professional to think differently and adopt test strategies that are very\n\
    different from traditional testing techniques. To test machine learning systems\
    \ is essential:\n1.\nObtaining data sets: This refers to a data set with main\
    \ variables captured and stored to analyse\nand design the model. In irrigation\
    \ process data set are: irrigation programming used (time and\nﬂow), ambient conditions\
    \ (humidity, temperature) and soil conditions (humidity, temperature,\npH and\
    \ conductivity) captured by sensors. All this data are monitored and stored.\n\
    2.\nTraining data sets: This refers to a data set used for training the model.\
    \ It is a subset of the\nprevious dataset. In irrigation process training data\
    \ set are: irrigation programming automated\nby the model (time and ﬂow decision)\
    \ considering ambient conditions (soil, ambient and crop).\nThis data is usually\
    \ prepared by collecting data in a semi-automated way. The results of this\nprocess\
    \ are validated with agronomists.\n3.\nTesting data sets: It is a dataset used\
    \ to to measure the model quality.\n4.\nValidation test suites on real scenarios.\
    \ Taking the irrigation example, test scenarios include\ncategorizing needs of\
    \ water for a kind of crop considering climatic conditions and its growth\nphase.\
    \ Automated irrigation decisions by the model are analysed in this phase.\n5.\n\
    Building validation suites. It is necessary to understand the algorithm. The model\
    \ has algorithm\nthat analyse the data provided, looks for speciﬁc patterns, and\
    \ uses the results of this analysis\nto develop optimal parameters for creating\
    \ the model. The model is reﬁned as the number of\niterations and the richness\
    \ of the data increase.\n6.\nCommunicating test results in statistical terms.\
    \ Models based on machine learning algorithms\nwill produce approximations and\
    \ not exact results. Quality of results must be analysed in the\nsame context.\
    \ The testing community will need to determine the level of conﬁdence within a\n\
    certain range.\n7.\nModel evolution. Support to develop new AI services or modiﬁcations\
    \ on algorithms\nimplemented. Supervised and automatic changes are processes to\
    \ maintain the operating models.\n3.5. Comparison with Industrial Facilities.\
    \ Novelty Elements Proposed\nCurrently, industrial facilities that use PA technologies\
    \ are based on integration of internet and web\nservices with automation and control\
    \ using industrial technology. Proprietary systems are designed for\nmonitoring\
    \ large production plants. Related work analysed show that the Agriculture Control\
    \ system\nfor production, irrigation, or climate proposes different monitoring\
    \ and control technologies, based on\nwireless sensor network and industrial control.\
    \ Monitoring systems analyse crop environment and the\nmethod to improve the decision\
    \ making by analysing statistics and reactive algorithms. This work\nproposes\
    \ two main novelty elements: optimization of architecture levels integration of\
    \ edge and fog\nlayers and proposes the integration the farmer in the design of\
    \ new improvements using data analysis\nobtained with the new architecture developed.\n\
    4. Experimental Work\nDifferent agricultural facilities have been analysed to\
    \ introduce the method proposed. Three kind\nof installations summarize the different\
    \ types:\n•\nInstallation automated but subsystems not interoperable\n•\nPartial\
    \ automation without any interconnection and non-interoperable systems\n•\nManual\
    \ control\nIn all of them, the services based on AI are not yet installed. In\
    \ this context, the method proposed\nusing edge-computing on basic controllers\
    \ and fog-computing on gateway nodes can design common\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n\
    12 of 21\nservices for the three types of facilities cited. With this conﬁguration,\
    \ subsystems interoperability and\nAI support are achieved. Control signals of\
    \ already installed controllers in automated installations\nbecome inputs to edge\
    \ nodes and a fog node which acts as an interface for all facility nodes. In all\n\
    greenhouses, irrigation and internal environment control are basic processes.\
    \ Agronomist users know\nhow to program reactive controls and how to conﬁgure\
    \ automated devices. Optimization of these\nresources (water, energy) are two\
    \ potential services that agronomist perform through their experience.\nThis knowledge\
    \ can be transferred to intelligent systems that integrate it through techniques\
    \ based on\nAI paradigms. Interconnection of subsystems also are one of the proposed\
    \ improvement. A deployment\nfor an automated installation is designed and implemented.\
    \ This case shows how to implement\nwhen there are already automated installations.\
    \ This case also serves as a guide for other types of\ngreenhouse installations.\n\
    4.1. Analysis\nThe farmer, together with the technician in information technologies,\
    \ propose a set\nof improvements:\n•\nMonitoring and control interfaces on the\
    \ Internet (control and communication services)\n•\nEvent and change communication\
    \ service (communication services)\n•\nInterconnection of irrigation and air conditioning\
    \ subsystems (interoperability services)\n•\nIntegration of automation to optimize\
    \ water consumption (AI services)\nThe work carried out designs an installation\
    \ that deploy the necessary hardware and software\nresources using the proposed\
    \ method Figure (Figure 7) shows agricultural subsystems and model\ndeployed on\
    \ distributed nodes.\nFigure 7. Greenhouse design. Fog and edge nodes relations\
    \ on agriculture subsystems.\nIntelligent irrigation control is installed in an\
    \ experimental greenhouse based on tomato\nhydroponic cultivation (Table 4). Following\

    \ Communication and Context\nIrrigation process, soil parameters, environmental\
    \ conditions inside and outside the greenhouse\nand energy consumption deﬁne objects\
    \ and context. Sensors, actuators and processes and their\nrelationship (context)\
    \ are shown in Table 5. Context vector are (ID, time, date, GH1, relations, state)\
    \ for\neach object/thing, where GH1 is the location ID of greenhouse.\nAll objects\
    \ are interoperable using MQTT protocol. Publisher and subscriber communication\n\
    model that implement this protocol allows interconnect all devices and things.\
    \ Broker device are\ninstalled on fog node. Publishers and subscribers are implemented\
    \ on different nodes.\n4.3. Hardware Devices and Software Modules\nTwo edge nodes\
    \ and one fog node are proposed to control climate and irrigation processes.\n\
    Objects (things) and processes are deployed on all nodes. Irrigation and climate\
    \ control are installed\nin edge nodes, AI services are implemented in fog node.\
    \ Process control architecture is used in\nthe ﬁrst node type (edge) and data-centred\
    \ architecture is used in the second node type (fog) and\nin the cloud services\
    \ implemented. In edge node the ﬂow of data comes from a set of variables\n(things\
    \ and internal variables) which control the processes execution. Agronomist and\

    \ edge nodes are deployed and allows:\n•\nWork in the same way as before (initial\
    \ learning stage, analysis and model selection).\n•\nChange to a new control using\
    \ new expert and automatic rules using AI processes (supervised stage\nand training)\n\
    •\nTest and reconﬁgure expert rules (testing and maintenance)\nFigure 8 shows\
    \ an edge node to irrigation control and how is deployed in the experimental\n\
    greenhouse built in this work, without previous installation. Agronomists and\
    \ farmers preferences are\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n15 of 21\nthose that drive\
    \ the design: interfaces, maintain and optimize control processes. In irrigation\
    \ process a\ntime schedule with the selected flow rate is programmed by the user\
    \ according to the period of crop\ngrowth. In learning stage, edge node captures\
    \ the data and sends it to the fog node. Fog node process\ndiary water uses, ambient\
    \ and soil conditions, type of crop and its growth. Using these data crop\ntype\
    \ is classified. Crop production results are added as data to analyse it together\
    \ with the stored ones.\nProduction, water consumption, crop growing stage, time,\
    \ date, soil parameters, current weather, forecast\nweather and ambient green\
    \ house conditions are captured as inputs to machine learning platform.\n(a) Hardware\
    \ device\n(b) Software processes\nFigure 8. Hardware and software deployed on\
    \ experimental greenhouse edge node.\nIn future crop productions the irrigation\
    \ schedule can be automated, first with human supervision\nand then automated.\
    \ Biophysical variables (plant, soil, canal flow, and weather conditions) that\
    \ are\nmeasured during the growing seasons are used as inputs to build the models.\
    \ Information about\ncrop phenology (growth stages), soil moisture, and weather\
    \ variables will be compiled. The analysis\nof irrigation decisions is important\
    \ because this can help in the estimation of short-term irrigation\ndemands. If\
    \ the automated process decisions are known, It can help canal operators to better\
    \ manage\nwater deliveries and avoid unexpected delays and operational conditions\
    \ that increase canal losses.\nInformation about these demands can also be helpful\
    \ for the evaluation of expected future agricultural\nsupplies. It can never be\
    \ possible to know the exact reasons why a farmer decided to irrigate, all farmers\n\
    are different and prefer their own decision processes. Data analysis with farmer\
    \ in in its own installation\ninfer automated farmer actions. This data is used\
    \ to build the models and these learnt frameworks will\nbe used to predict irrigation\
    \ decisions. The specific objectives planned with farmer are:\n1.\nIdentify the\
    \ main variables contributing to an irrigation behaviour by training the models\
    \ with\nrelevant data\n2.\nGroup the irrigation decisions into distinct classes\n\
    3.\nIdentify the decisions taken\n4.\nDetect the patterns in farmer decisions\n\
    5.\nInfer future irrigation decisions using the information and modelling tools.\

    In this work the state-of-the-art of PA and IoT technologies in agricultural scenarios,\
    \ have been\nanalysed. PA presents difﬁculties to be implemented by farmers. These\
    \ include cultural perception,\nlack of local technical expertise, infrastructure\
    \ constraints, knowledge and technical gaps and high\nstart-up costs. Farmers\
    \ must be involved in the design and integration of these technologies in their\n\
    facilities. To carry out this solution there must be methods to facilitate such\
    \ integration. This work\nproposes a new method to integrate the farmer in the\
    \ development of new solutions using low cost\nsensing technologies and innovative\
    \ communication paradigms. An architecture based on two new\nlevels of communication\
    \ and processing nodes (edge and fog nodes) form the technological core\nof the\
    \ proposed method. Each level performs a set of interconnected functionalities.\
    \ The proposed\ninfrastructure can be installed either in already automated installations\
    \ or in the design of new facilities.\nIn the already automated installations,\
    \ the method introduces new possibilities for the development of\nintelligent\
    \ and interconnected control. An experimental work has been carried out in a greenhouse.\n\
    In this work, communication nodes have been installed and a new service based\
    \ on a decision tree\nparadigm has been designed by expert user. The facilities\
    \ that use the proposed model make the\nclimate control and irrigation subsystems\
    \ interoperable and allow the farmer to design new integrated\ncontrol rules.\
    \ The new distributed communication model allows the farmer to analyse changes\
    \ and\nimprovements. This experimental work initiates a new methodology of work\
    \ for the farmer who can\nuse these new technologies more easily. Future control\
    \ rules and services using a machine learning\nplatform and AI paradigms will\
    \ allow to optimize and improve the results.\nAuthor Contributions: F.J.F.-P.\

    • SLR is conducted using PRISMA approach and148 articles are selected and critically
    analyzed. • The results show the extent of digital technologies adoption in agriculture.
    • The potential benefits of digital technologies and roadblocks hindering their
    implementation in agriculture sector are identified and discussed. • The study
    will positively impact the research around agriculture 4.0. Abstract Agriculture
    is considered one of the most important sectors that play a strategic role in
    ensuring food security. However, with the increasing world''s population, agri-food
    demands are growing — posing the need to switch from traditional agricultural
    methods to smart agriculture practices, also known as agriculture 4.0. To fully
    benefit from the potential of agriculture 4.0, it is significant to understand
    and address the problems and challenges associated with it. This study, therefore,
    aims to contribute to the development of agriculture 4.0 by investigating the
    emerging trends of digital technologies in the agricultural industry. For this
    purpose, a systematic literature review based on Protocol of Preferred Reporting
    Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses is conducted to analyse the scientific
    literature related to crop farming published in the last decade. After applying
    the protocol, 148 papers were selected and the extent of digital technologies
    adoption in agriculture was examined in the context of service type, technology
    readiness level, and farm type. The results have shown that digital technologies
    such as autonomous robotic systems, internet of things, and machine learning are
    significantly explored and open-air farms are frequently considered in research
    studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). Moreover, it is observed that most
    use cases are still in the prototypical phase. Finally, potential roadblocks to
    the digitization of the agriculture sector were identified and classified at technical
    and socio-economic levels. This comprehensive review results in providing useful
    information on the current status of digital technologies in agriculture along
    with prospective future opportunities. Previous article in issue Next article

    problem Food security is a multidimensional concept that alleviates hunger by
    ensuring a sustainable, nutritious food supply. It is characterized by a four-pillar
    model shown in Fig. 1, with each pillar intrinsic to ensure food security [1].

    full-size image Fig. 2. Agriculture value chain: stages and main functions. Due
    to several anthropogenic factors, such as rapid population growth, urbanization,
    industrialization, farmland loss, freshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation,
    food security is becoming a serious global issue. This is because these factors
    are also directly impacting agricultural industry which is a primary source of
    agri-food production around the world. It is anticipated that by 2050 global population
    will be increased from the current 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion, urban population
    will be rise by 66%, arable land will be declined by approximately 50 million
    hectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO2 – promote crop disease and pest
    growth) will be increased by 50%, agri-food production will be declined by 20%,
    and eventually, food demand will be increased by 59 to 98% – posing an imminent
    threat to food security and adequate food availability [2], [3], [4]. To satisfy
    the increasing food demands, agricultural practitioners worldwide will need to
    maximise the agricultural productivity involving crop and livestock farming. In
    this review paper, the focus is on crop farming that involves cultivation of both
    food and cash crops. A typical agri-food value chain depicting three primary stages,
    namely pre-field (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and harvesting stage),
    and post-field (post-harvesting stage) involved in the production of agricultural
    products is shown in Fig. 2. All the stages play a vital role in the value chain
    but, in this review, the second stage ˝in-field˝ will be considered that involves
    several crop growing processes such as plowing, sowing, spraying, and harvesting,
    etc. These processes currently employ traditional agricultural practices that
    are labor-intensive, require arable land, time, and a substantial amount of water
    (for irrigation) – making it a challenge to produce enough agri-food [5]. A part
    of problem is also related to irregular use of pesticides and herbicides and misuse
    of available technology which cause harm to crop and eventually resulting in agricultural
    wastes [6]. These issues can be addressed by integrating sophisticated technologies
    and computer-based applications that ensure high crop yield, less water consumption,
    optimised pesticide/herbicide utilization, and enhanced crop quality. This is
    where the smart agriculture concept comes in. 1.2. Smart agriculture Industry
    4.0, also known as the fourth industrial revolution, is revolutionizing, and reshaping
    every industry. It is a strategic initiative characterized by a fusion of emerging
    disruptive digital technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), big data and
    analytics (BDA), system integration (SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous
    robotic systems (ARS), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless
    sensor networks (WSN), cyber-physical system (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive
    manufacturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. The integration
    of these technologies in agriculture is sparking the next generation industrial
    agriculture, namely, agriculture 4.0 – also termed smart agriculture, smart farming,
    or digital farming [7]. Smart agriculture provides farmers with a diverse set
    of tools (shown in Fig. 3) to address several agricultural food production challenges
    associated with farm productivity, environmental impact, food security, crop losses,
    and sustainability. For instance, with IoT-enabled systems consisting of WSNs,
    farmers can connect to farms remotely irrespective of place and time to monitor
    and control farm operations. Drones equipped with hyperspectral cameras can be
    used to collect data from heterogeneous sources on farmlands and autonomous robots
    can be used to support or accomplish repetitive tasks at farms. Data analytics
    techniques can be employed to analyze the gathered data with computer applications
    can be used to assist farmers in decision-making process. Likewise, a wide variety
    of parameters related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production
    status, water management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides,
    and pesticides, and controlled environment agriculture can be monitored and analyzed
    in smart agriculture to increase crop yields, minimize costs, enhance product
    quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of modern systems [8]. Download

    The concept of “Smart Agriculture”. 1.3. Research motivation and contribution
    The motivation for preparing this review stems from the fact that digital technologies
    in agricultural systems offer new strategic solutions for enhancing the efficiency
    and effectiveness of farms’ production. Moreover, digital transformation provides
    a way forward to implement modern farming practices such as vertical farming (hydroponics,
    aquaponics and aeroponics), which has the potential to overcome food security
    problems. But there is a set of problems and limitations associated with this
    transformation from the technical, socio-economic, and management standpoint that
    must be death to fully exploit the potential of agriculture 4.0 [9]. There are
    number of studies that have discussed emerging trends in the development of agriculture
    4.0 by providing succinct information on key applications, advantages, and corresponding
    research challenges of smart farming [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15],
    [16], [17], [18]. The research focus of these studies is limited to either explaining
    more generic technical aspects while paying attention to only one or few digital
    technologies, and/or enhancing agricultural supply chain performance, and/or developing
    agriculture 4.0 definition, and/or achieving sustainable agronomy through precision
    agriculture, and/or proposing a smart farming framework. Nevertheless, these studies
    do not involve explicit discussion on the tools and techniques used to develop
    different systems and maturity level of these systems. There is also a lack of
    studies considering modern soilless farms such as hydroponics, aquaponics and
    aeroponics (indoor/outdoor) and implications of digital technologies in these
    farms. Hence, it is necessary to analyse the evolution of agriculture 4.0 from
    different perspectives to stimulate the discussion in the area. This study aims
    to present a holistic overview of digital technologies implemented in second stage
    of agricultural production value chain (in-field) for different types of farms
    as mentioned in section 1.1. The main theoretical contribution of the study involves
    analysis and dissemination of the tools and techniques employed, the farm type,
    the maturity level of the developed systems, along with potential roadblocks or
    inhibiting factors in development of agriculture 4.0. The reflections presented
    in the review will support researchers and agricultural practitioner in future
    research on agriculture 4.0. 1.4. Paper organization Following the introduction,
    the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the approach used to gather
    the relevant literature; then, Section 3 presents the statistical results obtained
    after a general analysis of the selected research studies; next, Section 4 provides
    a detailed overview of the core technologies used in the digitization of agriculture;
    after, Section 5 highlights the technical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital
    integration in agriculture; next, Section 6 outlines a discussion about the research
    questions followed by added value, considerations and future prospects related
    to agricultural digitization, and transition to agriculture 5.0; and lastly, Section
    8 concludes the review. 2. Research methodology A systematic literature review
    (SLR) is a tool used to manage the diverse knowledge and identify research related
    to a predetermined topic [19]. In this study, SLR is conducted to investigate
    the status of Industry 4.0 technologies in agricultural industry. Particularly,
    cases are searched where the term ‘agriculture’ appeared concurrently in the title,
    abstract, or keywords of an article with any of the ‘Industry 4.0 technologies”
    mentioned in section 1.2. Before conducting the SLR, a review protocol is defined
    to ensure a transparent and high-quality research process, which are the characteristics
    that make a literature review systematic [20]. The review protocol also helps
    to minimize bias by conducting exhaustive literature searches. This includes three
    steps: the formulation of the research questions, the definition of the search
    strategy, and the specification of inclusion and exclusion criteria. This paper
    uses a preferred reporting item for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA)
    approach to conduct SLR. PRISMA is an evidence-based minimum set of items that
    are used to guide the development process of systematic literature reviews and
    other meta-analyses [19]. 2.1. Review protocol A review protocol (in Table 1)
    is defined before conducting the bibliographic analysis to identify, evaluate,
    and interpret results relevant to the research scope. First, research questions
    are formulated to provide insight into the analysis of published studies in the
    research area of interest from different dimensions. These questions need to be
    answered in the study. Next, the search strategy is defined, which helps identify
    appropriate keywords later in the search equation to identify the relevant information
    sources, such as academic databases and search engines that provide access to
    a massive amount of digital documentation. Three online research repositories
    are used to retrieve relevant studies: ScienceDirect1, Scopus2, and IEEE Xplore3.
    Finally, to refine the search results of each database, boundaries are set by
    predefining inclusion and exclusion criteria for further investigation and content
    assessments of selected publications. It involves, for instance, defining the
    time interval for the research process from 2011 to 2021 to limit the studies
    to those published in English, disregarding chapters of books and grey literature,
    such as reports and summaries of events and seminars. These last two steps of
    the review protocol allow the preliminary filtering of metadata sources and narrow
    down the scope of research. Table 1. Review protocol for systematic literature
    review. Review questions RQ1: Which Industry 4.0 technologies have been used in
    the literature for digitization of agriculture? RQ2: How and to what extent have
    these technologies been applied in the context of service type, tools and techniques

    search process is done in four stages: identification, screening, eligibility,
    and inclusion, as detailed by the PRISMA flow diagram shown in Fig. 4. After initial
    metadata filtering through the application of search expression, a total of 3165
    records are found (1690 from Scopus, 926 from ScienceDirect, and 549 from IEEE
    Xplore), which are then consolidated for the removal of duplicate items in the
    identification stage. The number of publications after this step is reduced to
    2876. In the screening stage, the titles and abstracts of the papers are analyzed,
    and only 498 papers are selected for integral reading. In the third stage, full-text
    screening of these articles is performed to verify their eligibility in relation
    to the objective of this paper, which is to answer the research questions mentioned
    in Table 1. Of the 498 papers, 137 are found to be relevant for this review. Another
    11 are added through a cross-referencing approach, adding up to 148 papers selected
    in the final stage for further analysis. Download : Download high-res image (624KB)

    search process (PRISMA). 2.3. Threats to validity i SLR replication: The presented
    SLR is susceptible to threats to validity because the current search is limited
    to only three online repositories. More publications could potentially be found
    if additional sources were explored. The process of SLR is described clearly in
    sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2, and hence, validity can be considered well addressed.
    However, in the case of replication of this SLR, it is possible that one can find
    slightly different publications. This difference would result from different personal
    choices during the screening and eligibility steps of PRISMA, but it is highly
    unlikely that the overall findings would change. ii Search string: the search
    string used to find the relevant studies cover the whole scope of SLR, but there
    is a possibility that valuable studies might have been missed. Additional keywords
    and synonyms with a broader search might return more studies. 3. Digitization
    trends in agriculture The year-wise distribution of the 148 articles from 2011
    to 2021 is represented in Fig. 5. Around 22% of the scientific publications in
    the last ten years were published in 2018. This reflects that the agricultural
    industry is making considerable progress in the context of the implementation
    of digital technologies, but the pace is still slow as compared to other domains
    such as healthcare, manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, etc.,[15]. Download

    Year-wise distribution of selected research studies from 2011 to 2021. The breakdown
    of these publications with respect to digital technologies (mentioned in sub-section
    1.2) and targeted farm types is represented in Fig. 6. Download : Download high-res
    image (321KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Technology-wise distribution
    of the 148 selected research studies. The farm type refers to the crop farming
    method considered while developing an application or framework. For instance,
    the farming method can be soil-based or soilless. The soil-based farming category
    involves open-air fields (traditional outdoor agricultural farms) and greenhouse
    farms (indoor). On the other hand, the soilless farming category involves modern
    farming practices such as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor).
    The numbers at the top of the stacked column in Fig. 6 indicate the total number
    of studies that have used the particular technology to develop a smart agriculture
    system, whereas different colors of columns indicate the respective farm types.
    Use cases are from these publications are analysed, and conclusions are drawn.
    For instance, it is found that autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned
    guided vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), internet of things, and
    machine learning appear to be the widely applied technologies in the agricultural
    domain in the last decade. The same illustration suggests that big data, wireless
    sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins are the emerging areas
    in agriculture. Moreover, open-air farms are the most frequently considered in
    research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). For soilless farming systems
    (aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics), only 22 publications are found, which
    insinuates that these modern farming practices are still in their infancy. Likewise,
    services of each use case are identified and are classified under nine different
    service categories, namely: i) crop management, CM (Estimation/ prediction of
    crop yield/ growth rate/ harvesting period and seed plantation/ harvesting/ pollination/
    spraying (fertilizer/ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM (fresh weight,
    green biomass, height, length, width, leaf density, piment content (chlorophyll)
    and phytochemical composition); iii) water and environment management, WEM (monitoring
    and control of flow rate, water level, water quality (nutrients), temperature,
    humidity, CO2, and weather forecast etc.); iv) irrigation management, IM (water
    stress detection and scheduling); v) farm management, FM (monitoring of farm operations,
    tracking and counting products, determining production efficiency, financial analysis,
    energy consumption analysis, technology integration and decisions implementation);
    vi) pest and disease management, PDM (pest identification and disease detection);
    vii) soil management, SM (moisture content, soil nutrients, fertilizer needs and
    application); viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management, WUVM (weed/unknown
    vegetation mapping, classification, and herbicides application); and ix) fruit
    detection and counting, FDC — as shown in Fig. 7. These categories illustrate
    the role of different digital technologies in smart farming. Upon analysis, it
    is found that crop management parameters, such as crop yield prediction, growth
    rate estimation, or evaluation of harvesting period are the most frequently researched
    areas for agriculture 4.0 in the last decade (29%), whereas very little heed is
    paid towards soil management (2%), fruit detection and counting (2%), and crop
    quality management (3%). Download : Download high-res image (561KB) Download :

    studies: The technology readiness level (TRL) of all the use cases is examined
    using European Union''s TRL scale that partitions system''s maturity level into
    three generic levels [21]. The first level is conceptual, that represents European
    TRL 1–2 (use case is in conceptual phase), the second level is the prototype,
    which means European TRL 3–6 (use case is working even without the complete planned
    functionality), and the third level is deployed, that includes European TRL 7–9
    (use case is mature with all the possible functions). Fig. 8 depicts the TRL of
    each use case developed in selected studies. It is observed that little progress
    has been made in advancing smart agricultural systems beyond the concept and prototype
    levels to the commercial level. For instance, most use cases (129) are at the
    prototype level. Download : Download high-res image (269KB) Download : Download

    provides critical insights towards answering RQ1 and RQ2 from Table 1. 4.1. Internet
    of Things driven agricultural systems Internet of things (IoT) refers to a cosmos
    of interrelated computing devices, sensors, appliances, and machines connected
    with the internet, each having unique identities and capabilities for performing
    remote sensing and monitoring [21]. The reference architecture of IoT with six
    layers, namely perception layer (hardware devices), network layer (communication),
    middleware layer (device management and interoperability), service layer (cloud
    computing), application layer (data integration and analytics), and end-user layer
    (user-interface), is shown in Fig.9. In the agricultural domain, IoT devices in
    the physical layer gather data related to environmental and crop parameters such
    as temperature, humidity, pH value, water level, leaf color, fresh leaf weight,
    etc. The transmission of this data takes place in the network layer, the design
    of which depends on the selection of suitable communication technologies relevant
    to the field size, farm location, and type of farming method. For instance, ZigBee,
    LoRa, and Sigfox are widely used and employed in outdoor fields because they are
    cheaper and have low energy consumption and a good transmission range [22,23].
    Despite being a secure technology, Bluetooth is only used in indoor farms as it
    offers a short transmission range [22]. Wi-Fi is not a promising technology for
    agricultural applications due to its high costs and high energy consumption [22].
    RFID (radio frequency identification) and NFC (near field communication) technologies,
    on the other hand, are increasingly being implemented in agricultural systems
    for tracking agricultural products [24]. GPRS or mobile communication technology
    (2G, 3G, and 4G) are used for periodic monitoring of environmental and soil parameters.
    In addition, communication protocols mostly used in the agricultural scenarios
    are HTTP, WWW, and SMTP. Likewise, to ensure interoperability and system security
    to their context-aware functionalities, middleware HYDRA and SMEPP are mostly
    employed in agricultural systems [25]. To store data, cloud computing techniques
    are employed in the service layer. This data is then used in the application layer
    to build smart applications used by farmers, agriculture experts, and supply chain
    professionals to enhance farm monitoring capacity and productivity. Download :

    architecture of Internet of Things (IoT), (adapted) [26]. The integration of IoT
    in agriculture is meant to empower farmers with the decision tools and automation
    technologies that seamlessly integrate knowledge, products, and services to achieve
    high productivity, quality, and profit. A multitude of studies is performed and
    put forward concerning the incubation of the IoT concepts in the agricultural
    sector. The main findings of some of the studies are presented in Table 2. Multiple
    technological issues and architectural problems have been addressed through the
    development of IoT-based agricultural systems. But most of these systems are either
    in a conceptual stage or in a prototype form (not commercial) at the moment. Focus
    is mainly laid on-farm management, irrigation control, crop growth, health monitoring,
    and disease detection. Some of these studies have also explained IoT implementation
    in modern agricultural systems such as vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics,
    hydroponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Moreover, most
    studies have focused on addressing a specific problem. Table 2. IoT-driven agricultural

    networks in agriculture Wireless sensor network (WSN) is regarded as a technology
    that is used within an IoT system. It can be defined as a group of spatially distributed
    sensors for monitoring the physical conditions of the environment, temporarily
    storing the collected data, and transmitting the gathered information at a central
    location [22]. The general architecture of WSN is shown in Fig. 10. A WSN for
    smart farming is made up of numerous sensor nodes connected through a wireless
    connection module. These nodes have a variety of abilities (e.g., processing,
    transmission, and sensation) that allow them to self-organize, self-configure,
    and self-diagnose. There are different types of WSNs, which are categorized depending
    on the environment where they are deployed. These include terrestrial wireless
    sensor networks (TWSNs), wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs), underwater
    wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs),
    and mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) [55]. In agricultural applications,
    TWSN and UWSN are widely used. In TWSNs, the nodes are deployed above the ground
    surface, consisting of sensors for gathering the surrounding data. The second
    variant of WSNs is its underground counterpart – WUSNs, where sensor nodes are
    planted inside the soil. In this setting, lower frequencies easily penetrate through
    the soil, whereas higher frequencies suffer severe attenuation [56]. Therefore,
    the network requires a higher number of nodes to cover a large area because of
    the limited communication radius. Many research articles are available in the
    literature that discusses the use of WSN for different outdoor and indoor farms’
    applications such as irrigation management, water quality assessment, and environmental
    monitoring. A summary of some of these articles is given in Table 3. These studies
    have focused on developing WSNs architectures that are simplified, low cost, energy-efficient
    and scalable. Yet, various factors associated with WSNs need further attention,
    such as minimum maintenance, robust and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability.

    Standard and Technologies (NIST), cloud computing (CC) is defined as a model for
    enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of
    configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications,
    and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management
    effort or service provider interaction [67]. The main architecture of CC shown
    in Fig. 11 is comprised of four layers: datacenter (hardware), infrastructure,
    platform, and application [68]. Each of these layers is linked with specific cloud
    service models, which are classified as software as a service (SaaS), platform
    as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Cloud computing has
    gained great attention over the past decade in the agriculture sector because
    it provides: 1) inexpensive storage services for data gathered from different
    domains through WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale computing
    systems to perform intelligent decision-making by transforming this raw data into
    useful knowledge, and 3) a secure platform to develop agricultural IoT applications
    [69]. In combination with IoT and WSN, CC is employed to develop different agricultural
    applications, most of which are presented in Tables 2 and 3. CC technology is
    also used to create operational farm management systems (FMSs) to support farmers
    and farm managers in efficient monitoring of farm operations Table 4. presents
    the salient features of some of these FMSs. Another topic of interest that is
    being explored in global research is related to the traceability of agri-product
    quality [70]. But only preliminary research has been attempted to explore traceability
    compliance with standards of food safety and quality. Download : Download high-res

    systems have the potential to solve problems of increasing food demands, environmental
    pollution caused by excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers, and the safety
    of agricultural products. These FMSs, however, do not have the capability to support
    run-time customization in relation to distinct requirements of farmers. Moreover,
    because most farm data is usually fragmented and dispersed, it is difficult to
    record farm activities properly in current FMSs applications [75]. 4.4. Edge/fog
    computing in agriculture The rapid development of IoT has led to the explosive
    growth of sensors and smart devices, generating large volumes of data. The processing
    and analysis of such an enormous amount of data in real-time are challenging because
    it increases the load on the cloud server and also reduces the response speed.
    Simply using a cloud server is not able to provide real-time response while handling
    such a large data set. Additionally, IoT applications are sensitive to network
    latency because they require a constant exchange of information between devices
    and the cloud, making CC unfeasible to handle these applications [23]. The emergence
    of the edge computing concept can resolve the problems associated with CC. This
    new computing model deploys computing and storage resources (such as cloudlets
    or fog nodes) at the edge of the network closer to data sources such as mobile
    devices or sensors. This way, it can facilitate real-time analytics while keeping
    data secure on the device [23]. Edge computing offers intriguing possibilities
    for smart agriculture, but the applications of this technology are only in their
    infancy in agricultural systems. Hence, few research studies are available in
    this area; see Table 5. Most of the edge computing-based agricultural systems
    discussed in these studies are prototypical and address a limited selection of
    problems in various agricultural domains. So far, interoperability and scalability
    issues have not received sufficient consideration. Table 5. Edge computing-based

    robot systems in agriculture Autonomous robot systems (ARS) are intelligent machines
    capable of performing tasks, making decisions, and acting in real-time, with a
    high degree of autonomy (without external influence or without explicit human
    intervention) [83]. Interest in agricultural ARS (AARS) has grown significantly
    in recent years because of their ability to automate some practices in outdoor
    and indoor farms - including seeding, watering, fertilizing, spraying, plant monitoring
    and phenotyping, environmental monitoring, disease detection, weed and pest controlling,
    and harvesting [15]. The agricultural robots use a combination of emerging technologies
    such as computer vision, WSNs, satellite navigation systems (GPS), AI, CC, and
    IoT, thereby facilitating the farmers to enhance productivity and quality of agricultural
    products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile AARS, which can move throughout
    the working field, or fixed AARS [84]. Mobile AARSs are further classified into
    unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and 2) unnamed aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are
    explained in the following sections. 4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that operate on the ground
    without a human operator. The main components of UGVs generally include; a platform
    for locomotive apparatus and manipulator, sensors for navigation, a supervisory
    control system, an interface for the control system, the communication links for
    information exchange between devices, and a system architecture for integration
    between hardware and software agents [85]. The control architecture of UGV can
    be remote-operated (controlled by a human operator via the interface) or fully
    autonomous (operated without the need for a human controller based on artificial
    intelligence technologies) [85]. Likewise, locomotive systems can be based on
    wheels, tracks, or legs [85]. Despite high ground adaptability, intrinsic omnidirectionality
    and soil protection of legged robots, they are uncommon in agriculture. However,
    when combined with wheels (wheel-legged robots), these robots offer a disruptive
    locomotion system for smart farms. In addition to their needed characteristics
    for infield operations, UGV should fulfill certain requirements such as small
    size, maneuverability, resilience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety
    – to enhance crop yields and farm productivity. Table 6 summarizes the diverse
    range of UGVs designed for agricultural operations. Table 6. Different types of

    above have a 4WD locomotive system because it offers ease of construction and
    control. The drawback of 4WD is that the wheels are strongly affected by terrains
    containing stone elements and/or cavities [85]. Hence, it is significant to explore
    other mechanisms, such as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems. Some robots
    have computer vision systems, but due to the difficulty of developing an accurate
    and reliable system that replaces manual labor, most of these robots are built
    with a low-cost computer vision system, that is, using conventional RGB cameras.
    Moreover, most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase,
    with no commercial use on a large scale. 4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or aerial robots are aircrafts with no human pilot
    on board. Depending on the type of technology incorporated to fly (wing structure)
    and autonomy level, there is a wide variety of UAVs [96]. For instance, according
    to wing type, UAVs can be fixed-wing (planes), single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid
    system (vertical takeoff and landing), and multirotor (drone). Among these, drones
    (multi-rotor technology) which are lifted and propelled by four (quadrotor) or
    six (hex-rotor) rotors, have become increasingly popular in the agriculture sector
    due to their mechanical simplicity in comparison to helicopters, which rely on
    a much more sophisticated plate control mechanism [97]. Similarly, according to
    autonomy level, UAVs can be either teleoperated in which the pilot provides references
    to each actuator of the aircraft so as to control it, in the same manner, an onboard
    pilot would, or tele-commanded in which the aircraft relies on an automatic controller
    on board that is in charge of maintaining a stable flight [96]. Equipped with
    the appropriate sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, and hyperspectral cameras,
    etc.), agricultural UAVs allow farmers to obtain data (vegetation, leaf area,
    and reflectance indexes) from their fields to study dynamic changes in crops that
    cannot be detected by scouting the ground [98]. This data permits farmers to infer
    information related to crop diseases, nutrient deficiencies, water level, and
    other crop growth parameters. With this information, farmers can plan possible
    remedies (irrigation, fertilization, weed control, etc.). Table 7 reviews some
    of the UAV-based systems used for different agricultural operations. Table 7.

    Most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase, with no commercial
    use on a large scale. Other problems with these UAVs are associated with battery
    and flight time [96]. At the moment, lithium-ion batteries are being used because
    their capacity is larger than that of conventional batteries. But an increase
    in battery capacity increases the drone weight, and now research is undergoing
    to address this issue. In addition, the existing UAVs have complex user interfaces,
    and only experts can use them to perform agricultural tasks. By improving the
    user interface making it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow people
    who are older or unfamiliar with UAV technology to control it more easily. 4.6.
    Big data and analytics in agriculture Rapid developments in IoT and CC technologies
    have increased the magnitude of data immeasurably. This data, also referred to
    as Big Data (BD), includes textual content (i.e., structured, semi-structured,
    and unstructured), and multimedia content (e.g., videos, images, audio) [119].
    The process of examining this data to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations,
    market trends, customer preferences, and other useful information is referred
    to as big data analytics (BDA). Big data is typically characterized according
    to five dimensions defined by five Vs, which are displayed in Fig. 12 [120]. The
    paradigm of BD-driven smart agriculture is comparatively new, but the trend of
    this application is positive as it has the capacity to bring a revolutionary change
    in the food supply chain and food security through increased production. Agricultural
    big data is usually generated from various sectors and stages in agriculture,
    which can be collected either from agricultural fields through ground sensors,
    aerial vehicles, and ground vehicles using special cameras and sensors; from governmental
    bodies in the form of reports and regulations; from private organizations through
    online web services; from farmers in the form of knowledge through surveys; or
    from social media [120]. The data can be environmental (weather, climate, moisture
    level, etc.), biological (plant disease), or geo-spatial depending on the agricultural
    domain and differs in volume, velocity, and formats [121]. The gathered data is
    stored in a computer database and processed by computer algorithms for analyzing
    seed characteristics, weather patterns, soil properties (like pH or nutrient content),
    marketing and trade management, consumers’ behavior, and inventory management.
    A variety of techniques and tools are employed to analyze big data in agriculture.
    A summary of some of the studies is given in Table 8. Machine learning, cloud-based
    platforms, and modeling and simulation are the most commonly used techniques.
    Particularly, machine learning tools are used in prediction, clustering, and classification
    problems. Whereas cloud platforms are used for large-scale data storing, preprocessing,
    and visualization. There are still many potential areas that are not adequately
    covered in existing literature, where BDA can be applied to address various agricultural
    issues. For instance, these include data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical
    farming systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and
    indoor farms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to assist farmers
    in the design of indoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers
    to assist them in decision-making regarding the sustainability of the physical
    ecosystem. Lastly, most systems are still in the prototypical stage. Download

    involves the development of theory and computer systems capable of performing
    tasks requiring human intelligence, such as sensorial perception and decision-making
    [126]. Combined with CC, IoT, and big data, AI, particularly in the facet of machine
    learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), is regarded as one of the key drivers behind
    the digitization of agriculture. These technologies have the potential to enhance
    crop production and improve real-time monitoring, harvesting, processing, and
    marketing [127]. Several intelligent agricultural systems are developed that use
    ML and DL algorithms to determine various parameters like weed detection, yield
    prediction, or disease identification. These systems are discussed in the next
    two sub-sections. 4.7.1. Machine learning in agriculture Machine learning (ML)
    techniques are broadly classified into three categories: 1) supervised learning
    (linear regression, regression trees, non-linear regression, Bayesian linear regression,
    polynomial regression, and support vector regression), 2) unsupervised learning
    (k-means clustering, hierarchal clustering, anomaly detection, neural networks
    (NN), principal component analysis, independent component analysis, a-priori algorithm
    and singular value decomposition (SVD)); and 3) reinforcement learning (Markov
    decision process (MDP) and Q learning) [128]. ML techniques and algorithms are
    implemented in the agriculture sector for crop yield prediction, disease, and
    weed detection, weather prediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation (type,
    moisture content, pH, temperature, etc.), water management, determination of the
    optimal amount of fertilizer, and livestock production and management [129] Table
    9. presents a list of publications where different ML algorithms are utilized
    for various agricultural applications. From the analysis of these articles, “crop
    yield prediction” is a widely explored area, and linear regression, neural network
    (NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) is the most used ML
    techniques to enable smart farming. The presented use cases are still in the research
    phase with no reported commercial usage at the moment. Moreover, it is also found
    that AI and ML techniques are sparsely explored in the greenhouse and indoor vertical
    farming systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are
    only a few publications available summarized in the same table where ML techniques
    are employed. Considering the digital transformation''s cyber-security and data
    privacy challenges, new approaches such as federated learning and privacy-preserving
    methods are being developed to enable digital farming [130]. These approaches
    build ML models from local parameters without sharing private data samples, thus
    mitigating security issues. Table 9. Machine learning-based agricultural systems.

    the extension of classical ML that can solve complex problems (predictions and
    classification) particularly well and fast because more “depth” (complexity) is
    added into the model. The primary advantage of DL is feature learning which involves
    automatic extraction of features (high-level information) from large datasets
    [149]. Different DL algorithms are convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long
    short term memory (LSTM) networks, recurrent neural (RNN) networks, generative
    adversarial networks (GANs), radial basis function networks (RBFNs), multilayer
    perceptron (MLPs), feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing
    maps (SOMs), deep belief networks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),
    and autoencoders. A detailed description of these algorithms, popular architectures,
    and training platforms is available at various sources [150]. Fig. 13 illustrates
    an example of DL architecture of CNN [151]. In the agriculture sector, DL algorithms
    are mostly used to solve problems associated with computer vision applications
    that target the prediction of key parameters, such as crop yields, soil moisture
    content, weather conditions, and crop growth conditions; the detection of diseases,
    pests, and weed; and the identification of leaf or plant species [152]. Computer
    vision is an interdisciplinary field that has been gaining huge amounts of traction
    in recent years due to the surge in CNNs. It offers methods and techniques that
    allow the processing of digital images accurately and enables computers to interpret
    and understand the visual world [153]. A summary of agricultural applications
    using DL and computer vision techniques is given in Table 10. Among all the DL
    algorithms, CNNs or Convet and its variants are the most used algorithms in agricultural
    applications. The variants of CNN are region-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN,
    YOLO, and Mask-RCNN, among which the first four are mostly used to solve object
    detection problems. Mask-RCNN, on the other hand, is used to solve instance segmentation
    problems. The reader could refer to the existing bibliography for a detailed description
    of these algorithms and their applications [152]. Few studies have also used other
    DL techniques. Talking about datasets, most DL models are trained using images,
    and few models are trained using sensor data gathered from fields. This shows
    that DL can be applied to a wide variety of datasets. It is also observed that
    most of the work is done on outdoor farms, whereas next-generation farms (environment-controlled)
    are not extensively explored. Though DL has the potential to enable digital farming,
    most systems are still in the prototype phase. Additionally, the new challenges
    imposed by cyber-security and privacy issues require optimization of current DL
    and computer vision approaches. Download : Download high-res image (334KB) Download

    decision support systems A decision support system (DSS) can be defined as a smart
    system that supports decision-making to specific demands and problems by providing
    operational answers to stakeholders and potential users based on useful information
    extracted from raw data, documents, personal knowledge, and/or models [170]. DSS
    can be data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven, and knowledge-driven.
    The salient features of these DSSs are available at following source [171]. Fig.
    14 presents the general architecture of a DSS, consisting of four fundamental
    components, each having its specific purpose. Download : Download high-res image

    (adapted) [187]. Due to the evolution of agriculture 4.0, the amount of farming
    data has increased immensely. To transfer this heterogenous data into practical
    knowledge, platforms like agricultural decision support systems (ADSS) are required
    to make evidence-based and precise decisions regarding farm operation and facility
    layout [172]. Over the past few years, ADSSs are gaining much attention in the
    agriculture sector. A number of ADSSs have been developed that focus on a variety
    of agricultural aspects, such as farm management, water management, and environmental
    management. Table 11 presents a summary of the ADSSs found in the literature.
    From this analysis, most ADSSs have been found to not consider expert knowledge,
    which is highly valuable as it allows to development of systems as per user''s
    needs. The other reported issues with some of these ADDSs are complex GUIs, inadequate
    re-planning components, a lack of prediction and forecast abilities, and a lack
    of ability to adapt to uncertain and dynamic factors. It is also worth noting
    that all the ADSSs are for outdoor agricultural systems and are in the research
    phase. In comparison, the application of ADSS in indoor soilless farming is still
    very much unexploited. Table 11. Agricultural decision support systems. Use case

    As one of the main technologies of Industry 4.0, a cyber-physical system (CPS)
    refers to an automated distributed system that integrates physical processes with
    communication networks and computing infrastructures [184]. There are three standard
    CPS reference architecture models: namely, 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA, and their detailed
    description is available at following source [185]. Among these, the 5C is a well-known
    reference model with widespread usage. The architecture of 5C consists of five
    levels which are represented in Fig. 15. CPS benefits from a variety of existing
    technologies such as agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented reality, big data, and
    ML [186]. Its implementation ensures scalability, adaptability, autonomy, reliability,
    resilience, safety, and security improvements. Download : Download high-res image

    process, (adapted) [199]. Agricultural field is regarded as one of the complex
    domains that can benefit from CPS technology. Agricultural cyber-physical systems
    (ACPSs) use advanced electronic technologies and agricultural facilities to build
    integrated farm management systems that interact with the physical environment
    to maintain an optimal growth environment for crops [188]. ACPSs collect the essential
    and appropriate data about climate, soil, and crops, with high accuracy and use
    it to manage watering, humidity, and plant health, etc. A variety of ACPSs has
    been developed for the management of different services, and their summary is
    given in Table 12. Looking at these ACPSs, most systems are still at the prototype
    and conceptual level. Moreover, most studies are conducted for outdoor farms,
    with only a few works published related to soil-based greenhouse systems. No study
    is found that is relevant to indoor soilless farming systems. ACPSs has attracted
    significant research interest because of their promising applications across different
    domains; deploying CPS models in real-life applications is still a challenge as
    it requires proper hardware and software [189]. Moreover, particular attention
    should be given to autonomy, robustness, and resilience while engineering ACPSs
    in order to handle the unpredictability of the environment and the uncertainty
    of the characteristics of agricultural facilities. There are multiple factors
    (humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data, among others) that impact ACPSs. To
    ensure a smooth operation while avoiding conflicts, errors, and disruptions, ACPSs
    need to be designed carefully and comprehensively. Table 12. Agricultural cyber-physical

    in agriculture Digital twin (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical)
    object of which it mirrors its behaviors and states over multiple stages of object''s
    lifecycle by using real-world data, simulation, and machine learning models, combined
    with data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning [198]. A
    complete description of the DT concept for any physical system requires consolidation
    and formalization of various characteristics, including the physical and virtual
    entities, the physical and virtual environments, the metrology, and realization
    modules that perform the physical to virtual and the virtual to physical connection
    or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate, and the physical and virtual processes
    [199]. The schematic showing the mapping of these characteristics is shown in
    Fig. 16. The DT concept has gained prominence due to the advances in the technologies
    such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks, and cloud
    computing. This is because these technologies allow real-time monitoring of physical
    twins at high spatial resolutions through both miniature devices and remote sensing
    that produce ever-increasing data streams [21]. The concept of DT in agricultural
    applications is rather immature as compared to other disciplines with its first
    references occurred in 2017; hence its added value has not yet been discussed
    extensively [21]. This is because framing is a highly complex and dynamic domain
    because of its dependence on natural conditions (climate, soil, humidity) and
    presence of living physical twins (plants and animals) and non-living physical
    twins (indoor farm buildings, grow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural
    machinery). The non-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with
    plants and animals (living physical twins), thereby introducing more challenges
    for DT in agriculture. Whereas in other domains such as manufacturing DTs are
    mostly concerned with non-living physical twins. Table 13 summarises the agricultural
    DTs developed in the last 10 years. Table 13. Digital twins in agriculture Use

    have focused on open-air farming systems. Only one study is found that has proposed
    DT for soil-based vertical farming system and one study that implemented DT for
    soilless farming system (aquaponics). This might be because the design and management
    of modern farming systems are challenging. Moreover, most DTs are in the research
    phase with no commercial deployment at the moment. The reported benefits of the
    DT applications in agriculture are cost reductions, catastrophe prevention, clearer
    decision making, and efficient management operations, which can be applied to
    several agricultural subfields like plant and animal breeding, aquaponics, vertical
    farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming. While DT technology has great
    potential, achieving the synchronization between the physical entity and its digital
    counterpart is challenging. The complexity of this process is further amplified
    in agricultural systems due to the idiosyncrasies of living physical twins. Hence,
    implementation of agricultural DT should start with micro-farms, which can then
    be gradually enhanced to an intelligent and autonomous version by incorporating
    more components. 4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry This
    section provides an answer to RQ3 by listing a series of interconnected roadblocks
    hampering a larger adoption of digital technologies in the agriculture sector.
    After analysing 148 articles, 21 roadblocks are identified which can be categorized
    at technical and socio-economic levels. 4.12. Technical roadblocks • Interoperability:
    data is considered a cornerstone for the success of smart systems. Agricultural
    data usually comes from multiple heterogeneous sources such as thousands of individual
    farmlands, animal factories, and enterprise applications. This data can have diverse
    formats, making data integration complex. Hence, data interoperability is essential
    to enhance the value of this massively dispersed data after systematic data collection,
    storage, processing, and knowledge mining [208]. Likewise, for establishing effective
    communication between heterogeneous devices, they need to be interconnected and
    interoperable. With cross-technology communication, interoperability of the system
    can be improved [209]. • Standardization: to fully exploit the digital technologies
    for smart farming applications, standardization of the devices is essential. Output
    differences can occur because of misinterpretation and alterations from time to
    time. With standardization, the interoperability issues of the devices, applications,
    and systems can also be resolved [25]. • Dataquality: to produce meaningful results,
    data quality is also crucial along with data security, storage, and openness.
    The lack of decentralized data management systems is another roadblock hindering
    the adoption of smart farming practices [9]. This issue decreases the willingness
    of multiple actors to share agriculture data. • Hardwareimplementation: the deployment
    of a smart agricultural setup in large-scale open fields is extremely challenging.
    This is because all the hardware consisting of IoT devices, wireless sensor networks,
    sensor nodes, machinery, and equipment directly exposed to harsh environmental
    conditions such as heavy rainfall, high/low-temperature levels, extreme humidity,
    strong wind speeds and many other possible dangers which can destroy electronic
    circuits or disrupt their normal functionality [210]. A possible solution is to
    build an adequate casing for all the costly devices that is robust and durable
    enough to endure real field conditions [211]. • Adequatepower sources: typically,
    the wireless devices deployed at farms consistently operate for a long time and
    have limited battery life. A suitable energy saving scheme is necessary because,
    in case of any failure, instant battery replacement is complicated, especially
    in open-air farms where devices are strategically placed with minimum access [210].
    The possible solutions to optimize energy consumption are usage of low power sensors
    and, proper management of communication [24,212]. Wireless power transfer and
    self-supporting wireless system are other promising solutions to eliminate the
    need for battery replacement by recharging the batteries through electromagnetic
    waves. However, long-distance wireless charging is needed in most agricultural
    applications [9]. Ambient energy harvesting from rivers, fluid flow, movement
    of vehicles and, ground surface using sensor nodes offers another viable solution,
    but the converted electrical energy is limited at present – posing the need to
    improve power conversion efficiency [213]. • Reliability: The reliability of devices,
    as well as corresponding software applications, is crucial. This is because IoT
    devices need to gather and transfer the data based on which decisions are made
    using several software packages. Unreliable sensing, processing, and transmission
    can cause false monitoring data reports, long delays, and even data loss – eventually
    impacting the performance of agricultural system [25]. • Adaptability: agricultural
    environments are complex, dynamic, and rapidly changing. Hence, when designing
    a system, it is pertinent for the devices and applications to proactively adapt
    with the other entities under uncertain and dynamic factors - offering the needed
    performance [214]. • Robust wirelessarchitectures: wireless networks and communication
    technologies offer several benefits in terms of low cost, wide-area coverage,
    adequate networking flexibility, and high scalability. But dynamic agriculture
    environments such as temperature variations, living objects’ movements, and the
    presence of obstacles pose severe challenges to reliable wireless communication.
    For instance, fluctuations in the signal intensity occur due to the multipath
    propagation effects – causing unstable connectivity and inadequate data transmission
    [215]. These factors impact the performance of the agricultural system. Hence,
    there is a need for robust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures with appropriate
    location of sensor nodes, antenna height, network topology, and communication
    protocols that also require minimum maintenance [11]. • Interference: another
    challenge is wireless interference and degradation of the quality of service because
    of the dense deployment of IoT devices and wireless sensor networks. These issues
    can be mitigated with efficient channel scheduling between heterogeneous sensing
    devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and emerging networking primitives such
    as concurrent transmission [216]. Since agriculture devices are distributed at
    indoor greenhouses, outdoor farmlands, underground areas, or even water areas,
    cross-media communication between underground, underwater, and air is also required
    for the complete incorporation of smart technologies [217]. • Security and privacy:
    the distributed nature of smart agricultural systems brings potential vulnerabilities
    to cyber-attacks such as eavesdropping, data integrity, denial-of-service attacks,
    or other types of disruptions that may risk privacy, integrity, and availability
    of the system [218]. Cyber-security is a major challenge that needs to be addressed
    within the context of smart farming, with diverse privacy-preserving mechanisms
    and federated learning approaches [130]. • Compatibility: to achieve the standards
    of fragmentation and scalability, the models or software applications developed
    should be flexible and run on any machine installed in the agricultural system
    [13]. • Resource optimization: farmers require a resource optimization process
    to estimate the optimal number of IoT devices and gateways, cloud storage size,
    and amount of transmitted data to improve farm profitability. Since farms have
    different sizes and need distinct types of sensors to measure different variables,
    resource optimization is challenging [219]. Secondly, most of the farm management
    systems do not offer run-time customization in relation to the distinct requirements
    of farmers. Hence, complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to
    estimate adequate resource allocation [75]. • Scalability: the number of devices,
    machinery, and sensors installed at farms is increasing gradually due to advancements
    in technologies. To support these entities, gateways, network applications, and
    back-end databases should be reliable and scalable [220]. • Human-centereduserinterfaces:
    complex user interfaces of existing agricultural applications and devices are
    impeding smart farming practices. Most GUI is designed in a way that only experts
    can use to perform agricultural tasks. Improving the user interface by making
    it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow a larger group of people
    to use it to perform different agricultural operations [96]. 4.13. Socio-economic
    roadblocks • Gap between farmers and researchers: the participation of farmers
    is a key factor toward the success of the digitization of the agricultural industry.
    Farmers face a lot of problems during the agri-food production process, which
    smart technologies could fix, but agricultural experts are not usually aware of
    these issues [16]. Moreover, to devise an adequate smart solution, first, it is
    important to fully understand the nature of problems. Hence, it is essential to
    bridge the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, and AI researchers.
    • Costs associated with smart systems: the costs associated with the adoption
    of smart technologies and systems are the major deterrent in the digitization
    of the agricultural sector. These costs usually involve deployment, operating,
    and maintenance costs. The deployment costs of smart systems are usually very
    high as they involve; i) hardware installation such as autonomous robots and drones,
    WSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure, etc., to perform certain farm
    operations, and ii) hiring the skilled labour [221]. Likewise, to facilitate data
    processing, management of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge exchange, subscription
    of centralized networks and software packages is required, which ultimately increases
    the operating costs [222]. Though sometimes service providers offer free subscription
    packages with restricted features, the amount of storage capacity is limited.
    To ensure the adequate operations of the smart system, occasional maintenance
    is required, which then also adds up to total costs. Other types of costs associated
    with smart systems deployment could be environmental, ethical, and social costs.
    To overcome cost related roadblocks, initiatives focusing on cooperative farming
    are needed that provide; i) support services for better handling of costs and
    needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to transform conventional equipment
    into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce high initial costs [222]. • Digital
    division: another factor that is slowing the digitization of the agricultural
    sector is the lack of knowledge of digital technologies and their applications.
    The majority of farmers have no idea about the significance of digital technologies,
    how to implement and use them, and which technology is suitable for their farm
    and meets their requirements [14]. Hence, it is essential to educate farmers about
    modern farming technologies and systems. Moreover, different strategies are needed
    to build tools using natural language that farmers with low education levels can
    easily understand [223]. • Return on investment: in agriculture, the profit margin
    is very important like other sectors. When it comes to the implementation of advanced
    technologies, farmers have concerns related to the time to recover the investment
    and to the difficulties in evaluating the advantages [12]. • Trust building: unlike
    in other disciplines, building trust regarding the effectiveness of smart technologies
    in agriculture is difficult because many decisions affect systems that involve
    living and non-living entities, and consequences can be hard to reverse [16].
    Additionally, insufficient proof of the impact of digital tools on-farm productivity
    further intensifies the current challenges. • Laws and regulations: different
    regions and countries have different legal frameworks which impact the implementation
    of digital technologies in the agriculture sector, particularly in monitoring
    and agri-food supply [70]. Likewise, regulations related to resource allocation
    (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy, and security also vary from one
    country to another [70]. • Connectivity infrastructure: most less-developed countries
    usually have insufficient connectivity infrastructure that limits access to advanced
    digital tools that would help to turn data from heterogenous sources into valuable
    and actionable insights [10]. 4.14. Discussion This section discusses the main
    conclusions of RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3. In addition, added value, considerations, and
    future directions are also presented to ensure higher accuracy and great advancements
    in agricultural industry. 4.15. RQ1, RQ2 and RQ3 The present study tried to articulate
    the emerging digital technologies being implemented in agricultural industry to
    anticipate the future trajectories of agriculture 4.0. By looking at Table 2,
    Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, Table 9, Table 10, Table
    11, Table 12, Table 13 in section 4, it can be seen some technologies such as
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins are not significantly explored in agriculture. A reason for this
    gap could be that implementing advanced technologies with more complex operations
    can be expensive, at least in the early experimental phase of their adoption.
    Hence, the development of these technologies in agricultural industry should increase
    in the coming years. The results of SLR also show that IoT is significantly implemented
    in farms. This is due to the broad functionality of IoT such as in the monitoring,
    tracking and tracing, agriculture machinery, and precision agriculture [21]. It
    can be said that IoT is one of the main research objectives within the agriculture
    4.0 approaches. Nevertheless, only few studies have considered data security and
    reliability, scalability, and interoperability while developing an intelligent
    agricultural system. The research findings also demonstrated that most use cases
    are still in the prototype phase. The possible reason could be because most agricultural
    operations have to do with living subjects, like animals and plants or perishable
    products, and developing systems is harder than non-living human-made systems.
    Another reason might be that agriculture is a slow adopter of technology because
    of transdisciplinary nature of this field, and hence to develop intelligent systems,
    the agricultural community must become familiar will all the digital technologies.
    Lastly, variations in plant/crops’ species, and growth conditions also make digitization
    of agricultural systems complex [188]. The SLR findings also show that most of
    the systems are developed for open-air soil-based farms contrary to indoor farms
    (soilless and soil-based). This is due to complex design and management of indoor
    farms particularly soilless farms where parameters and factors (pH, air temperature,
    humidity, etc.) to be controlled are diverse [5]. But with introduction of digital
    technologies and data-driven computer applications in indoor farms, a more robust
    control of the process can be achieved. Furthermore, it is also revealed from
    SLR that limited research is conducted in three (soil management, fruit detection
    and counting and crop quality management) out of nine different service categories
    mentioned in section 3. This corroborates that substantial research and development
    is needed in some areas to ensure successful digitization of agriculture industry
    in developed countries as well as in developing countries. The complexity of agriculture
    ecosystem presents a series of interconnected roadblocks that hinder the full
    integration of digital technologies for agriculture 4.0 realization. Hence, it
    is essential to identify potential roadblocks in order to come up with strategic
    solutions to overcome them. This study is an attempt to explore what these roadblocks
    are. Based on analysis, 21 roadblocks were identified and classified at technical
    and socio-economic levels. These roadblocks are listed in section 5, which suggests
    what needs to be done for digitization of agricultural industry on larger scale.
    But it is still not known, to what extent elimination or mitigation of these roadblocks
    assist in successful integration of digital technologies. 4.16. Added value of
    agricultural digitization Based on analysis, several benefits that can motivate
    framers and other actors to support digitization of agricultural industry are
    identified and summarised below. The presented benefits have potential to maximise
    the farm''s productivity and enhance product quality, but they should not be considered
    a panacea for challenges associated with smart agriculture [222]. • Improved agility:
    digital technologies improve the agility of farm operations. Through real-time
    surveillance and forecast systems, farmers or agricultural experts can rapidly
    react to any potential fluctuations in environmental and water conditions to save
    crops [221]. • Green process: digital technologies make the farming process more
    environmentally friendly and climate-resilient by significantly reducing the usage
    of in-field fuel, nitrogen fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides [224]. • Resource
    use efficiency: digital platforms can improve resource use efficiency by enhancing
    the quantity and quality of agricultural output and limiting the usage of water,
    energy, fertilizers, and pesticides [3]. • Time and cost savings: digital technologies
    enable significant time and cost savings by automating different operations, such
    as harvesting, sowing, or irrigation, controlling the application of fertilizers
    or pesticides, and scheduling the irrigation [225]. • Asset management: digital
    technologies allow real-time surveillance of farm properties and equipment to
    prevent theft, expedite component replacement and perform routine maintenance
    [10]. • Product safety: digital technologies ensure adequate farm productivity
    and guarantee a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food products by preventing
    fraud related to adulteration, counterfeit, and artificial enhancement [218].
    4.17. Considerations and future prospects The upcoming initiatives would result
    in significant improvements in the agricultural sector. But in order to make things
    sustainable for small and medium-scale growers, roadblocks mentioned in section
    5 need to be addressed first. Awareness campaigns highlighting the significance
    of smart agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and promoting
    innovative ways (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders to take on an
    active role in the digital revolution can mitigate some of the mentioned roadblocks
    [9]. Government level initiatives, grants and endowments, public-private partnerships,
    the openness of data, and regional basis research work can also assist in coping
    with potential roadblocks. Lastly, a roadmap can be adopted while developing a
    smart agriculture system, starting from basic architecture with few components
    and simpler functionality, gradually adding components and functionality to develop
    a complex system with the full potential of digitization [21]. These considerations
    can pave the way for successful implementation of agriculture 4.0. The future
    prospects of digital technologies in smart agriculture involve using explainable
    artificial intelligence to monitor crop growth, estimate crop biomass, evaluate
    crop health, and control pests and diseases. Explainable AI fades away the traditional
    black-box concept of machine learning and enables understanding the reasons behind
    any specific decision [15]. Description of big data through common semantics and
    ontologies and the adoption of open standards have great potential to boost research
    and development towards smart farming . Similarly, to ensure enhanced connectivity
    and live streaming of crop data, 5G technology need to be extensively explored
    [6]. 5G technology will minimize internet costs and augment the overall user experience
    of farm management and food safety by performing accurate crop inspections remotely
    [226]. Furthermore, it will significantly bridge the gap between stakeholders
    by keeping them well informed on produce availability. Lastly, blockchain in combination
    with IoT and other technologies can be implemented to address the challenges related
    to data privacy and security [227]. 4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 The industrial
    revolutions have always brought a breakthrough in the agricultural sector. As
    formally discussed in previous sections, agriculture 4.0 has great potential to
    counterbalance the growing food demands and prepare for future by reinforcing
    agricultural systems with WSN, IoT, AI, etc. While the realization of agriculture
    4.0 is still underway, there is already a talk about agriculture 5.0. Agriculture
    5.0 extends agriculture 4.0 with inclusion of industry 5.0 principles to produce
    healthy and affordable food while ensuring to prevent degradation of the ecosystems
    on which life depends [228]. The European Commission formally called for the Fifth
    Industrial Revolution (industry 5.0) in 2021 after observing that industry 4.0
    focuses less on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability
    but more on digitalization and AI-driven technologies for increasing the efficiency
    and flexibility [229]. Industry 5.0 complements and extends industry 4.0 concept
    to recognize the human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience [230]. It involves
    refining the collaborative interactions between humans and machines, reducing
    environmental impact through circular economy, and developing high degree of robustness
    in systems to achieve optimal balance between efficiency and productivity. The
    enabling technologies of industry 5.0 are Cobots (collaborative robots), smart
    materials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient
    and secure data management, renewable energy sources, etc [229].. In agriculture
    5.0 settings, farm''s production efficiency and crop quality can be enhanced by
    assigning repetitive and monotonous tasks to the machines and the tasks which
    need critical thinking to the humans. For this purpose, similar to manufacturing
    sector cyber physical cognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment
    and take actions accordingly should be developed for agricultural sector. This
    may include collaborative farm robots which will work in the fields and assist
    crop producers in tedious tasks such as seed sowing and harvesting etc. Likewise,
    digital twins in agriculture 5.0 can also offer significant value by identifying
    technical issues in agricultural systems and overcoming them at a faster speed,
    detecting crop diseases, and making crop yield predictions at a higher accuracy
    rate. This shows that agriculture 5.0 has potential to pave a way for climate
    smart, sustainable and resilient agriculture but as of now, it is in the developing
    phase. 5. Conclusions Increased concerns about global food security have accelerated
    the need for next-generation industrial farms and intensive production methods
    in agriculture. At the forefront of this modern agricultural era, digital technologies
    offered by Industry 4.0 initiative are suggesting a myriad of creative solutions.
    The scientific community and researchers integrate disruptive technologies in
    conventional agriculture systems to increase crop yields, minimize costs, reduce
    wastes, and maintain process inputs. An SLR discussing the prevailing state of
    these technologies in the agriculture sector is presented in this study. After
    applying SLR protocol, 148 articles were considered from the time frame of the
    year 2011 to 2021. Various research questions pertaining to i) current and continuing
    research trends, ii) functionality, maturity level, farm type and tools and techniques
    used, iii) primary roadblocks, and iv) added value of digital technologies; were
    put forward and answered. Several conclusions are drawn such as integration of
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins in agriculture is only in its infancy, and most use cases are in
    the prototype phase. Likewise, 21 roadblocks are identified and classified at
    technical and socioeconomic levels. To ensure the digitization of agricultural
    industry, these roadblocks must be analyzed and overcome. The added value of digital
    technologies in agriculture industry are also identified and presented in the
    study. Overall, this study contributes to the research being carried around agriculture
    4.0. The primary limitation of this review is twofold: firstly, only three online
    repositories are considered for literature search (Scopus, IEEE and Science Direct),
    and secondly additional keywords and synonyms might return more studies. In both
    scenarios, it is highly unlikely that the overall findings would change. For the
    future work, additional research databases and aspects can be considered to provide
    holistic overview of agricultural industry in terms of digitization. Moreover,
    studies targeting agriculture 5.0 in general will also be included. Declaration

    Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: A rise in the
    population has immensely increased the pressure on the agriculture sector. With
    the advent of technology, this decade is witnessing a shift from conventional
    approaches to the most advanced ones. The Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed
    both the quality and quantity of the agriculture sector. Hybridization of species
    along with the real-time monitoring of the farms paved a way for resource optimization.
    Scientists, research institutions, academicians, and most nations across the globe
    are moving towards the practice and execution of collaborative projects to explore
    the horizon of this field for serving mankind. The tech industry is racing to
    provide more optimal solutions. Inclusion of IoT, along with cloud computing,
    big data analytics, and wireless sensor networks can provide sufficient scope
    to predict, process, and analyze the situations and improve the activities in
    the real-time scenario. The concept of heterogeneity and interoperability of the
    devices by providing flexible, scalable, and durable methods, models are also
    opening new domains in this field. Therefore, this paper contributes towards the
    recent IoT technologies in the agriculture sector, along with the development
    of hardware and software systems. The public and private sector projects and startup''s
    started all over the globe to provide smart and sustainable solutions in precision
    agriculture are also discussed. The current scenario, applications, research potential,
    limitations, and future aspects are briefly discussed. Based on the concepts of
    IoT a precision farming framework is also proposed in this article. A graphical

    term ‘Agriculture’ is inferred from the Latin words ‘Ager’ means ‘Land’ and ‘Culture’
    means ‘Cultivation’. It is the milestone field of human civilization and is one
    of the benchmark areas. This field is the withstander of the economies of various
    nations. According to the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations
    (FAO), more than 60% of the human population depends on agriculture for survival
    and around 12% of the total land area is under agricultural production [1]. Predicted
    by FAO, the global population will reach the mark of 8 billion people by the year
    2025 and 9.6 billion by the end of 2050 (FAO, 2009) [2]. The interpretation of
    this data shows that to tackle this population growth, an estimated increase of
    70% in food production must be achieved worldwide by 2050 [3]. Agriculture is
    also the second-largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter, because of fossil-based
    fertilizers, biomass, and machinery. In some of the developed and developing nations,
    the agriculture sector is the backbone of the economy. This field has a huge contribution
    in the growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of developing countries, in particular,
    some of them are listed in TABLE 1. TABLE 1 Nations Having Agriculture as a Major
    Part of Their GDP [4] In India, 53% of the population is dependent on the agriculture
    sector for employment and 61.5 % of the Indian population is primarily dependent
    on the agriculture sector for its livelihood [5]. Focusing on the market size,
    India is the second-largest fruit producer in the world. Based on certain data
    and statistics, the farming income in India is expected to double by 2022. Eyeing
    this change, there is an intra-state cluster development of certain states in
    terms of the agriculture sector. The various stats and numbers representing the
    impact of agriculture in the overall economic development of India as compared
    to other fields has been shown in Fig. 1. FIGURE 1. Contributions of various sectors
    in the Indian economy [6]. Show All At present, the demand is more than the supply
    generated and this curve will illustrate more unstable results in the coming years,
    due to increase in demand with population rise. To maintain the demand-supply
    curve, there will be enormous stress on the agricultural sector. Global warming
    and changing climatic conditions are also important factors to be taken into consideration.
    From the past decades, due to the increase in demand and pressure on the overall
    structure of the field, this area is witnessing the slow but progressive shift
    from traditional approaches to the most advanced technology-driven methods. The
    use of traditional approaches and conventional methods, as well as the changes
    in the environment, lay stress on the agricultural sector. Some of the challenges
    for the agricultural sector are given as follows: The use of traditional techniques
    of farming hinders the optimization of both cost and time. Depletion of the topsoil
    due to floods and winds resulting in the deposition of the pollutants, sediments,
    nitrates, and phosphates, result in causing the eutrophication and the runoff
    of the soil. Planting the same crop after each harvest makes the soil redundant
    of the essential nutrients. Water scarcity due to the climatic changes lowers
    the level of groundwater for irrigation, thereby disturbing the water cycle. Global
    climate changes due to the destruction of the tropical forests and the other vegetative
    species in agriculture result in the elevation of the carbon dioxide and other
    greenhouse gas levels. Lack of expertise in proper recognition of the particular
    plant species. There is no proper method to detect the disease at early stages,
    such that precautionary measures could be taken to prevent it. Therefore, because
    of these factors, the need for the creation of modern methods and intensification
    of the agricultural practices to use water, soil, minerals, and other resources
    efficiently becomes obligatory. The nature of the technology and devices is changing
    i.e. it never settles for any less. A lot of research papers addressing the challenges
    of agriculture in the IoT domain have been put forth. Constant developments and
    everlasting expectations from the existing technologies paves a great way for
    motivating academicians and researchers to set and attain new standards. During
    recent years, there has been a paradigm shift in the study and application of
    domains like IoT, cloud computing, machine learning, and big data, etc. Therefore,
    from the trends of these data sets, a constant need is felt to revisit the current
    standings and capacities of the new age IoT concepts. The modern-day requirements
    and the counteractive substitutes in the field of agriculture and changes exactly
    to the expectations based on the concepts of IoT must be addressed. The contribution
    of IoT in the agriculture field and certain gaps in resource utilization motivated
    us to perform a study that addresses current issues and applications of IoT in
    agriculture. Agriculture is expected to get immensely fortified by the advancement
    of technology especially by the domain IoT. Precision agriculture is the new term
    appended to the agriculture filed, with all the procedures being followed, addressed,
    and simulated in a tech-driven manner. Incorporation of the internet has started
    to revolutionize this field by associating devices together, now being identified
    as the Internet of Things. Coined in 1999 by a British visionary “Kevin Ashton”,
    Internet of Things is a consortium of devices connected [7]. The devices are associated
    with internet via Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Radio-frequency Identification
    (RIFD), Near Field Communication (NFC), Long Term Evolution (LTE), and other devices
    and communication technologies. This association helps the devices and the other
    objects transfer the information gathered to destined places all over the network.
    Precision agriculture, therefore, aims to optimize and improve agricultural processes
    to ensure optimum production with reliable, fast, and distributed dimensions thus
    providing growers a detailed overview of the ongoing scenarios in the cultivation
    stretches. This practice is followed to reduce energy consumption. The major areas
    where IoT can leave an everlasting impression are climate monitoring [8], data
    analytics [9], early disease detection [10], crop counting [11], smart irrigation
    [12], etc. With the spread of a network of devices, a communication channel can
    be established between the farmers, fields, and experts. By developing IoT based
    models, the field conditions can be monitored remotely on regular time intervals
    without any human intervention and after analyzing the data favorable and efficient
    decisions can be taken accordingly. This will help to ensure both field and market
    safety and security to the farmer. Also, with early monitoring of crops, disease
    detection can be done and thus preventive measures can be taken to save the crop
    beforehand. For producers it will also help in the analysis of consumer demands.
    Whether the product will be able to meet market expectations, thus creating an
    intelligent decision driven farming. An analysis of different existing articles
    addressing the research and development of precision agriculture is presented
    in TABLE 2. TABLE 2 Alaysis of Various Papers in the Field of Precison Agricuture
    for the Current Study In this article based on research gaps and findings obtained
    from articles analyzed below, a systematic survey is done. Therefore in this study,
    the most prominent problems of the agriculture sector, and solutions provided
    by modern systems are addressed and discussed in detail. The major contributions
    of this study are as follows: A comprehensive survey of the architectural, conceptual,
    and implementation details of IoT models adopted for Precision Agriculture has
    been carried out. Various IoT hardware platforms and other associated devices
    like sensors, accumulators, etc. along with their role in agriculture have been
    discussed in brief. Various IoT OS supported for Precision Agriculture have been
    discussed. The significance and key differences of MIoT in agriculture have been
    discussed along with related studies. Studies limited to a specific domain has
    been merged together for clear mapping of the domain. Sensors and their role in
    agriculture is discussed. Various projects/ start-up’s started all over the globe
    for tacking agricultural problems and providing intelligent and sustainable solutions
    to farmers have also been discussed. Functional concepts like limitations, improvements,
    future works and applications are discussed separately. The rest of the paper
    has been organized as in Section 2 various search and source methods used for
    the selections of relevant articles has been introduced, in Section 3 to get into
    the deep insight of the various concepts, theories, and devices related to the
    implementation of Internet of Things has been discussed, followed by Section 4
    which gives the various related studies concerning different applications of Internet
    of Things in Agriculture, findings like challenges, limitations, improvements,
    future work, etc. with a short description of our proposed work has been given
    in Section 5, and finally, at last, the article ends with a conclusion. Table
    3 gives the detailed nomenclature used throughout this article. TABLE 3 Nomenclature
    SECTION II. Sources and Search Methods The research methodology consists of going
    through articles based on the contribution of IoT and its related technologies
    for the advancement and development of the agriculture filed. For designing the
    overall structure of this article, the data and selected studies are chosen strictly
    based on a time frame. Most of the articles taken for study are sorted from 2015
    to 2020. This time frame is chosen to visualize and understand the current impact
    of IoT in the field. In TABLE 4, a summary of the resources from where the papers
    have been selected is presented. TABLE 4 Summary of the E-Reserves for Obtaining
    the Related Research Articles Given the objective of this article, research has
    been conducted thoroughly by examining the existing literature work related to
    the subject. For developing a firm foundation, the articles containing the origin
    of IoT, alongside current standings, recent trends, and technologies, were considered
    for a study concerning their contributions to the field of agriculture. By reviewing
    the existing literature, a sustainable framework has been developed to overcome
    the existing challenges in the field. The keywords mainly used to identify the
    literature included Precision Agriculture, Agriculture, Plant Monitoring, Internet
    of Things, Smart Agriculture, Smart Farming, Irrigation, Plant Pathology, Wireless
    Sensor Networks, etc. The eight-year trends of the different terminologies and
    their search significance over the years have been extracted from Google and are
    presented in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. FIGURE 2. Worldwide distribution of IoT of the
    past eight years [19]. Show All FIGURE 3. Precision Agriculture distribution worldwide
    of the past eight years [19]. Show All From the figures, it can be seen that the
    frequency of search or usage of these two terms is somewhat stable over the past
    eight years. An average, 80% of people talk and search about these topics for
    study and other related purposes, thus establishing the growing interest worldwide
    in this area. So for a better understanding, in the next section, the various
    terminologies related to the Internet of things concepts and devise have been
    discussed. SECTION III. Introduction to the Internet of Things (IoT) Concepts
    and Theories Inspired from the technology of the internet to connect the whole
    world, the Internet of Things constitutes of things possessing unique identities
    and are connected to the internet. A cosmos of sensors, actuators, appliances,
    and other devices connected with each over the internet, results in making the
    Internet of Things (IoT). The scope of IoT is not just limited to only connecting
    things but to allow them to communicate and exchange data. Based on the Electronic
    Devices and Network Annex-IEA-4E (EDNA), by 2020 the number of connected devices
    will rise to 50 billion, thus resulting in the generation of high revenue. IoT
    works in a layered manner depending upon the problem it is addressing. Therefore,
    it can be define that IoT possesses a layered architecture [20]. All these layers
    combined are called the IoT functional blocks. Apart from the functional blocks,
    various communication models that aid the smooth working of an IoT model are a
    request-response model, publish-subscribe, push-pull, and exclusive pair [20].
    Fig. 4 represents the reference architecture of IoT in agriculture and includes
    the following layers: device/physical layer, network layer, middleware layer,
    service layer, analytics layer, and end-user layer. The layered architecture includes
    all the hardware devices, facilities, equipment, internet, communication technologies,
    protocols, and data analytic algorithms. How the layers work along with each other
    is described below: Perception Layer: Also called physical or the device layer,
    this layer lies at the bottom of the architecture and constitutes of sensors,
    actuators, microcontrollers, gateways, routers, switches, hubs, etc. The main
    role of this layer is, how efficiently the sensing devices and the other equipment’s
    can work together to gather data. The microcontroller device acts as a controller
    as it performs all the networking ifunctionalities. The microcontroller also acts
    as a network regulating body as it regulates the networks, such that the sensors
    and other devices can collect data. The main aim of this layer is to capture data
    and transfer it to the other layer i.e., the higher abstraction layers. In terms
    of agriculture, the devices in the physical layer gather, soil, water, pH value,
    humidity, leaf wetness, and other data parameters. Also, the topology in which
    the devices are placed plays a major role in power consumption and efficient data
    collection in this layer. Network Layer: It comprises of internet and other communication
    technologies. The main aim of this layer is, how to achieve better communication
    in the platform. In terms of agriculture, the design of this layer plays an important
    role in a framework due to the selection of suitable communication technologies
    relevant to field size or the test bed size. LTE, CDMA, GSM, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, LoRa,
    NFC, UWB Bluetooth, and RIFD are some of the communication technologies used for
    agriculture purposes. ZigBee, LoRa, and NFC are the most used communication technologies
    employed depending upon the problem and the area to be addressed in the agro domain.
    NFC and Bluetooth are the most suitable for the greenhouses. Various protocols
    like HTTP, WWW, and SMTP serve for efficient communication in the agricultural
    scenarios. Middleware Layer: This layer in IoT architecture is accountable for
    device management, context awareness, interoperability, portability, and security-related
    responsibilities. In terms of agriculture scenarios, HYDRA, SMEPP act as best
    middleware due to their context-aware functionalities. Service Layer: Dealing
    with agricultural problems, cloud-assisted service layer in IoT layered architecture
    plays a prominent role in providing cloud storage and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).
    To facilitate the function of sensing, actuation, and other activities, this layer
    focuses on some main areas or domains such as monitoring, detection, control,
    decision making, recognition, etc. The service layer offers services like device
    monitoring, control, discovery, and data publishing services. Analytics Layer:
    The layer is responsible for the processing and analysis of data. This layer works
    as a consortium of two steps- 1) Data ingestion, is the step that performs storage,
    cleansing, and streaming of data and the 2) Data analytics, which performs data
    reporting, mining, and learning. In the analytics layer various machine learning
    tools, data analytic algorithms are employed to give early predictive decisions
    for measuring the crop yield, crop growth, disease detection, etc. These decisions
    can enhance farm monitoring capacity. The predictive decisions can help in the
    design of better decision support systems. End-User Layer: Being the topmost layer
    of the model, it serves the consumer or the user. To provide the interface to
    the users to control and monitor their model, this layer allows them to view the
    system status, analyze or process the data. In agro models, the farmer is the
    end-user. This layer provides a user-friendly experience and platform to the farmers.
    The services or applications in this layer are designed based on the behavioral
    study and pattern analysis of the user. Various intelligent approaches and data
    analytic studies are employed to understand the behavior of the users, as they
    come with different needs and offer a lot of diversity. Social media, Cloud computing,
    Mobile messaging are the platforms used to provide services to users, experts,
    and industries. Through this layer, the whole IoT based platform can be monitored,
    controlled, and run. The services generated from this layer are mostly the link
    between the user and the systems/platforms. FIGURE 4. A layered ecosystem/architecture
    of Agro-IoT. Show All A. Multimedia Internet of Things (MIoT) in Agriculture Based
    on the working, nature of deployment, and the subject IoT concepts are used to
    address, traditional IoT is differentiated into various forms such as IoMT, MIoT,
    IIoT, etc. Without the inclusion of these concepts, IoT systems cannot successfully
    realize the concept of ubiquitous computing. In these paradigms, the interaction
    and cooperation between the heterogeneous devices is facilitated. Due to the increase
    in the number, diversity of devices and data with time, these concepts have become
    more functional and prominent to develop models and techniques for coming challenges
    and reflect the possibilities enabled in them. All these concepts have the same
    main character of availability, intelligence, and devices but they only differ
    in their due course of action i.e., their general usage. Being an allied branch
    or extension of IoT, MIoT, include smart objects that are usually resource-constrained,
    in terms of memory, energy, and processing power. Due to the progressive reduction
    in size and cost of production of these devices, MIoT models are expected to be
    developed and deployed on a large scale. Generally, the sensors of these models
    are usually designed to be battery operated or solar power operated. Due to the
    large data sensing and analysis, these devices require high computational power.
    Mostly, the multimedia data includes audio, video, and image data, which possess
    unstructured features and is difficult to transmit and analyze on a computationally
    scarce network and low bandwidth conditions. Multimedia data shows different behavior
    compared to the scalar data due to its computational complexity and network topology
    bottlenecks to the Quality of Service (QoS). A lot of work has been done in IoT
    and its allied fields to realize the concept of heterogeneous, low-level data
    transmission, and communication. In agricultural frameworks, the data is mostly
    in the visual form e.g., pest images, plant disease images, field images, etc.
    The characteristic difference in scalar and multimedia data is shown in Fig. 5.
    FIGURE 5. Key characteristic differences between IoT and MIoT data [25]. Show
    All Depending upon the various parameters there are key differences between IoT
    and MIoT and they are discussed as: The IoT systems work mostly on non-heterogeneous
    devices while the MIoT functions well in case of heterogeneity. IoT data is mostly
    scalar, however, MIoT considers the multimedia data. Traditional IoT networks
    does not take into consideration the concept QoS while transmission and communication
    whereas in case of MIoT, QoS and QoE play a major role as the prime parameters.
    IoT can function well over low bandwidth channels whereas MIoT networks are in
    demand of high bandwidth due to bulky data. Node operation is predefined in IoT
    whereas in MIoT the node operation is adaptive in nature. Various authors have
    worked on the implementation of concepts of MIoT for agriculture. Zhang et al.
    [21], worked on the concept of preserving the concept of data confidentiality
    while realizing the challenge of low-cost data acquisition. A measurement matrix
    under the control of chaos and random subsampling is employed to capture the ruptured
    image signals. Then these sampled sub-images are assembled to form a big master
    image and then encrypted based on android transform and single value diffusion.
    Correlation, histogram, keyspace, robustness, real-time, and entropy analysis
    are performed to understand and realize the concept of low-level transmission.
    Rani et al. [22], worked on the concept of bridging the gap between the scalar
    and multimedia data, and for this, they developed an IoMT cross-layer protocol.
    This protocol considered cross-communication between the physical, data link,
    and routing layers. The main objective of this work was to achieve energy-efficient
    communication with less computational time complexity. An optimal mathematical
    model was developed to study the cross-layer behavior in all the three layers,
    therefore selecting the efficient one. A comparative study was conducted on two
    parameters like delay and distance. Usman et al. [23], proposed a multilayer framework
    based on multilevel edge computing architecture to manage, and preserve the privacy
    of end devices from external attacks. Authors mainly focused on the three major
    challenges i.e., node management, privacy-preserving, and network protection.
    The proposed architecture is divided into three layers with the first layer comprising
    of underlying network partitioned into multiple clusters to manage end-devices
    and Level-One Edge Devices (LOEDs). In the second layer, the LOEDs apply an efficient
    aggregation technique to reduce the volumes of generated data and preserve the
    privacy of end-devices. Local differential privacy-based technique is applied
    to protect the privacy of sensitive information in aggregated data. In the last
    layer, the mobile sinks are registered with a level-two edge device via a handshaking
    mechanism to protect the underlying network from external threats. Floris and
    Atzori [24], addressed the issue of evaluation of Quality of Experience (QoE)
    for IoT applications where mostly multimedia data is involved. For designing a
    layered architecture, authors first tried to analyze the QoE parameters or factors
    with applications in the relevant scenarios. Then a layered multimedia IoT architecture
    was proposed for QoE analysis by combing each of the analytic and contributing
    factors. Zikria et al. [25], presented a brief overview of the MIoT along with
    its challenges, solutions and future opportunities. The authors discussed the
    data differences between the traditional IoT and MIoT, along with the role of
    communication technologies. The demand for realizing the dream of MIoT and its
    bottlenecks were also discussed. The challenge of data collection and its impact
    over the network traffic is also discussed along with the methodologies developed
    to solve it. Nauman et al. [26], presented a comprehensive survey on the multimedia
    internet of things. Authors discussed the existing role of MIoT in concern with
    various fields like medical, agriculture, automation, and industry, etc. The importance
    of QoE and QoS for multimedia transmission over IoT channels is also discussed.
    A better need for routing and Physical-Medium Access Control (PHY-MAC) protocols
    for M-IoT was also discussed. A potential discussion on open research issues related
    to multimedia communication in IoT was presented. Alsamhi et al. [27], presented
    a survey on the role of green IoT in greener and smart cities. The authors focused
    on how the environment pollution can be controlled along with other parameters
    for making living more sustainable and green with the aid of IoT concepts. AlSkaif
    et al. [28], presented a survey on the energy efficiency of MAC protocols in low
    data rate wireless multimedia sensors. The conflicting goals of WMSN were also
    discussed. Role and challenges of multimedia data were also discussed. A focused
    analysis was performed on network parameter constraints and what techniques are
    employed to solve them. A comparison of the energy consumption of MAC protocols
    in four selected application scenarios related to smart cities and environment
    monitoring was also presented. Libo et al. [29], worked on how with the use of
    multimedia data in the form of images can be employed to detect the plant diseases.
    Rape diseases were studied as a case study. Authors also discussed the challenges
    and bottlenecks faced for the transfer of multimedia data over low bandwidth channels.
    With machine intelligence, authors also proposed a diagnostic procedure via which
    the data can be transferred over wireless multimedia sensors networks. Psannis
    et al. [30], proposed a technique for the transfer of advanced media-based smart
    big data via intelligent systems. Authors in their work addressed the problem
    of the rapid rise of devices and heterogeneity. An encoding algorithm with HVEC
    standard for performance evaluation was proposed to transfer the data intelligently.
    B. Hardware Platforms for IoT The hardware platform for IoT comprises a set of
    compatible hardware capable of running certain software. The main components of
    a hardware platform are machine language, sensors, wireless devices, programs,
    and processors, protocols, etc. The processor in a hardware platform determines
    how much fast a framework can work. To design certain new methodologies in IoT,
    various hardware platforms supported are elaborated as: 1) Raspberry Pi It is
    a series of single-board computers developed in the UK by Raspberry foundation.
    There are various families of raspberry i.e., Raspberry Pi 1, Raspberry Pi 2,
    Raspberry Pi 3, Raspberry Pi Zero, Raspberry Pi 4. All these families have different
    models. The Broadcom processor is used in most of the boards. It acts more like
    a computer system and can do multitasking [31]. 2) Arduino Uno Developed by Arduino.cc,
    it is a microcontroller board and is based on the ATMega32 processor. Arduino
    Uno possessing a USB port is a very valuable addition to the family of microcontrollers.
    Various versions of Arduino like Arduino Uno, Arduino Due, Arduino Leonardo, and
    Arduino Mega are present in the market. Out of these the most common versions
    are Arduino Uno and Arduino Mega [32]. 3) Node MCU It is an open-source IoT platform.
    It generally refers to firmware rather than the development kits. It is a low-cost
    open-source kit/module developed for the ESP8266 Wi-Fi chip. It is developed in
    the Arduino IDE environment [33]. 4) Beaglebone Developed by Texas Instruments,
    it is a low-cost open-source single-board computer. Its size measures 75 by 75
    mm and possesses all the functionality of a basic computer. It requires 2W of
    power or a 5V separate power and can work smoothly without any cooling or sinks
    [34], [35]. 5) Banana Pi It is a low-cost credit-card-sized single-board computer
    developed by a Chinese company Shenzhen SINOVOIP Co. Ltd. The hardware design
    is hugely influenced by Raspberry Pi. It is compatible with Raspberry Pi boards
    as well. It can be developed both on Android and Linux [36]. The various hardware
    platforms of IoT with their functional specifications are given in TABLE 5. TABLE
    5 Hardware Platforms of IoT and Their Specifications C. IoT Operating System (IoT
    OS) for Agriculture IoT operating system (IoT OS) is an operating system designed
    to perform within the constraints particular to Internet of Things devices. IoT
    OS are designed and developed in such a way that it can function under the restrictions
    of memory, size, power and processing capability. The main aim of IoT OS is to
    enable successful data transfer over the network via internet. The IoT OS for
    a particular framework is not chosen at random. Certain parameters such as footprint,
    scalability, portability, modularity, connectivity, and reliability are taken
    into consideration. As per the requirement of agriculture, a huge number of devices
    are connected having different features and also the devices have to withstand
    the different environments, the OS then to be chosen must be scalable, cost-efficient,
    and reliable. Various studies have been put forward for the role of IoT OS in
    network management and overall communication. Javed et al. [37], provided a detailed
    reviewed comparison of the operating systems designed for IoT devices based on
    their architecture, scheduling methods, networking technologies, programming models,
    power, and memory management methods, along with other features required for IoT
    OS applications. Musaddiq et al. [38], studied the role of small IoTOS in powering
    the scarce network devices. Authors also put light on the energy consumption of
    these devices. A detailed discussion on IoT devices and resource management is
    provided and some state of art IoT OSs such as Contiki, TinyOS, and FreeRTOS are
    also investigated. Baccelli et al. [39], a comprehensive review of RIOT is provided.
    The key components highlighted in this study are the kernel, hardware abstraction,
    software modularity for various configurations. The authors also discussed the
    operational aspects like system boot-up, timers, power management, and networking
    along with the relevant APIs. Zikria et al. [40], proposed a study for the management,
    challenges, and opportunities of IoT OS in managing IoT systems. The authors discussed
    the issue of interoperability, protocol functionalities to support heterogeneous
    deployment scenarios. Supported hardware and future research trends are also discussed.
    Ain et al. [41], proposed an efficient and flexible decision-making system for
    maintaining user thermal comfort with the help of intelligent sensors. Fuzzy based
    approach along with RIOT OS was developed to tackle the problem of fluctuation
    and adjustment. Results show that the proposed approach can perform 28% better
    than the existing approaches in terms of energy efficiency. Stergiou et al. [42],
    studied the transfer of metadata in the IoT networks. Authors discussed the techniques
    and open tools such as CC analyzers and simulators which can provide intelligent
    metadata transfer over a network. The experimentation was performed on CloudSim
    and Cooja emulator of Contiki OS for the testing of a single network segment.
    From the experimentation, it was found that no duplicate packet transfer occurred
    which is a good sign for multimedia data transmission. The various IoT OS with
    their functional specifications are presented in TABLE 6. TABLE 6 IoT OS Platforms
    in Agriculture and Their Specifications D. Sensors and Their Role in Agriculture
    Sensors are the devices, modules, machines or subsystems capable of detecting
    the changes or events in the environment. They also send signals back to the receiver
    end. Mostly the sensors are used with other electronics. A sensors sensitivity
    usually indicates how much change in sensor output occurs with respect to the
    change in the input quantity measurements. Most sensors possess the linear transfer
    function. The sensitivity of a sensor is defined as the ratio between the output
    signal and the measured property. The resolution of a sensor is the smallest change
    it can detect in the quantity it is measuring. In the area of agriculture, demand
    of technological solutions with high aim in rising production and quality is increasing
    day by day. Also the solutions are required which provide optimal analysis and
    sustainable methods for the field development with reduced cost and time. To sustain
    such challenges, sensor- based technologies have proven to be of much help to
    tackle the above issues and challenges. Precision agriculture is an emerging area
    where sensor based technologies are playing a major role. Since the sensors are
    a major data collection agents, they play a dynamic role in agriculture. Also,
    it is very difficult to collect the data from an agricultural field due to the
    undulating field conditions that keep on changing over time. Sensors are selected
    or designed according the problem to be addressed or needs identified by the farmers.
    Agriculturalists generally use sensors to sense the soil conditions, humidity,
    crop conditions, minerals, pH value, water levels, and sunlight, etc. The nature
    and the characteristics of the component which needs to be sensed also plays a
    major role in the development of a sensing device. With the development of technology,
    machinery and easy-to-use microcontroller platforms, the usage of sensors has
    expanded beyond the traditional fields of measurement i.e., temperature, pressure
    and flow. However, the analog sensors such as potentiometers and force sensing
    resistors are still widely in use. Pajares et al. [54], discussed the sensors
    in agriculture and forestry. In the article, various related works of the sensors
    performed by different authors in the same domain were presented. The role and
    importance of the component or substance which needs to be sensed was discussed
    along with their characteristics and specifications. The major areas focused by
    authors were soil analysis, seed growth, weed detection, forest stands and reflectance,
    machinery for effective treatments, microorganisms, pest control, seedling breeding,
    growing, state of health, positioning, navigation, safety, detection and classification.
    Zhu et al. [55], showed that LIDAR, IMU, and Encoder (x2) can be used for designing
    a prototype vehicle for the agricultural domain. The authors also discussed how
    these sensors can be used for the development and usage of that prototype in case
    of undulating surfaces and rough terrains. A complete review of the wireless sensors
    and the network applications used in agriculture is provided. The authors also
    addressed the importance of sensors in the field of agriculture. Along with the
    sensors, the communication technologies that support sensor communications are
    also mentioned by Rehman et al. [56]. The sensors used in the medical and agricultural
    fields have also been discussed. In the case of the agricultural field, the various
    conditions and circumstances affecting the data collection from sensors are addressed.
    The various types of sensors and their platforms used by different authors in
    their work are also included by Chokkareddy et al. [57]. Plageras et al. [58],
    used efficient IoT based sensor and big data analytics for secure collection of
    data and communication over a channel. In the study, smart housing or building
    was taken as case study, and the secure data collection with the sensors was performed
    and analyzed. The behavior of various sensors for data collection in different
    scenarios in terms of IoT and cloud computing was studied by Stergiou et al. [59].
    The secure communication among devices was also studied along with performance
    bottlenecks and challenges. The various sensors and their use in agriculture is
    discussed below: 1) Level Sensors They measure the substance of liquid in a cast.
    The cast can be any agricultural field, pond, water tank, etc. They measure data
    in two methodologies 1) Point level measurements: indicate only whether the constituent
    or level measured is above or below the sensing point or threshold. 2) Continuous
    measurements: specific range measurements and exact substance amount determination
    are performed by these sensors. In agricultural fields, the water level sensors,
    humidity sensors, and moisture sensors are used to measure the water content levels
    in a field. The point level sensors are used when the water content in the cast
    i.e., soil or testbed is very less i.e. in dry and arid areas, whereas the continuous
    level sensors are feasible for semi-arid locations. Some of the ultrasonic level
    sensors are also used in water treatment plants. Blank et al. [60], designed a
    low-level senor based fusion application for agricultural machinery design. 2)
    Temperature Sensor Temperature sensors measure the temperature of the environment
    or surroundings. They are of different types i.e. thermistors, thermocouples,
    resistance temperature detectors, infrared sensors, semiconductor sensors. In
    agriculture they measure the temperature variants in a field. Mahan et al. [61]
    designed an optimal temperature based field monitoring system by using a low-cost
    infrared sensor. 3) Proximity Sensors Detect the presence of nearby objects without
    any physical intervention. The sensor works by emitting an electromagnetic beam
    in the field and looks for any alterations in the signal. These are mainly employed
    in agricultural cattle grazing, counting of fruits, etc. Kim et al. [62] used
    a capacitive proximity sensor to optimize the harvest yield of fields. 4) Infrared
    Sensors Senses the changes in the environment by emitting infrared rays. They
    work in two approaches i.e., active and passive. An active IR sensor can both
    emit and detect the radiations and constitute a light-emitting diode and a receiver.
    The passive IR sensors can only detect the radiation and possess only a LED. In
    agriculture field infrared sensors can be employed to detect the presence of rodents
    in the orchards, count the number of plants or trees in the field, capturing satellite
    images of the field. Allred et al. [63], used IR sensor-based satellite imagery
    to map the findings and results of UAV to chart agricultural drainage systems.
    5) Touch Sensors Also known as tactile sensors, work on sensing the touch. They
    are low-cost sensors. In the agriculture field they can be used for the detection
    of intrusions in the field. Depending on the target and the range, there are different
    types of sensors, the same are discussed in Fig. 6 and TABLE 7 below: TABLE 7
    Sensors Based on Their Fields of Application FIGURE 6. Sensors and their types.
    Show All SECTION IV. Related Work The advancement and role of the Internet of
    Things in precision agriculture along with the related areas where research is
    being conducted are discussed in this section. Literature including various approaches,
    techniques, and methodologies presented by the number of authors has been divided
    into different sections. Various studies are performed and put forward by various
    academicians and authors concerning the evolution of agriculture relating to the
    incubation of the concepts of the Internet of Things. Kim et al. [64], reviewed

    irrigation, insect, pest analysis were studied and discussed. Also, how this technology
    is redefining the agriculture system and boosting farmers to work, is portrayed.
    Authors studied the recent developments of IoT and how it is helping in providing
    the solutions while designing an IoT system for agriculture, what strategies and
    policies need to be considered. The advanced agricultural practices such as greenhouses,
    vertical farming, hydroponic farming, and phenotyping are also explained. All
    the crop stages and potential challenges are also discussed. Farooq et al. [66],
    presented many aspects of IoT in agriculture. Authors discussed all the recent
    technologies associated with IoT along with big data analytics for the development
    of precision agriculture systems. Various network topologies, architectures, layers,
    and protocols are also presented. In context to the development of a smart farm,
    all the major components and relevant technologies were discussed. Also, the regulations,
    standardizations, and policies used by several countries to standardize IoT methods
    for agriculture have been discussed. Elijah et al. [67], gave an overview of IoT
    and data analytics technologies and practices in agriculture. The authors divided
    their study into four sections i.e., communication technology, internet, data
    storage, technology. The authors also provided an analysis and data on how the
    aforementioned sections can be employed for dealing with the diminishing agricultural
    resources. The pros and cons of various technologies such as cloud computing,
    WSN, radio frequency identification, middleware systems, etc. to their application
    in the agriculture field are also discussed. Studies on how these technologies
    can be used to develop an IoT ecosystem, with technical and business scenarios
    were also presented. Misra et al. [68], discussed the concepts and role of IoT,
    AI and big data in the field of agriculture. In the review, focus was laid on
    green- house monitoring, disease detection, usage UAV machines and drones agriculture
    and supply chain modernization, social media in food industry, food quality assessment
    and modernization for food traceability. Thakur et al. [69], reviewed articles
    of repute in the context of the employability of WSN in agriculture. The authors
    highlighted the different communication technologies and WSN technologies adopted
    for precision agriculture. The authors also discussed various sensors and their
    role in agriculture. The influence of various techniques for designing the models
    is also discussed at length. Damos [70], presented a review on the pest control
    in precision agriculture. The author discussed the various computer-aided technologies
    employed for forecasting and designing decision support systems. The challenges
    and constraints of designing the decision support system were highlighted. The
    most available and published data present online in terms of pest management was
    also discussed. A differentiation between the documented and existing decision
    support systems was highlighted. The advancement and role of the internet of things
    in precision agriculture along with the related areas where research is being
    conducted are discussed in this section. Literature including various approaches,
    techniques, and methodologies presented by the number of authors has been divided
    into different sections and are discussed as follows: A. IoT in Farm Management
    Farm management refers to the construction and implementation of decisions for
    obtaining the maximum production and profit via organizational operation of decisions.
    This area is most benefitted by automation and the implementation of new technological
    methods. With farm management agricultural practices are made informative by evaluation
    and comparison with the other developed approaches and methods. Diedrichs et al.
    [71], with the aid of machine learning and IoT sensing devices, predicted the
    occurrence of frost events. Authors designed their system based on three layers
    i.e., a group of internet-enabled devices for water data collection. The authors
    augmented the data using the synthetic minority oversampling technique due to
    its capability of reducing the occurrence of errors with the ML approaches. The
    humidity and temperature sensors were employed to collect data from five meteorological
    stations of the Mendoza Province of Argentina. For each station, the existing
    sensor data spanning from a period 2001 to 2016 was taken as a reference to collect
    the daily data. The data was divided into two sets i.e., locally available is
    the config-local and the one available globally is the config-all. Bayesian Networks
    were employed along with SMOTE and recursive portioning, to train the system.
    Jawad et al. [72], designed a wireless power transfer technology based on a drone
    charging system for smart agriculture. The authors used the concepts of magnetic
    resonator coupling and sleep/active modes of charge transfer system for designing
    the model. Authors mainly focused on how to charge wirelessly the drones and other
    equipment employed in agricultural field monitoring. The magnetic resonant coupling
    technique was considered due to its capability of high power transfer and efficiency.
    In the experimentation, authors found that the FSC coil with 150 coil turns in
    the transmitter circuit and the MTC comprising of 60 coil turns in the receiver
    (i.e. drone) accomplish the maximum transfer power and efficiency. For finding
    the accurate efficiency, the model was tested based on different load, and how
    to load misalignment changes the model behavior was also noted. Drone flight time
    was also taken into consideration and was estimated based on the adopted battery
    capacity and payload of the drone. Tseng et al. [73], proposed an intelligent
    IoT based platform for farm management. The authors took the data based on different
    plants i.e., beans, spinach, celery via sensors, and used 3D normalization on
    that data to extract the optimal/useful data. The average and variance were moved
    to obtain user data without making any visible changes in the actual data. Farmer’s
    behavior was analyzed for the application of pesticides and fertilizers. For the
    platform development SIM5320E, IoT Development Board is used along with the BH1750
    illumination sensor and BME280 temperature and moisture sensor. Bacco et al. [74],
    designed a model based on air-ground UAV communications for smart farming. Authors
    empirically and analytically developed a real test-bed implementation of IEEE
    802.15.4 based communication between unmanned aerial vehicle and ground sensors.
    The focus was laid on how to transfer data between sensors and other devices present
    on the ground in an optimized manner to ensure fewer transmission losses. From
    the experimentation, and result analysis authors found the Gilbert-Elliot model
    to be suitable to approximate the packet loss in the link at low transmission
    speeds. The authors used approximately 80,000 datasets from the testbed. Ahmed
    et al. [75], based on the concepts of fog computing and Wi-Fi-based long-distance
    networks proposed a system for smart monitoring. In comparison to the existing
    traditional models, a scalable and flexible model was designed for monitoring
    and controlling agro farms in rural areas. Authors introduced a WiLD network and
    fog computing in the existing WSN-based solutions to cover long ranges with fewer
    delays. A cross-layer based MAC and routing solution for sensing and actuating
    were proposed to reduce the network latency. Throughput, coverage range, and network
    latency of the network structure were analyzed. Liu et al. [76], by hybridizing
    the concepts of IoT, cloud computing, and data mining proposed an integrated framework
    for the agricultural field. China was considered as the territory to design and
    devise mechanisms to enhance modern agriculture as compared to the conventional
    one. Quality, safety, management, and pollution are were taken into consideration
    while designing the model. NoSql database, DynamoDB, relational database Oracle,
    and file object storage Amazon S3, were employed to provide the hybrid data storage
    design. Bai et al. [77], due to the issue of frequently changing environmental
    conditions addressed the issue of estimation and control in the greenhouse. The
    authors studied how to collaboratively deploy WSNs and actuator schemes for agriculture.
    Sensor nodes were used to conduct a local estimation with Kalman filters to enhance
    the stability and transmission of data ensuring energy optimization. Using the
    concepts of collective clustering and mutual effect, the actuator node based scheme
    is designed for the improvement of estimation speed and conversion accuracy. Parameter
    optimization is achieved through fuzzy neural networks along with the PID control
    algorithm. Jinbo et al. [78], performed research on developing a platform for
    the monitoring of a field with agricultural modernization. A system named DEMO
    was proposed by using the SpringMVC framework, MyBatis, Spring Data DynamoDB Stored
    Procedure, Paho, and other related technologies grounded on the J2EE platform.
    Open-source elements such as raspberry, IoT gateway integrated with the ZigBee
    module were used for the development of the platform and were chosen due to their
    stable and cost-efficient properties. The proposed system is capable of massive
    data processing and analysis for agricultural monitoring. RESTful interface service
    system developed on a cloud platform, ExtJs client technology, and WeChat were
    applied to develop the Demo system of an application layer. Mukherjee et al. [79],
    worked on the challenges of a decentralized and heterogeneous UAV swarm deployment.
    The work is focused on how to design and deploy a UAV in resource-constrained,
    harsh, and challenging environments. Swarm edge due to its heterogeneous nature
    and unequal data generation within its member’s results in under-utilization of
    the available computational resources. To solve this issue, the authors proposed
    a Nash bargaining-based weighted intra edge processing offload scheme which can
    reduce the problem of heavy processing in some swarm members. The proposed method
    achieves better scalability and reduced processing delays. Chen et al. [80], developed
    an IoT based inexpensive platform named ‘AgriTalk’ for precision soil farming.
    Turmeric plant was considered for cultivation and experiments were conducted to
    enhance its growth and production. Authors employed AgriTalk in developing several
    other IoT based models for the fields of Mountain Bao in Taiwan. For the study
    authors grew turmeric in three fields. The proposed model is capable of addressing
    dynamic changes in the field conditions for plants grown via in-soil cultivation.
    Automated devices like sensors, actuators with desired farming intelligence were
    employed to design the model. Manual delays for automatic control and switching
    over long distances were also addressed. From experim-entation it was found that
    the curcumin concentration in turmeric leaves after six months was elevated to
    6685.6 μM as compared to 72.1 μM thus witnessing a fivefold increase. Lopez et
    al. [81], proposed a smart system for estimation of soil parameters using an autonomous
    wireless sensor network. Phosphorus content in the soil was measured. For power
    optimization and maintaining a balance between change rate phenomena of soil throughout
    the day for phosphorous estimation, authors developed a dynamic power management
    approach. DPM was tested on both the circuit level and the system level. ANN was
    used to find the significant correlations between the soil parameters such as
    electrical conductivity, phosphorous, temperature, and humidity. Also, energy
    harvesting with the help of IoT and cloud services is proposed. Chen and Yang
    [82], provided a detailed analysis of how efficiently the systems can be developed
    for agriculture based on the techniques of data visualization, clustering, etc.
    The authors studied the significance of various parameters in the same environment
    and effects. For the promotion of efficient development of agriculture, the authors
    proved that data visualization and cluster analysis pave a way for finding the
    key technologies to be applied in modern agriculture. For time and cost optimization,
    functions such as sensing, monitoring, identification, transmission, and feedback
    can be realized using IOT platforms and they can serve as an impetus for intelligent
    agriculture. To test and develop their methodology, authors took the agriculture
    situation in the Jhinsa river basin which lies in the upper reaches of the Yangtze
    River as a testbed. This area has become the most abundant area of biological
    communities in Eurasia. For the study, the authors collected precipitation and
    temperature data. Since data was large, k-means clustering is used to analyze
    the data. Leng et al. [83], presented a study for the application of IoT in agricultural
    products supply chain management. Authors discussed in length what to take into
    consideration, while designing a structural model for the supply chain management.
    RIFD technology was considered as the key constituent for designing the model.
    Pereira et al. [84], based on the concepts of IoT developed an instrument capable
    of performing environment monitoring in a poultry farm. The authors focused on
    designing a cost efficient prototype for the poultry monitoring which provides
    affordable benefits compared to the commercial products available in the market.
    DHT22 sensors were used to collect air pressure and temperature details and CPU
    such as Wemos Mini D1with chipset ESP-8266EXwith standard Wi-Fi 2.4 Ghz connectivity
    were used to calibrate the whole model. Singh et al. [85], developed a cloud based
    autonomic system for delivering agriculture as a service via web and mobile based
    applications. For data collection IoT and other devices were used for communication
    and coordination. Fuzzy logic was used to automatically analyze agriculture. An
    architecture named Agri-info was developed to provide user services. Kolipaka
    [86], proposed a predictive analysis using cross media references for precision
    farming. Authors focused on the usage of sensors and MEMS integrated IoT for precision
    farming. The crop growth parameters such as soil state, water, weed state, crop
    quality and seed quality were also discussed. ML and big data approaches were
    applied to perform predictive analysis and thus finding method to provide optimal
    solutions to farmers. Further based upon the certain characteristics we have tabularized
    the major findings in TABLE 8. TABLE 8 Summary of Developed Methods for Farm Management
    B. IoT in Irrigation Irrigation is the method of application of controlled water
    to the farming fields, at needed intervals. Irrigation has been a constant area
    where a lot of energy, money, and labor is invested in the case of farming. Detection
    and knowledge of water level can reduce the cost of production by half. For increasing
    crop yield, smart irrigation management is essential. Various optimized and precise
    methods have been developed by various academicians. Klein et al. [96], with the
    help of satellite images, worked on the implementation of closed-loop irrigation.
    The authors designed a real-time water requirement system, which can optimize
    water delivery for 140 cells located in four hectares of land. Vegetative indexes
    were calculated for analyzing the total water consumption and how via loops this
    facility can be automated. Through this study and experimentation it was found
    that with the integration of closed-loop strategy and advanced water analysis,
    the overall water consumption efficiency can be improved. Alahi et al. [97], extended
    research to design and develop a smart nitrate monitoring system for the monitoring
    nitrate content in the surface and groundwater. The authors proposed a portable
    sensing system with the help of a planar inter-digital sensor, associated electronics,
    instrumentation, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy-based analysis. Through
    real-time monitoring and sending data directly to the IoT web server, the proposed
    system possesses the capacity to monitor the impact of industrial, urban, and
    agricultural activity on water content and quality. The system also ensures distributed
    monitoring. Daskalakis et al. [98], used leaf sensing technology instead of ground
    soil monitoring for knowing the plant water stress. The authors proposed a low
    cost and low power consumption leaf moisture sensing model by sensing the leaves
    with the new plant backscatter sensor node/tag. The developed tag collects the
    information from a leaf via analog and digital conversions and then the data is
    transferred via remote communication to a low-cost software-defined radio reader
    using monostatic backscatter architecture. The data collected from this node is
    then connected to the irrigation system. The proposed system is powered by a flexible
    solar panel. Jayalakshmi and Gomathi [99], proposed a sensor-cloud based precision
    agriculture for intelligent water management, to enhance crop production. For
    the model design, moisture and stress levels of different plant organs were considered
    along with the behavior vegetative and reproductive organs cell growth, and its
    effects on the water requirement were studied. The dimensionality reduction technique
    was employed to choose the optimal parameters. For the case study, the wheat plant
    was taken. The effect of soil temperature and water suction rate was studied in
    the case of the plant growth. The non-adsorbing testbed was prepared by exploding
    the sand grains at high temperatures. With the aid of WSN, it was monitored when
    the plant needs to be irrigated. Angelopoulos et al. [100], developed a small
    scale smart irrigation prototype for a strawberry greenhouse. The prototype possesses
    off the shelf hardware and software requirements and was tested on large farms
    having multiple crops to get a data gain. The reference architecture also targets
    edge data distribution. The model was tested in Greece and its performance was
    compared against the traditional existing strawberry greenhouse methods for irrigation.
    Compared to the cloud-based approaches, and their incompetence to handle network
    traffic, security challenges, and data sharing with the third party, this model
    is secure and reliable and can handle large datasets. Dominguez-Nino et al. [101],
    worked on how to integrate sensors for developing automated software tools to
    undertake the routine tasks and decision-making involved in scheduling irrigation.
    The authors also focused on the suitability of capacitance approach soil moisture
    sensors and how to automatically interpret them and providing feedback to the
    scheduling algorithm. The proposed approach was tested in the apple orchards located
    at the IRTA-Lleida Experimental Station in Mollerussa, Lleida, Spain. For the
    study, both the physiological and agronomic properties were taken into consideration
    while experimentation. Krishnan et al. [102], designed an automated irrigation
    method. The authors developed a fuzzy logic-based system for precision irrigation
    by using Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) service to enable farmers
    to water the fields. Soil and temperature, humidity, and motor status parameters
    were monitored and taken for the study. For the efficiency evaluation of the system,
    a comparison was done between the proposed system, drip irrigation, and manual
    flooding. Harun et al. [103], designed an environment-friendly system named “Greenhouse
    Irrigation Management System” for precision irrigation in agriculture. Some critical
    environmental parameters such as soil moisture, pH, temperature, humidity are
    measured with the use of WSNs to make decisions. The sensors measure the data
    and based on certain threshold value result, the fields are irrigated. Olivo [104],
    focused on the problems associated with device growth and its effects on the control
    decisions. To address this issue, an architecture named “Rules Engine and Context
    Event Processor (RECEP)” is proposed for the dynamic processing of events originated
    in the context of IoT and PA. In this model the concept if optimization was used
    to optimize the resources to increase agricultural production. The experimental
    setup was set in a banana field located in Machala-Ecuador. The given model was
    designed for operating in low-cost infrastructures for both small and large producers.
    Marcelino et al. [105], based on the work and issues of small family farmers,
    proposed a low-cost system for control, monitoring, and automation of agricultural
    greenhouse. The proposed model was designed by prototyping Raspberry Pi and Arduino
    along with sensors. Temperature, humidity, and light sensors are used for the
    field data collection. The web human interface was developed for interaction between
    the system and the farmers. Koksal and Tekinerdogan [106], developed an automatic
    farm management information system capable of performing data acquisition, processing,
    monitoring, planning, and decision making and managing the farm fields. The authors
    tested their models on two case studies on smart farming in Turkey, one for smart
    wheat in Konya and other greenhouses in Antalya. The feature-driven domain analysis
    model is designed based on IoT reference architectures and data modeling approaches.
    The system was capable of performing all farming related functions, such as irrigation,
    crop monitoring, etc. Hate et al. [107], designed a vegetable traceability system
    with smart irrigation. The field parameters like soil moisture, humidity, water
    supply control, and temperature of particular farmland are monitored with sensors
    such as water level, humidity, soil moisture, and temperature sensors. With IoT,
    the cost is reduced and efficiency is improved. Agale and Gaikwad [108], focused
    on the problem of water reduction in farmlands. An IoT based automatic system
    is designed to collect, analyze, and monitor the real-time sensor data every 10
    seconds from soil and environment and provide irrigation solutions based on that.
    The parameters like temperature, humidity, soil moisture were considered for data
    collection. The proposed method achieved 92.24 % accuracy in water-saving strategy.
    Huan et al. [109], designed a system for monitoring of water in aquaculture ponds.
    To design the system authors used the concept of narrowband IoT (NB-IoT). The
    system used STM32L151C8 microcontroller, sensors and other devices for real time
    data collection and other services. The system was implemented and tested in ChangZhou,
    JiangSu Province, China and performed with low error rate. Vij et al. [110], developed
    a smart precision irrigation system based on the concepts of IoT and machine learning.
    The main aim of authors was to develop a computationally efficient and low cost
    system. Raspberry Pi and Arduino Mega 3 were used as microcontroller and other
    sensors were used to fabricate the system. Compared to the existing systems, the
    proposed system is computationally efficient. The various findings of this section
    have been tabularized in TABLE 9. TABLE 9 Summary of IoT Based Developed Methods
    for Irrigation C. IoT in Crop Monitoring Crop monitoring is the process or method
    of observing the farm fields and crops for enhancing productivity and reducing
    cost. This can be performed with satellites, drones, sensors, and other methods.
    Vegetative indexes of an area can also play a major role in crop monitoring by
    providing the data related to the exact area of land under cultivation etc. With
    crop monitoring the estimated time of harvest can be predicted. de Souza et al.
    [118], proposed an integrated framework with the combination of hardware, software,
    middleware, and other equipment to monitor the testbed. The authors also recorded
    the testing of each equipment in the seed test labs. An IoT based system was developed
    where soil sensors provided the relevant information/data for the growth of seeds.
    Testing was performed in the Official Seed Analysis Laboratory (OSTL) of the Brazilian
    Agricultural Research Corporation. Rekha et al. [119], developed a WSN based framework
    for sensing agricultural characteristics and then provide decisions to the farmers.
    Based on the data collected, the model will provide decisions for irrigation and
    crop monitoring. For the case study, India was taken into consideration due to
    its large farming area and population dependence on agriculture. Groundnut farming
    was studied in this work. Becker Reshef et al. [120], proposed a remote sensing
    analysis based crop monitoring system for strengthening agricultural decisions
    and improving crop security. The authors named this model as “GEOGLAM” model which
    ensures the decision support of all the necessary steps for crop security and
    analysis. Kamath et al. [121], proposed a wireless sensor-based model for monitoring
    the growth of weeds in paddy crop. The authors performed a study on how Raspberry
    Pi and WSN can be modeled for precision agriculture. Raspberry Pi based model
    was deployed to monitor crop along with the integration of Bluetooth 4.0 to send
    signals from visual sensors to the base station. A solar cell battery was used
    to provide power to the system. At the remote station, the images of the crops
    were processed to extract the background and foreground objects. Classification
    between weeds and paddy crop was performed with SVM. Rao and Sridhar [122], Developed
    an automatic irrigation system by prototyping Raspberry Pi and other IoT devices
    to enhance crop productivity. A cloud-based data collection system supported by
    sensors used for data collection is employed to collect the field data. The data
    collected is sent to the base station and based on that data, the decisions are
    made. Parameters like humidity, soil temperature, and sunlight availability are
    measured. Geng et al. [123], for greenhouse environment monitoring proposed a
    four-layer IoT based mobile system. To design the system, the authors proposed
    integration of both Raspberry Pi and Arduino chip in the design where the former
    serves as the data server and later as the master chip for a mobile system. Fabrication
    of all the sensors, actuators, and other devices was done on a single board, thereby
    reducing the device’s physical distances for better performance due to serial
    communication. A dedicated communication protocol with CYC was designed to reduce
    transmission errors and data loss. Shadrin et al. [124], designed an intelligent
    agriculture IoT equipment to monitor the crop. The authors designed the system
    using the test case of monitoring the seed germination. The proposed model was
    fabricated with the integration of low power embedding wireless sensor nodes with
    artificial intelligence. CNN was used to train the model along with the collection
    of data via sensor nodes of the different stages of germinated seeds. A 3D clustering
    analysis was used to analyze the relationship between environmental factors and
    farmer issues. Uddin et al. [125], focused on developing a system for monitoring
    crops from the stage of seed germination to harvest. For this authors proposed
    a resource optimized fast health crop monitoring system. Saudi Arabian agriculture
    was taken into consideration as a case study. IoT and drones were harnessed to
    make an efficient agricultural monitoring system. Data collection methods were
    used to collect data from heterogeneous devices arranged in localized clusters.
    The system was designed to withstand a harsh environment with agility and feasibility.
    Feng et al. [126], proposed a crop growth and nutrition diagnostic system based
    on hyperspectral remote sensing. Color canopies obtained from images captured
    with satellites, UAV, and remote sensing were used to determine the index of yield.
    To determine the color canopy of plants, the color correlation was employed. Cen
    et al. [127], discussed the usage of UAV with dual image frame cameras to estimate
    the aboveground biomass and panicle biomass of rice. The authors conducted their
    study at different growth stages of the crop. The field investigations were made
    on the variations in typical vegetation indices. The accuracy of the model was
    obtained with the extraction of RGB images at two different stages. Random forest
    was employed to obtain AGB as well as the PB. Khan and Kumar [128], proposed a
    framework for the monitoring the crop field. To make their study reliable, the
    authors monitored weather in real-time to get an idea of how to provide an ambient
    condition to farm. Production increase techniques are also proposed for precision
    farming. To overcome the problems of delay in information transfer from the field
    to the farmer, the context-based agricultural mobile sink is designed in WSN.
    Thus the mobile sink node introduction improves the overall efficiency and energy
    consumption of the model. Frontward communication area (FCA) based route selection
    is proposed to reduce energy consumption and delay. Min and Kuang [129], designed
    a system for monitoring the rice crop field. The analysis of the growth of rice
    and rice duck in real-time is done by obtaining the data via the Internet of Things.
    Authors comprehensively viewed the rice and rice duck plant species and the ambient
    farm conditions required for their growth. Qiulan et al. [130], estimated the
    production of carbon from the crop growth. The authors provided a framework for
    the estimation of organic carbon compounds in the farmland soil. The wheat plant
    was taken as a test case in this study. The model provided the real monitoring
    of the farm for carbon production with the aid of IoT and other devices. The real-time
    data was collected from the Yanzhou District of Jining City, Shandong Province,
    China. Harun et al. [131], proposed an improved crop monitoring system based on
    IoT concepts. Brassica Chinensis is the plant taken for study and was subjected
    to four different light treatments such as pulse treatment, continuous treatment,
    high intensity, and artificial control for enhancing the plant growth. The authors
    also analyzed parameters such as leaf count, height, dry weight, and chlorophyll
    a and b. An intelligent embedded system was developed to monitor and capture real-time
    data. Alonso et al. [132], designed an intelligent edge IoT based platform for
    precision livestock and crop monitoring in a dairy farming scenario. In their
    study, authors used the concepts of AI, blockchain technology, edge computing
    and IoT concepts for designing the platform. The architecture named Global Edge
    Computing Architecture (GCEA) was tried and tested in real time in a dairy farm.
    Castellanos et al. [133], proposed a narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) system for collection
    of soil parameters to monitor the potato crop health and growth. A UAV aided network
    is used to support the purpose. The architecture proposed accessed the real filed
    scenario of a potato filed near Bogota, Columbia. The main achievement of this
    work was the energy harnessing due to optimal topology applied for the deployment
    of sensors across the field and thus making the battery last for 82 hours for
    above ground sensors and 77 months for the deep buried sensors. Shafi et al. [134],
    presented a multimodal for crop health monitoring based on the concepts remote
    sensing, IoT and ML. Authors conducted their research in Pakistan. Sensors were
    deployed in fields to collect the real time data. Multispectral data from drones
    presented a NDVI and was used to analyze the crop based on its chlorophyll content.
    Variable length time series data captured from IoT devices and sensors were used
    to generate crop health maps. Deep neural networks were implemented for classification
    and provided the optimal classification. Some studies of the articles incorporating
    IoT in fields related to crop monitoring are presented in TABLE 10. TABLE 10 Summary
    of Developed Methods Crop Monitoring D. IoT in Disease Detection Diseases play
    a vital role in the economic and food crisis of a country. So to avoid this, disease
    detection is employed. This involves the detection of various diseases whether
    fungal, viral, bacterial, etc. from the stages of early to the post-harvest. Incubation
    of IoT has revolutionized the disease detection area in plant phenotyping resulting
    in major control resources available to avoid disease occurrence. Wang et al.
    [146], focused on addressing the problem of pests and insects. Authors proposed
    an IoT based model that can detect the early occurrence of the pests and diseases
    from visual references. Rough set theory algorithm and NN were used to model design.
    The proposed model was compared with existing models for accuracy and efficiency.
    Pandiyan et al. [147], applied the concepts of image segmentation and IoT, to
    develop a system/platform that can detect the diseases in plants. Authors proposed
    a novel platform having an Advanced Segmented Dimension Extraction (ASDE) with
    Heterogeneous Internet of Things procedural (HIoT) aspects, to detect the apple
    leaf diseases. A sign based plant disease identification model for real-time resembling
    of leaf diseases namely bacteria, fungi, micro-organisms, and viruses is presented.
    Three levels i.e. connectivity level, platform level, and service level were employed
    for performing data aggregation, transmission, and automatic identity identification.
    Leaf gestures were studied to identify the diseases in leaves. Zhao et al. [148],
    developed an automatic crop disease detection system capable of identifying and
    recognizing the leaves from a cluttered background. Combining IoT concepts and
    CNN, authors designed a novel approach named “Multi-Context Fusion Network (MCFN)”
    along with IoT deployments for crop diseased detection in wild. Kale and Sonavane
    [149], developed a smart and optimized smart fertilizing decision support system
    for smart farming. The authors addressed the problem of disproportion due to lack
    of judgment. Concepts of IoT and GA were used to design the system. An improved
    GA based multilevel parameter optimized feature selection algorithm for ELM classifier
    along with IoT was proposed in the designed system. The proposed system focuses
    on plant disease detection in a real-time environment. Khattab et al. [150], developed
    an IoT based cognitive automatic monitoring system for detecting the epidemic
    diseases in plants. By combining the concepts of artificial intelligence and prediction
    algorithms to develop the expert system, capable of predicting, analyzing, and
    decision making. A layered approach was used to design the model. Soil, leaf wetness,
    wind speed, and wind direction sensors were employed to gather the data. The model
    was tested on detection of the diseases like Late Blight, Early Blight, and Powdery
    Mildew in tomato and potato crops. Chen et al. [151], based on AI technologies
    and IoT, developed a system named “RiceTalk” for the detection of Blight diseases
    in the rice plant. AgriTalk model was used as a base model in this work to develop
    this system. Compared to AgriTalk, the authors used non-image IoT devices to design
    this model for disease detection. Devi et al. [152], proposed a simple and efficient
    IoT enabled solution for developing a system for automatic disease detection.
    Bunchy top of banana and Sigatoka diseases in the wild banana plant were detected
    and classified. Environmental parameters like soil moisture, temperature were
    measured with sensors and the IoT model was framed using the Raspberry PI hardware
    model. Data were classified using GLCM and RFC for disease detection. Kitpo and
    Inoue [153], developed an early disease detection system for rice crops disease
    detection. The drones based IoT architecture with real-time data collection capabilities
    was designed. For the mapping of drones on the fields, GPS sensors were used.
    The designed system is capable of displaying the analytical results and the position
    of the plant where the disease is present. Pawara et al. [154], studied the pomegranate
    diseases such as Bacterial Blight, Fruit Spot, Fruit Rot, and Leaf Spot. Developed
    a HMM and senor based model to early detect the disease and provide the solutions.
    Parameters like air temperature, leaf wetness, air humidity, and soil wetness
    were considered and studied for model design. For digital communication between
    field and farm GSM module was used. Truong et al. [155], real-time data monitoring
    capable system was designed with IoT and cloud storage for disease detection and
    recognition. The fungal diseases of rural crop fields with detected. Environmental
    data conditions such as humidity, temperature, wind speed, and rainfall were employed
    for designing decision support. A Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMr) model
    was used to classify the data. Jumat et al. [156], developed a cost-efficient
    and affordable smart farming prototype capable of detecting plant disease and
    proving decisions. For study and experimentation, Septoria plant disease was taken
    and studied for different stages right from outbreak to spread maturity. The system
    also possesses the web-enabled facilities for farmer support. Some studies of
    the articles incorporating IoT in fields related to disease detection are presented
    in TABLE 11. TABLE 11 Summary of IoT Based Developed Methods for Disease Detection
    SECTION V. Findings Several research articles related to the role and responses
    of the Internet of Things in agriculture have been studied. From the literature
    and studies, it can be seen that immense contribution has made by IoT in the field
    of agriculture starting from micro areas and moving over to macro environments.
    Internet of Things along with the concepts of cloud computing, cluster computing,
    wireless sensor networks and computer vision has revolutionized the field of monitoring,
    crop production, disease detection, and supply chain management. Since the domain
    of agriculture itself is a wide domain so considering the impact IoT has or can
    make on this field, the search was not restricted or limited to any area. The
    data acquisition for agriculture systems is a multidimensional approach. There
    are several fields in agriculture where IoT is applied e.g., crop monitoring,
    diseased detection, precision irrigation, supply chain, cattle grazing, and raising,
    etc. To design a precision approach, the target plays a very important role in
    data collection. From the existing studies it is found that mostly overall 90%
    of the data is self-acquired by the authors with the use of wireless sensors.
    This data included soil data, pH values, light, water, humidity, and images. In
    the case of crop disease detection, leaves were taken as the primary subject of
    study due to their ease of availability and quantity. Nearly 80% of the leaf data
    was self-acquired using digital cameras and web-enabled devices. However in some
    studies to validate their models, authors also used the existing standard ground
    truth databases available. Satellite imaging and remote sensing images were also
    taken to understand the demography and vegetative indexes of a region. UAV drones
    were the most used devices along with web-enabled digital cameras and mobile devices
    to capture the data in the form of images and also acted for providing real-time
    monitoring of device location in the fields. Certain issues and challenges are
    faced by the authors while capturing real-time images due to environmental and
    lighting conditions. To avoid these issues, laboratory-based testbeds such as
    greenhouses were developed and their data was acquired in a closed environment.
    From the literature, it is seen that, to develop the prototypes certain common
    parameters were taken for conducting the study irrespective of the problem to
    be addressed. Theses parameters included soil data, pH value, humidity level,
    moisture content, water content. After the analysis of the studies it was found
    that for any agricultural system to flourish all these parameters play a combined
    role. These parameters were most common for the problems addressing farm management,
    crop monitoring, and irrigation. However in certain other parameters like leaf
    wetness, salinity, disease severity, fertilizer ratio, plant height, CO2 content,
    mineral content, and conductivity were considered while addressing the specific
    problems like plant disease detection, smart irrigation, seedling germination,
    etc. These were the devices employed to collect the data. Depending upon the problem
    the authors addressed, different type of sensors were employed. For soil data
    collection, the contact method sensors such as hygrometers, or electrodes which
    penetrate the soil were used to collect soil information. While as in the case
    of the collection of soil information via tractors or vehicles non-contact soil
    sensors were employed. But for the studies it can be seen that contact method
    sensors are the most common devices used for soil data collection. In case of
    soil pH value and salinity electrochemical sensors are employed. In the case of
    soil nitrates, CO2, and fertilizer content, topsoil depth, biomass content, organic
    matter are measured. For water data collection, parameters like relative humidity,
    leakage of pipes, dissolved oxygen, nitrates, and other oxides were measured by
    the authors. To accomplish this various water sensors like ultrasonic sensors
    were employed to measure the water levels in the tanks, ponds, and farms. Temperature
    and humidity sensors were used to measure the temperature of water and humidity
    of soil for water content. In the case of plant leaves, the leaf wetness sensors
    were employed to understand the moisture content of the plants. Other than these
    sensors, neutron sensors, time travels sensors, and capacitance sensors are also
    employed by some authors for measuring the water levels. In the case of supply
    chain and cattle grazing, tags and biosensors were employed to gather the data.
    To develop the prototypes, the authors used the devices based on functional capabilities.
    From all the devices, Arduino and Raspberry Pi were the most desirable hardware
    platforms for the authors. Arduino was employed to tackle simple or sequential
    issues that do not require complex solutions. In the case of scenarios with complex
    environments, Raspberry Pi boards were employed due to their capability of addressing
    multiple problems at the same time. For functionalities that faced time issues,
    Raspberry Pi boards were employed. In the case of communication technologies,
    LoRa and ZigBee are the most commonly used communication technologies by the authors
    in the platform designs due to their capabilities of handling a multitude of solutions.
    Lora and ZigBee use GPS to enable and detect geo-locations. They are low cost
    and secure for data transmission. Other than these technologies, authors also
    made use of cloud and cluster computing to handle a large mass of data and provide
    on-spot solutions to the consumers. The authors performed the processing of data
    in different stages. At first preprocessing on data was performed to remove any
    kind of outliers or anomalies in the data. To remove the imperfect data, algorithms
    such as noise removal with Gaussian noise, salt and pepper noise, histogram equalization
    were commonly used for the preprocessing of image data. However in the case of
    numerical data missing value imputation, the banana dataset for noise reduction
    was employed. To obtain the optimal data from a given set of data, data reduction
    was performed. The data reduction approaches e.g., dimensionality reduction, attribute
    subset selection, numerosity reduction, etc. were employed by various authors.
    To make systems capable of taking decisions, several learning algorithms like
    GA, CNN, NN, SVM, PNN, GANs were used to train and test the models. From the literature,
    it is seen that most studies and experiments were performed in countries that
    have agricultural economies like the USA, China, India, Brazil, Australia, etc.
    Most of these countries are economically stable and first world countries. They
    have better infrastructure and service availability. Also only 20% of the studies
    were focused on real-time implementation of their prototypes which indicates that
    most of the experimentation was conducted in a closed environment. This pattern
    raises concerns on how these studies can be employed in real-time environments
    with low infrastructure and maintenance costs. The problem of power consumption
    was also addressed by some studies. However there were no comparisons and reasons
    given on how the dream of IoT can be made real for poor and self-financing farmers.
    Along with this, a few studies provided the cost estimation for the deployment
    of the models. In the Fig. 7, the percentage distribution and contribution of
    IoT in different fields of agriculture are shown. From the figure it can be seen
    that more extensive studies are conducted in the field of crop monitoring. FIGURE
    7. Percentage contribution of IoT in different fields of agriculture. Show All
    These studies and analysis put forth by different articles show that current/existing
    solutions have incorporated IoT to solve several challenges in the agricultural
    domain. With the incorporation of these technologies, a large number of challenges/factors
    for improvement have emerged. Along with the study of factors for improvement,
    future research directions, applications are also highlighted. The sections below
    explain the factors for improvement and the futuristic research directions. A.
    Challenges Despite the growth achieved by IoT over the past few decades, there
    still exist some conceptual, fundamental, and developmental issues. 1) Cost Designing
    a cost-optimized model is still a difficulty faced by many authors. Scientists
    are focusing on developing cost-efficient systems by reducing the hardware and
    software requirements in IoT deployments. Economic differences of countries make
    it difficult for farmers to deploy devices and technology. So, it is important
    to develop some economic models. 2) Standardization To fully utilize the technology
    for large range of applications, standardization of devices is essential. The
    present or current mechanisms do not confirm any standardization formats either
    for the data and process representation. Deprived of the cordial use of the semantic
    ontologies, machine-readable codes result in output differences due to misinterpretation
    and alterations from time to time. With standardization the interoperability issues
    of the devices, applications, systems and products can be solved. 3) Heterogeneity
    While designing a system, heterogeneous devices are used. Every device differs
    in processes and services requirements. In the case of agriculture, most models
    perform with heterogeneous devices, so it is important to create interaction between
    heterogeneous modules and communication technologies. Because of heterogeneity,
    the complexity of the network increases, and sometimes falsified results may appear.
    4) Accessibility For developing any farming decision support system based on IoT
    technology and other devices, the demand for availability of existing software
    and hardware to be present anywhere any time is a must thing. These problems need
    to be addressed to ensure the availability of services anywhere and anytime. Lack
    of availability of the required equipment can result in chaos and delay in the
    services. 5) Adaptability While designing a model, especially for precision farming,
    it is pertinent for the devices to be adaptable with the other devices and the
    surroundings. Since the environmental conditions keep varying and also sometimes
    due to certain communication or hardware issues certain devices are not adaptable
    with each other. 6) Energy Optimization Energy is the most emerging issue in IoT
    systems, WSNs, and other devices for their communication. Till now conventional
    sources of energy have been supporting the designing and working models. But due
    to an increase in devices, the consumption of conventional energy is not a reliable
    solution. Non-conventional sources of energy like solar, wind, water energy harvesting
    schemes should also be tested, but they haven’t been of much success and new methodologies
    should be developed to employ them for model development. 7) Compatibility To
    achieve the standards of fragmentation and scalability, the developed models or
    software should be flexible and should run on any machine. 8) Reliability For
    successful and smooth working, reliability is a major concern for IoT devices
    in terms of data transmission. The devices need to gather and transfer reliable
    data as based on the data received and interpreted, the decisions are made. Reliability
    is still a challenge due to system failures, node failures, battery issues, or
    other interventions. 9) Mobility Generally the systems or models developed are
    static. For smooth implementation of the framework, there should be mobility as
    most of the devices and applications are mobile. In mobile models, the issue of
    maintaining connectivity is still a difficult task. 10) Environmental Conditions
    In agriculture there are different landforms. So it becomes difficult to adapt
    to those changes, and this also jeopardizes data and services. This alters the
    accuracy of a system. 11) Real-Time Deployment Most of the studies put forward
    are not employed or tested in a real-time testbed. So before deploying a system
    or model, real-time analysis is a must, to avoid post-deployment losses. B. Improvements
    Since the growth of IoT is remarkable in the field of agriculture, certain improvements
    can be included in the growth and developmental state to make the systems and
    models more efficient, reliable, and business-oriented. 1) Warding Off the Performance
    Degradation Generally while developing systems, customer interaction or input
    is not taken. As the models serve a variety of customers from dynamic backgrounds,
    therefore their input must be taken while developing the models. This way the
    performance hazards and chaos that occurs on the filed can be avoided. 2) Sharing
    Rich Data Globally In almost all, the IoT based models designed for precision
    farming, the data sharing while integrating and mapping the system design should
    be encouraged. This can lead to the development of an interactive model globally.
    This feature can also help in understanding the topographic and demographic challenges
    of various regions on a global level. Thus the suitable solutions can be designed
    with those working in resource-constrained environments. 3) Moving Towards High-Speed
    Communication The communication domain itself is witnessing a progressive and
    dynamic shift. Since the IoT models are remotely located, so better communication
    is a prerequisite. Therefore it is important to consider high-speed communication
    strategies like 5G, for making the devices more reachable with lesser delays.
    4) Cost Analytic Studies for Model Design With the incumbent of IoT in agriculture,
    a variety of models are designed for addressing different domains such as irrigation,
    farm management, disease detection, and crop monitoring, etc. While designing
    the models various case studies are performed. As the development cost of models
    for these cases varies from country to country i.e., in first world countries
    there will be the different cost of devices and in second and third world countries
    it will be different. Therefore a model cost analysis will provide an idea of
    the purchasing power and investment a farmer from these varied economic regions
    can invest to develop a model. Also this can result in seeking or considering
    other cheaper and efficient ways to develop models. C. Future Research Directions
    With the advancement in the development of precision agriculture platforms with
    IoT and other technologies, the development of new applications or research areas
    is envisioned. After the study of the literature, certain potential concepts and
    futuristic research directions are listed and discussed below: Design of platforms
    in a user-friendly manner (from farmers’ perspective and ease of using) using
    Artificial Intelligence and other learning tools. Farmer’s perspective here means
    that an audit should be done well before designing the prototype. From this study
    a clear insight and differences between the requirements of the farmers and farming
    systems across the globe can be understood. To develop concepts and methodologies
    based on multidimensional aspects like science, expertise, experience, industry,
    etc. Energy harvesting or power optimization methodologies should be developed
    to reduce the cost of production, maintenance, and fault tolerance. It is evident
    that mostly the farms be it small or large, require power and energy for the working
    of devices. In most of the cases, the power to the devices is supplied from the
    main line or the power grid. But this is not a sustainable and efficient method.
    Thus in order to make farms self-reliant, the energy harvesting or power optimization
    approaches should be developed or incorporated while designing of the models.
    Induction of cloud sources for data gathering and processing in a reliable, systematic,
    and scientific manner. Develop systems that can withstand variable soil and environmental
    conditions. Since the agricultural environments are harsh and keep on changing
    with change in climatic conditions or seasons. So it is essential to develop systems
    which can be robust and sustainable to the changes in the external as well as
    internal factors. Development of user or farmer friendly apps for monitoring crop
    and plant health. Mostly farmers come different ethnic and linguistic backgrounds.
    So due to this their level of understanding and ways to perform agricultural tasks
    is also different. It is important to develop frameworks considering the native
    language of a region into consideration so the farmer and machine interaction
    can be improved. This will enhance enable the acceptance of precision farming
    methods easy as it can be seen some areas are reluctant to adopt due to this linguistic
    and understanding problems. Development of efficient sensor-based systems for
    high elevation areas. High elevation areas mostly have undulating surfaces and
    also in most of the countries, supply of power to these areas is still a dream.
    Form the literature, it can be seen that these areas have not been targeted for
    precision farming instead of being resource deficient. Therefore deployment and
    design of sensor based systems in these areas opens a scope in future of precision
    farming. Usage of previous and existential scientific data for the development
    of decision support systems in farming. Generally for designing the precision
    farming models, the primary data is considered. However for designing cost efficient
    and reliable models, the previous case studies and deployment models should be
    considered for the study. This means a collaborative model development methodology
    should be developed for understanding the nature of the work. To recognize various
    plant species using mixed data sets or heterogeneous data. Design of a portable
    and sustainable farming equipment control systems for large as well as small farms.
    Mostly from the study it can be seen that first world countries are welcoming
    in PA approaches while as in most third world and other nations, this concept
    is still in avoidance due to cost and shelf life of products and equipment’s.
    Development of reliable supply chain management methods for precision farming.
    D. Applications of IoT in Agriculture IoT has revolutionized the world of agriculture,
    and a manifold of application can be derivative of implementation of the Internet
    of Things in agriculture. These applications are a resultant of the architectural
    design chosen. These applications have been categorized and differentiated based
    on the subject they focus on and also the service they provide. The major sectional
    areas where IoT is applicable in agriculture are- observation, data collection
    and corroboration, governing, and management. Most of these fields work collaboratively,
    and all the applications involve at least two of these sections. All these sections
    are described below and TABLE 12 presents various IoT applications in agriculture.
    TABLE 12 Applications of IoT in Agriculture 1) Observation It is also called monitoring
    as the main aim of this section is to discern the working of various models, devices,
    applications, etc. With the incubation of the concept of IoT, it is the first
    and foremost stage to be smeared. In this phase, all the devices and equipment
    that are placed strategically are monitored for their work. Sensors, are the major
    deployment and data collection tools engaged in this phase for data collection
    of various field and non-field parameters. Monitoring the certain parameters,
    like soil salinity, pH value, volumetric water content by using various soil sensors
    and other essential parameters such leaf wetness sensors, color, humidity, etc.
    helps in the development of systems capable of performing following operations
    e.g., calculation of leaf area index, leaf health, leaf color, plant growth and
    aid in the development of automatic plant recognition systems. Other devices like
    water sensors aid in the monitoring of irrigation levels and requirements of the
    fields. Thus with such devices, smart irrigation scheduling systems are developed.
    Also with the gas sensors, remote monitoring devices such as UAV devices or images
    with hyperspectral reflectance properties, help in the estimation of biomass,
    nitrogen, carbon, and other essential gases content. This data can also be used
    to find the vegetative indexes of the filed or large demography. Heavy-duty vehicles
    such as thrashers, tractors, trucks etc., also need supervision and can use data
    analytics for farm management. Robots, autonomous vehicles, agricultural drones
    other equipment also need to be monitored remotely for better farm supervision.
    Livestock monitoring with the aid of IoT is also an important subject for precision
    farming. It includes cattle monitoring remotely using tags. Labour is also a major
    area of concern for precision farming. Since human intervention is generally prone
    to errors due to differences in understanding, decision making, and methodologies
    applied to solve a particular problem. Also the induction of human labor is cost-intensive.
    Therefore, with the application of IoT, human interference can be minimized and
    a network can be set up for monitoring thus reducing the errors and cost. 2) Data
    Collection and Corroboration Data is the main constituent of precision farming.
    It acts as both base and catalyst in the whole process. With IoT, a large number
    of data is collected in varying forms and formats. Sensors, cameras, and various
    other nodes aid in the collection of data. In precision agriculture, based on
    the nature of the problem, the IoT network can be designed and formulated to collect
    different types of data. After the data is collected, the corroboration also called
    documentation of the data is very important for better understanding. Corroboration
    is a natural application of collected data, but certain additions of different
    samples such as manual or machine integration are also seen. Data once collected
    needs to be refined and understood, labeled, and thus documented in a certain
    format. Documentation or corroboration of data helps in formulating statistical
    analysis and developing the decision support systems. Remote sensing charts and
    other crop assessing tools can be employed to understand the total crop yield
    of a particular region. Crop management can also be optimized using corroborating
    data. A yearly or term analysis can be performed on this data to improve precision
    farming. Food chain supply management can use the predictive analysis of this
    data for optimizing and designing new efficient strategies. The major areas where
    its application is seen are yield mapping for fertilization planning, field planning,
    agro-food traceability, site-specific measurements based on soil and water analysis,
    and remote vehicle monitoring for supply chains, etc. 3) Foretelling Also called
    forecasting is one of the major attributes or applications for decision making
    that is brought in agriculture with the introduction of IoT. With the IoT devices
    and network, real-time data analysis along with the comparison to the previously
    available datasets helps in the forecasting of the upcoming events in much advance.
    With this foretelling, various decision support systems can be designed capable
    of taking optimal and real time-decisions. It can also act as a preventive measure
    mechanism for avoiding or dealing with various upcoming unprecedented situations.
    With monitoring, data collection, and corroboration, foretelling can help in early
    disease detection, pest growth, weeding, drought, smart irrigation, and harvesting.
    Artificial intelligence can be employed for designing these learning systems.
    With IoT, a predictive analysis could be made way earlier than the harvest period
    for assessing crop production and consumption. Pre and post-harvest crop monitoring
    along with behavioral sciences and market analysis can also be employed to help
    site-specific farming and production increase in precision agriculture in the
    context of IoT. 4) Governing and Management It is an outcome of the monitoring
    device. Governing helps in controlling the whole system. Foretelling also plays
    a major role in governing. With IoT, it is important to govern the farm. Thresholds
    play a major role in designing a controlling strategy. Controlling is a major
    addendum of IoT in agriculture. Applications of controlling can be easily seen
    in site-specific management, working of smart irrigation models, plant growth
    monitoring models, and early crop analysis models and also in supply chain and
    smart vehicular navigation, interaction, optimization, and logistics control of
    farms. With governing, all the new strategies, formulae, practices and methods
    employed to solve the problems occurring on daily basis in farms can be monitored.
    These strategies can then be compared and analysed with the previous existential
    strategies. Therefore a knowledge base can be maintained. From the data analysis
    of that knowledge base, the best or the optimal strategies that can be employed
    to design or mould the system can be fetched. Various case studies can be performed
    to gather and test such information. From this the redundant techniques can be
    withdrawn and robust ones can be prioritised. With these methodologies and experiments,
    the management can be made more flexible, scalable and reliable. Also governing
    and management can be employed to find the best suited solutions. Due to the growth
    in agriculture sector, various public and private sector projects and startups
    are being started in various countries across the world. All these projects use
    artificial intelligence and IoT concepts to provide support and solutions to the
    growing industry of agriculture. All these projects or startups are explained
    in the TABLE 13. TABLE 13 IoT Based Public and Private Sector Projects/Startups
    for Precision Agriculture E. Our Proposed Work Inspired by the contribution of
    IoT in the field of agriculture, we proposed an architecture for precision farming.
    The layout of the architecture to be designed is proposed and shown in Fig. 8.
    The structure proposed for precision farming in case of farm management will constitute
    of different layers. The first layer would be the sensing layer, in which different
    types of sensors like soil, humidity, water, light, proximity, and conductive
    sensors will be deployed in the region of experimentation. All data from the sensors
    will be sent to the base station. The second layer is the network layer, which
    consists of gateways, internet, and other devices. This layer manages the traffic
    of the whole architecture. This layer collects data from the sensing layer and
    transfers it to the decision layer and the application layer. The third layer
    is the decision layer, which processes the data, manipulates it, and generates
    alerts or actions. The next layer is the application layer, which constitutes
    the firmware and the users. It receives all the inputs from other layers and the
    outputs are made visible to users. It also manages how the whole architecture
    will work or look. FIGURE 8. Proposed layered architecture for Precision Agriculture.
    Show All Our proposed architecture aims to observe and monitor the farm in real-time.
    Optimize the resource utilization, early detection of the diseases, and identification
    of the plant species, optimize irrigation facilities, and make definite use of
    pesticides and other manures. Monitor the growth of plants in each stage and take
    the necessary actions for the betterment of plants. The model to be designed will
    take into consideration the earning and investment of the small scale farmer.
    A scalable and cost efficient model will be designed by considering the reusability
    and recycling of the materials used. From the literature, it is found that the
    issue of interoperability and robustness is still not achieved. So, while designing
    the model these issues will be prioritized. Also, power supply and power consumption
    is a bottleneck for each model. So, from the literature it is found that energy
    harnessing approaches can be used to address this issue. In the proposed model,
    main focus will be on incorporating the concepts of energy harnessing approaches
    like solar energy and wind flow energy for power optimization. Harnessing solar
    energy for regions which have different season’s e.g., Kashmir, which has four
    seasons like spring, summer, autumn and winter throughout the year. So for these
    regions depending only on solar energy will be a bottle neck. Therefore, in the
    proposed work, a hybrid approach based on consumption of both wind and solar energy
    for reducing power consumption will be proposed. Some of the major findings of
    the proposed work will be: A scalable and cost efficient model will be designed
    by considering the reusability and recycling of materials used. The issues of
    interoperability and robustness issues of heterogeneous devices will be targeted.
    Power supply and power consumption being the bottleneck of each model will be
    targeted. To tackle such issues, energy conservation and energy harnessing approaches
    like solar and wind energy will be used. Harnessing solar energy for regions which
    have different season’s e.g., Kashmir, which has four seasons like spring, summer,
    autumn and winter throughout the year. So for these regions depending only on
    solar energy will be a bottle neck. Therefore in the proposed work, a hybrid approach
    based on consumption of both wind and solar energy for reducing power consumption
    will be proposed. Small scale farmers will be targeted for the development of
    sustainable and robust model. SECTION VI. Conclusion The Internet is revolutionizing
    our world. Communication via connective devices has become the countenance of
    survival. Agriculture is growing from precision farming to micro-farming. IoT
    has added more potential to communication by enabling the communication between
    humans and objects along with the environmental aspects. Seeking the vision of
    omnipresence i.e., anytime, anything, anywhere, everywhere, IoT should be considered
    a core for the development of new architectural concepts. Resource scarcity is
    a must address issue in precision agriculture and models should be developed to
    optimize resource utilization. Inclusion of monitoring in food supply chains,
    farms, greenhouses equipped with tags, WSN, etc. at each stage in the growth of
    the product/plant, making automatic reasoning via intelligent analysis and responses
    is moving towards much safer, secure, and trustworthy systems. In the article,
    firstly the agriculture sector along with its challenges and economic importance
    is presented. The domain of IoT along with the communication technologies and
    goals, protocols, architectures are studied and put forward. The various IoT OS,
    their specifications and features with respect to agriculture are discussed. An
    analytic study of various articles in the field of agriculture is presented, highlighting
    their most focused sections and gaps or areas not addressed. The sensors based

    precision farming a base, a layout of an IoT based architecture is proposed. The
    communication technologies and the hardware platforms of IoT are also discussed.

    \ of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) in agricul-\nture includes the low replicability\
    \ and the corresponding difﬁculty in systematic data gathering, as\nno two ﬁelds\
    \ are exactly alike. Therefore, the comparison of several pilot experiments in\
    \ different\nﬁelds, weather conditions and farming techniques enhances the collective\
    \ knowledge. Thus, this\nwork provides a summary of the most recent research activities\
    \ in the form of research projects\nimplemented and validated by the authors in\
    \ several European countries, with the objective of pre-\nsenting the already\
    \ achieved results, the current investigations and the still open technical challenges.\n\
    As an overall conclusion, it can be mentioned that even though in their primary\
    \ stages in some\ncases, AI technologies improve decision support at farm level,\
    \ monitoring conditions and optimizing\nproduction to allow farmers to apply the\
    \ optimal number of inputs for each crop, thereby boosting\nyields and reducing\
    \ water use and greenhouse gas emissions. Future extensions of this work will\n\
    include new concepts based on autonomous and intelligent robots for plant and\
    \ soil sample retrieval,\nand effective livestock management.\nKeywords: agriculture;\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence; data analysis; computer vision; robotics\n1. Introduction\n\
    The information of interest in the agricultural sector consists of traits or features\
    \ of\nsystems that vary in space and time. Understanding how to manage agricultural\
    \ processes\nimplies considering many hundreds if not thousands of variables.\
    \ Thus, agriculture is\none of the most difﬁcult ﬁelds for statistical quantiﬁcation.\
    \ Even within a single ﬁeld,\nconditions are always changing from one section\
    \ to the next. The weather is hard to predict,\nthe quality of the soil changes\
    \ and there is always the possibility of pests and diseases.\nTraditionally, many\
    \ of these traits have been managed by the own experience and expertise\nof the\
    \ farmers. Although they may think the prospects for an upcoming harvest are good,\n\
    the outcome is always uncertain until the harvest day arrives.\nPrecision agriculture\
    \ (PA) is seen today as a key technological solution enabling the\nmore efﬁcient\
    \ use of agricultural resources. General goals of PA are the increase of farmers’\n\
    proﬁts by improving harvest and/or quality yields, while reducing inputs, and\
    \ the negative\nAgronomy 2021, 11, 1227. https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11061227\n\

    \ of farming on the environment, e.g., such that stems from the over-application\
    \ of\npesticides and fertilizers, and inefﬁcient irrigation.\nThe emergence of\
    \ new technological trends like artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) enables\nfarmers to\
    \ take a data-driven approach to collect and analyze large amounts of data\nto\
    \ gain knowledge about the real-time status of their ﬁelds to improve farm yield\
    \ and\nmitigate risks from weeds, pests, and diseases. The development of intelligent\
    \ sensors,\ninstrumentation and machines is beginning to play a crucial role in\
    \ agricultural systems,\nwhich are affected by several factors such as environmental\
    \ conditions, soil characteristics,\nwater availability, harvesting practices,\
    \ plant diseases, weeds, and other pests. In the\nnear future, the integration\
    \ of automated data collection and analysis, AI algorithms and\ndecision support\
    \ tools will provide advanced tools towards PA. Moreover, robotic systems,\non\
    \ the ground and in the air, will also have a major role in bringing PA and digitalization\n\
    to the ﬁeld, for harvesting, pest control or data collection, just to name a few.\n\
    This paper explains how data-driven AI applications are key enablers for PA in\
    \ several\nEuropean countries. First, the paper summarizes several deﬁnitions\
    \ about terms and con-\ncepts related to PA; describes global trends and policies\
    \ that will foster the implementation\nof the AI-based solutions in the agricultural\
    \ sector; provides an overview of the current\nstate-of-the-art regarding the\
    \ application of AI technologies within the PA. Secondly, the\npaper provides\
    \ a summary of the most recent research activities in the form of research\nprojects\
    \ implemented and validated by the authors in several European countries, with\
    \ the\nobjective of showing the already achieved results, the current investigations\
    \ and the still\nopen technical challenges. Finally, several conclusions and future\
    \ works are presented.\n2. Artiﬁcial Intelligence for Precision Agriculture\n\
    2.1. Global Trends\nFrom ending poverty and hunger to responding to climate change\
    \ and sustaining\nnatural resources, agriculture is a key component in the 2030\
    \ Agenda for Sustainable\nDevelopment to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals\
    \ (SGD), as it can be said that\nagriculture is the common thread which holds\
    \ the 17 SDGs together. Despite greater\nproductivity, the agricultural sector\
    \ faces new challenges that threaten human civilization\nworldwide. With a growing\
    \ population and the complexity of climate change, the sector\nhas been forced\
    \ to transition away from industrial methods to data-driven management\nand automation\
    \ to grow more food while using fewer precious resources.\nIn Europe, the Farm\
    \ to Fork Strategy presented in the ﬁrst quarter of 2020 plays a key\nrole to\
    \ achieve the goals of the EU’s Green Deal, which sets out how to make the continent\n\
    climate-neutral by 2050 [1]. It ﬁxes the measures needed to create more efﬁcient,\
    \ climate-\nsmart agricultural systems that provide healthy food, while securing\
    \ a decent living for\nEU farmers. The Strategy targets a signiﬁcant reduction\
    \ of the dependency, risk and use of\nchemical pesticides, as well as of fertilizers;\
    \ an increase in the EU’s land area dedicated to\norganic farming; the development\
    \ of innovative farming techniques that protect harvest\nfrom pests and diseases;\
    \ the reduction of the carbon footprint and water pollution.\nTo achieve the objectives\
    \ of both the SDGs and the Farm to Folk Strategy, European\nfarmers need to transform\
    \ their production methods more quickly and make the best use of\nnature-based,\
    \ technological, digital and space-based solutions to optimize their inputs (e.g.,\n\
    water, pesticides, fertilizers) and deliver better climate and environmental results.\
    \ Such a\nnew paradigm will only be possible with the adoption of technological\
    \ applications and\nsolutions that are driven by the convergence of several fundamental\
    \ technologies, which\nkeep a farm productive and proﬁtable by collecting and\
    \ analyzing data to help farmers\nmanage their resources, produce better crops\
    \ while optimizing energy and chemical use\nand mitigating risk.\n2.2. What Is\
    \ Precision Agriculture (PA)?\nIn the context of digitization in agriculture,\
    \ two concepts are usually mentioned:\nprecision farming and smart farming. On\
    \ the one hand, the former can be deﬁned as “an\nAgronomy 2021, 11, 1227\n3 of\
    \ 14\ninformation-led management concept in both plant and animal production that\
    \ is based\non a wide range of technologies”. This concept is based on digital\
    \ processing of speciﬁc\ninformation so it can support decision making processes.\
    \ On the other hand, the latter\nrelates to a “knowledge-based approach in which\
    \ machines can at least take partially\nautonomous decisions in collaboration\
    \ with management systems. The decisions taken\nby machines are based on autonomously\
    \ obtained and processed information in real-time,\neven though farmers always\
    \ have the possibility to correct them” [2].\nMoreover, the PA concept has also\
    \ gained ground in the European Union as a “farm-\ning management concept based\
    \ upon observing, measuring and responding to inter and\nintra-ﬁeld variability\
    \ in crops or in aspects of animal rearing” [3]. PA brings about a\nchange in\
    \ the land use, by fostering “whole-farm management strategies using information\n\
    technology, highlighting the potential improvements on production while reducing\
    \ envi-\nronmental impacts”. Yost et al. simpliﬁed this deﬁnition and described\
    \ PA as a “suite of\nInformation Technologies that focus on producing immediate\
    \ beneﬁts by being conscious\nof the environment” [4]. Moreover, Lezoche et al.\
    \ have deﬁned the term “Agriculture 4.0”\nas “the provision of advanced technologies\
    \ to farmers to meet their production challenges”\nby establishing the linkages\
    \ between new 4.0 trends in technologies and agri-food supply\nchain challenges\
    \ [5].\nRegardless of the term used, it is undeniable that digitization is leading\
    \ to on- and off-\nfarm management tasks that focus on different data sources\
    \ (location, weather, phytosani-\ntary status, inputs consumption, prices) using\
    \ sensors, machines, unmanned autonomous\nvehicles (UAV) and satellites to monitor\
    \ soil, water, plants and humans. Obtained data\ncan be used to make more informed\
    \ decisions and to reduce uncertainty when predicting\nthe future.\n2.3. AI in\
    \ Precision Agriculture (PA)\nCurrent adoption rate of AI technologies in the\
    \ agricultural sector is not high due to\ndistinct factors among which a lack\
    \ of knowledge on its real use plays an important role.\nTherefore, several studies\
    \ have focused on the identiﬁcation of the main AI technologies\nused in PA as\
    \ well as documented implementations.\nLiakos et al. have presented a comprehensive\
    \ review of research dedicated to applica-\ntions of machine learning (ML) in\
    \ agricultural production systems [6]. The key ﬁelds of\napplication were categorized\
    \ into crop management, water management, and soil man-\nagement. They concluded\
    \ that it is undeniable that agriculture will beneﬁt from ML\ntechnologies, which\
    \ will allow Farm Management Systems to evolve into real-time decision\nsupport\
    \ systems (DSS) thanks to the application of AI algorithms.\nFurthermore, van\
    \ Klompenburg, Kassahun and Catal have performed a systematic\nliterature review\
    \ (SLR) about the ML algorithms and features used in crop yield prediction\nstudies\
    \ [7]. The results show that no speciﬁc conclusion can be drawn as to what the\
    \ best\nmodel is, but they clearly show that some ML models such as the random\
    \ forest, neural\nnetworks, linear regression, and gradient boosting tree are\
    \ used more than the others.\nAdditionally, Noon et al. have presented a large\
    \ survey of the application of deep\nlearning (DL) techniques for plant leaf stress\
    \ identiﬁcation [8]. The techniques reviewed\nwere divided in vegetables, fruits\
    \ and other crops on the basis of stress type, size of dataset,\ntraining/test\
    \ size and the deep network used. Several research gaps have been identiﬁed,\n\
    such as the detection and classiﬁcation of all severity levels of a stress to\
    \ detect contagious\ndiseases, or the generalization of algorithms to different\
    \ crops.\nFinally, AI and robotics are playing a key role in helping or substituting\
    \ manual\nintervention in the agricultural sector, which covers a large application\
    \ panel. On the one\nhand, robotics has played a key role in agricultural production\
    \ and management, so robots\nare performing several operations autonomously such\
    \ as weeding, irrigating or managing\nindividual plants. Zhang et al. have provided\
    \ a detailed summary of the state-of-the-art\nrobotic grippers, grasping and sensor-based\
    \ control methods, as well as their applications\nin robotic agricultural tasks\
    \ [9]. Compared to industrial grasping, higher requirements\nAgronomy 2021, 11,\
    \ 1227\n4 of 14\nof grasping in agriculture are rising since most of the food\
    \ and agricultural products are\nalways fragile, easily marked or bruised, adhesive\
    \ or/and slippery.\nOn the other hand, drones are being implemented in agriculture\
    \ for crop health\nmonitoring, irrigation equipment monitoring or weed identiﬁcation.\
    \ Roshanianfard et al.\ndescribed different aspects of autonomous agricultural\
    \ vehicles that have been developed\nat Hokkaido University [10]. The development\
    \ procedures and characteristics of each\nunmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) were compared\
    \ and discussed. Case studies of autonomous\nvehicles designed and the development\
    \ process have been presented as practical cases and\nrepresentative development\
    \ challenges.\nIn last years, the EU has actively undertaken R&D activities related\
    \ to the application\nof AI for the digitization of agriculture. For example,\
    \ Bacco et al. provided a survey\nof the most recent research activities with\
    \ two main contributions: a survey of relevant\nresearch projects recently funded\
    \ by the EU in the ﬁeld of PA; a review of the scientiﬁc\nworks that propose solutions\
    \ for its implementation [11]. Regarding the former, they aim at\nhighlighting\
    \ the increasing attention towards those research activities and the identiﬁcation\n\
    of the involved technologies.\nHowever, to the best of the authors’ knowledge,\
    \ there are no recent surveys of research\nactivities at European level related\
    \ to the application of AI technologies for the agricultural\nsector. Following\
    \ the approach from Bacco et al., this paper aims at providing an updated\nversion\
    \ of several European research projects that have been or are being run by the\
    \ authors.\nTaken together, these examples represent the current abilities and\
    \ future potential for AI\napplications in European agricultural research projects.\n\
    3. Results of the European Research Projects\nLow replicability and the corresponding\
    \ difﬁculty in systematic data gathering is a\nkey challenge in agriculture, as\
    \ no two ﬁelds are exactly alike. Therefore, the comparison\nof several pilot\
    \ experiments in different ﬁelds, weather conditions and farming techniques\n\
    can enhance the collective knowledge. Thus, this section provides a summary of\
    \ the\nmost recent research activities in the form of research projects implemented\
    \ and validated\nby the authors in several European countries, with the objective\
    \ of showing the already\nachieved results, the current investigations and the\
    \ still open technical challenges. Figure 1\ndepicts relevant agricultural operations\
    \ faced by the research projects, and the AI-based\ntechnological solutions for\
    \ each of those projects. The objectives, methodologies and\nmaterial used are\
    \ different for each of the research projects, and when available, can be\nfurther\
    \ assessed from the existing references.\n3.1. AI-Based Data Fusion for Crop Monitoring\n\
    Data collection from agricultural areas related to soil watering, plant health\
    \ or pest\ninfestation often relies on manual inspection due to insufﬁcient capturing\
    \ methods and\nmissing aggregation of different data sources. However, thanks\
    \ to the increasing dig-\nitization of the sector, the fusion of remote sensing\
    \ for automated scanning and data\nanalysis with other sources of information\
    \ (soil analyses, weather forecasts) and powerful\nAI algorithms is leading to\
    \ a reduction in the application of fertilizers and pesticides.\nIn this context,\
    \ the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy has\nrecently funded\
    \ the large scale NaLamKI initiative, which aims at developing a cloud-\nbased\
    \ Software as a Service (SaaS) platform with open interfaces for providers from\
    \ the\nupstream and downstream sectors of agriculture, industry, and service providers\
    \ for special\napplications in crop production. The initiative aims at the creation\
    \ of a dataset by the fusion\nof sensor data from machines, remote sensing (satellites\
    \ and drones), soil, weather and\nother existing data sources [12], so that agricultural\
    \ processes like irrigation, fertilization,\nor pest control can be optimized\
    \ thanks to the application of advanced AI methodologies.\nAgronomy 2021, 11,\

    \ Finally, powerful AI algorithms will fuse the data and \nextract information\

    \ the\nacceptance by partners and farmers.\n3.2. Agricultural Digital Twins for\
    \ Geospatial Monitoring\nWithin the manufacturing domain, the digital twin (DT)\
    \ concept allows for testing\nhypotheses through simulations, establishing continuous\
    \ monitoring and implementing\nmeasures for management and maintenance. Although\
    \ agriculture cannot be compared\none-to-one with a factory production line, this\
    \ concept can be extended to fulﬁl similar\nexpectations as in the Industry 4.0.\n\
    An agricultural DT [15] represents a generic key component for agricultural applica-\n\
    tions to build up a reliable database for plantations and ﬁelds, to increase accuracy\
    \ and\ncoverage of crop prediction, and to signiﬁcantly reduce costs and time\
    \ expenditure. Acting\nas a virtual replica of the physical system, the DT provides\
    \ the ability to examine complex\nscenarios which involve multiple, intertwined\
    \ factors at once. Limited existing use cases\ninclude, for example, the ability\
    \ to take measurements ranging from phenotype traits to\nplantation inventory,\
    \ the generation of precise weed control maps, or the control of the\nevolution\
    \ of the assets over time.\nAgronomy 2021, 11, 1227\n6 of 14\nA distinctive characteristic\
    \ of a DT in agriculture lies on the spatio-temporal dimen-\nsion of its operation,\
    \ as it ranges from individual plants to twins of land parcels, farms or\nregions\
    \ [16]. Thus, one of the key concepts required for geospatial DT consists in ﬁnding\n\
    adequate feature spaces for geospatial entities. As a basis for so-called “Spatial\
    \ Digital\nTwins”, 3D point clouds can be deﬁned as a universal digital 3D representation\
    \ for environ-\nments in almost all geoscale ranges. They are characterized by\
    \ their enormous data volume\nand lack of semantics, so that their added value\
    \ is often limited to manual evaluation and\ninterpretation (e.g., by surveying\
    \ ofﬁces). However, a single point of the 3D point cloud\ndoes not allow constructing\
    \ meaningful feature vectors.\nTherefore, geospatial AI algorithms based on ML\
    \ and DL have been implemented in\nthe German project DEAL to automatically derive\
    \ vegetation objects from 3D point clouds\nso that a fully automatic workﬂow that\
    \ generates an agricultural DT can be implemented\n(Figure 2) [17]. In such context,\
    \ geospatial AI offers manifold ways to “distil” object-based\ninformation from\
    \ 3D point clouds, as ML and DL algorithms are able to identify and\ninterpret\
    \ orchards and tree plantations, including the whole range of what constitutes\n\
    “trees” and “vegetation” (e.g., “crooked trees”, “ﬂat bushes”, “diseased trees”,\
    \ etc.).\n \nAn agricultural DT [15] represents a generic key component for agricultural\

    \ Use\nThe European project Internet of Food and Farm 2020 (IoF2020) explores\
    \ the potential\nof the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies for the European\
    \ food and farming industry\nto make precision farming a reality [18]. IoT-driven\
    \ PA enables farmers to optimize\ntheir operating tasks to increase crop yields\
    \ and to minimize costs of inputs such as\nwater, fertilizer, insecticides, and\
    \ herbicides. The project has implemented the QUHOMA\nplatform [19], a smart irrigation\
    \ solution developed as a FIWARE-backed end application\n(Figure 3). The irrigation\
    \ schedule is calculated by a complex event processing (CEP) AI\napproach based\
    \ on current algorithms used for irrigation. This approach relies on the daily\n\
    accumulated sensor data. Therefore, if the data stream were interrupted or inaccurate\n\
    due to malfunction or failure of the sensors, and/or loss of connection during\
    \ long-time\nperiods, calculations would deviate from the optimized target.\n\

    \ \n \nFigure 3. Sensors and components of the QUHOMA platform. \nTo overcome\
    \ these limitations, the project has implemented AI-based predictive an-\nalytics\
    \ that fuse the gathered datasets with other public data sources to train models.\
    \ As \na result, data customized to the field are generated and used as a workaround\
    \ for the \nfollowing two scenarios. On the one hand, sensor data streams may\
    \ become unavailable \nfor a period longer than the estimated tolerance threshold\
    \ of the CEP algorithm. In this \ncase, accumulated historical data from sensors\
    \ and previously defined irrigation sched-\nules are used to calculate the irrigation\
    \ schedule. On the other hand, sensor data may be \ninaccurate. Thus, predictive\
    \ analytics based on the historical data can detect anomalies in \nthe values\
    \ of the sensor data (e.g., when stream data values are not in the estimated ac-\n\
    ceptable value span) and use this information for the proactive maintenance of\
    \ the af-\nfected sensors. \nReal-life irrigation experiments started in 2020\
    \ in Cyprus and Slovenia. The objec-\ntives and methodology of the pilots are\
    \ available in [20]. As an example, an experiment \nwas conducted during a crop\
    \ session of strawberries (approx. 100 days), planted in a tun-\nnel farm with\
    \ Clay Loam soil in the coastal Ammochostos district in Cyprus (Figure 4). In\
    \ \norder to perform this experiment, critical values of the climate zone, ETo\
    \ (reference evap-\notranspiration), ETc (crop evapotranspiration) and other sensitive\
    \ irrigation parameters \nwere implemented on the algorithm which handles the\
    \ smart irrigation schedule on \nQUHOMA. Several tasks such as quality assessment\
    \ and cleaning of weather data, or the \nFigure 3. Sensors and components of the\

    \ historical data from sensors and previously deﬁned irrigation schedules are\n\
    used to calculate the irrigation schedule. On the other hand, sensor data may\
    \ be inaccurate.\nThus, predictive analytics based on the historical data can\
    \ detect anomalies in the values of\nthe sensor data (e.g., when stream data values\
    \ are not in the estimated acceptable value\nspan) and use this information for\
    \ the proactive maintenance of the affected sensors.\nReal-life irrigation experiments\

    Researchers from the French–German MOVEON project have recently demonstrated\n\
    a comprehensive breakdown of a visual SLAM system based only on a single camera\n\
    combined with state-of-the-art multi-view stereo (MVS) algorithms and DL techniques\
    \ [27].\nIt overcomes some of the constraints of current autonomous vehicles or\
    \ robots working\non agricultural environments, such as overly repetitive patterns,\
    \ the need of very detailed\nreconstructions, or the abrupt movements caused by\
    \ uneven roads. The results of the\nproject have been extended towards the agricultural\
    \ sector. Therefore, experiments have\nbeen conducted over the Rosario dataset,\
    \ which consists of six sequences recorded in a\nsoybean ﬁeld, captured by forward\
    \ looking stereo camera, showing real and challenging\ncases such as highly repetitive\
    \ scenes, reﬂection and burned images caused by direct\nsunlight and rough terrain,\

    \ up to real scale\n(see Figure 9a), so that it is suitable for tasks like 4D\
    \ monitoring of the crop and the\nprovision of valuable information to the farmer\
    \ (e.g., size, disposition, maturity, volume,\nwidth and height of the crop).\
    \ As dense mapping can be achieved also in real-time, the\nagricultural vehicle\
    \ or robot can sense the environment to its position and auto-steer. More\nimportant,\
    \ it is also possible to use unsupervised depth estimation using convolutional\n\

    \ German projects that deal with\nAgronomy 2021, 11, 1227\n12 of 14\nthe availability\

    \ of agricultural processes. Furthermore, current research challenges\nfor AI\
    \ such as explainability and the integration of semantic agricultural models will\n\
    be targeted.\nOn the other hand, even though still in primary stages, the application\
    \ of DT in\nagriculture can bring a technological breakthrough in the near future.\
    \ In order to provide\ninsights into complex agricultural systems, the DEAL project\
    \ has implemented geospatial\nML and DL algorithms to automatically derive vegetation\
    \ objects from 3D point clouds,\ntranscending explicit geospatial modeling and\
    \ overcoming heuristics-based reconstructions\nand model-based abstractions. Therefore,\
    \ agricultural DT can be fully automatically\nimplemented to simulate, plan, analyze\
    \ and improve the way crops are grown so that\nyields are maximized, stress on\
    \ water supplies and soil quality is reduced, and agriculture\nbecomes a sustainable\
    \ practice.\nSecondly, AI in agriculture is helping farmers to shift their management\
    \ strategies to\nprecise cultivation for higher crop yield and better quality\
    \ while using fewer resources. On\nthe one hand, AI applications in agriculture\
    \ such as for irrigation, weeding or spraying,\nsave the excess use of water,\
    \ pesticides and herbicides while maintaining the fertility of\nthe soil to improve\
    \ both productivity and quality of produced goods. In this way, the\nQUHOMA irrigation\
    \ platform developed within the IoF2020 project has been extended\nwith AI-based\
    \ predictive analytics that fuse the gathered datasets with other public data\n\
    sources to train models when data stream is interrupted or inaccurate due to malfunction\n\
    or failure of the sensors, and/or loss of connection during long time periods.\
    \ Real-life\nexperiments conducted in strawberry crops in Cyprus led to a signiﬁcant\
    \ reduction (from 6\nto 11% less) in water used when compared to the empirical\
    \ irrigation scheduling program\navailable for the farmer. The platform is currently\
    \ being adapted to groves of olives in\norder to optimize their irrigation using\
    \ the minimum number of sensors.On the other\nhand, while many analytical models\
    \ have been developed to plan agronomic strategies to\noptimize production, AI\
    \ leads current research since it enables to take into account complex\nmultidimensional\
    \ holistic approaches. This paper describes two examples of the use of ML\ntechniques\
    \ for the yield prediction, both in the automated estimation of canopy features\
    \ of\nan experimental vineyard in Lisbon and in olive tree plantations based on\
    \ phenotypic data.\nFirst, the VINBOT project aims at predicting yield in vineyards\
    \ using an all-terrain\nAGV with a set of sensors capable of capturing and analyzing\
    \ vineyard images and\n3D data by means of cloud computing applications. Although\
    \ the platform showed an\nacceptable performance, with a better accuracy within\
    \ the “Alvarinho” plot than in the\n“Arinto” one, a general underestimation of\
    \ actual yield for both plots was observed. This\nresult can be attributed to\
    \ a combined effect of bunch occlusions, low accuracy of grape\ndetection algorithms,\
    \ and empirical relationships used in ﬁnal yield calculations. Thus,\nfurther\
    \ research on computer vision algorithms, especially related to hidden bunches\
    \ by\nvegetation, is needed to improve the reliability and accuracy of the yield\
    \ estimations.\nSecondly, prediction models of the phenological state for olive\
    \ trees have been devel-\noped within the DEMETER project, as models simulating\
    \ phenological phases are valuable\ntools to plan agronomic strategies to optimize\
    \ production and assess the impact of climate\nchange. Four different ML models\
    \ have been tested and compared according to the RMSE.\nThe use of low base temperature\
    \ resulted in better model prediction.\nFinally, robotics agriculture will not\
    \ only make agriculture more precise but also\na sustainable business, as it is\
    \ undeniable that the average age of farmers is rising, and\nyounger generations\
    \ are less likely to take their place causing concern about labor shortages\n\
    in the agricultural sector. The MOVEON project has demonstrated a comprehensive\n\
    breakdown of a visual SLAM system based only on a single camera combined with\
    \ state-\nAgronomy 2021, 11, 1227\n13 of 14\nof-the-art multi-view stereo (MVS)\
    \ algorithms and DL techniques, overcoming some of the\nconstraints of current\
    \ autonomous vehicles or robots working on agricultural environments,\nsuch as\
    \ overly repetitive patterns, the need of very detailed reconstructions, or the\
    \ abrupt\nmovements caused by uneven roads.\n5. Future Work\nA key goal of PA\
    \ is to retrieve accurate information about the spatial and temporal\nvariability\
    \ of soil and plant parameters, with the aim to reduce inputs such as fertilizers,\n\
    seeds, water or pesticides. This allows better quantitative assessment of how\
    \ much of a\nspeciﬁc input is needed, so that agriculture has a lighter impact\
    \ on the environment and\nat the same time, “produces more with less” in the same\
    \ area. However, current plant\nsampling techniques are time-consuming and involve\
    \ intensive human labor and costs,\nwhich leads to signiﬁcant limitations on the\
    \ frequency and the number of samples that can\nbe collected to quantify the experimental\
    \ error among treatment repetitions.\nNew concepts based on autonomous and intelligent\
    \ robots for plant and soil sample\nretrieval should be introduced to obtain more\
    \ and better plant data in a shorter time with\nless human labor. Therefore, groups\
    \ of heterogeneous intelligent and autonomous agricul-\ntural vehicles (UAVs)\
    \ and ground robots (UGVs) capable of approaching and recognizing,\nmanipulating,\
    \ sampling and collecting, transporting and delivering soil and plant samples\n\
    required for inspection should be developed. High-quality sampling data gathered\
    \ by\nrobots will allow the development of novel DDS, which in turn will facilitate\
    \ decisions on\nexactly how, where and in which amount inputs should be used to\
    \ improve production\nand to use resources sustainably. The concept, once applied,\
    \ will greatly increase precision\nand quality in farming processes.\nFurthermore,\
    \ future extensions of this work will include the implementation of AI\nalgorithms\
    \ for the smart farming concept, including effective livestock management. For\n\
    example, automated video monitoring of animal behavior to detect events like calving,\n\
    heat periods or other physiological phenomena, is of great interest to help farmers\
    \ and\nbreeders improve efﬁciency in their professional activity. Advantages of\
    \ an automated\nsolution are to provide a 24 h/7 days assistance, to allow anticipating\
    \ alerts, to facilitate\nreporting, to ensure traceability and all this to alleviate\
    \ the burden for the farmers and\nattend to the health of the animals. The livestock\
    \ monitoring will be progressively enriched\nwith advanced functionalities based\
    \ on IA and sensing that will be kept noninvasive\nfor animals.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    Abstract: Smart farming is a development that has emphasized information and communication

    technology used in machinery, equipment, and sensors in network-based hi-tech
    farm supervision

    cycles. Innovative technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing
    are anticipated

    to inspire growth and initiate the use of robots and artiﬁcial intelligence in
    farming. Such ground-

    breaking deviations are unsettling current agriculture approaches, while also
    presenting a range of

    challenges. This paper investigates the tools and equipment used in applications
    of wireless sensors

    in IoT agriculture, and the anticipated challenges faced when merging technology
    with conventional

    farming activities. Furthermore, this technical knowledge is helpful to growers
    during crop periods

    from sowing to harvest; and applications in both packing and transport are also
    investigated.

    Keywords: crop management; sustainable agriculture; smart farming; internet-of-things

    1. Introduction

    Sustainable agriculture is a measure of the endurance and sustenance of food grains

    produced in an eco-friendly manner [1]. Sustainable agriculture helps in the encourage-

    ment of farming practices and approaches to help sustain farmers and resources.
    It is

    economically feasible and maintains soil quality, reduces soil degradation, saves
    water

    resources, improves land biodiversity, and ensures a natural and healthy environment
    [2].

    Sustainable agriculture plays a signiﬁcant role in preserving natural resources,
    halting

    biodiversity loss, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions [3].

    Sustainable agriculture farming is a method of preserving nature without compromis-

    ing the future generation’s basic needs, whilst also improving the effectiveness
    of farming.

    The basic accomplishments of smart farming in terms of sustainable agriculture
    are crop ro-

    tation, the control of nutrient deﬁciency in crops, the control of pests and diseases,
    recycling,

    and water harvesting, leading to an overall safer environment. Living organisms
    depend

    on the nature of biodiversity, and are contaminated by waste emissions, the use
    of fertilizers

    and pesticides, degraded dead plants, etc. The emission of greenhouse gases affects
    plants,

    animals, humans, and the environment; hence, it necessitates a better environment
    for

    living things [4] (Figure 1).

    Agriculture is the largest contributor in India, with an 18% gross domestic product

    involving approximately 57% of people in rural areas. Over the years, although
    India’s

    total agronomic output has increased, the number of growers has fallen from 71.9%
    in 1951

    to 45.1% in 2011 [5]. The Economic Survey 2018 revealed that the number of agricultural

    workers in the total workforce will drop to 25.7% in 2050. In rural areas, farming
    families

    gradually lose the next generation of farmers, overwhelmed by higher costs of
    cultivation,

    low per capita productivity, inadequate soil maintenance, and migrations to a
    non-farming

    or higher remunerative occupation. Presently, the world is on the verge of a digital

    revolution, and so it is the appropriate time to connect the agricultural landform
    with

    wireless technology to introduce and accommodate digital connectivity with farmers.

    Figure 1. Factors of sustainable agriculture.

    Regrettably, not all parts of the Earth’s surface are suitable for agriculture
    due to

    various restrictions, such as: soil quality, topography, temperature, climate,
    and most

    relevant cultivable areas are also not homogenous [6]. Further, existing farming
    land is

    fragmented by political and ﬁscal features, and rapid urbanization, which consistently

    increases pressure on arable land availability (Figure 2). Recently, total agricultural
    land

    used for food production has declined [7]. Furthermore, every crop ﬁeld has different

    critical characteristics, such as soil type, ﬂow of irrigation, presence of nutrients,
    and pest

    resistance, which are all measured separately both in quality and quantity regarding
    a

    speciﬁc crop. Both spatial and temporal differences are necessary for optimizing
    crop

    production in the same ﬁeld by crop rotation and an annual crop growth development

    cycle [8].

    Figure 2. Key issues of technology in the agriculture industry.

    In most cases, variations in characteristics occur within a single crop, or the
    same

    crop is grown on the whole farm and requires site-speciﬁc analyses for optimum
    yield

    production. New technology-based approaches are needed to produce more from less
    land,

    and to address these various issues. In traditional farming practices, farmers
    frequently

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    3 of 26

    visit their ﬁelds throughout the crop’s life in routine farming activities to
    better understand

    the crop conditions [9]. The current sensor and communication technologies offer
    an precise

    view of the ﬁeld, from which farmers can detect ongoing ﬁeld activities without
    being in

    the ﬁeld in person. Wireless sensors monitor the crops with higher accuracy and
    detect

    issues at early stages, often facilitating the use of smart tools from initial
    sowing to the

    harvest of crops [10].

    The timely use of sensors has made the entire farming operation smart and cost-

    effective, due to precise monitoring. The various autonomous harvesters, robotic
    weeders,

    and drones have sensors attached to collect data over short intervals. However,
    the vastness

    of agriculture puts extreme demands on technological solutions for sustainability
    with

    minimum ecological impact. Sensor technology through wireless communication helps

    farmers to know the various needs and requirements of crops without being in the
    ﬁelds,

    and they are then able to take remote action [11].

    2. Smart Farming

    Historically, ancient agriculture practices were related to the production of
    food in

    cultivated lands for the survival of humans and the breeding of animals [12],
    and was

    called the traditional agricultural era 1.0. This mainly resorted to using manpower
    and

    animals. Simple tools were used for farming activities, such as sickles and shovels.
    Work

    was mainly conducted through manual labor, and subsequently, productivity continued
    at

    a low level (Figure 3).

    Figure 3. Agricultural decision support system framework.

    During the 19th Century, new types of machinery appeared in the agricultural indus-

    tries, in the form of steam engines. The wide use of agricultural machinery and
    abundant

    chemicals by farmers signaled the start of the agricultural era 2.0, and outwardly
    improved

    effectiveness and productivity of farmers and farms. However, considerably harmful
    impli-

    cations, such as chemical pollution, environmental devastation, waste of natural
    resources,

    and excess utilization of energy, simultaneously developed.

    The agricultural era 3.0 emerged during the 20th Century, due to the rapid growth
    of

    computation and electronics. Robotic techniques, programed agricultural machinery,
    and

    other technologies enhanced the agricultural processes efﬁciently. The issues
    that had arisen

    during agricultural era 2.0 were solved, and policies were readapted to the agricultural
    era

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    4 of 26

    3.0 through work distribution, precise irrigation, the reduced use of chemicals,
    site-speciﬁc

    nutrient application, and efﬁcient pest control technologies, etc.

    The next agricultural era is also the current iteration of agriculture, the agricultural

    era 4.0, involving the engagement of recent technologies, such as the Internet
    of Things, big

    data analysis, artiﬁcial intelligence, cloud computing and remote sensing, etc.
    The adop-

    tion of new technologies has signiﬁcantly improved agricultural activities by
    developing

    low-cost sensor and network platforms, aimed towards the optimization of production

    efﬁciency, along with reductions in the usage of water resources and energy with
    minimum

    environmental effects [13]. Big data in smart farming provides extrapolative overviews
    of

    real-time agricultural situations, allowing farmers to make effective decisions
    [14]. Real-

    time programming is developed with artiﬁcial intelligence concepts and embedded
    in IoT

    devices, helping farmers make the most suitable decisions [15].

    Smart farming promotes precision agriculture with modern, sophisticated technology

    and enables farmers to remotely monitor the plants. Smart farming helps agricultural
    pro-

    cesses, such as harvesting and crop yields, as the automation of sensors and machinery
    has

    made the farming workforce more efﬁcient [16]. The technologies convert traditional
    farm-

    ing methods to automatic devices, causing a technological revolution in agriculture.
    Today,

    the technology in agriculture has altered the way farming is conducted, and conventional

    techniques have been transformed by the Internet of Things [17].

    In terms of optimizing farm labor requirements and increasing the quantity and

    quality of products, smart farming is an emerging modern technique implemented
    with

    information and communication technologies (ICT) [16]. Modern ICT technologies,
    such

    as the Internet of Things, GPS (Global Positioning Systems), sensors, robotics,
    drones,

    precision equipment, actuators, and data analytics, are used to identify the farmers’
    needs

    and select suitable solutions to their problems. These innovations increase the
    accuracy

    and timeliness of decisions taken, and improve crop productivity. Several multilateral

    organizations and developing countries around the world have proposed smart farming

    technologies to increase agricultural output [18].

    Sensors are constantly monitoring crops with greater accuracy, detecting any undesir-

    able conditions during the early stages of the crop’s lifecycle. Current farming
    incorporates

    smart tools from crop sowing to harvest, storing, and conveyance. The appropriate
    use of a

    wide variety of sensors has made the entire operation both more efﬁcient and proﬁtable,

    due to its accurate monitoring competencies. In addition, sensors that collect
    data quickly

    are directly available online for further evaluation, and they provide crop and
    site-speciﬁc

    agriculture for every site.

    The many issues related to crop production are addressed by smart agriculture
    and

    monitoring, particularly regarding changes in soil characteristics, climate factors,
    soil mois-

    ture, etc., to improve the spatial management practices that increase crop production
    and

    avoid the excess use of fertilizers and pesticides [19]. The ANN models in smart
    irrigation

    water management (SIWM) regulate irrigation scheduling support systems (DSS) and
    offer

    data on irrigation efﬁciency, water productivity index, and irrigation water demand
    and

    supply on a real-time basis. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is an upcoming technology,

    especially in developing countries, due to its potential to improve food security,
    farm

    system resilience, and lower greenhouse gas emissions [20]. Smart agriculture
    technology

    based on IoT technologies has many advantages in all agricultural processes and
    practices

    in real-time, including irrigation, plant protection, improving product quality,
    fertilization,

    disease prediction, etc. [21]. The beneﬁt of smart agriculture lies in its collection
    of real-time

    data on crops, the precise assessment of soil and crops, remote monitoring by
    farmers,

    supervising water and other natural resources, and improving livestock and agricultural

    production. Therefore, smart agriculture is considered to be the progression of
    precision

    agriculture through modernization and smart methods to attain various information
    of

    farm activities that are then remotely managed, and reinforced by suitable alternative

    real-time farm maintenance solutions.

    3. Internet of Things

    The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new technology that allows devices to connect

    remotely to achieve smart farming [22]. The IoT has begun to inﬂuence a vast range

    of industries, from health, trade, communications, energy and agriculture, to
    enhance

    efﬁciency and performance across all markets [23–25].

    Current applications provide information on the IoT’s effects, and its practices
    that are

    yet to be observed. However, by considering the advancement of technologies, one
    can

    envisage the IoT technologies perform a crucial role in numerous activities of
    farming, such

    as the utilization of communication infrastructure, data acquisition, smart objects,
    sensors,

    mobile devices, cloud-based intelligent information, decision-making, and the
    automation

    of agricultural operations (Figure 4).

    Figure 4. Barriers in the implementation of smart agriculture technology.

    The IoT technology monitors plants and animals and remotely retrieves information

    from mobile phones and devices. Sensors and instruments empower farmers to assess

    the weather and to anticipate production levels. The IoT plays a role in water
    harvesting,

    monitoring and controlling the ﬂow amount, assessing crops’ water requirements,
    time of

    supply, and the saving of water, more than ever before [26]. Sensors and cloud
    connectivity

    through the gateway can remotely monitor the status and water supply based on
    soil

    and plant needs [27]. To correct nutrient deﬁciencies, pests, and diseases, farmers
    cannot

    monitor and observe every plant manually, but IoT technology is still beneﬁcial
    and has

    led farmers to a new milestone in modern agriculture [28].

    Recently, the development of IoT technologies has played a major role throughout
    the

    farming sector, particularly through its communication infrastructure. This has
    included

    connecting smart objects, remote data acquisition, using vehicles and sensors
    through

    mobile devices and the internet, cloud-based intelligent analysis, interfacing,
    decision

    formation, and the automation of agricultural operations. These proﬁciencies have
    revo-

    lutionized the agriculture industry in terms of resource optimization, controlling
    climate

    effects, and improving crop yields.

    Researchers have proposed different methods, architectures, and various equipment
    to

    monitor and convey crop information at different growth stages, based on several
    crop and

    ﬁeld types. Many manufacturers provide communication devices, multiple sensors,
    robots,

    heavy machinery, and drones to collect and then distribute data. Food and agriculture

    organizations, along with other government organizations, develop guidelines and
    policies

    for regulating the use of technologies to preserve food and environment safety
    [29,30].

    Fundamentals of IoT Applications in Agriculture

    The accessible, inexpensive and interactive tracking platform provides consolidated

    information on traditional agricultural methods, techniques, implements, crop
    pests and

    diseases, etc., collected from various sources for sustainable agriculture. Interactive
    agricul-

    ture allows easy access to the data by users through multiple devices, such as
    computers

    and mobile phones [31].

    1.

    Robust Models: The distinctive features of the agriculture sector are diversity,
    com-

    plexity, spatio-temporal variability, and uncertainties of the right types of
    harvests

    and facilities.

    2.

    Scalability: The variation in farm size from smaller to larger; hence, the results
    should

    be scalable. The placement and testing planning should be progressively scaled
    up

    with fewer expenses.

    3.

    Affordability: Affordability is vital to farming achievement, and therefore price
    should

    be suitable with signiﬁcant assistance. Standardized platforms, products, tools,
    and

    facilities could obtain a satisfactory price.

    4.

    Sustainability: The problem of sustainability is a vital issue due to strong economic

    pressure and intense competition worldwide.

    4. Technologies Used in Smart Farming

    4.1. Global Positioning System (GPS)

    GPS accurately records latitude, longitude, and elevation information [32]. Global

    Positioning System satellites transmit signals and permit GPS receivers to compute
    their

    location in real-time, and provide continuous positions while moving. The exact
    location

    information offers farmers the opportunity to discover the precise position of
    ﬁeld data,

    such as pest occurrence, type of soil, weeds, and other barriers. The system facilitates
    the

    recognition of various ﬁeld locations in order to then apply the necessary inputs
    (seed,

    fertilizer, herbicide, pesticide, and water) to a particular ﬁeld [33].

    4.2. Sensor Technologies

    Technics, such as photo electricity, electromagnetics, conductivity, and ultrasound,
    are

    used to estimate soil texture and structure, nutrient level, vegetation, humidity,
    vapor, air,

    temperature, etc. Remote sensing data can differentiate between crop types, categorize

    pests and weeds, locate stress in soil and plant conditions, and monitor drought
    [34].

    Plant health is affected by many factors, such as soil moisture, nutrient availability,

    exposure to light, humidity, the amount of rainfall, the color of leaves, etc.
    The plants are

    monitored by maintaining the optimum temperature and light intensity, and conserving

    water and energy through micro-irrigation. Different sensors are used to detect
    many

    parameters. If they cross a threshold, the sensor senses the changes and transmits
    them

    to the microcontroller to perform the required actions until the parameter returns
    to its

    optimum level [1].

    The temperature, humidity, soil pattern monitoring, airﬂow sensor, location, CO2,

    pressure, light, and moisture sensors are generally used in sensing technologies.
    Prominent

    sensor characteristics include reliability, memory, portability, durability, coverage,
    and

    computational efﬁciency, and make them suitable for agriculture [35]. Currently
    available

    wireless sensors play a vital role in collecting data on crop conditions and providing
    other

    information. These sensors are standalone types and can be integrated with advanced

    agricultural tools and heavy machinery, based on application necessities.

    The major sensor types with their corresponding working procedure and purpose
    are

    represented in Table 1.

    4.3. Variable-Rate of Technology (VRT) and Grid Soil Sampling

    Variable-rate technologies (VRT) are used in farming to predict the delivery rate
    of

    inputs based on a predetermined map extrapolated from GIS for the placement of
    inputs at

    variable amounts in the right place and at the right time [16,33]. Grid soil sampling
    is soil

    collection from a systematic grid to establish a map for every parameter. These
    maps are

    the basis for VRT and are loaded into a variable-rate applicator. The computer
    and GPS

    receiver direct and control the changes in the delivery amount or fertilizer product,
    based

    on map features [58,59].

    New technologies, such as variable rate technology and associated practices (grid
    soil

    sampling), potentially improve soil fertility management and assess the spatial
    distribution

    of nutrients and yields [60]. In grid sampling, samples are collected from sampled
    sections

    based on the subdivision of a ﬁeld into small areas, or cells, by superimposing
    the grid

    lines onto the ﬁeld. Composite samples represent an entire area of each much smaller
    area

    (grid-point sampling) at the intersections of grid lines. Soil-test values from
    grid sampling

    are mapped by interpolating methods from non-measured locations between sampled

    points. The variability of phosphorus and potassium is ﬁeld-speciﬁc, and each
    ﬁeld should

    be fertilized differently to improve nutrient management practices by uniform
    applications

    of fertilizers and manure for better precision agriculture [61].

    4.4. Geographic Information System (GIS)

    The GIS comprises hardware and software designed to provide compilation, storage,

    retrieval, attributes analysis, and location data to generate maps and analyze
    characters and

    geography for statistics and spatial methods [62]. The GIS database provides information

    on ﬁeld soil types, nutrient status, topography, irrigation, surface and subsurface
    drainage,

    quantity of chemical applications, and crop production, and also establishes the
    relationship

    between elements that affect a crop on a particular farming ﬁeld [63]. Apart from
    data

    storage and display, the GIS is used to assess present and alternative management
    by

    compounding and altering data layers for decision-making.

    4.5. Crop Management

    Satellite images provide information on variations in soil conditions, as well
    as crop

    performances affected by topography within the ﬁeld. Therefore, farmers can exactly

    monitor production factors, such as seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides, that are
    responsible

    for yield increase and efﬁciency.

    The spatial coverage and temporal revisit frequency of satellite images provide
    the

    information in near real-time at a regional scale. The relationship between the
    spectral prop-

    erties of crops and their biomass/yield experiments [64] is predicted by spectral
    reﬂectance

    properties of vegetation, especially in red and near-infrared combinations (vegetation

    indices) to monitor green foliage. Among the different indices, the normalized
    difference

    vegetation index (NDVI) is the most popular indicator to assess vegetation health
    and crop

    production, due to the closely related leaf area index (LAI) and photosynthetic
    activity

    of green vegetation [25]. Crop monitoring methods are based on the interpretation
    of

    remote-sensing-derived indicators by comparing actual crop status to previous
    or normal

    seasons [65]. The relationship between vegetation indices and biomass permits
    early crop

    yield estimation in certain periods before harvest [66]. The automated data acquisition,
    pro-

    cessing, monitoring, decision-making, and management of farm operations [67],
    including

    the basic functions of crop production (yields), proﬁts and losses, farm weather
    prediction,

    ﬁeld mapping, soil nutrients tracking, are the more complicated functionalities
    available

    through automated ﬁeld management.

    4.6. Soil and Plant Sensors

    Sensor technology, a signiﬁcant constituent of precision agriculture, provides
    soil

    properties information, fertility, and water status. Hence, new sensors have been
    developed

    based on desirable features and established apart from currently available sensors
    [68].

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    9 of 26

    Soil sensors and plant wearables monitor real-time physical and chemical signals

    in soil, such as moisture, pH, temperature, and pollutants, and provide information
    to

    optimize crop growth conditions, ﬁght against biotic and abiotic stresses, and
    increase

    crop yields. Soil organic matters (SOMs), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium

    (K) are the most important nutrients for crop production. The NIR reﬂectance-based

    sensors measure the spatial variation of surface and subsurface soil nitrogen
    [69]. SOM is

    predicted based on optimal wavelengths by assessing soil spectral reﬂectance in
    IR and

    visible wavelength regions [70]. The soil nitrogen and phosphorus are predicted
    using

    NIR spectrophotometry technology [71–73]. The soil apparent electrical conductivity
    (ECa)

    sensors collect information continuously on the ﬁeld surface, since ECa is sensitive
    to

    changes in soil texture and salinity. Soil insects/pests are detected using optoelectronic,

    acoustic, impedance sensors, and nanostructured biosensors [74].

    4.7. Rate Controllers

    Rate controllers are designed to control the delivery rate of inputs by monitoring
    the

    speed of vehicles across the ﬁeld, and altering the ﬂow rate of material on a
    real-time basis

    at the target rate. Rate controllers are commonly used as stand-alone systems
    [75].

    4.8. Precision Irrigation in Pressurized Systems

    Recent developments in irrigation systems have introduced irrigation machines,
    de-

    voted to motion control, GPS-based controllers, sensor technologies, and wireless
    commu-

    nication to monitor soil and climatic conditions together with an assessment of
    irrigation

    parameters, i.e., ﬂow and pressure, to attain greater water utilization efﬁciency
    by crop.

    These technologies show signiﬁcant potential; however, further progress is required
    before

    they can become commercially available [76].

    4.9. Yield Monitor

    Yield monitors are the combination of sensors and components, including a data

    storage device, a computer, and user interface, that control integration and interaction

    components. The sensor measures yield continuously by evaluating the force of
    mass or

    volume of grain ﬂow. The mass ﬂow sensor was based on the principle of transmitting

    microwave energy beams and measuring the energy that bounces back after hitting.
    In

    yield monitors, GPS receivers create yield maps based on the location yield data
    [77].

    The yield monitor is mounted on a harvester and connected with the mobile app
    for

    displaying live harvest data, and automatically uploads to the web-based platform.
    The

    app can generate and share high-quality yield maps with an agronomist, and farmers

    can export other farm management data for analysis. In horticultural crops, to
    precisely

    determine the yield quantity and quality of produce, fruit growth is considered
    one of

    the most relevant parameters in the crop progressing period [78]. Color images
    are used

    to track fruit conditions for estimating fruit maturation, making decisions for
    harvesting,

    and targeting the right market [79]. Satellite images are one of the options for
    real-time

    monitoring of the yield of crops over vast areas; for example, Sentinel-1A images
    are used

    to map the rice yield and crop intensity in Myanmar [80].

    The crop yield estimation system was designed using both software and hardware

    components. Based on a Bluetooth terminal android application and yield estimator

    software program, crop yield is estimated using a mathematical calculation through
    a

    mobile application [81]. Satellite-based crop yield predictions based on spectral
    signatures

    reveal the estimated yields are as reliable as actual yields. The maize yield
    predictions

    were successfully carried out under varying environments using machine learning
    and

    satellite-derived data assimilation in crop models [82].

    4.10. Software

    The software has multiple tasks, such as mapping, display controller interfacing,
    data

    processing, analysis, and interpretation, etc. Most commonly, software is used
    to generate

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    10 of 26

    the maps for soil properties and nutrient status, yield maps, variable rate applications

    maps for inputs, and overlaying different kinds of maps with advanced geostatistical

    features [83].

    5. Applications in Agriculture

    By adopting the current sensor and IoT technologies in agriculture, each characteristic

    of conventional farming practices is rehabilitated. The incorporation of wireless
    sensors

    and IoT in smart farming answers many of the issues facing conventional agriculture;
    for

    example, land suitability, drought monitoring, irrigation, pest control, and yield
    maximiza-

    tion. Figure 5 demonstrates the order of main applications, facilities, and devices
    for smart

    agriculture applications. Using advanced technologies at various stages in the
    following

    few applications enhances efﬁciency and revolutionizes agriculture.

    Figure 5. Hierarchy of probable applications, facilities and devices for smart
    agriculture.

    5.1. Soil Mapping and Plant Monitoring

    Soil analysis estimates the nutrient status of the ﬁeld based on GPS position
    and

    ﬁeld-speciﬁc information, and critical decisions are then taken according to the
    nutrient

    deﬁciencies at different stages of the crop. The factors controlling soil fertility
    status are

    topography, type and texture, cropping pattern, application of fertilizer, irrigation,
    etc. [84].

    Soil mapping is useful for assessing crop suitability or varieties in a speciﬁc
    ﬁeld, as well

    as planting depth, the physical, chemical and biological properties of soil, in
    order to

    best utilize resources. Presently, a wide range of sensors and tools are used
    to monitor

    soil properties, such as water-holding capacity, texture, and absorption rate,
    which assists

    farmers in tracking the soil quality and adopting suitable remedies to avoid soil
    degradation

    such as erosion, alkalization, acidiﬁcation, salinization, and pollution. Drought
    is another

    concern that affects plant productivity and crop yield. Remote sensing techniques
    that

    can obtain soil moisture data frequently assist in analyzing agricultural drought
    in remote

    regions. Soil moisture maps generated from satellite data are used to estimate
    the soil water

    deﬁcit index (SWDI), which enables the development of prediction models based
    on soil

    physical properties [85,86].

    Various factors, such as soil type, soil nutrients, irrigation, and pests, affect
    rice yield

    and quality. The IoT-based mobile application aids crop management and provides
    real-

    time information on soil nutrition and characteristics. The system consists of
    electrical

    conductivity (EC), temperature sensors with a T-Beam microcontroller, and IoT
    connectivity,

    and the estimated EC value near the calibration solution is 12.88 mS/cm, and 150
    mS/cm

    is less than 2% of the calibration solution’s value. The measured EC values are
    linearly

    proportional to temperature and depth, and values of 1.04 and 3.86 mS/cm were
    noticed

    with and without fertilizer at 5 cm depth, while it was 0.656 and 420 mS/cm at
    10 cm depth,

    respectively [87].

    Plant monitoring conducted through the IoT ADCON-based station, with sensors

    and mobile devices (smartphones and tablets), farmers are able to collect data
    on soil and

    ambient parameters, such as leaf wetness, air and soil temperature, soil and air
    humidity to

    improve the grape productivity, and crop quality from seeding to harvest. Further,
    the data

    transmission system highlights the soil-plant-atmosphere interactions needed to
    optimize

    agricultural production [88]. By analyzing the data from soil moisture, carbon
    dioxide,

    light, and temperature sensors in bell peppers grown in a greenhouse were compared
    with

    day and night CO2, rolling the doors and windows of the greenhouse open and closed,

    based on soil moisture [89].

    5.2. Irrigation

    According to the UN Convention to Combat Desertiﬁcation (UNCCD), 168 countries

    will be inundated with desertiﬁcation by 2030, and nearly 50% of the world population

    lives in high water shortage areas [90]. Considering the water crises and increasing
    demand

    for farming and other activities, it must be provided to regions with water quantities.
    Water

    resources are conserved by adopting more controlled and efﬁcient irrigation systems;
    for

    example, drip and sprinkler irrigations. Water demand estimation for crops is
    controlled

    by soil type, precipitation, irrigation method, crop type, and requirement, as
    well as soil

    moisture retention. Using air and soil moisture control systems with wireless
    sensors

    optimizes water resources and improves crop health. In the current scenario, a
    substantial

    increase in crop productivity is anticipated using IoT techniques, namely CWSI
    (crop water

    stress index)-based water management [91], calculated from the crop canopy at
    varying

    crop growth stages and air temperatures. The information from climate data, sensors,
    and

    satellite imaging are related to the CWSI model for water requirement calculation,
    and

    predictions using the irrigation index values can be used for every ﬁeld based
    on slope or

    soil variability to improve water usage efﬁciency.

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    12 of 26

    5.3. Site-Speciﬁc Nutrient Management

    Fertilizer is a either natural or synthetic chemical substance that provides nutrients
    for

    plant growth and soil fertility. Both nutrient deﬁciency and excessive fertilizer
    use harms

    soil, plant health, and the environment [92]. The site-speciﬁc soil nutrient fertilization
    under

    smart agriculture estimates the required quantity of nutrients precisely, and
    minimizes

    their negative effects through excessive use on soil and in the environment. The
    site-

    speciﬁc soil, nutrient measurements are inﬂuenced by soil types, crop type, yield
    targets,

    exchange capacity, use efﬁciency, the type of fertilizer, weather conditions,
    etc. The IoT-

    based fertilizing technique estimates the nutrient’s spatial patterns of distribution
    [93,94].

    The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was obtained from satellite
    images to

    observe crop nutrient status [95,96], crop health, vegetation vigor, and plant
    density, as well

    as soil nutrient level. Recent technologies, like GPS [97], geo mapping [98],
    variable rate

    technology (VRT) [99,100], and autonomous vehicles [101] strongly contribute to
    IoT-based

    smart fertilization. Apart from these, fertigation [102] and chemigation [103,104],
    i.e., the

    use of water-soluble fertilizers in soil amendments and pesticides, are considered
    effective

    management practices to improve fertilization efﬁciency.

    5.4. Crop Pest and Disease Management

    The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) concluded that an annual global crop

    yield loss of 20- 40% was only due to pests and diseases [105], and these losses
    are controlled

    by the use of pesticides and other agrochemicals [106]. Most of them are harmful
    to human

    and animal health, and ultimately cause contamination of environmental systems
    [107,108].

    The IoT-based devices, such as robots, wireless sensors, and drones, precisely
    spot and

    control the crop opponents by real-time monitoring, modelling, and disease forecasting,

    increasing overall effectiveness [109,110] more than traditional pest control
    procedures.

    The IoT-based disease and pest management process depends on detection and image

    processing. The remote sensing imagery and ﬁeld sensors are used to collect data,
    such

    as plant health and pest incidence, in every ﬁeld for the entire crop period.
    IoT-based

    automated traps [111,112] capture, count, and describe insect types, and further
    upload

    data to the Cloud for complete analysis. Due to advancements in robotic technology,

    an agricultural robot with multispectral image sensing devices and precision spraying

    nozzles is utilized to detect and control pest problems more accurately under
    the IoT

    management system.

    5.5. Yield Monitoring and Forecasting

    The yield monitoring mechanism conforms to yield, moisture content, and quality
    of

    produce. The quality depends on pollination with good pollen, especially under
    changing

    environmental circumstances [113–115]. Crop forecasting predicts the yield before
    the crop

    harvest, and assists the farmer in future planning, decision-making, and further
    analysis of

    the yield quality. Maturity determines the right harvesting time by monitoring
    the crop at

    different development stages, including factors such as fruit color, size, etc.
    Predictions of

    the correct harvesting time aids in maximizing crop quality and production, and
    regulates

    market management strategies. Therefore, farmers should know the exact harvest
    time of

    crops to obtain proﬁt. Figure 6 outlines the idea of a farm area network, representing
    the

    whole farm in real-time conditions.

    The development and installation of a yield monitor [116] on a harvester, connected

    with a mobile app, shows real-time crop harvest, and automatically transmits data
    to

    the manufacturer’s web-based platform. To estimate crop production and monitoring,

    satellite images are exploited to cover vast areas [80]. For fruit crops, multicolor
    (RGB)

    satellite images [79] are utilized to track the diverse fruit conditions, especially
    fruit size

    and color, and plays a major role in estimating its maturation, making decisions
    on harvest,

    and market opportunities. Similarly, multiple optical sensors are used [117] to
    monitor

    shrinking fruits during drying conditions.

    6. Role of IoT in Advanced Farming Practices

    Adopting the new methods based on sensor and IoT-based technologies improved

    the yield of crops more than conventional agriculture processes. The involvement
    of new

    sophisticated sensor-based technologies in controlled environments plays an important

    role in enhancing the quality and quantity of produce.

    6.1. Greenhouse Farming and Protected Cultivation

    Growing plants in a controlled environment gained popularity in the 19th Century,

    and is considered one of the oldest methods of smart farming. These practices
    further

    accelerated during the 20th Century in countries facing severe weather conditions
    [118].

    Crops grown in indoor conditions are less affected by the environment. As a result,

    crops grown traditionally under suitable conditions are today being raised at
    anytime and

    anywhere by the use of sensors and communication devices. The success of crop
    production

    under a controlled environment depends on various factors, such as shed structures
    and

    material for controlling wind effects, aeration systems, accuracy of monitoring
    parameters,

    decision support system, etc. [119]. One of the greatest challenges in greenhouses
    is the

    precise monitoring of environmental parameters; hence, it requires several measurement

    points to predict the various parameters for controlling and ensuring the local
    climate. In

    an IoT-based greenhouse, sensors are used to measure and monitor the internal
    parameters,

    such as humidity, temperature, light, and pressure [120].

    The smart greenhouse has helped farmers automatically conduct farm work, without

    manual inspection, and protects the plants from hailstorms, winds, ultraviolet
    radiation,

    and insect and pest attacks. Hibiscus plants are grown with the required wavelength
    during

    the night using lights, temperature, and air humidity sensors. A study revealed
    a reduction

    in 70–80% water requirement, and the IoT enables direct contact between the farmer
    and

    consumer to make farming as efﬁcient and proﬁtable as possible [121]. The IoT-enabled

    automated system increased the productivity of rose plants grown in a greenhouse
    by

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    14 of 26

    monitoring and controlling various parameters, such as humidity, mist, CO2 level,
    UV light

    intensity, pH and EC value, water nutrients solution level, temperature, and amount
    of

    pesticides, through sensors for further efﬁcient detection and diagnosis [122].

    6.2. Hydroponics

    Hydroponics, a subdivision of hydroculture, is growing plants without soil to
    improve

    greenhouse farming beneﬁts. Hydroponic-based irrigation systems enable a balanced
    rate

    of application of dissolved nutrients in the water to crop roots as a solution.
    Presently,

    the available systems and sensors [123] detect a wide range of parameters and
    perform

    data analysis at predetermined intervals. Precise measurement and monitoring of
    nutrient

    content in solution is crucial for plant growth and considers its demands. On
    a real-

    time basis, the wireless-sensor-based prototype [124] has delivered a solution
    for soilless

    cultivation, and measures the concentration of numerous nutrients and water levels
    [125].

    An automated smart hydroponics system integrated with IoT consists of three major

    components: input data, cloud server and output data. These monitor lettuce cultivation

    from anywhere through the internet by analyzing parameters, such as pH level,
    water,

    nutrient-rich water-based solution, room temperature, and humidity, on a real-time
    ba-

    sis [126]. The hydroponic system of the deep ﬂow technique is a method for cultivating

    plants by placing roots in deep water layers, and ensuring the continuous circulation
    of

    plant nutrient solution. The plant growth elements data, such as pH, temperature,
    humid-

    ity, and water level in the hydroponic reservoir, are acquired by sensors integrated
    into

    Raspberry Pi, and data are processed and monitored automatically on a real-time
    basis to

    ensure proper water circulation [127].

    6.3. Vertical Farming

    The industrial-based agricultural farming practices damage soil quality at a faster

    rate than nature can reconstruct. The alarming erosion rate and use of fresh water
    for

    agriculture has led to the reduction of arable land, and increased the overburden
    on present

    water reservoirs [128]. Vertical farming (VF) offers an opportunity to keep the
    plants in a

    precisely controlled environment, signiﬁcantly reducing resource consumption and,
    at the

    same time, increasing production at varied times; and only a portion of the ground
    surface

    is needed depending on the number of stacks. VF is also extremely effective in
    higher

    yields and reducing water consumption compared to traditional farming [129]. The
    carbon

    dioxide measurement is the most critical parameter; hence, nondispersive infrared
    (NDIR)

    CO2 sensors play a vital part in tracking and controlling the conditions in vertical
    farms.

    6.4. Phenotyping

    Phenotyping is an emerging crop engineering technique, relating plant genomics
    with

    ecophysiology and agronomy. The advancement of genetic and molecular tools is
    signiﬁ-

    cant for crop breeding; however, quantitative analysis of crop behaviors, such
    as pathogen

    resistance, grain weight, etc., is inadequate due to the absence of effective
    technologies

    and efﬁcient techniques. In this condition, [130] reported that plant phenotyping
    is highly

    useful in investigating the quantitative characteristics responsible for growth,
    resistance

    to various stresses, yield quality, and quantity. The sensing technologies and
    image-based

    phenotyping describe screening of biostimulants and an understanding of their
    mode

    of action [131]. IoT-based phenotyping is intended to observe the crop and related
    trait

    measurements, and offer facilities for the breeding of crops and digital agriculture
    [132].

    The trait analysis algorithms and modelling support determine the relationships
    among

    genotypes, phenotypes, and their growing condition.

    7. The Role of the Engineer in Smart Farming

    Farmers face many issues when they adopt IoT-based agriculture. Therefore, engi-

    neers must develop solutions for speciﬁc problems related to smart farming techniques.
    An

    engineering role concerns the application and use of innovative technologies and
    methods

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    15 of 26

    for precision agricultural machinery, and smart farming is a creative way to mechanize

    agricultural engineering through means different from conventional mechanization
    [133].

    The concepts and synergy-based information are obtained from different technology
    areas,

    such as agricultural mechanization, mechatronics, instrumentation, control systems,
    and

    knowledge in artiﬁcial and computational intelligence [134]. Big data, satellite,
    and aerial

    images have revolutionized precision agriculture, and these new technologies increase

    production efﬁciency by creating a balance between productivity and environmental
    pro-

    tection. As a system integrator, engineering combines technical experience and
    strong

    business skills in both the public and private sectors [135].

    At the same time, engineering exploits the rewards of digital transformation in
    the

    entire agri-food chain, from day-to-day farming activities to supporting sales
    operations,

    logistics, and the maintenance of farm assets. For example, knowledge of the IoT,
    AI,

    mobile, precision farming technologies, remote sensing, advanced analytics, the
    Cloud,

    RPA, and blockchain technologies are necessary [136]. The data collected from
    the various

    types of machinery through sensors and other devices generates responses concerning

    cereals, viticulture, fruit, and vegetables, as well as soil and monitoring [137].

    The use of digital technologies and control systems to automate production processes

    also reduces manual human intervention. The production process, from ﬁeld to ﬁnal

    product, is carried out by planning, organizing, and analyzing data received from
    machines.

    The data acquired are stored in historical archives and correlated with each other
    to

    retrieve useful information for products through traceable systems working based
    on

    radio-frequency signals [138].

    7.1. Purpose

    Purpose is based on the user’s ﬁnal requirement, and inﬂuences the monitoring
    of

    crops during the growth period. Sensors provide the IoT solutions to their problems.

    For example, the end-user is a corn farmer, faced by problems mainly concerning
    water

    usage and ensuring that a crop gets adequate water; therefore, water level and
    moisture

    monitoring sensors are accommodated to prevent water wastage.

    7.2. Technology

    Distance plays an important role in technology selection because the sensors collect

    data and send to the server; hence, similar technology cannot be used for varying
    distances.

    For example, radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) or near ﬁeld communication (NFC)
    and

    low power, wide area network (LPWAN) technologies could send data over a distance
    of

    hundreds or even thousands of meters.

    7.3. Power Requirements

    Most IoT solutions are spread across a large farm, so it is better to develop
    low-

    power applications. On the other hand, more data transmission requires huge data
    costs

    and power consumption; hence, designers need to consider developing cost-effective
    IoT

    solutions for farmers. Usually, engineers save costs with customized IoT-based
    farming

    solutions, and develop apps for sending the data less frequently.

    7.4. Data Frequency

    The end user’s necessities are critical in deciding the number of sensors and
    data

    packets. Sometimes, a farmer does not require information frequently, but developer
    design

    an IoT application to function on a continual and real-time basis, with very high
    data

    frequency.

    7.5. Placement of Sensors

    Sensors are placed in such a way that they provide optimal performance, even if
    the

    farm has all the essential sensors with proper placement.

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    8. Barriers to Implementing Smart Farming Technologies

    Technology adoption is a method with a certain level of heterogeneity factors
    that

    are affective [139]. Technology implemented in farming systems has provided accuracy,

    efﬁciency, and eased time pressures. Although smart farming increases the productivity
    of

    crops, there are still problems in adopting these technologies

    8.1. Cost of Technology

    Existing technologies minimize the workforce and perform extremely fast with high

    accuracy. Therefore, it is anticipated that machines would probably replace a
    human work-

    force in the near future. However, it is impossible, since many countries have
    experienced

    poverty wherever the workforce was the main source for the agriculture sector.
    The imple-

    mentation of devices and technologies requires a huge amount of money; therefore,
    farmers

    face difﬁculties in terms of affordability when they look beyond conventional
    tools.

    8.2. Lack of Financial Resources

    Financial supporters could provide adequate loans to farmers if farmers did not
    get

    the anticipated yield, perhaps because unexpected calamities like drought, ﬂood,
    pests,

    and diseases impacted the crops.

    8.3. Literacy Status of Farmers

    The education level among the farmers is one of the greater challenges in implementing

    technologies in developing countries. The knowledge needed encompasses educational
    and

    technical abilities to manage the tools. The level of education increases a farmers’
    aptitude

    to process information, and thus make decisions using smart farming technologies
    [140],

    facilitating farmers’ use of computers [141]. Farmers in developing nations are
    mostly

    uneducated and unskilled because of a lack of desire to gain knowledge, or any
    new

    technology awareness [142]. Hence, it is a reason for farmers in choosing traditional

    farming over smart farming [143]. Farmers have considered that usage is too complex,

    sometimes incapable of recognizing the icons used in a mobile application as the
    farmers

    use general icons based on traditional understanding. Farmers need to be digitally
    literate

    to reinforce the advantages of smart farming technologies and, simultaneously,
    agri-tech

    companies should ensure farmers easily understand the limitations of the technology.

    8.4. Lack of Integration between the Systems

    Integration across systems is one of the areas where smart farming technologies
    needs

    to be advanced further by incorporating production, property management, and decision-

    making tools. The communication between academics and interdisciplinary groups
    must

    overcome the gap between agricultural and information science. More emphasis has

    been given to increasing user effectiveness during the development of an information

    system [144]. The basis for improved decision-making is based on the timely obtain-

    ability of superior quality data; hence, data must be integrated to generate information

    and knowledge.

    8.5. Telecommunications Infrastructure

    Farming activities mostly occur in rural areas more effectively in arable land
    than

    contaminated land. However, poor telecommunication infrastructure makes data transmis-

    sion unreliable, especially through mobile phones and tablets. Smart farming necessitates

    a real-time connection with the internet to enable the use of information. In
    addition,

    various operation control systems, such as fertilizers, pesticides, and seed volume,
    requires

    high-quality internet connection to produce outcomes. Recently, with the expansion
    of

    mobile phones, rural producers have gained to access mobile internet; however,
    signal

    quality and input speed are limited.

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    17 of 26

    8.6. Data Management

    Farmers are facing problems in organizing and manipulating data obtained by the

    sensors. The weather stations are generating data; however, farmers do not recognize
    how

    to use the information and how to change the data into a more available form.
    Its complex

    systems, alongside issues of acceptability and usability, lead to incorrect calculations.

    Farmers, consultants, and others involved in the production process must provide
    greater

    accessibility to data and information in productive systems.

    9. Current Challenges and Future Expectations

    In the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the United Nations and international

    community established a goal to end hunger by 2030. Currently, the World Health
    Organi-

    zation reports that more than 800 million people are facing food shortages worldwise
    [145].

    In addition, the increasing global population is increasing the demand for quality
    food;

    therefore, food and cash crops could improve overall crop production.

    Figure 7 represents the future challenges agriculture is anticipated to face in
    2050. This

    illustration offers three major problems: (1) feeding 10 billion people, (2) limitations
    in the

    expansion of land, and (3) the reduction of greenhouse gases emissions. These
    challenges

    lead to new thinking about water scarcity, shrinking arable land, rural labor,
    climate condi-

    tions, and much more. The diminishment in rural populations due to urbanization
    is not

    only shrinking communities, but is also leading to ageing populations; therefore,
    younger

    growers must step forward to take responsibility. The generation shift and population

    imbalance create further implications for the workforce and production.

    Figure 7. Challenges in sustainable future agriculture.

    The further shrinking of arable land and the suitability of particular crops in
    speciﬁc

    regions are due to geographic and ecological conditions. Abrupt weather changes
    enhance

    the intensity of environmental issues, such as drought, groundwater depletion,
    and soil

    degradation, affecting crop production. Moreover, traditional agricultural methods
    have

    historically met food demands by employing fertilizers and pesticides; however,
    it increases

    food production only to a certain level and negligent use of chemical deteriorate
    the envi-

    ronment. In developing countries, various problems facing the agricultural sector
    include

    no suitable crop selection, soil testing, efﬁcient irrigation systems, weather
    forecasting,

    animal husbandry, etc. Technological advancements have proved beneﬁcial in developed

    countries, both quantitively and qualitatively, but, in developing countries,
    50% of the

    population is already engaged in agriculture.

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    18 of 26

    The future of agriculture is expected to interconnect with artiﬁcial intelligence
    and

    big data services. As a result, the systems will converge into a single unit,
    where farm

    machinery and management start from seeding to production forecasting. Few of
    the key

    technologies and methods are focused on achieving sustainable future agriculture.

    9.1. Communication

    The achievement of the IoT in agriculture mostly depends on connectivity between

    devices [146]. Most telecom operators provide connectivity services, but represent
    a small

    percentage of smart farming as a whole. Cellular operators offer new services
    to target

    growers and enhance market facilities, especially in rural areas. The success
    of cellular

    technology is feasible when service providers guarantee its beneﬁts, such as ﬂexibility,

    portability, and extravagance, of both-way communication at low cost. In developing

    countries, mobile services and smartphone technology offer a hopeful future for
    farmers

    to enhance their crop yields. The low power wide area technology (LPWA) is anticipated

    to play a major role in smart farming agriculture, due to its improved facilities,
    efﬁcient

    coverage, low power consumption, and cost economics. The cellular operators with
    robust

    IoT create signiﬁcant returns by offering smart agriculture facilities in collaboration
    with

    LPWA technology.

    9.2. Wireless Sensors and IoT

    Placing wireless sensors around the ﬁeld provides timely information on a real-time

    basis to farmers in order to make decisions and act in order to obtain higher
    crop yields.

    Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with GPS technology update all information on
    crop

    growth and terrain features. Recently, digital images and signal processing offer
    additional

    competencies to WSN, and precisely ascertain crop quality and health. The IoT
    technology

    can streamline tasks in a predictable manner by diagnosing crop requirements at
    each

    stage to maximize their effectiveness. In the future, IoT will be upgraded to
    the ﬁfth-

    generation (5G) cellular mobile communication technologies, to provide real-time
    data

    to farmers at any time and everywhere. Based on this achievement, around 29 billion

    IoT-based components are expected to operate in the agriculture sector by the
    end of 2022.

    Furthermore, it is expected to create 4.1 million data points daily from farms
    by 2050 [147].

    9.3. Drones and Unarmed Vehicles

    Farmers widely use drones for crop growth monitoring, spraying nutrient solutions

    and water, and pesticides in tough terrains and for different crop heights. Drones
    have

    proven their value for spraying speed, area coverage, and precision, compared
    to tradi-

    tional machinery. Due to advancements in technology, drones are equipped with
    various

    sensors, and 3D cameras provide comprehensive capabilities in land management
    by

    farmers. With the addition of UAVs in agriculture, many challenges, particularly
    the in-

    corporation of technologies and use in inclement weather conditions, are addressed
    by

    farmers. Other than drones, robotics in agriculture has also enhanced productivity
    due to

    higher yields achieved by spraying and weeding without human intervention. The
    seeding,

    transplanting, and fruit harvest/picking robots have recently added a new efﬁciency
    level

    to traditional methods.

    The UAV technology in smart agriculture provides information on fertilization,
    ir-

    rigation, use of pesticides, plant growth monitoring, weed management, crop disease

    management, and ﬁeld-level phenotyping to enhance cultivation practices. A new
    method

    of 3D modeling has been used to monitor crop growth parameters to determine the
    height

    of maize and sorghum plants under ﬁeld conditions using UAV, and the average root
    mean

    square error (RMSE) of sorghum height with hand sampling ﬁeld data was 0.33 m
    [148]. The

    UAV and 3D models were also restored to extract leaf area index (LAI) in soybean
    plants,

    the measured LAI predicted accuracy corresponding to the handheld device (R2 =
    0.92)

    was correlated with destructive LAI measurements (R2 = 0.89) [149].

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    19 of 26

    Weed detection and management were assessed by integrating low-resolution multi-

    spectral high-resolution RGB images [150] using the Random Forest (RF) technique
    in

    ﬁeld-grown rice and sugar beet crops [151]. Multi-spectral digital images obtained
    by

    UAVs are used for evaluating vegetation indices (VIs) and multi-temporal VIs to
    predict

    grain yield in wheat [152]. The indices, including the normalized difference vegetation

    index (NDVI), spectral vegetation index (SVI), and green area index (GAI), are
    evaluated in

    wheat crops to predict grain yield [153], monitor breeding [154], detect plant
    stress caused

    by yellow rust disease [155], and quantify plant density [156]. The usage of pesticides
    in

    agriculture is crucial for crop yields and the environment, and efforts have been
    made to

    develop and evaluate an algorithm to self-adjust UAV routes during chemical spraying
    in a

    crop ﬁeld to reduce the waste of pesticides and fertilizers [157].

    9.4. Vertical Farming and Hydroponics

    The shrinking of arable land and rapid urbanization results in greater pressure
    on the

    present resources [158], which causes hardships for food production with current
    agricul-

    ture practices. Vertical farming (VF) navigates land and water shortage challenges,
    and

    is highly suitable for adoption in nearby cities. Hydroponics plays a key role
    in lowering

    water requirements. Hydroponics, along with VF, increases available arable land
    without

    distressing forests and other natural habitats. The presence of advanced technologies,

    especially the IoT, makes the agriculture industry highly remunerative with a
    reduction in

    labor requirements and other resources, in addition to minimizing environmental
    impact.

    9.5. Performance Analysis Using Machine Learning

    Data analytics and machine learning concepts are applied to analyze the real-time

    data. In crop production, identifying the best genes is an important process that
    can be

    conducted using machine learning techniques. In agriculture, machine learning
    is used to

    envisage the best genes suited for crop production, especially for selecting seed
    varieties

    that are highly suitable to speciﬁc climate conditions and locations. Machine
    learning

    algorithms identify high demand products and currently unavailable products. Recent

    developments in machine learning and analytics allow farmers to correctly categorize
    their

    harvests before it is processes and delivered to customers.

    Machine learning (ML) in big data systems solves the issues related to farmers’

    decision-making, crops, animal research, land, food availability and security,
    weather

    and climate change, and weeds [159]. ML-based applications accommodate a large
    number

    of agricultural activities, such as yield prediction based on a deep memory model
    for

    maize [160], binary classiﬁcation model with logistic regression technique to
    assess rainfall

    intensity [161], and a short-term memory model to predict soil water content with
    data

    parameters of rainfall, temperature, water diversion, evaporation, and time for
    the next

    1, 2, and 7 days with greater R2 compared to artiﬁcial neural networks [162].
    As a result,

    the agricultural sector is increasing farmers’ incomes, and so communities are
    further

    integrated into the agricultural value chain to reduce poverty and provide access
    to health

    care, education, and nutritious food for their families [163].

    9.6. Renewable Energy, Microgrids and Smart Grids

    Smart farming requires extensive energy due to power consumption by long-standing

    sensor placement, use of GPS, and data transmission. Traditionally, using renewable
    energy

    sources in remote areas solves long-term power issues. Smart grids and microgrids
    are

    integrated into distributed energy sources (DERs). Recent advances in storage
    devices

    combine electricity and heat systems to stock energy and use the heat produced.

    Globally, smart grid technology enables a smooth transition from traditional to
    smart

    energy systems, ensuring energy security. In developing countries, power-strengthening

    systems integrated with renewable sources have enhanced the transport sector,
    and in-

    creased bioenergy use in the power sector through profuse renewable energy sources

    identiﬁed using smart technologies, such as, energy storage devices, smart appliances,

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    20 of 26

    computational intelligence, and the IoT. For example, the smart grid provides
    a broad

    range of opportunities for power sector reform in Nepal, alleviating the rural
    electricity

    problem by implementing smart microgrids, and subsequently, connecting to the
    national

    grid [164]. The Dayalbagh renewable energy smart microgrid in India is a small-scale

    electricity system comprising distributed loads and renewable energy resources,
    acting as a

    single controllable entity in the grid. The smart microgrids are integrated into
    renewable

    resources and form building blocks of smart grids, especially for the dairy plant
    to produce

    various dairy products [165].

    The mixed integer linear programme (MILP) systematically and efﬁciently managed

    energy consumption and subsequently lowered the cost, especially in residential
    areas,

    by scheduling the use of smart appliances and charging/discharging electric vehicles

    (EVs). The model generates its own energy from a microgrid containing solar panels

    and wind turbines, and forecasts wind speed and solar radiation for effective
    energy

    management. MILP-based energy planning sustains the effectiveness and productiveness

    of energy-efﬁcient techniques [166].

    10. Conclusions

    Smarter and more efﬁcient crop production methodologies are needed to address
    the

    issues of shrinking arable land and the food demands of an increasing world population.

    There is a necessity for everyone to be aware of food security in terms of sustainable

    agriculture. The growth of new technologies for increasing crop yield and encouraging

    the adoption of farming by innovative young people as a legitimate profession.
    This

    paper emphasized the role of many technologies used for farming, particularly
    the IoT,

    in making agriculture smarter and more effective in meeting future requirements.
    The

    current challenges faced by the industry and future prospects are noted to guide
    scholars

    and engineers. Hence, every piece of farmland is important to enhance crop production
    by

    dealing with every inch of land using sustainable IoT-based sensors and communication

    technologies.

    Dana O. Porter, Ruixiu Sui, Suat Irmak, Allan Fulton, Jonathan Aguilar Keywords:   Computer
    modeling, Plant characteristics, Soil water status. Highlights The progress made
    in agricultural irrigation scheduling in the past ten years and the current challenges
    are discussed. The main scientific scheduling strategies are based on soil water
    status, plant characteristics, and crop modeling. Challenges include large time
    and data requirements and availability of decision support systems. Opportunities
    include integration of scheduling strategies and demonstrating their effectiveness
    through local studies. Abstract. Irrigation scheduling is the process of determining
    the appropriate amount and timing of water application to achieve desired crop
    yield and quality, maximize water conservation, and minimize possible negative
    effects on the environment, such as nutrient leaching below the crop root zone.
    Effective irrigation scheduling has been shown to save water, save energy, and
    help agricultural producers achieve improved yields and quality. However, scientific
    irrigation scheduling methods generally have remained limited to mostly research
    applications with relatively low adoption by irrigators. There are several main
    approaches to irrigation scheduling, including those based on soil water status,
    plant characteristics, and/or crop modeling. Each of these approaches has advantages
    as well as limitations and sources of uncertainty and variability, depending on
    application conditions. This article summarizes progress made in the U.S. in each
    of the main scheduling approaches in the past ten years (since the 2010 Decennial
    Irrigation Symposium) and existing challenges and opportunities that should be
    considered moving forward. This article is intended to guide future research and
    extension projects in improving adoption of scientific irrigation scheduling approaches.

    \ have emerged as a popular and cost-\neffective technology to capture high spatial\
    \ and temporal resolution remote sensing (RS) images for a\nwide range of precision\
    \ agriculture applications, which can help reduce costs and environmental\nimpacts\
    \ by providing detailed agricultural information to optimize ﬁeld practices. Furthermore,\n\
    deep learning (DL) has been successfully applied in agricultural applications\
    \ such as weed detection,\ncrop pest and disease detection, etc. as an intelligent\
    \ tool. However, most DL-based methods place\nhigh computation, memory and network\
    \ demands on resources. Cloud computing can increase\nprocessing efﬁciency with\
    \ high scalability and low cost, but results in high latency and great pressure\n\
    on the network bandwidth. The emerging of edge intelligence, although still in\
    \ the early stages,\nprovides a promising solution for artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ (AI) applications on intelligent edge devices\nat the edge of the network close\
    \ to data sources. These devices are with built-in processors enabling\nonboard\
    \ analytics or AI (e.g., UAVs and Internet of Things gateways). Therefore, in\
    \ this paper,\na comprehensive survey on the latest developments of precision\
    \ agriculture with UAV RS and\nedge intelligence is conducted for the ﬁrst time.\
    \ The major insights observed are as follows: (a) in\nterms of UAV systems, small\
    \ or light, ﬁxed-wing or industrial rotor-wing UAVs are widely used in\nprecision\
    \ agriculture; (b) sensors on UAVs can provide multi-source datasets, and there\
    \ are only a\nfew public UAV dataset for intelligent precision agriculture, mainly\
    \ from RGB sensors and a few\nfrom multispectral and hyperspectral sensors; (c)\
    \ DL-based UAV RS methods can be categorized\ninto classiﬁcation, object detection\
    \ and segmentation tasks, and convolutional neural network and\nrecurrent neural\
    \ network are the mostly common used network architectures; (d) cloud computing\
    \ is\na common solution to UAV RS data processing, while edge computing brings\
    \ the computing close to\ndata sources; (e) edge intelligence is the convergence\
    \ of artiﬁcial intelligence and edge computing,\nin which model compression especially\
    \ parameter pruning and quantization is the most important\nand widely used technique\
    \ at present, and typical edge resources include central processing units,\ngraphics\
    \ processing units and ﬁeld programmable gate arrays.\nKeywords: precision agriculture;\

    \ is the foundation of society and national economies, and one of the most\nimportant\
    \ industries in China. Acquiring timely and reliable agriculture information such\n\
    as crop growth and yields is crucial to the establishment of related policies\
    \ and plans for\nfood security, poverty reduction and sustainable development.\
    \ In recent years precision\nagriculture (PA) has developed rapidly, which refers\
    \ to a management strategy that gathers,\nprocesses and analyzes temporal, spatial\
    \ and individual data in agricultural production.\nThis data is combined with\
    \ other information to support management decisions with\nestimated variability\
    \ for improved resource use efﬁciency, productivity, quality, proﬁtability\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2021, 13, 4387. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13214387\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\n\
    Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 4387\n2 of 31\nand sustainability of agricultural production\
    \ according to the International Society of\nPrecision Agriculture (ISPA) [1,2].\
    \ It can help to reduce costs and environmental impacts\nby providing farmers\
    \ with detailed spatial information to optimize ﬁeld practices [3,4].\nThe traditional\
    \ way to get the prerequisite knowledge for PA depends on labor-\nintensive and\
    \ subjective investigation, which consumes a large amount of human time and\n\
    ﬁnancial resources. Since remote sensing (RS) allows for a high frequency of information\n\
    gathering without making physical contact at a low cost [5], it has been widely\
    \ used\nas a powerful tool for rapid, accurate and dynamic agriculture applications\
    \ [6,7]. RS\ndata are mainly collected by three kinds of platforms, i.e., spaceborne,\
    \ airborne, and\nground-based [5]. Spaceborne includes satellite RS and can provide\
    \ large-scale spatial\ncoverage, but can suffer from ﬁxed and long revisit periods\
    \ and cloud occlusion, limiting\nits application for ﬁne-scale PA [8,9]. Additionally,\
    \ relatively low spatial and temporal\nresolution and high equipment costs become\
    \ critical bottlenecks [10]. Ground-based remote\nsensors (onboard vehicles, ships,\
    \ ﬁxed or movable elevated platforms) are suitable for\nsmall scale monitoring.\
    \ In comparison, airborne platforms can collect data with high\nspatial resolution\
    \ and ﬂexibility in terms of ﬂight conﬁgurations such as observation\nangles,\
    \ ﬂight routes [7]. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is a powered, aerial vehicle\n\
    without any human operator, which can ﬂy autonomously or be controlled remotely\
    \ with\nvarious payloads [11]. Due to their advantages in terms of ﬂexible data\
    \ acquisition and\nhigh spatial resolution [12], UAVs are quickly evolving and\
    \ provide a powerful technical\napproach for many applications in PA, for example,\
    \ crop state mapping [13,14], crop\nyield prediction [15,16], diseases detection\
    \ [17,18], weed management [19,20] rapidly\nand nondestructively.\nCompared with\
    \ traditional mechanism-based methods, machine learning (ML) meth-\nods have long\
    \ been applied in a variety of agriculture applications to discover patterns\n\
    and correlations due to their capability to address linear and non-linear issues\
    \ from\nlarge numbers of inputs [7,21]. For example, Su et al. [22] proposed a\
    \ support vector\nmachine-based crop model for large-scale simulation of rice\
    \ production in China, and\nEveringham et al. [23] utilize a random forest model\
    \ to predict sugarcane yield with sim-\nulated and observed variables as inputs.\
    \ An ML pipeline typically consists of feature\nextraction and a classiﬁcation\
    \ or regression module for prediction, and its performance\nheavily relies on\
    \ the handcrafted feature extraction techniques [24,25]. In the past years,\n\
    with the development of computing and storage capability, deep learning (DL),\
    \ which\nis composed of “deep” layers to learn the representation of data with\
    \ multiple levels of\nabstraction and discovers intricate structure in large datasets\
    \ by using the backpropagation\nalgorithm [26], has improved the state-of-the-art\
    \ in a variety of tasks. This includes com-\nputer vision, natural language processing,\
    \ speech recognition etc. In the RS community,\neven for typical PA applications\
    \ with UAV data (e.g., weed detection [27], crops and plants\ncounting [28], land\
    \ cover and crop type classiﬁcation [29]), DL has emerged as an intelligent\n\
    and robust tool [30].\nDL has achieved success with high accuracy for PA, for\
    \ instance, the DL model in [27]\nprovides much better weed detection results\
    \ than ML methods in the bean ﬁeld with a\nperformance gain greater than 20%,\
    \ and more PA applications boosted by DL have shown\nsimilar promising superiority.\
    \ However, the successful implementation of DL comes at\nthe cost of high computational,\
    \ memory and network requirements at both the training\nand inference stages [31].\
    \ For example, the VGG-16, an early classic convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN)\
    \ used for classiﬁcation contains around 140 million parameters, consumes\nover\
    \ 500MB of memory and has 15 billion ﬂoating point of operations (FLOPs) [32].\
    \ It is\nchallenging to deploy deep neural network models in scenarios onboard\
    \ mobile airborne\nand spaceborne platforms with limited computation, storage,\
    \ power consumption, and\nbandwidth resources [33]. To meet the computational\
    \ requirements of DL, a common way\nis to utilize cloud computing, where data\
    \ are moved from the data sources located at the\nnetwork edge such as smartphones\
    \ and internet-of-things (IoT) sensors to the cloud [31].\nHowever, the cloud-computing\
    \ mode might put great pressure on network bandwidth\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 4387\n\
    3 of 31\nand cause signiﬁcant latency when moving massive data across the wide\
    \ area network\n(WAN) [34]. Besides the above, privacy leakage is also a major\
    \ concern [35]. The emerging\nof edge computing fulﬁlls the above-mentioned issues.\n\
    According to the Edge Computing Consortium (ECC), edge computing is a distributed\n\
    open platform at the network edge, close to the things or data sources, and integrating\
    \ the\ncapabilities of networks, storage and applications [36]. In this new computing\
    \ paradigm,\ndata does not need to be sent to a Cloud or other remote centralized\
    \ or distributed systems\nfor further processing. The combination of edge computing\
    \ and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI)\nyields edge intelligence, the next stage of\
    \ edge computing. It aims to use AI technology to\nempower the edge. Edge is a\
    \ relative concept, which refers to any resource, storage, and\nnetwork resource\
    \ from the data source to the cloud-computing center. The resources on\nthis path\
    \ can be regarded as a continuous system. Currently, there is no formal deﬁnition\n\
    of edge intelligence internationally. Most organizations refer to edge intelligence\
    \ as the\nparadigm of running AI algorithms locally on an end device, with data\
    \ created on the\ndevice [34]. It enables the deployment of AI algorithms on intelligent\
    \ edge devices with\nbuilt-in processors for onboard analytics or AI (e.g., UAVs,\
    \ sensors and IoT gateways)\nthat are closer to the data sources [34,37]. However,\
    \ more researchers consider that edge\nintelligence should not be restricted to\
    \ running AI models on edge devices or servers. A\nbroader deﬁnition divides edge\
    \ intelligence into AI for edge (intelligence-enabled edge\ncomputing) and AI\
    \ on edge. The former tries to provide optimal solutions to key problems\nin edge\
    \ computing with AI technologies, while the latter focuses on the way to carry\
    \ out\nthe entire process of building AI models, i.e., model training and inference,\
    \ on the edge [38].\nZhou et al. further present a deﬁnition of six levels to\
    \ fully exploit the available data\nand resources across end devices, edge nodes,\
    \ and cloud datacenters, thus optimizing the\nperformance of training and inferencing\
    \ an AI model [34].\nThere already exist many reviews for agriculture with UAVs\
    \ [2,8,9,39–41] and\nDL [24,42–44]. However, the research and practice of edge\
    \ intelligence are still in an\nearly stage, and to the best of our knowledge,\
    \ there is a literature gap to review the ad-\nvances combining edge intelligence\
    \ and UAV RS in the PA area. Therefore, in this paper we\nattempt to provide an\
    \ in-depth and comprehensive survey on the latest development of PA\nwith UAV\
    \ RS and edge intelligence. The main contributions of this paper are as follows:\n\
    1. The most relevant DL techniques and their latest implementations in PA are\n\
    reviewed in detail. Speciﬁcally, this paper gives a comprehensive publicly available\
    \ UAV-\nbased RS datasets for intelligent agriculture, which attempts to facilitate\
    \ the validation of\nDL-based methods for the community.\n2. The cloud computing\
    \ and edge computing paradigms for the UAV RS in PA are\ndiscussed in this paper.\n\
    3. The relevant edge intelligence techniques are thoroughly reviewed and analyzed\n\
    for UAV RS in PA for the ﬁrst time to the best of our knowledge. Particularly,\
    \ this paper\ngives a compilation of the UAV intelligent edge devices and the\
    \ latest development of edge\ninference with model compression in detail.\nThe\
    \ remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the application\n\
    of UAV RS technology in PA, including the relevant fundamentals of UAV systems,\
    \ RS\nsensors and typical applications in PA. Section 3 gives the DL methods and\
    \ publicly\navailable datasets used in PA. Section 4 emphatically analyzes the\
    \ edge intelligence for\nUAV RS in PA, including the cloud and edge computing\
    \ paradigms, basic concepts and\nmajor components of edge intelligence, network\
    \ model design and edge resources. Future\ndirections are given in Section 5 and\
    \ conclusions are drawn in Section 6.\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 4387\n4 of 31\n\
    2. UAV Remote Sensing in Precision Agriculture\n2.1. UAV Systems and Sensors for\
    \ Precision Agriculture\nUAV systems differ in size, weight, load, power, endurance\
    \ time, purpose etc., and\nthere are many kinds of taxonomic approaches. According\
    \ to the Civil Aviation Adminis-\ntration of China, UAVs mainly serve for military\
    \ and civilian ﬁelds. Agriculture belongs\nto the latter. In terms of the operational\
    \ risk, mainly including the metrics of size, the\nweight of UAVs and the ability\
    \ to carry payloads when performing missions, civilian UAVs\ncan be divided into\
    \ mini UAV, light UAV, small UAV, medium UAV, and large UAV [45].\nTheir major\
    \ characteristics are listed in Table 1. In addition, according to the aerodynamic\n\
    features, UAVs are usually classiﬁed into ﬁxed-wing, rotary-wing, ﬂapping-wing\
    \ and\nhybrid UAVs shown in Table 2 [9,46,47]. For ﬁxed-wing UAVs, the main wing\
    \ surface that\ngenerates lift is ﬁxed relative to the fuselage, and the power\
    \ device generates the forward\nforce. Rotary-wing UAVs possess power devices\
    \ and rotor blades that are rotating relative\nto the fuselage for generating\
    \ lift during ﬂight, and further mainly include unmanned\nhelicopters and multi-rotor\
    \ UAVs, for instance, tricopters, quadcopters, hexacopters and\noctocopters, which\
    \ can take off, land and hover vertically. Flapping-wing UAVs obtain\nlift and\
    \ power by ﬂapping wings up and down like birds and insects, and are suitable\
    \ for\nsmall, light and mini UAVs. The hybrid layout UAVs consists of a combination\
    \ of basic\nlayout types, mainly including tilt-rotor UAVs and rotor/ﬁxed UAVs.\

    6 of 31\n2.2. Application of UAV Remote Sensing in Precision Agriculture\nThe\
    \ major objectives of PA are to increase crop yields, improve product quality,\
    \ make\nefﬁcient use of agrochemical products, save energy and protect the physical\
    \ environment\nagainst pollution [47]. With the advantages of cost-effective,\
    \ high-resolution imagery [67],\nUAVs have now been commonly used in the PA area,\
    \ mainly for monitoring [12,68–70]\nand spraying [71–73]. For the former, different\
    \ sensors onboard UAVs capture RS data,\nwhich are utilized to identify speciﬁc\
    \ spatial features and time variant information of crop\ncharacteristics; for\
    \ the latter, UAV systems are used to spray accurate amounts of pesticides\nand\
    \ fertilizers, thus to mitigate possible diseases and pests and increase crop\
    \ yields and\nproduct quality [47]. RS provides an effective tool for UAV-based\
    \ PA monitoring, and the\nmost common related applications are as follows.\n•\n\
    Weed detection and mapping: As weeds have been responsible for most agricultural\n\
    yield losses, the utilization of herbicides is important in the growth of crops,\
    \ but the\nunreasonable use will cause a series of environmental problems. To\
    \ fulﬁll precision\nweed management [19,74], UAV RS can help to accurately locate\
    \ weed areas, analyze\nweed types and weed density etc., thus using herbicides\
    \ at ﬁxed points quantitatively\nor applying improved and targeted mechanical\
    \ soil tillage [27]. Weeds detection\nand mapping tries to ﬁnd/map the locations\
    \ of weeds in the obtained UAV RS im-\nages, and is achieved generally based on\
    \ the different spatial distribution [27,75],\nshape [76], spectral signatures\
    \ [53,77–79], or their combinations [80] of weeds com-\npared to normal crops.\
    \ Accordingly, the most important sensors as UAV payload\nare mainly RGB sensors\
    \ [27,76,77,80], multispectral sensors [53,78] and hyperspectral\nsensors [79]\
    \ ADDIN.\n•\nCrop pest and disease detection: Field crops are subjected to the\
    \ attack of various\npests and diseases at stages from sowing to harvest, which\
    \ affects the yield and quality\nof crops and become one of the main limits to\
    \ agricultural production in China. As\nthe main part of pest and disease management,\
    \ early detection of pests and diseases\nfrom UAV RS images allows efﬁcient application\
    \ of pesticides and an early response\nto the production costs and environmental\
    \ impact. Crop pest and disease detection\ntries to locate the possible pest or\
    \ disease infected areas on leaves from observed UAV\nRS images, and the detection\
    \ basis is mainly their spectral difference [81]. To obtain\nmore details of pests\
    \ and diseases on leaves, UAVs are usually with low ﬂight height\nfor observations\
    \ with high spatial or spectral resolution [82–84]. Commonly mounted\nsensors\
    \ are RGB sensors [83,85–87], multispectral sensors [88], infrared sensors [89]\n\
    and hyperspectral sensors [82,84].\n•\nCrop growth monitoring: RS can be used\
    \ to monitor group and individual characteris-\ntics of crop growth, e.g., crop\
    \ seedling condition, growth status and changes. Crop\ngrowth information monitoring\
    \ is fundamental for regulating crop growth, diagnosing\ncrop nutrient deﬁciencies,\
    \ analyzing and predicting crop yield etc., and can provide\ndecision-making basis\
    \ for agricultural policy formulation and food trade. Crop growth\nmonitoring\
    \ is to build a multitemporal crop model to allow for comparison of differ-\n\
    ent phenological stages [90], and UAV provides a good platform for obtaining crop\n\
    information [91]. The crop growth is generally quantiﬁed by several indices, such\n\
    as LAI, leaf dry weight, leaf nitrogen accumulation, etc., in which multiple spectral\n\
    bands are usually needed. As a relatively more comprehensive task, sensors onboard\n\
    UAVs are usually multispectral/hyperspectral ones [91,92] or the combination of\
    \ RGB\nand infrared [93] or LiDAR [63].\n•\nCrop yield estimation: Accurate yield\
    \ estimates are essential for predicting the volume\nof stock needed and organizing\
    \ harvesting operations. RS information can be used as\ninput variables or parameters\
    \ to directly or indirectly reﬂect the inﬂuencing factors in\nthe process of crop\
    \ growth and yield formation, alone or in combination with other\ninformation\
    \ for crop yield estimation. It tries to estimate the crop yield by observing\n\
    the morphological characteristics of crops in a non-destructive way [16]. Similar\
    \ to the\ntask of crop growth monitoring, crop yield estimation also relies on\
    \ multiple spectral\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 4387\n7 of 31\nbands for better and\
    \ richer information. Therefore, UAVs are usually equipped with\nmultimodal sensors,\
    \ for example, hyperspectral/multispectral [15,16,94–97], thermal\ninfrared [95],\
    \ and combination with RGB [15,16,94–97] or SAR [66].\n•\nCrop type classiﬁcation:\
    \ Crop type maps are one of the most essential inputs for\nagriculture tasks such\
    \ as crop yield estimation, and accurate crop type identiﬁcation\nis important\
    \ for subsidy control, biodiversity monitoring, soil protection, sustainable\n\
    application of fertilizer etc. There exist practices to explore the discrimination\
    \ of\ndifferent crop types from RS images in complex and heterogeneous environments.\n\
    Crop type classiﬁcation task tries to discriminate different types of crop into\
    \ a map\nbased on the information captured by RS data, and is similar to land\
    \ cover/land\nuse classiﬁcation [98]. According to the demands of different tasks,\
    \ it can be imple-\nmented from different spatial scales. For larger scale classiﬁcation,\
    \ SAR sensors are\nused [64,99,100], and for smaller scale, RGB images from UAVs\
    \ can be utilized [101],\nor with SAR data fused [102].\n3. Deep Learning in Precision\
    \ Agriculture with UAV Remote Sensing\n3.1. Deep Learning Methods in Precision\
    \ Agriculture\nDL is a subset of artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) methods in machine\
    \ learning. DL\nconsists of several connected layers of neurons with activations\
    \ like ANNs, but with\nmore hidden layers and deeper and more complex combinations,\
    \ which is responsible for\nobtaining better learning patterns than a common ANN.\
    \ The concept of DL is proposed in\n2006 by Hinton et al. [103] in which key issues\
    \ for deep ANN training are solved. With\nthe advance of computational capacity\
    \ of computer hardware and the availability of large\namounts of labeled samples,\
    \ the massive training and inference of DL become possible and\nefﬁcient, which\
    \ makes DL outperform traditional ML methods in a variety of applications.\nIn\
    \ the last decade, DL methods have gained increasingly more attention, and become\
    \ the\nde facto mainstream of ML. More fundamental details of DL models such as\
    \ the activation\nfunctions, loss functions, optimizers, basic structures are\
    \ referred to [26].\nAccording to the data type processed and the type of network\
    \ architectures, different\ntypes of DL models are designed and representative\
    \ ones are CNN, recurrent neural\nnetwork (RNN), and generative adversarial network\
    \ (GAN) etc. These three types of\nnetwork architectures are the most widely used\
    \ in agriculture applications, especially for\nthe UAV RS. CNNs are designed to\
    \ deal with grid-like data, such as images, and it is\ntherefore very suitable\
    \ for supervised image processing and computer vision applications.\nIt is usually\
    \ composed of three distinct hierarchical structures, such as convolutional layers,\n\
    pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Typical CNN architectures are AlexNet\
    \ [104],\nGoogleNet [105], and ResNet [106] etc. RNNs, as supervised models, have\
    \ also been\napplied to deal with time-series data via modeling time-related features.\
    \ One typical RNN\narchitecture is long short-term memory with its basic unit\
    \ remembering information from\narbitrary time intervals. Another network architecture\
    \ that is popular and successful in\nrecent years is GAN [107]. A GAN model consists\
    \ of two sub-networks, one is generative\nnetwork and the other is discriminative\
    \ network. Its main idea comes from Zero-Sum\nGame, in which the generative network\
    \ tries to generate samples as vivid as possible and\nthe discriminative network\
    \ tries to discriminate the fake ones and real ones. GANs have\nalso been applied\
    \ to image-to-image translation [108,109], sample augmentation [110,111]\nin the\
    \ ﬁeld of RS.\nIn UAV RS scenarios, most applications utilize images captured\
    \ by cameras as their\ndata inputs, i.e., they are computer vision related tasks.\
    \ In this way, UAV RS tasks in\nPA that uses DL methods (mainly CNN) can be divided\
    \ into three typical and principal\ncomputer vision tasks: classiﬁcation, detection\
    \ and segmentation [112].\n•\nClassiﬁcation tries to predict the presence/absence\
    \ of at least one object of a particular\nobject class in the image, and DL algorithms\
    \ are required to provide a real-valued con-\nﬁdence of the object’s presence.\
    \ Classiﬁcation methods are mainly used to recognize\ncrop diseases [86,113,114],\
    \ weed type [27,115,116], or crop type [117,118].\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 4387\n\
    8 of 31\n•\nDetection tasks try to predict the bounding box of each object of\
    \ a particular object\nclass in the image with associated conﬁdence, i.e., answer\
    \ the question “where are\nthe instances in the image, if any?” It means that\
    \ the extracted object information is\nrelatively more precise. Typical applications\
    \ are ﬁnding the crops with pests [119]\nor other diseases [120], locating the\
    \ weeds in the images [121,122], counting the crop\nnumber for yield estimation\
    \ [123–125] or disaster evaluation [126], etc.\n•\nSegmentation is a task that\
    \ predicts the object label (for semantic segmentation) or\ninstance label (for\
    \ instance segmentation) of each pixel in the test image, which can be\nviewed\
    \ as a more precise classiﬁcation for each pixel. It can not only locate objects,\
    \ but\nalso obtain their pixels at a ﬁner-grained level. Therefore, segmentation\
    \ methods are\nusually used to accurately locate features of interest in images.\
    \ Semantic segmentation\ncan help locate crop leaf diseases [127,128], generating\
    \ weed maps [76,78,129], or\nassessing crop growth [130,131] and yields [132],\
    \ while instance segmentation can\ndetect crop and weed plants [133,134], or conduct\
    \ crop seed phenotyping [135] at a\nﬁner level.\nOverall, the three principal\
    \ kinds of computer vision techniques have played a crucial\nrole in UAV-based\
    \ RS for PA and support various typical applications as mentioned in\nSection\
    \ 2.2, mainly including crop pest and disease detection, weed detection and mapping,\n\
    crop growth monitoring and yield estimation, crop type classiﬁcation etc. Table\
    \ 4 shows a\ncompilation of typical examples in PA using DL methods.\n3.2. Dataset\
    \ for Intelligent Precision Agriculture\nThe sensors integrated with a UAV depend\
    \ on the purpose, size, weight, power\nconsumption etc. A number of reviews discuss\
    \ the sensors on UAVs in the PA ﬁeld, and\nto the best of our knowledge, only\
    \ Zhang et al. [158] listed some datasets in agricultural\ndense scenes, but whether\

    \ UAV RS in Precision Agriculture\n4.1. Cloud and Edge Computing for UAVs\n4.1.1.\
    \ Cloud Computing Paradigm for UAVs\nCloud computing is a computing paradigm that\
    \ provides end-users with infras-\ntructure, platforms, software and other on-demand\
    \ shared services through integrating\nlarge-scale and scalable computing, storage,\
    \ data, applications and other distributed com-\nputing resources over an Internet\
    \ connection [172,173]. The main characteristic of cloud\ncomputing is the change\
    \ in the way resources are used. End-users normally run applica-\ntions on their\
    \ end-devices while the core service and processing are performed on cloud\nservers.\
    \ At the same time, end-users do not need to master the corresponding technology\n\
    or operation skills for device maintenance, but only focus on the required services.\
    \ It\nimproves service quality while reducing operation and maintenance costs.\
    \ The key services\nthat cloud computing offers include infrastructure as a service\
    \ (IAAS), platform as a service\n(PAAS) and software as a service (SAAS) [174].\
    \ The cloud-computing paradigm provides\nthe major following advantages:\n•\n\
    The number of servers in the cloud is huge, providing users with powerful computing\n\
    and storage resources for massive UAV RS data processing.\n•\nCloud computing\
    \ supports users to obtain services at any location from various\nterminals such\
    \ as a laptop or a phone through virtualization.\n•\nCloud computing is a distributed\
    \ computing architecture, and issues such as single-\npoint errors are inevitable.\
    \ The fault-tolerant mechanisms such as copy strategies\nensure high reliability\
    \ for various processing and analysis services.\n•\nCloud centers can dynamically\
    \ allocate or release resources according to the needs of\nspeciﬁc users, and\
    \ can meet the dynamic scale growth requirements of applications\nand users. It\
    \ beneﬁts from the scalability of cloud computing.\nThere exist researches to\
    \ construct cloud-based systems for UAV RS. Jeong et al. [175]\nproposes a UAV\
    \ control system that performs real-time image processing in a cloud system\n\
    and controls a UAV according to these computed results, wherein the UAV contains\
    \ the\nminimal essential control function and shares data with the cloud server\
    \ via WiFi. In [176],\na cloud-based environment for generating yield estimation\
    \ maps from apple orchards is\npresented using UAV images. The DL model for apple\
    \ detection is trained and veriﬁed\nofﬂine in the cloud service of Google Colab,\
    \ along with the aid of GIS tools. Similarly,\nAmpatzidis et al. [143] developed\
    \ a cloud and AI based application, i.e., Agroview to accu-\nrately and rapidly\
    \ process, analyze and visualize data collected from UAVs. Agroview uses\nthe\
    \ Amazon Web Service (AWS) that provides highly reliable and scalable infrastructure\
    \ for\ndeploying cloud-based applications, a main application control machine\
    \ as user interface,\none instance for central processing units (CPU) intensive\
    \ usage like data stitching, and one\ninstance for graphics processing units (GPU)\
    \ intensive usage like tree detection algorithm.\nCurrent cloud-based applications\
    \ generally follow the pipeline as shown in Figure 2a.\nAccording to the pattern\
    \ of cloud computing, it suffers from the following disadvan-\ntages [177]. (a)\
    \ With the growing quantity of data generated at the edge, the speed of\ndata\

    4.1.2. Edge Computing Paradigm for UAVs \nEdge computing fulfills the above-mentioned\
    \ disadvantages by bringing the compu-\nting and storage resources to the edge\
    \ of the network, which is close to mobile devices or \nsensors [177]. In the\
    \ edge computing paradigm, the edge can perform computing offload-\ning, data\
    \ storage, caching and processing, as well as distribute request and delivery\
    \ ser-\nvice from cloud to end-users. In recent years, edge computing has attracted\
    \ tremendous \nattention for its low latency, mobility, proximity to the end-users\
    \ and location awareness, \ncompared to the cloud computing paradigm [137,172,178]\
    \ as shown in Figure 2 (b). Com-\npared with cloud computing, edge computing has\
    \ the following characteristics: \n• \nWith the rapid development of IoT, devices\
    \ around the world generate massive data, \nbut only a few are critical and most\
    \ are temporary, which do not require long-term \nstorage. A large amount of temporary\
    \ data are processed at the edge of the network, \nthereby reducing the pressure\
    \ on network bandwidth and data centers. \n• \nAlthough cloud computing can provide\

    \ computing fulﬁlls the above-mentioned disadvantages by bringing the com-\nputing\
    \ and storage resources to the edge of the network, which is close to mobile devices\n\
    or sensors [177]. In the edge computing paradigm, the edge can perform computing\
    \ of-\nﬂoading, data storage, caching and processing, as well as distribute request\
    \ and delivery\nservice from cloud to end-users. In recent years, edge computing\
    \ has attracted tremendous\nattention for its low latency, mobility, proximity\
    \ to the end-users and location aware-\nness, compared to the cloud computing\
    \ paradigm [137,172,178] as shown in Figure 2b.\nCompared with cloud computing,\
    \ edge computing has the following characteristics:\n•\nWith the rapid development\
    \ of IoT, devices around the world generate massive data,\nbut only a few are\
    \ critical and most are temporary, which do not require long-term\nstorage. A\
    \ large amount of temporary data are processed at the edge of the network,\nthereby\
    \ reducing the pressure on network bandwidth and data centers.\n•\nAlthough cloud\
    \ computing can provide services for mobile devices to make up for\ntheir lack\
    \ of computing, storage, power resources, the network transmission speed is\n\
    limited by the development of communication technology, and there are issues such\n\
    as unstable links and routing in a complex network environment. These factors\
    \ can\ncause high latency, excessive jitter and slow data transmission speed,\
    \ thus reducing\nthe response of cloud services. Edge computing provides services\

    \ processing\nand storage resources. Similarly, Deng et al. [137] used a lightweight\
    \ segmentation model\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 4387\n14 of 31\nfor real-time weed\
    \ mapping on a NIVIDA Jetson TX board. Camargo et al. [115] specially\noptimized\
    \ ResNet model and changed it from 32-bit to 16-bit to reduce computing on an\n\
    NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier embedded system. Many researchers [179,180] also exploited\n\
    the acceleration of traditional image processing algorithms for various RS data\
    \ types on\nUAV platforms.\n4.2. Edge Intelligence: Convergence of AI and Edge\
    \ Computing\nArtiﬁcial intelligence methods are computationally and storage intensive.\
    \ Although it\ncan achieve excellent performance in most applications, it also\
    \ places high computing and\nstorage demands on resources, making it challenge\
    \ for real applications. The emerging of\nedge computing solves the above key\
    \ problems in artiﬁcial intelligence applications on\nedge devices. The combination\
    \ of edge computing and artiﬁcial intelligence yields edge\nintelligence [38].\
    \ Currently, there is no formal deﬁnition for edge intelligence internationally.\n\
    Edge intelligence is regarded as the paradigm of running AI algorithms locally\
    \ on an\nintelligent edge device [34]. Researchers also try to give a broader\
    \ deﬁnition, which\nmainly includes AI for edge and AI on edge. The former part\
    \ solves the problems in\nedge computing with AI, while the latter is the common\
    \ deﬁnition [34] and the focus of\nthis paper. In edge intelligence applications,\
    \ edge devices can reduce the amount of data\ntransferred to the central cloud\
    \ and greatly save bandwidth resources. Meanwhile, running\nDL models at edge\
    \ devices has lower computing consumption, higher performance, and\ncan avoid\
    \ possible privacy risks.\nIn the scope of this review, the combination of intelligent\
    \ UAV RS and edge computing\nresults in more effective PA applications. To obtain\
    \ better performance, DL models tend\nto be designed deeper and more complex,\
    \ which inevitably causes delays. Limited by\nprocessing and storage resources,\
    \ these complex DL models can hardly be directly applied\nto UAVs. Much work needs\
    \ to be fulﬁlled before implementing on the resources-limited\nUAV edge platforms\
    \ for efﬁcient PA applications. According to existing work, the major\ncomponents\
    \ of edge intelligence include: (a) edge caching, a distributed data system\n\
    near end users to collect and store the data produced by edge devices and surrounding\n\
    environments, and also the data received from the Internet; (b) edge training,\
    \ a distributed\nlearning procedure that learns the optimal models with the training\
    \ set cached at the edge;\n(c) edge inference, which infers the testing instance\
    \ on edge devices and servers using a\ntrained model or algorithm; and d) edge\
    \ ofﬂoading, a distributed computing paradigm\nthat offers computing service for\
    \ edge caching, edge training and edge inference [181]. As\nfor UAV RS in PA,\
    \ the existing studies mainly focus on edge training and edge inference,\nespecially\
    \ the inference onboard UAVs. On the other hand, for an edge intelligence system\n\
    and industrial ecosystem, algorithms and computing resources are the key elements.\
    \ As a\nresult, we discuss the relevant developments from the perspectives of\
    \ model design and\nedge resources for the edge intelligence in PA with UAV RS\
    \ in Sections 4.3 and 4.4.\n4.3. Lightweight Network Model Design\nTo obtain higher\
    \ classification, detection or segmentation accuracy, the deep CNN models\nare\
    \ designed with deeper, wider and more complex architectures, which inevitably\
    \ leads\nto computation-intensive and storage-intensive algorithms on computing\
    \ devices. When it\ncomes to edge devices, especially UAVs, their limited computing,\
    \ storage, power consumption\nand bandwidth resources can hardly meet the requirements\
    \ of intelligent applications.\nResearch has found that the structure of deep\
    \ neural networks is redundant. Based\non this property, the compression of deep\
    \ neural networks will therefore greatly ease the\nburden of inference and accelerate\
    \ computing to accommodate the usage on UAV platforms.\nIn recent years, researchers\
    \ have made great efforts to compress and accelerate deep neural\nnetwork models\
    \ from the aspects of algorithm optimization, hardware implementation\nand co-design\
    \ [182]. The work in [183] by Han et al. is widely considered to be the ﬁrst\n\
    to systematically carry out deep model compression. Its main work includes pruning\n\
    network connections to keep the more important ones only, quantitating model parameters\n\
    Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 4387\n15 of 31\nto reduce the model volume and improve\
    \ the efﬁciency, and further compressing the\nmodel through Huffman Coding. Through\
    \ model compression, it is conducive to reducing\ncomputing, memory and power\
    \ consumption, which makes it easier to be deployed to the\nUAV systems.\nThe\
    \ mainstream deep model compression methods can be divided into the following\n\
    categories: (1) lightweight convolution design, (2) parameter pruning, (3) low-rank\
    \ factor-\nization, (4) parameter quantization, and (5) knowledge distillation.\
    \ Each tries to compress\nthe model from different aspects, and they are always\
    \ used with the combination. Table 6\nshows a compilation of lightweight inference\
    \ applications onboard UAVs for PA. As shown\nin Table 6, the research of the\
    \ edge inference of UAV RS in the PA ﬁeld is in the starting\nstage yet, and there\
    \ are only a few attempts at general model quantization and pruning\nmethods.\
    \ Hence, we describe the categories and the corresponding development in details,\n\
    taking more domains in addition to agriculture for edge inference onboard UAVs\
    \ into\nconsideration below.\nTable 6. A compilation of lightweight inference\

    \ Convolution Design\nLightweight convolution design refers to the compact design\
    \ of convolutional ﬁlters.\nThe convolutional ﬁlter is actually used for translation\
    \ invariant feature extraction, and\nmakes up the majority of CNN operations.\
    \ Therefore, lightweight convolution design has\nbeen a hot research direction\
    \ in DL.\nIt tries to replace the original heavy convolutional ﬁlters with compact\
    \ ones. Speciﬁ-\ncally, it transforms the convolutional ﬁlter with large size\
    \ into several smaller-sized ones\nand concatenates their results to achieve equivalent\
    \ convolution results, as smaller-sized\nﬁlters calculate much faster. Typical\
    \ designs are SqueezeNet [187], MobileNet [188], and\nShufﬂeNet [189]. SqueezeNet\
    \ designs a ﬁre module composed of a squeeze layer with\n1×1 ﬁlters to reduce\
    \ the input channels, and an expanding layer with a mix of 1×1 and\n3×3 ﬁlters.\
    \ MobileNet adopts the idea of depthwise separable convolutions to reduce\nthe\
    \ volume of parameters and computations, in which depthwise convolutions are used\n\
    for feature extraction and pointwise convolutions are deployed to build feature\
    \ via lin-\near combinations of input channels. ShufﬂeNet designs with group convolution\
    \ and\nchannel shufﬂe to reduce parameters, and can obtain similar results compared\
    \ with the\noriginal convolutions.\nIn [190], a DL ﬁre recognition algorithm is\
    \ proposed for embedded intelligent forest\nﬁre monitoring using UAVs. It is based\
    \ on the lightweight MobileNet V3 to reduce\nthe complexity of the conventional\
    \ YOLOv4 network architecture. With regards to the\nmodel parameters, a decline\
    \ of 63.91% from 63.94 million to 23.08 million is obtained.\nEgli et al. [184]\
    \ designs a computationally lightweight CNN with a sequential model design\nwith\
    \ four consecutive convolution/pooling layers for tree species classiﬁcation that\
    \ uses\nhigh-resolution RGB images from automated UAV observations, which outperforms\
    \ several\ndifferent architectures on the available data set. Similarly, in order\
    \ to accommodate the\nreal-time performance on UAVs, Hua et al. [191] designs\
    \ a lightweight E-Mobile Net as the\nbackbone network of feature extraction for\
    \ real-time tracking.\n4.3.2. Parameter Pruning\nIn deep models, not all parameters\
    \ contribute to the outstanding discriminative\nperformance, thus many of them\
    \ can be removed from the network while having the least\neffect on the accuracy\
    \ of the trained models. Based on the principle, parameter pruning\ntries to prune\
    \ out the redundant non-informative parameters from convolutional layers\nand\
    \ fully connected layers for less computational operations and memory consumption.\n\
    There are several ways of pruning with different granularity. Some unimportant\n\
    weight connection can be pruned out with certain threshold [192]. Similarly, individual\n\
    redundant neurons, along with their input and output connections, can be pruned\
    \ [193].\nFurthermore, the ﬁlters composed of neurons can also be removed according\
    \ to their\nimportance which is indicated by L1 or L2 norm [194]. With the coarsest\
    \ granularity, layers\nthat are least informative can also be pruned, as shown\
    \ in [185]. As for connection-level\nand neuron-level pruning, they introduce\
    \ unstructured sparse connections in the network,\nwhich will also affect the\
    \ computational efﬁciency. On the contrary, ﬁlter-level and layer-\nlevel pruning\
    \ does not interfere with the normal forward computing, which can therefore\n\
    compress the model and accelerate the model inference. Worth noting that pruning\
    \ is\nalways accompanied with model ﬁne-tuning.\nWang et al. [190] eliminated\
    \ the redundant channels through channel-level sparsity-\ninduced regularization,\
    \ and achieved a signiﬁcant drop of model parameter number and\ninference time\
    \ by over 95% and 75% but with comparable accuracy, thus making it suitable\n\
    for real-time ﬁre monitoring on UAV platforms. [185] adopts two ways of pruning,\
    \ with one-\nshot pruning to achieve the desired compression ratio in a single\
    \ step and iterative pruning\nto gradually remove connections until obtaining\
    \ the targeted compression ratio. The model\nis retrained to readapt the parameters\
    \ after pruning iterations to recover the accuracy\ndrop. Aiming at secure edge\
    \ computing for agricultural object detection application,\nRemote Sens. 2021,\
    \ 13, 4387\n17 of 31\nFan et al. [195] use layer pruning and ﬁlter pruning together\
    \ to achieve a smaller structure\nand maximize real-time performance.\n4.3.3.\
    \ Low-rank Factorization\nLow-rank factorization tries to factorize a large weight\
    \ matrix or tensor into several\nsmaller dimension matrices or tensors. It can\
    \ be applied to both convolutional layer\nand fully-connected layer. When convolutional\
    \ ﬁlters are factorized, it will make the\ninference process faster, and when\
    \ applied to denser fully-connected layers, it will remove\nredundancy and reduce\
    \ the storage requirements.\nLebedev et al. [196] explore the low-rank factorization\
    \ of deep network through\ntensor decomposition and discriminative ﬁne-tuning.\
    \ Based on CP-decomposition, they\ndecompose the original convolutional layer\
    \ into a sequence of four layers with smaller\nﬁlters, thus reducing the computations.\
    \ Similarly, famous factorization methods like Tucker\ndecomposition [197], and\
    \ singular value decomposition [198,199] are also widely applied\nwith low-rank\
    \ constraints in the model training process to reduce the number of parameters\n\
    and speed-up the network.\nTo meet the severe constraints of typical embedded\
    \ systems in the applications for grape\nleaf disease detection, a low-rank CNN\
    \ architecture LR-Net based on Tensor decomposition\nis developed in [200] for\
    \ both convolutional layer and fully-connected layer, and the obvious\nperformance\
    \ gain is obtained compared with other lightweight network architectures.\n4.3.4.\
    \ Parameter Quantization\nThe intention of parameter quantization is to reduce\
    \ the volume of the trained model\nduring storage and transmission. Generally,\
    \ weights in deep models are stored as 32-bit\nﬂoating-point numbers. If their\
    \ number of bits is reduced, it will lead to the reduction of\noperations and\
    \ model sizes.\nIn recent years, low-bit quantization is becoming popular for\
    \ deep model compression\nand acceleration. There are two types of quantization,\
    \ one is parameter sharing for the\ntrained model, and the other is the low-bit\
    \ representation for model training. Parameter\nsharing designs a function that\
    \ maps various weight parameters to the same value. In [201],\na new network architecture\
    \ HashedNets is designed, in which the weight parameters are\nrandomly mapped\
    \ to hash bucket through hash function and every parameter shares the\nsame weight\
    \ value. [202] develops an approximation that quantizes the gradients to 8-bit\n\
    for GPU cluster parallelism. Further, [203] proposes incremental network quantization\n\
    method that lossless quantizes parameters to low 5-bit. The challenging binary\
    \ neural\nnetwork [137] is also in the spot of researches.\nTo develop a lightweight\
    \ network architecture for weed mapping tasks onboard\nUAVs, [137] conducted optimization\
    \ and precision calibration during the inference process.\nThe precision was reduced\
    \ from 32-bit to 16-bit. Similarly, Camargo et al. [115] shifted\ntheir ResNet-18\
    \ model from 32-bit to 16-bit and observed speed performance decline on\nNVIDIA\
    \ Jetson AGX Xavier. To be able to execute deep models efﬁciently in embedded\n\
    platforms, Blekos et al. [186] perform quantization on the trained U-Net model\
    \ to 8-bit\nintegers with acceptable losses.\n4.3.5. Knowledge Distillation\n\
    The main objective of knowledge distillation is to train a student network from\
    \ the\nteacher network while maintaining its generalization capability [204].\
    \ The student network\nis lighter, i.e., having a smaller model size and less\
    \ computation, but with the same or\ncomparable performance as the larger network.\n\
    Great efforts have been done to improve the supervision of student network by\n\
    different knowledge transferred. Romero et al. [205] proposed a FitNets model\
    \ which\nteaches the student network to imitate the hints from both middle layers\
    \ and output layer\nof the teach network. Instead of hard labels that are used,\
    \ the work in [206] utilizes soft\nlabels as the representation from teacher network.\
    \ Kim et al. [207] proposed a paraphrasing\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 4387\n18 of\
    \ 31\nbased knowledge transfer method which uses convolution operations to paraphrase\
    \ the\nteacher model knowledge and translate it to a student model. From the point\
    \ of teacher\nnetworks, student networks can also learn knowledge from multiple\
    \ teachers [208].\nIn the ﬁeld of UAV based deep model inference, knowledge distillation\
    \ is a promising\ndirection. In [209], YOLO + MobileNet model acts as the teacher\
    \ network, while the pruned\nmodel functions as the student network, and knowledge\
    \ distillation algorithm is used to\nimprove the detection accuracy of the pruned\
    \ model. Qiu et al. [210] propose to distill\nknowledge to a lighter distilled\
    \ network through soft labels from trained teacher network\nMobileNet. Similar\
    \ applications using knowledge distillation for model compression can\nbe found\
    \ in [211,212].\n4.4. Edge Resources for UAV RS\nThe key idea of edge computing\
    \ is that computing should be closer to the data sources\nand users. It can avoid\
    \ massive data transfer to the cloud and process data near the places\nwhere things\
    \ and people produce or consume data, thus reducing the latency, pressure on\n\
    network bandwidth and demand for computing and storage resources. Edge is a relative\n\
    concept to the network core. It refers to any resource, storage, and network resource\
    \ from\nthe data source to the cloud-computing center. The resources on this path\
    \ (from the data\nsources to cloud centers) can be regarded as a continuous system.\
    \ Generally, the resources\nat the edge mainly include user terminals such as\
    \ mobile phones and personal computers,\ninfrastructure such as WiFi access points,\
    \ cellular network base stations and routers, and\nembedded devices such as cameras\
    \ and set-top boxes. These numerous resources around\nusers are independent of\
    \ each other, which are called edge nodes. In this paper, we focus\non the scope\
    \ of AI on edge among the edge intelligence, which is to run AI models on\nintelligent\
    \ edge devices. Such devices have built-in processors with onboard analytics\n\
    or AI capabilities, mainly including sensors, UAVs, autonomous cars, etc. Rather\
    \ than\nuploading, processing and storing data to a cloud, intelligent edge devices\
    \ offer the ability\nto process certain amounts of data directly, while reducing\
    \ latency, bandwidth requirement,\ncost, privacy threats, etc.\nFor the scenario\
    \ of edge computing for UAV RS in PA, applications can be deployed\non the UAV\
    \ intelligent edge devices with embedded computing platforms or edge servers.\n\
    Here in this paper we mainly discuss the former. To accelerate the processing\
    \ of complex\nDL models, a few types of onboard hardware accelerators are mainly\
    \ included in UAV\nsolutions currently.\nThe following list the popular examples,\
    \ which are divided into the general-purpose\nCPU based solutions, GPU solutions\
    \ and ﬁeld programmable gate arrays (FPGA) solutions.\nVery few studies also use\
    \ microcontroller unit (MCU) [213] and vision processing unit\n(VPU) [214] for\
    \ UAV image recognition and monitoring.\n•\nGeneral-purpose CPU based solutions:\
    \ Multi-core CPUs are latency-oriented archi-\ntectures, which have more computational\
    \ power per core, but less number of cores,\nand are more suitable for task-level\
    \ parallelism [215,216]. As for the general-purpose\nsoftware-programmable platforms,\
    \ Raspberry Pi has been widely adopted as ready-\nto-use solutions for a variety\
    \ of UAV applications due to their weight, size and low\npower consumption.\n\
    •\nGPU solutions: GPUs have been designed as throughput-oriented architectures,\
    \ and\nown less powerful cores than that of CPUs but have hundreds or thousands\
    \ of cores\nand signiﬁcantly larger memory bandwidth, which make GPUs suitable\
    \ for data-level\nparallelism [215]. In recent years, the embedded GPUs especially\
    \ from NVIDIA, for\nexample, the Jetson boards, standing out among the other manufacturers\
    \ have been\nwidely used to provide ﬂexible solutions compared with FPGAs.\n•\n\
    FPGA solutions: The advent of FPGA-based embedded platforms allows combin-\ning\
    \ high-level management capabilities of processors and ﬂexible operations of pro-\n\
    grammable hardware [217]. With the advantages of: a) relatively smaller size and\n\
    weight compared with clusters, multi-core and many-core processors, b) signiﬁcantly\n\
    Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 4387\n19 of 31\nlower power consumption compared with GPUs,\
    \ and c) reprogrammed ability during\nthe ﬂight different from application-speciﬁc\
    \ integrated circuit (ASIC), FPGA-based\nplatforms such as the Xilinx Zynq-7000\
    \ family provide plenty of solutions for real-time\nprocessing onboard UAVs [218].\n\

    21 of 31\n5. Future Directions\nDespite the great progress of DL and UAV RS techniques\
    \ in the PA ﬁeld, the research\nand practice of edge intelligence, especially\
    \ in PA is still in an early stage. In addition to\ncommon challenges in PA, UAV\
    \ RS and edge intelligence, here we list a few speciﬁc issues\nthat need to be\
    \ addressed within the scope of this paper.\n•\nLightweight intelligent model\
    \ design in PA for edge inference. As mentioned in\nSection 4, most DL-based models\
    \ for UAV RS data processing and analytics in PA\nare highly resources intensive.\
    \ Hardware with powerful computing capability is\nimportant to support the training\
    \ and inference of these large AI models. Currently,\nthere are just a few studies\
    \ towards applying common parameter pruning and quanti-\nzation methods in PA\
    \ with UAV RS. The metrics of size and efﬁciency can be further\nimproved by considering\
    \ the data and algorithm characteristics and exploiting other\nsophisticated model\
    \ compression techniques such as knowledge distillation and a com-\nbination of\
    \ multiple compression methods [183]. In addition, instead of using existing\n\
    AI models, the neural architecture search (NAS) technique [243] can be utilized\
    \ to de-\nrive models tailored to the hardware resource constraints on the performance\
    \ metrics,\ne.g., latency and energy efﬁciency considering the underlying edge\
    \ devices [34].\n•\nTransfer learning and incremental learning for intelligent\
    \ PA models on UAV edge\ndevices. The performance of many DL models heavily relies\
    \ on the quantity and\nquality of datasets. However, it is difﬁcult or expensive\
    \ to collect a large amount\nof data with labels. Therefore, edge devices can\
    \ exploit transfer learning to learn a\ncompetitive model, in which a pre-trained\
    \ model with a large-scale dataset is further\nﬁne-tuned according to the domain-speciﬁc\
    \ data [244,245]. Secondly, edge devices\nsuch as UAVs may collect data with different\
    \ distributions or even data belonging to\nan unknown class compared with the\
    \ original training data during ﬂight. The model\non the edge devices can be updated\
    \ by incremental learning to give better prediction\nperformance [246].\n•\nCollaboration\
    \ of RS cloud centers, ground control stations and UAV edge devices. To\nbridge\
    \ the gap between the low computing and storage capabilities of edge devices\n\
    and the high resource requirements of DL training, the collaborative computing\n\
    between the end, the edge and the cloud is a possible solution. It has become\
    \ the trend\nfor edge intelligence architectures and application scenes. A good\
    \ cloud-edge-end\ncollaboration architecture should take into account the characteristics\
    \ of heterogeneous\ndevices, asynchronous communication and diverse computing\
    \ and storage resources,\nthus achieving collaborative model training and inference\
    \ [247]. In the conventional\nmode, the model training is often performed in the\
    \ cloud, and the trained model is\ndeployed on edge devices. This mode is simple,\
    \ but cannot fully utilize resources. For\nthe case of edge intelligence for UAV\
    \ RS in PA, decentralized edge devices and data\ncenters can cooperate with each\
    \ other to train or improve a model by using federated\nlearning [248].\n6. Conclusions\n\
    This paper gives a systematic and comprehensive overview of the latest development\n\
    of PA promoted by UAV RS and edge intelligence techniques. We ﬁrst introduce the\n\
    application of UAV RS in PA, including the fundamentals of various types of UAV\
    \ systems\nand sensors and typical applications to give a preliminary picture.\
    \ The latest development\nof DL methods and public datasets in PA with UAV RS\
    \ are then presented. Subsequently,\nwe give a thorough analysis of the development\
    \ of edge intelligence in PA with UAV RS,\nincluding the cloud computing and edge\
    \ computing paradigms, the basic concepts and\nmajor components (i.e., edge caching,\
    \ edge training, edge inference and edge ofﬂoading)\nof edge intelligence, the\
    \ developments from the perspectives of network model design and\nedge resources.\
    \ Finally, we present several issues that need to be further addressed.\nThrough\
    \ this survey, we provide preliminary insights into how PA beneﬁts from\nUAV RS\
    \ together with edge intelligence. In recent years, the small and light, ﬁxed-wing\
    \ or\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 4387\n22 of 31\nindustrial rotor-wing UAV systems\
    \ have been widely adopted in PA. Due to the advantages\nof easy-to-use, high\
    \ ﬂexibility, high resolution and being less affected by clouds during\nﬂight\
    \ at low altitudes, UAV RS has become a powerful manner to monitor agricultural\n\
    conditions. In addition, the integration of DL techniques in PA with UAV RS reached\n\
    higher accuracies compared with traditional analysis methods. These PA applications\
    \ have\nbeen transformed into computer vision tasks including classiﬁcation, object\
    \ detection and\nsegmentation, and CNN and RNN are the most widely adopted network\
    \ architectures.\nThere are also a few publicly available UAV datasets for intelligent\
    \ PA, mainly from RGB\nsensors and very few from multispectral and hyperspectral\
    \ sensors. These datasets can\nfacilitate the validation and comparison of DL\
    \ methods. However, deep models generally\nbring higher computing, memory and\
    \ network requirements, hence cloud computing is a\ncommon solution to increase\
    \ efﬁciency with high scalability and low cost, but at the cost of\nhigh latency\
    \ and pressure on the network bandwidth. The emerging of edge computing\nbrings\
    \ the computing to the edge of the network close to the data sources. The AI and\
    \ edge\ncomputing further yield edge intelligence, providing a promising solution\
    \ for efﬁcient\nintelligent UAV RS applications. In terms of hardware, typical\
    \ computing solutions include\nCPUs, GPUs and FPGAs. From the perspectives of\
    \ algorithm, lightweight model design\nderiving from model compression techniques\
    \ especially model pruning and quantization\nis one of the most signiﬁcant and\
    \ widely used technique. The PA supported by advanced\nUAV RS and edge intelligence\
    \ techniques offers the capabilities to increase productivity\nand efﬁciency while\
    \ reducing costs.\nThe research and practice of edge intelligence, especially\
    \ in PA with UAV RS is still in\nan early stage. In the future, in addition to\
    \ the general challenges of PA, UAV RS and edge\nintelligence, there are issues\
    \ within the scope of this paper that need to be addressed. These\ndirections\
    \ can include designing and implementing lightweight models for PA with UAV\n\
    RS on edge devices, realizing transfer learning and incremental learning for intelligent\n\
    PA models on UAV edge devices, and efﬁcient collaboration of RS cloud centers,\
    \ ground\ncontrol stations and UAV edge devices.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    Agriculture plays an important role in the making and development of a country.\
    \ In India, agriculture is \nthe primary source of living for more than about\
    \ 60% of its population. The agriculture-related issues \nalways hinder the development\
    \ of a country. The enhancement of traditional agriculture methods and \nits modernization\
    \ towards smart agriculture is the only solution for agriculture problems. Hence,\
    \ by \nconsidering this issue, a framework is presented for smart agriculture\
    \ using sensor network and IoT. The \nkey features of this system are the deployment\
    \ of smart sensors for the collection of data, cloud-based \nanalysis, and decision\
    \ based on monitoring for spraying and weeding. The smart farming approach \n\
    provides valuable collection of data, high precision control, and automated monitoring\
    \ approach. \nThe proposed system presents smart agriculture monitoring system\
    \ that collects and monitors the \nsoil moisture, environmental temperature, and\
    \ humidity. The measured soil moisture, temperature, \nand humidity are stored\
    \ in ThingSpeak cloud for analysis.\nKEywoRdS\nInternet of Things (IoT), Precision\
    \ Agriculture, Productivity, ThingSpeak Cloud Platform, Wireless Sensor \nNetworks\
    \ (WSNs)\n1. INTRodUCTIoN\nPrecision agriculture is a method in which farmers\
    \ optimize inputs such as water and fertilizer for \nthe enhancement of productivity,\
    \ quality and yield (Srbinovska et al., 2015). The term precision \nagriculture\
    \ also encourages for minimizing pests and diseases through specially target application\
    \ \nof precise amount of pesticides. Smart agriculture or precision agriculture\
    \ is an integrated farm \nmanagement framework which constitutes a holistic management\
    \ approach aiming to optimize the \nyield per unit of farming land. Increasing\
    \ the quantity and quality of agricultural products while \nutilizing less inputs\
    \ such as fertilizers, water, pesticides, energy, etc., results in cost reduction\
    \ with \npositive environmental impact (Mekala and Viswanathan, 2017). Therefore,\
    \ rather than applying the \nsame amount of fertilizers over the entire agricultural\
    \ field or applying fertilizers to specially target \narea helps in overall cost\
    \ reduction. The smart agriculture solution measures the variation in field \n\
    conditions and adapts the fertilization or feed strategy accordingly (TongKe,\
    \ 2013). Farmers as the \nprincipal stakeholders usually make complex decisions\
    \ without proper information and execute the \nInternational Journal of Agricultural\
    \ and Environmental Information Systems\nVolume 12 • Issue 2 • April-June 2021\n\
    2\ndemanding field operations. Therefore, smart agriculture solutions are best\
    \ designed considering \nfarmers at the center of the process. The solutions of\
    \ smart agriculture complements and transforms \nthe skills and experiences gained\
    \ naturally through the generations (Chhetri et al., 2017). The smart \nsolution\
    \ can complement the farmer’s capabilities in three main processes. The three\
    \ sub-processes \nare presented in Figure 1. The sub-processes are data collection,\
    \ decision making, and intervention. \nThe data collection is a part where remote\
    \ sensing and sensor networks are utilized. In the decision \nmaking part, expert\
    \ systems and machine learning can be exploited. The third part is an intervention\
    \ \nwhere intelligent machinery and robotic agents can be utilized for field operations.\
    \ The complete \ntypical process cycle includes data collection for measuring\
    \ such as soil moisture, temperature, PH, \nhumidity, or multi-spectral images.\
    \ The data collection process is followed by the data analysis which \nproduces\
    \ a description for the pesticides, irrigation, fertilizers, and harvest. The\
    \ last component of \nthe process is an automated intervention which executes\
    \ the description maps on the field area using \nvariable rate technology machinery.\
    \ This cycle can monitors the possible areas of concern like soil, \nvegetation,\
    \ or the environment. In addition to this farmer, related sub-processes smart\
    \ agriculture can \nbe designed to provide extra benefits. The benefits for external\
    \ functions such as soil and environment \nmonitoring, traceability of food, and\
    \ specific bookkeeping facilitating national planning (Mekala and \nViswanathan,\
    \ 2017). The recent survey presents the decreasing level of waters and drying\
    \ up of major \nwater resources such as rivers and tanks, presents efficient utilization\
    \ of water resources (Veena et \nal., 2018). The technological evolution of WSNs\
    \ and IoT made it possible to monitor the environment \nand agricultural fields\
    \ for gaining the production (Khanna and Kaur, 2019). \nThese technologies are\
    \ in different levels of maturity and adoption across all over the world. \nTherefore,\
    \ more than often technology introduction to different communities needs to be\
    \ planned \nand driven by the relevant authorities. The blind technology or solutions\
    \ should account for the wide \ndiversity of agriculture for the following characteristics\
    \ particularly farm size, farming types, farming \npractices, level of yield,\
    \ and employment (Patil and Kale, 2016). These are the major challenges in \n\
    the technology of smart agriculture. The technology and their solutions should\
    \ be customized and \nadapted accordingly. In general, the factors that affect\
    \ technology adoption in agriculture are yield gap, \nfarm size, and the learning\
    \ required for the integration of new technologies with the existing practices\
    \ \n(Elijah el al., 2018). On the other hand, smart agriculture solutions affect\
    \ farming economics through \nmultiple channels. Hence solution design should\
    \ evaluate farming economics in different levels of \nanalysis. The smart agriculture\
    \ solution can reduce operational costs by optimizing the user inputs. \nFigure\

    \ and Environmental Information Systems\nVolume 12 • Issue 2 • April-June 2021\n\
    3\nEven if the operational cost is increased under precision agriculture, yields\
    \ can grow enough to increase \nthe operating benefit. The smart agriculture solutions\
    \ are built on the several enabling technologies \ninvolving sensor technology,\
    \ global navigation satellite system (used for positioning), remote \nsensing,\
    \ data storage and analysis, variable rate technology, advisory systems and interconnected\
    \ \ncommunications, autonomous navigation and intelligent machinery (Lakshmisudha\
    \ et al., 2016). Some \nof these technologies recently presented relatively high\
    \ investments and adoption rates. The main \nidea is the design a system that\
    \ can collect data in real-time from deployed sensors, analysis of data \nbased\
    \ on cloud platform and decision based on monitoring for spraying and weeding.\
    \ The proposed \nsystem collects and monitors the soil moisture, environmental\
    \ temperature and humidity. The control \nstation processes the collected information\
    \ for the decision making without human intervention. \nThe measured soil moisture,\
    \ temperature and humidity are stored in ThingSpeak cloud for analysis.\nThe remaining\
    \ manuscript is organized as follows: Section 2 provides the related works on\
    \ \nprecision agriculture and smart agriculture based on IoT and cloud systems.\
    \ Section 3 discusses the \nsystem design and the operational layers of the proposed\
    \ model. Section 4 presents the experimental \nsetup and the hardware/software\
    \ used for the experimentation. The observed results and analysis are \ndiscussed\
    \ in section 5 followed by the conclusion of the framework in section 6.\n2. RELATEd\
    \ woRK\nThe major rising issues of agriculture such as decreasing water levels\
    \ (rivers and tanks) and \nenvironmental factors that need to be addressed and\
    \ requires a solution based on smart agriculture. \n(Liqiang et al., 2011) presented\
    \ a system for monitoring crops utilizing temperature and moisture \nsensors.\
    \ (Ocampo et al., 2017) developed an algorithm based on temperature and soil moisture\
    \ values \nand the sensed information is processed through the gateway for controlling\
    \ water quantity. Their \nproposed system has duplex communication links and power\
    \ through photovoltaic panels. Their \nsystem utilizes a cellular network interface\
    \ for data transmission and its calculations for irrigation \nscheduling. The\
    \ advancement in the field of wireless sensor networks has helped the evolution\
    \ of \nmany approaches for precision agriculture applications. (Chaudhary et al.,\
    \ 2011) have presented a \nsystem that utilizes WSNs for monitoring and controlling\
    \ greenhouse parameters. It is observed from \nthe study of different agriculture\
    \ fields that outcomes from agriculture are decreasing day by day. The \nadoption\
    \ of new technologies for precision agriculture promises an increase in production\
    \ rate and \nalso reduces the extra manpower requirements. There exist many studies\
    \ contributing to the benefit \nof farmers which provides an efficient system\
    \ based on new technologies for increasing the overall \nproduction rates (Varman\
    \ et al., 2017). (Keshtgari and Deljoo, 2011) developed a system that uses a \n\
    distributed wireless sensor networks system. Their proposed system is designed\
    \ for providing real-\ntime monitoring of the agriculture field and controlled\
    \ irrigation scheme for increasing productivity \nutilizing water resources efficiently.\
    \ The system provides the design in detail including real-time \nfield sensing\
    \ and controlled irrigation utilizing the software. The designed system provides\
    \ a low-\ncost efficient solution for irrigation control using WSNs. The system\
    \ using WSNs for precision \nagriculture highly depends on the field parameters\
    \ such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity \nlevels. Sensor nodes were\
    \ deployed below the soil for the collection of parameters and these sensor \n\
    communicates among others using communication protocols and transmits their measured\
    \ data to the \ncontrol station through the sink node. (Zhao et al., 2017) have\
    \ designed a communication protocol \nfor quick transmission of the sensor data\
    \ to the sink node. Their proposed design delivers very few \nduty cycles and\
    \ results increase in the lifetime of the monitoring system. (Bachuwar et al.,\
    \ 2018) have \ndeveloped a system that utilizes sensors and UART (universal asynchronous\
    \ receiver transmitter) \ninterface. The transmission is carried out through hourly\
    \ sampling, buffering of data, its transmission, \nand at last the validation\
    \ of status. The experimental results present attenuation in radio frequency \n\
    signals because of sensor deployment under the soil and the deployment cost is\
    \ comparatively high. \n(Gayatri et al., 2015) presents a solution for monitoring\
    \ agricultural fields along with the irrigation \nInternational Journal of Agricultural\
    \ and Environmental Information Systems\nVolume 12 • Issue 2 • April-June 2021\n\
    4\ncontrol utilizing GPS (global positioning system) enable sensors. Their system\
    \ is capable for providing \ntimely response but the drawback is deployment cost\
    \ and the attenuation which caused by deploying \nsensors under soil. (Dan et\
    \ al., 2015) presented a greenhouse monitoring system based on WSNs and \nIoT\
    \ integration with cloud. Their system is capable of logging and storing data\
    \ in cloud periodically \nand present an effective solution for greenhouse monitoring.\
    \ \n(Heble et al., 2018) have presented a cost-effective solution of farming where\
    \ the water resources \nare limited. The designed system considers low-cost sensors\
    \ and easy circuitry and designed an \nautomatic water flow control system. The\
    \ real-time monitoring considers sensing of temperature and \nhumidity and displaying\
    \ them on LCD. Their designed system provides the water efficiently to the \n\
    needed plants measured according to the present moisture level. (Reche et al.,\
    \ 2014) have proposed \nan irrigation scheduler system based on low cost and time-dependent\
    \ microcontroller. Their designed \nsystem comprises of sensor network for the\
    \ detection of soil moisture and temperature levels. The \nreal-time sensed data\
    \ is processed to the users through SMS using GSM module.\n(Nawandar and Satpute,\

    5\ndesign requires soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and air monitoring sensors\
    \ for designing a \nsystem without human interventions. Figure 2, presents the\
    \ proposed framework for smart agriculture \nbased on sensor networks and IoT.\
    \ The proposed design consists of four layers of operation which \nare sensor\
    \ deployment, middleware, communication, and application layer.\n3.1 Sensor deployment\
    \ Layer\nSensor deployment in the agriculture field is the first layer of operation.\
    \ The proposed system uses a \nsoil moisture sensor, temperature, and humidity\
    \ sensor and air monitoring sensor for the collection of \nfield data. The deployed\
    \ sensor nodes are presented in Figure 3. These sensor nodes are responsible \n\
    for collecting real-time field data and regular monitoring of the agriculture\
    \ field. The soil moisture \nsensor measures the soil moisture level, temperature,\
    \ and humidity sensor to measure the relative \ntemperature and humidity levels.\
    \ Similarly, an air monitoring sensor is used to estimate wind speed \nand directions.\
    \ These sensor nodes communicate with each other and transfer the sensed information\
    \ \nto the sink or master node. \nThe sink node is Arduino Uno based microcontroller,\
    \ which is responsible for collecting field \ndata and transferring information\
    \ further to the ThingSpeak cloud platform for storage and its \nanalysis. The\
    \ hardware used for the experimentation collects data in real time (soil moisture\
    \ level, \nrelative temperature & humidity and wind speed). The sensor nodes communicates\
    \ with each other \nwirelessly and transfers sensed data to sink node which is\
    \ GSM enabled. This sink node is responsible \nfor gathering the field information\
    \ and transferring data to the cloud for analysis and storing.\n3.2 Middleware\
    \ Layer\nMiddleware is the second operation layer of our proposed system. This\
    \ layer is responsible for \ncontrolling the actuators and automating the agriculture\
    \ process. The collected values beyond the \nthreshold are transferred to the\
    \ controller for their analysis in the ground station. These operational \nlayers\
    \ carefully monitor the soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and wind speed as\
    \ these factors \nFigure 2. IoT based framework for smart agriculture\nInternational\
    \ Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Information Systems\nVolume 12 • Issue\
    \ 2 • April-June 2021\n6\ndirectly impact agricultural yields. The system is configured\
    \ considering three factors; in the first \nfactor when the soil moisture is observed\
    \ below its threshold value an alert message is generated and \nsend to the user\
    \ through e-mail. The automated system then generates a query for turning ON the\
    \ \nwater motor for soil irrigation. When the required irrigation level is covered\
    \ the system automatically \nturns OFF the water motor. The factor considers the\
    \ rise in relative temperature and humidity values \nbeyond the threshold. The\
    \ system sends an automated generated alert and suggests to open the flap \nof\
    \ greenhouse or poly-house for maintaining the ambient atmosphere. The third factor\
    \ is the wind \nspeed and its direction which is monitored by air monitoring sensors.\
    \ When air monitoring value \nsucceeds threshold, systems generate an alert for\
    \ covering the region and targeted plants, protecting \nthem from harm. The middleware\
    \ layer is responsible for above mentioned three operations. These \noperations\
    \ are carried out in the ground station using the ThnigSpeak platform based on\
    \ the real-\ntime analysis of sensed field data. Controlling these three factors\
    \ in the targeted agriculture region, \nincrease the overall crop production with\
    \ efficient use of resources.\n3.3 Communication and Cloud Analysis Layer\nThe\
    \ third operational layer of the proposed system is the communication layer. This\
    \ layer uses \nArdunio Uno based microcontroller and responsible for communicating\
    \ with the deployed sensors. \nThe collected data is transferred to the base station\
    \ through this gateway wirelessly as it is comprised \nof the GSM module. This\
    \ module is WiFi-enabled and communicates the information wirelessly. The \ndeployed\
    \ sensor monitors the field data such as moisture, temperature, humidity, wind\
    \ speed, and \ncommunicates them to the gateway node. An IP protocol is running\
    \ in the controller gateway which \nsends the collected information to ThingSpeak\
    \ cloud for analysis and making decisions.\n3.4 Application Layer\nThe advancement\
    \ in the field of cloud computing and edge computing provides an effective solution\
    \ \nfor the issues of smart agriculture application. The designed model uses the\
    \ ThingSpeak cloud platform \nfor the collection of field data and provides efficient\
    \ storage and analysis. In this operational layer, \nFigure 3. Deployment of Sensors\
    \ for data collection\nInternational Journal of Agricultural and Environmental\
    \ Information Systems\nVolume 12 • Issue 2 • April-June 2021\n7\nvarious channels\
    \ are created for specific field parameters that represent their regular monitoring\
    \ and \nstoring of data fields with time and date. The gateway node transmits\
    \ the particular measured data to \ntheir respective channels. Table 2 represents\
    \ the sample of an observed dataset from the agricultural \nfield in the ThingSpeak\
    \ Platform. In table 2 column 1 represents the time and date of recorded instance,\
    \ \ncolumn 2 represents their entry numbers. The rest of columns represents values\
    \ of soil moisture in \npercentage (amount of water present in soil), temperature\
    \ (in degree Celsius), humidity in percentage \n(amount of moisture present in\
    \ air) and wind speed (in meters per second). The data is analyzed using \nMATLAB\
    \ in ThingSpeak cloud for calculating irregularities and predicting the results.\
    \ These data \nvalues are plotted using MATLAB for its time-based analysis in\
    \ the ground station. The agricultural \nfield data can be monitored from anywhere\
    \ at any time, remotely using web service.\n4. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nThe performance\
    \ of the system is realized by deploying sensor modules in the agriculture field\
    \ and \nanalyzing real-time collected in ThingSpeak IoT Platform. The hardware\
    \ setup consists of Arduino \nUno and other various sensors for collecting field\
    \ data. The hardware and software utilized for \nexperimentation are discussed\
    \ below and presented in Figure 3.\n4.1 Hardware Used\nArduino Uno Microcontroller\n\

    \ memory which \nis self-programmable. The microcontroller supports 23 programmable\

    \ Sensor\nThe soil moisture sensor is deployed for calculating the percentage\
    \ of water quantity present in the soil. \nThe required average percentage of\
    \ the water content in soil varies for different agriculture domains \nTable 2.\

    \ The moisture sensor is used to measure \nthe percentage of water in the soil\
    \ and to transfer the collected measurement to the controller for \nmaking control\
    \ actions in terms of turning On/Off Water motors. The soil moisture sensor consists\
    \ of \ntwo attached electrodes that need to be placed in the upper layer of soil.\
    \ The soil moisture sensor is \nan analog sensor and it provides an analog output\
    \ to the controller. The output of the moisture sensor \nis converted to a digital\
    \ value (10 bit) and hence the average percentage is calculated.\nTemperature\
    \ and Humidity Sensor\nVarious crops are evolved as temperature and humidity sensitive.\
    \ DHT11 a digital sensor is utilized for \nmeasuring temperature and humidity\
    \ values. This sensor provides the early detection of temperature \nand humidity\
    \ values so that some precautionary steps or preparations can be implemented for\
    \ the \nupcoming season to increase crop production. The temperature and humidity\
    \ values play an important \nrole in deciding the accurate cultivating time of\
    \ crops. \nAir Monitoring Sensor\nFresh air is very much important for the nourishment\
    \ of crops and plants. The amount of polluted air \nmay degrade the growth or\
    \ may sick crops and plants. Therefore, the monitoring of air quality is an \n\
    important parameter for the growth of plants and crops. MQ135 air monitoring sensor\
    \ is used which \nprovides an analog output. This sensor detects the wind speed\
    \ and the presence of toxic gases in the air. \nThe output in the form of analog\
    \ is converted to 10-bit digital form and then presented in percentage.\nRaspberry\
    \ Pi\nRaspberry Pi provides the sensor interface to the gateway node and performs\
    \ computing and networking \noperations. It is the most important part of the\
    \ Internet of Things platform. It provides the wireless \ntransmission of sensed\
    \ information to the cloud so that the data can be accessed remotely. The Pi \n\
    model B is utilized for this framework which has a quad-core ARM processor, HDMI\
    \ and USB ports, \nGSM module and storage SD slot. \n4.2 Software Used\nThingSpeak\
    \ IoT Platform\nThingSpeak Cloud platform is used for the real time analysis of\
    \ ground data. This cloud platform \nprovides the facilities for processing of\
    \ data in case of any adversaries. An observed sample of ground \ndata is presented\
    \ in Table 2. It is used to plot the sensed information of field in terms of soil\
    \ moisture, \ntemperature, humidity and air quality.\nMATLAB Function\nMATLAB\
    \ function of ThingSpeak platform is utilized for presenting the comparative study\
    \ of previous \nand current stored values. The observed data can be analysed implementing\
    \ various machine learning \nand deep learning algorithms for their evaluation.\
    \ \n5. RESULTS ANd ANALySIS\nThingSpeak IoT platform provides services such as\
    \ data aggregation, visualization, and data analysis of \nlive streams. The sensed\
    \ field information is transmitted to the cloud platform using gateway module\
    \ \nand instant visualization of data is created and alerts are generated and\
    \ transmitted using web service. \nThe MATLAB analysis of ThingSpeak stored data,\
    \ runs a MATLAB code for processing, visualizing, \nand analyzing data streams.\
    \ Based on experimental setup the proposed system collects real-time field \n\
    information such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. These\
    \ sensed instances \nare transmitted to the cloud system for their timely analysis.\

    \ the generated plots \nfrom following sensed data (a): Soil Moisture, (b): Temperature,\
    \ (c): Humidity and (d): Air quality. \nThe cloud platform represents the graphical\
    \ representation of sensed agricultural field data. The \nfield information is\
    \ visualized in real-time utilizing cloud applications. It is observed from Figure\
    \ \n4, that the field data is updated and plotted through ThingSpeak analysis.\
    \ The graph represents the \nvariation in the sensed values in different instances\
    \ and plotted accordingly. Field 1 is set for soil \nmoisture channel, field 2\
    \ corresponds to temperature channel, field 3 for humidity, and field 4 for air\
    \ \nquality measurement. The different fields update their data and stores every\
    \ upcoming value every \n3 to 6 minutes.\nThe MATLAB function of the ThingSpeak\
    \ platform is utilized and a MATLAB code is executed \nfor the visualization of\
    \ temperature comparison for three days and to find the relation between the \n\
    relative temperature and wind speed. Figure 5, presents the MATLAB based visualization\
    \ of three days \nmeasured values of temperature and relative temperature values\
    \ with wind speed. This visualization \nhelps in predicting the upcoming weather\
    \ for considering changes and implementing operations for \nimproving crop production.\
    \ In agriculture, the efficient use of water is an important factor. This system\
    \ \nmainly focuses on the effective utilization of water in agriculture along\
    \ with the weather prediction. \nThe work is mainly based on the moisture content\
    \ of the soil, and relative temperature and humidity \nvalues. This system allows\
    \ a sufficient supply of water to the agriculture field and accurate prediction\
    \ \nof weather for increasing the crop yields. \nThe prediction of upcoming weather\
    \ plays an important role in maximizing crop yields. The \nproposed system based\
    \ on the MATLAB analysis of recently recorded temperature values of three \ndays\
    \ predicts the weather report. Figure 6, presents the histogram of temperature\
    \ variation at different \ntemperature ranges. The weather prediction is calculated\
    \ using the MATLAB analysis of recorded \ntemperature values. \nFigure 4. Generated\

    \ and this further helps in \npredicting the percentage of moisture content in\
    \ soil for the coming days. Weather prediction helps \nin calculating the percentage\
    \ of dryness that may occur in the agriculture field. The system updates \nthe\
    \ user through notification whenever the soil is in dry condition means high resistance.\
    \ Based on \nthe threshold values of moisture sensor an automatic operation of\
    \ soil irrigation through water motor \nis initiated. \nThe soil moisture content\
    \ varies for different types of agricultural fields. The designed system is \n\
    capable of pumping water to the field whenever required. The automated operation\
    \ of the water motor \nturns off automatically when the percentage wet level of\
    \ the soil is achieved. Figure 7 presents the \nresulted graphs of the proposed\
    \ system where (a) represents the recorded temperature of the recent \nthree days\
    \ and (b) represents the operational time of water motor to make the soil wet.\n\
    After the execution of MATLAB code, the readings of soil moisture content, temperature,\
    \ and \nhumidity, air quality can be visualized through the ThingSpeak platform.\
    \ The system sends alerts of \nmoisture, temperature, and humidity values through\
    \ emails to the field users. Based on the above-\nmentioned experimental set up\
    \ different instances of soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and air \nquality\

    \ system is capable of \nproviding continuous monitoring of the agricultural field\
    \ and triggers the operation of the motor as \nper the requirement. The performance\
    \ of the system is evaluated considering two major performance \nmetrics. Average\
    \ response time and standard deviation at the same cloud platform and different\
    \ cloud \nplatforms. The response time and standard deviation are measured for\
    \ the same clod platform and \ndifferent cloud platforms for the evaluation of\
    \ the overall system’s performance.\nTable 3, presents the analysis of the proposed\
    \ framework for average response time and standard \ndeviation at the same cloud\
    \ and different cloud platforms. The observed standard deviation and \nresponse\
    \ time of the system for the same clout platform are 10.63 milliseconds and 13.57\
    \ milliseconds. \nSimilarly, for different cloud systems, the standard deviation\
    \ and response time are recorded as 16.24 \nmilliseconds and 25.17 milliseconds.\
    \ These observed results are compared with other cloud-based \napproaches (Reche\
    \ et al., 2014; Nawandar and Satpute, 2019) and it is analyzed that the performance\
    \ of \nthe proposed framework is better than others and concludes that the system\
    \ is efficient for continuous \nmonitoring of agricultural fields.\n6. CoNCLUSIoN\n\

    48 PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a set of emerging
    technologies that is revolutionizing the agriculture industry and enabling farmers
    to contend with the enormous challenges in the twenty-first century. Precision
    agriculture (PA), which is also known as site-specific farming, represents an
    information-driven agricultural management system. The PA management system is
    designed to improve the agricultural processes by enabling continues soil/plant
    monitoring and precise treatment. With the latest technology, cloud-based IoT
    control center collects and processes real-time data of both crops and environment
    with regard to planting, fertilizing, and harvesting crops, at appropriate time
    and duration. Through this way, IoT-embedded PA can be achieved to increase the
    quality, quantity, sustainability, and cost effectiveness of agricultural production.
    The chapter provides an overview of the current situation and future prospects
    of IoT applications in PA. More specifically, typical IoT-based PA applications
    are presented in different sections, including precision irrigation, precision
    fertilization, crop disease and management, pest control, equipment automation,
    and precision livestock farming. References Citing Literature Internet of Things

    \ justiﬁes the incorporation and\nadaptation of the latest technologies. Nowadays,\
    \ managing crops is possible through Internet-based\ntechnologies. Their application\
    \ allows for the exploitation of information and the development of\nisolated\
    \ applications, which, although powerful, create challenges for obtaining scalable\
    \ predictions\nthroughout the useful life of farms. To address this problem, a\
    \ data model was deﬁned to improve\nthe management of crop plots in irrigation\
    \ communities and simultaneously monitor crop needs.\nConsequently, the objective\
    \ of this study was to create an open and interoperable platform based on\nstandard\
    \ interfaces and protocols to enable the integration of heterogeneous sources\
    \ of information,\nwhile ensuring interoperability with other third-party solutions\
    \ for exchanging and exploiting such\ninformation. Standard and open interfaces\
    \ and protocols form the basis of the platform, thereby\nunifying all information\
    \ in a single data model, which facilitates the better use and dissemination of\n\
    information. The system was fully instantiated in a real prototype in an irrigation\
    \ community; the\nsoftware improved water irrigation management for the farmers\
    \ connected to the platform.\nKeywords: IoT platform; data model; smart agriculture;\

    1. Introduction\nSociety is characterized by uncertainty and constant technological\
    \ changes. The productive sectors\nthat are more digitized tend to improve their\
    \ productivity faster than those that are less digitized.\nIrrigation farming\
    \ communities have beneﬁted for many years from the use of information and\ncommunications\
    \ technology (ICT), which allows them to improve the current agricultural development,\n\
    facilitate the fulﬁllment of daily tasks, and convert farms into efﬁcient and\
    \ sustainable production\nsystems. The use of these new technologies not only\
    \ enables the digital transformation process\ndemanded by the sector, but also\
    \ supports irrigation communities and other farming groups with tools\nfor analysis\
    \ and prediction, improving optimization.\nThe digital transformation and continuous\
    \ technological advances that are currently occurring,\ne.g., the Internet of\
    \ Things (IoT) [1], big data, cloud computing [2], artiﬁcial intelligence, and\
    \ aerial\nimages [3] to name a few, are providing the agricultural sector with\
    \ new tools that help determine\nthe real needs of farms and improve their efﬁciency.\
    \ Speciﬁcally, the use of the IoT has changed the\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153; doi:10.3390/s20041153\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n2 of 20\ntraditional paradigm\
    \ regarding access to and the management of sensors and actuators, making\nall\
    \ objects accessible through the Internet, and transferring the management and\
    \ integration of\ninformation and real knowledge into the digital world [4].\n\
    This transformation has produced\nimprovements compared to the techniques traditionally\
    \ used [5], allowing new mechanisms to help in\nthe management of farms. These\
    \ advantages are mainly focused on the following:\n•\nProblem detection: The implementation\
    \ of new technologies such as satellite images, variable\napplication algorithms,\
    \ drones, high-tech sensors, mobile applications, and GPS guides, allowing\nfor\
    \ the assessment of crop status and the detection of problems (improper fertilizer\
    \ use, water\nstress, changing weather conditions, and pest monitoring) before\
    \ they start to interfere with\ncrop performance;\n•\nProductivity improvement:\
    \ The sensorization of crops allows for the establishment of patterns of\nplanting\
    \ and fertilization depending on factors such as the type of seeds and soil conditions,\
    \ to\nimprove crop production levels;\n•\nImprovement in decision making: By analyzing\
    \ and monitoring agronomic parameters, crop water\nneeds, and precipitation forecasts,\
    \ it is possible to identify which areas of land need more water\nand schedule\
    \ irrigation to vary the volume of water applied without imposing water stress\
    \ on\nthe crop;\n•\nBehaviour analysis: As a result of continuous crop monitoring\
    \ and the analysis of the relationships\namong different elements, such as yield,\
    \ energy efﬁciency, and the agricultural practices used, the\nmost beneﬁcial actions\
    \ and those that must be eliminated or modiﬁed can be identiﬁed.\nMotivated by\
    \ the digital transformation, the agricultural sector is providing its farms with\
    \ new\ndevices and services (sensors, actuators, weather information, drones,\
    \ and satellite images) that allow\nfor the optimization of the resources, to\
    \ improve productivity and simultaneously reduce the impact\non the environment.\
    \ For the digital transformation of the agricultural sector, a common integration\n\
    framework is needed that uniﬁes the entire dataset, so that new services are generated\
    \ according to\nthe needs of the sector. The data generated by the farms are crucial\
    \ and have to be part of a unique\nsemantic model that organizes and evaluates\
    \ all the data collected.\nAt the European level, an open initiative, FIWARE [6],\
    \ offers a framework using a set of standard\nand open Application Programming\
    \ Interfaces (APIs) based on Next Generation Service Interface\n(NGSI), promoted\
    \ by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA), or Next Generation Service Interfaces\nwith\
    \ Linked Data (NGSI-LD) [7], promoted by ETSI Industry Speciﬁcation Group for\
    \ Context\nInformation Management (ETSI ISG CIM), to deﬁne a universal set of\
    \ standards based on the contextual\nmanagement of the data. Therefore, adhering\
    \ the standards and abandoning the code and proprietary\ntechnologies can contribute\
    \ to improving the competitiveness of the agricultural sector. In a world\nwhere\
    \ everything is connected, isolated solutions have no place. By contrast, interoperability\
    \ must be\nthe cornerstone feature that all solutions adopt, thus contributing\
    \ to a more productive environment\nwhere information is exchanged for a greater\
    \ good. The proposed solution is a platform that allows\nfor the integration of\
    \ different suppliers’ devices, and implements standards and open interfaces and\n\
    data models based on NGSI-LD. Additionally, the platform exploits the stored information\
    \ to analyze,\nin real time, the factors associated with the production process,\
    \ the evolution of the crops, and the\noptimal use of water for irrigation. The\
    \ core features the platform are as follows:\n1.\nScalability and ﬂexibility:The\
    \ platform, instead of being locked to a single provider, is up to date\nwith\
    \ protocols, technologies, and features that vary rapidly. It is network-independent\
    \ and can be\nintegrated to work with all vital technological systems;\n2.\nInteroperable:\
    \ The platform offers a wide range of IoT agents that facilitate the connection\
    \ with\ndevices that use standardized IoT protocols, such as Lightweight Machine\
    \ to Machine (LWM2M)\nover Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), JavaScript\
    \ Object Notation (JSON), or UltraLight\n(UL) over HTTP/MQTT, with the possibility\
    \ of using parameterizing agents to integrate any\nother type of future protocols.\
    \ At the application level, the platform is open to integration with\nother third-party\
    \ platforms using both API and data model based on NGSI-LD.\nSensors 2020, 20,\
    \ 1153\n3 of 20\n3.\nSemantic enrichment: The use of the data model to homogenize\
    \ the management of the different\nelements that are part of a farm;\n4.\nEfﬁciency\
    \ and competitiveness: The model allows precise and timely decisions to be made\
    \ in terms\nof management and agricultural processes. The ability to automatically\
    \ document the health\nstatus of the crop or natural resources provides an efﬁcient\
    \ and effective diagnosis technique\nfor managers.\nThe remainder of this paper\
    \ is structured as follows: In Section 2, the proposed solution is\nintroduced,\
    \ detailing the most unique elements. Section 3 outlines the deployment in a community\n\
    of irrigators. Section 4 shows the evaluation of the system at different levels\
    \ of implementation and\nthe results obtained. Finally, in Section 5, the conclusion\
    \ and new proposals based in these results\nare described.\n1.1. Information Models\
    \ Applied to Agriculture\nThe data collected by all connected devices are characterized\
    \ by scalability, heterogeneity,\nand dynamism:\n•\nScalability: Millions of sensors\
    \ continuously generating large amounts of information;\n•\nHeterogeneity: There\
    \ is a wide variety of sensors;\n•\nDynamism: The high speed of generation produced\
    \ the need to generate data models that allow\nfor better use and dissemination\
    \ of the information from these devices.\nGiven the above factors, interoperability\
    \ mechanisms must be generated that allow for the\nintegration of different devices,\
    \ applications, or platforms to ﬁlter the vast amounts of information\nthat many\
    \ systems are producing [8]. The shared data models are useful as they are essential\
    \ resources\nthat improve the communication, knowledge recovery, and interoperability\
    \ of information systems to\ndevelop better applications for the agri-food sector\
    \ [9].\nToday, different data models are available; many of them were developed\
    \ by the organizations\nin charge of developing their standards. The Open Geospatial\
    \ Consortium (OGC) data models are\nused primarily in geosciences and environmental\
    \ domains, including the SensorThings API, based on\nthe Observations and Measurements\
    \ (O&M) data model (OGC/ISO 19156:2011), which transforms\nthe numerous unconnected\
    \ IoT systems into a fully connected platform where complex tasks can\nbe performed\
    \ and synchronized. The Open Connectivity Foundation speciﬁes data models based\n\
    on vertical industries such as the automotive, healthcare, industrial, and smart\
    \ home sectors. The\nWorld Wide Web Consortium Thing Description provides some\
    \ vocabularies to describe real things\nbut does not focus much on the data. Other\
    \ vocabularies, such as those offered by the INSPIRE\ndirective [10], deﬁne the\
    \ rules on the interoperability of spatial data sets and their associated services;\n\
    these are mandatory.\nCurrently, some resources speed up the data modeling of\
    \ a speciﬁc location or sector. In the ﬁeld\nof agriculture, Drury et al. [11]\
    \ presented different types of tools to help us develop this task:\n•\nControlled\
    \ vocabulary (a set of preselected terms or words for a speciﬁc domain): An example\n\
    is AGROVOC vocabulary, promoted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the\
    \ United\nNations (FAO) and available in multiple languages.\n•\nMiscellaneous\
    \ ontologies: Crop Ontology, AgroPortal, Dairy Farming Ontology (DFO), AgOnt,\n\
    CIARD Ring, and Vest.\n•\nData exchange standards: AgriOpenLink, AgroXML, and\
    \ AgroRDF; speciﬁc ontologies: SSN (for\nsensor discovery) and Cotton Ontology\
    \ (diseases and pests that affect cotton).\nThe basis of many decisions is the\
    \ uniformity of architectures, and ETSI ISG CIM provides the\ncorrect interfaces\
    \ (006 V1.1.1 (2019-07)) and context information management (CIM) and allows for\
    \ the\nuniﬁed representation of the information through next generation service\
    \ interfaces with linked data\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n4 of 20\n(NGSI-LD) [12].\
    \ This reduces the time and resources required for the management of daily tasks\
    \ and\nfor the improvement of the productivity and beneﬁts.\nA diverse range of\
    \ ontological models are available for the IoT, developed with different\nobjectives\
    \ [13,14] that describe various areas, such as Fiesta-IoT ontology, which reuses\
    \ the results\nof projects and current EU strategies in semantic web technologies,\
    \ such as OpenIoT, DUL, VITAL,\nSpitﬁre, IoT-O, IoT-A, IoT-Lite, and Sensei. One\
    \ recent ontology, which is promoted by the ETSI\nSmartM2M Technical Committee,\
    \ is the Smart Appliances REFerence (SAREF) ontology, a shared\nmodel of consensus\
    \ that facilitates the matching of existing assets in the smart appliances domain\
    \ and\nallows for the separation and recombination of different parts of the ontology\
    \ according to speciﬁc\nneeds. For the agricultural ﬁeld, the SAREF4AGRI version\
    \ [15] was created to provide services for\nanimal husbandry, intelligent irrigation,\
    \ and the integration of multiple data sources to provide support\nservices for\
    \ decision making.\nSome models are promoted by public administrations, such as\
    \ the standardized water\nmanagement model applied to irrigation model (MEGA)\
    \ [16], an initiative of the Ministry of\nAgriculture of Spain, included in the\
    \ ISO 21622 standard and managed by TRAGSA Group. The\npurpose of MEGA is to establish\
    \ a standardized model that, when applied to irrigation, allows for\ninteroperability\
    \ between different systems that coexist in the same facility and thus to efﬁciently\n\
    manage irrigation water use. The introduction of the standardized model improves\
    \ how the irrigation\nschedules and the requirements of the control systems are\
    \ speciﬁed, establishing a clear separation\nbetween decision making and execution.\n\
    1.2. IoT Solutions in the Agricultural Sector\nMultiple problems exist in the\
    \ domain of agriculture, such as irrigation, the application of\npesticides and\
    \ fertilizers, and the monitoring of crops, land, and livestock. Different researchers\
    \ are\nworking to provide the best possible solutions:\n•\nImprovements in productivity:Through\
    \ the sensorization of crops to provide values in real time,\nthe farmer can apply\
    \ irrigation, pesticides, and fertilizers only when they are needed. For example,\n\
    Araby et al. [17] proposed the integration of the IoT and machine learning to\
    \ predict diseases\nin horticultural crops before they appear, allowing the farmer\
    \ to apply the necessary defense\nmechanisms, thus improving productivity and\
    \ reducing the use of pesticides. Trilles et al. [18]\npresented a low-cost sensor-equipped\
    \ platform, SEenviro, which applies a disease model for alert\nmanagement in vineyards;\n\
    •\nDetection of undetected problems: Using satellite images or drones, harmful\
    \ agronomic factors,\npreviously untreated, can be detected and mapped in crops\
    \ using remote-sensing techniques. For\nexample, De Rango et al. [19] monitored\
    \ crops using the images provided by a drone to see if they\nhad parasites and\
    \ to decide if subsequent treatment was necessary, representing a new technique\n\
    for the coordination and control of the drone ﬂeet in precision agriculture (PA);\n\
    •\nMonitoring the behavior of plants: Through the use of artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ to analyze the\nentire dataset obtained from crops to make future predictions,\
    \ the PLANTAE platform [20] is a\nsystem capable of managing the agricultural\
    \ process and simultaneously using machine-learning\ntechniques to detect possible\
    \ diseases in plants. Other works, such as that of Choudhury et al. [21],\nmonitored\
    \ the behavior of plants to avoid pests and diseases. Through the use of a mobile\n\
    applications, farmers report events that improve the models of diseases used;\n\
    •\nEfﬁcient water management: Crop water adjustments should avoid water stress.\
    \ Riquelme\net al. [22] showed how the use of cloud services involving the FIWARE\
    \ platform allows for the\nimprovement of the management of water used for irrigation\
    \ in areas with water deﬁcits. Another\nproject to be considered, also based on\
    \ FIWARE, is the SWAMP platform [23]. Its primary objective\nis to develop innovative\
    \ methods based on the IoT for the intelligent management of irrigation\nwater,\
    \ using the semantic characteristics provided by a context engine based on the\
    \ SPARQL\nProtocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) Event Processing Architecture;\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 1153\n5 of 20\n•\nImprovement in greenhouse management: By monitoring\
    \ its different components, Zamora-\nIzquierdo et al. [24] proposed a ﬂexible\
    \ platform capable of meeting the needs of hydroponic\ncrops in a greenhouse with\
    \ complete recirculation. For this FIWARE-based deployment, Message\nQueuing Telemetry\
    \ Transport (MQTT) communications were used, with NGSIs being used as a\nmeans\
    \ to represent the information. Somov et al. [25] constructed a system to monitor\
    \ both the\nconditions established in a greenhouse and the behavior of plants\
    \ for the prediction of the growth\nrate of tomatoes in different environments.\n\
    IoT platforms can be considered the backbone of any industrial sector that wants\
    \ to provide its\nactivity with a smart component. These platforms collect and\
    \ store data in a distributed database for\nthe ﬁltering, analysis, calculation,\
    \ decision making, management, translation, and visualization of data\nin new\
    \ services. Several analyses of the different types of platforms for the integration\
    \ of IoT services\nand their characteristics can be found, such as that provided\
    \ by Silva et al. [26], although a results\ncomparison is difﬁcult because of\
    \ the lack of standardization.\n2. Proposed System\nThis article proposes an open\
    \ and interoperable platform for irrigation community management.\nThe platform,\
    \ based on standard and open interfaces and protocols, allows for the integration\
    \ of\nheterogeneous information sources as well as interoperability with other\
    \ third-party solutions for\nexchanging and exploiting this information. Additionally,\
    \ this platform exploits the stored information\nto analyze, in real time, the\
    \ factors associated with the production process, the evolution of crops, and\n\
    the optimal use of water for irrigation.\n2.1. Proposed Data Model\nAs a result\
    \ of the lack of the compatibility necessary to manage the large amount of data\
    \ generated\nby the agricultural sector, agricultural managers must be provided\
    \ with standardized information\nmodels that permit farmers to make the best possible\
    \ decisions, allowing them to take advantage of\nthe available data and knowledge.\
    \ Therefore, a data model is proposed here that ﬁts the functional\nrequirements\
    \ of the users.\nThe proposed data model is based on interviews with farmers,\
    \ responsible technicians, and farm\nmanagers about the useful and necessary information\
    \ that should be managed on a farm. The existing\nmodels are too specialized;\
    \ although they cover the information that needs to be managed, their\nimplementation\
    \ is time-consuming. Therefore, we decided to develop a new model that would meet\n\
    the needs of our users.\nConceptually, the model presented is based on the proposed\
    \ by FIWARE harmonized data\nmodels [27], speciﬁcally, the AgriFood model that\
    \ includes requirements for irrigation and crop control.\nThe model was constructed\
    \ as an agile tool to respond to the requirements farmers allowing them\nto characterize\
    \ the plots, reduce the hydric needs of the crops, and control the soil and water\
    \ quality\nand the associated atmospheric conditions. This ﬁrst version of the\
    \ model focuses on the efﬁcient\nmanagement of the crop plots and all the included\
    \ elements, as can be seen in the class diagram in\nFigure 1.\nThe proposed data\
    \ model focuses on the management of crop plots represented by the AgriPlot\n\
    entity, which is part of an agricultural holding, represented by the AgriExploitation\
    \ entity. The plot is\ncharacterized by four pillars that allow it to be uniquely\
    \ deﬁned:\n•\nDevices, represented by AgriDevice, are the devices that provide\
    \ information to the plot and are\nclassiﬁed based on the parameters studied:\
    \ AgriDSoil, those that obtain soil values (soil moisture\nprobes, temperature\
    \ and soil dissolution); AgriPlant, those that measure the evolution of the crop\n\
    (leaf/trunk diameter, stem water potential, and dendrometers); and AgriAtmosphere,\
    \ which are\nthe devices that record the atmospheric conditions (temperature,\
    \ humidity, radiation, and wind\nspeed). These data are used to optimize agricultural\
    \ decisions;\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n6 of 20\n•\nWater, represented by AgriWater,\
    \ indicates the type of water used and the parameters that affect\nirrigation.\
    \ AgriAnalysis manages the water analysis conducted at different points of the\
    \ water\ndistribution network of the farm. These analyses are usually necessary\
    \ for fertilization and\nirrigation, since they describe the quality and quantity\
    \ of nutrients carried by the water;\n•\nSoil, represented by AgriSoil, indicates\
    \ the type of soil present in the plot. This entity can be more\ndetailed by indicating\
    \ the AgriHorizon, which includes the different characteristics of the layers\n\
    (horizons) that deﬁne the ground;\n•\nCultivation, represented by AgriCrop, deﬁnes\
    \ the crop and the variety, AgriVariety, with which the\nplot is associated. The\
    \ crop is determined by the different phenological phases that determine its\n\
    growth; AgriPhenology provides the crop coefﬁcients and their duration over time.\
    \ The phenology\nis determined by the variety of the crop and the climatic zone,\
    \ AgriZone since the zone inﬂuences\nthe optimal climatic conditions for the development\
    \ of the crops.\nAnother feature to be considered is the Aerial Images management,\
    \ represented by the AgriScene\nentity, including images or scenes from any satellite\
    \ or drone; these scenes are composed of bands,\nAgriBand, of different wavelengths.\
    \ In turn, these bands can generate derivative products, AgriProduct,\nafter processing,\
    \ such as mosaics (adding two or more adjacent scenes) or indices of vegetation\
    \ or\nwater, useful for detecting problems in the ﬁelds.\nFigure 1. Speciﬁc data\
    \ model for agricultural plot management.\nThe main feature of the IoT-based interoperability\
    \ mechanisms is the possibility of exchanging\ninformation homogeneously in different\
    \ systems or applications. One of the elements that enables this\ncontinuous exchange\
    \ of information is the use of data models. To acquire more signiﬁcant value,\
    \ the\nspeciﬁc vocabulary of the sector must be uniﬁed, which is deﬁned by the\
    \ set of attributes that compose\nthe entities and their relationships [28]. As\
    \ NGSI-LD allows us to link data from other vocabularies or\nontologies, we added\
    \ a level of interoperability to the model. For these reasons, the use of information\n\
    models is considered beneﬁcial to allow for the integration of any device or characteristic\
    \ element of\nthe study sector.\nIn Section 3.2, an instantiation of this model\
    \ is provided using NGSI-LD. The advantages of the\nuse of NGSI-LD concerning\
    \ NGSI are as follows:\n•\nThe information model is based on graphs and focuses\
    \ on information. The concept of Relation\nappears. Entities can have properties\
    \ and relations. Instances of each of the entities can be the\nobject of the properties\
    \ or relationships;\n•\nAll data types in NGSI-LD can be associated with unique\
    \ Uniform Resource Identiﬁer (URI)\ncorresponding to well-established semantic\
    \ identiﬁers;\n•\nIt allows one to make references to vocabularies: all terms\
    \ are deﬁned unequivocally. This allows\nusers to refer to their information deﬁnitions;\n\
    •\nThe model and query language is more constrained;\n•\nThe use of JSON-LD allows\
    \ us to operate with linked data to unify vocabularies;\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n\
    7 of 20\n•\nThere were syntactic differences: the metadata dictionary is no longer\
    \ needed, GeoProperty is\nused instead of geo:json, JSON-LD @context is included,\
    \ TemporalProperty is used instead of\nDateTime, and an “object” ﬁeld is used\
    \ to encode the relation target.\n2.2. System Architecture\nSince the new IoT\
    \ devices and the new communications technologies provide the user with\nfaster\
    \ and more efﬁcient communication, we propose an affordable platform, independent\
    \ of the\nprovider and interoperable, as the cornerstone for all connections between\
    \ applications/services\nand the irrigation elements. In this way, we offer a\
    \ common framework so that applications can\ninteract with any aspect that is\
    \ part of a farm in a similar way, while being able to act on any device\nor controller\
    \ using the same set of instructions, thus allowing for greater interoperability\
    \ between\ndifferent manufacturers or services.\nThe architecture of the platform\
    \ proposed in this paper is depicted in Figure 2. It has a layered\nmodular form\
    \ ranging from the deployment of sensors and the monitoring of techniques for\
    \ data\nextraction to the intelligent processing of data. Each of these layers\
    \ is based on open and standard\ninitiatives, such as the one provided by the\
    \ FIWARE community [29] or the ETSI ISG CIM group.\nFigure 2. General vision of\
    \ the proposed architecture.\nThe ﬁrst layer, Device and Data Acquisition, represents\
    \ the different sources of information that form\nthe system; these include sensors,\
    \ actuators, open information available on the Internet, and databases\nwith updated\
    \ information of interest. These devices employ different communication technologies\n\
    to transmit information to an IoT Backend module formed by IoT Agents. This module\
    \ acts as an\nintermediary with the second layer and transforms information unidirectionally\
    \ or bidirectionally\n(in the case of actuators), allowing the IoT devices to\
    \ interact with the platform.\nA speciﬁc module is required because of the restrictions\
    \ imposed by the modules on the processing\ncapacity, memory, and even the available\
    \ power to these devices. These restrictions usually prevent\nthem from using\
    \ heavy protocols at the application level, so they use lightweight protocols\
    \ such as\nCoAP or MQTT or integrate other solutions such as LoRa and Sigfox to\
    \ perform communications\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n8 of 20\nwith the different\
    \ devices through Ethernet or mobile networks (e.g., GPRS/3G/4G/NB-IoT/5G).\n\
    As such, the IoT backend module component acts as an intermediary by translating\
    \ the information\nsent through these protocols to the interface made available\
    \ by the broker through NGSI-LD.\nThe second layer, Information Management, contains\
    \ software components in charge of data storage,\nprocessing, and distribution.\
    \ The distributed infrastructure is composed of servers in the cloud that\nwork\
    \ together to manage massive amounts of data and make them available to the upper\
    \ layer. The\nNGSI-LD interface is used to send data updates and receive notiﬁcations\
    \ about data changes. Figure 3\npresents an example of how the information provided\
    \ by an IoT gateway, which implements JSON\nover MQTT, is integrated into the\
    \ platform.\nFigure 3. Data model from Internet of Things (IoT) level to applications.\n\
    The element chosen was the device that analyses the water at the exit of the wastewater\
    \ treatment\nplant and determines the levels of turbidity and ph of the water.\
    \ Once the entity is created in the\nbroker using the NGSI-LD data model, consumers\
    \ can retrieve this information following two different\napproaches: query or\
    \ subscription.\nThe core of this platform is the NGSI-LD broker. It is an information\
    \ broker that exposes an\nHTTP REST API based on NGSI-LD for both registration\
    \ and consultation, as well as a subscription/\nnotiﬁcation approach. This is\
    \ the second point where interoperability is a signiﬁcant aspect. The use of\n\
    NGSI-LD provides various possible interactions with third-party platforms in both\
    \ directions. One\nof these solutions that has been integrated into the platform\
    \ through the development of a connector\nis MEGA [16]. The MEGA standard (ISO\
    \ 21622) provides guidelines for the implementation of a\nstandardized model applied\
    \ to irrigation that improves the speciﬁcation of irrigation schedules and\nthe\
    \ control of the system requirements. Within this management layer, the stored\
    \ information of each\nentity is overwritten, with only the current state being\
    \ kept; the information is stored in a nonrelational\ndatabase, MongoDB. This\
    \ database contains data referring to infrastructure and information ﬂow,\nas\
    \ well as information about users and organizations. All this information is modeled\
    \ using data\nmodels that allow for the uniﬁcation of data structures using standards\
    \ and also ensure the generality\nnecessary for the subsequent extensibility.\n\
    The last layer, Service, serves as an interface between users and the central\
    \ layer to offer different\nsolutions to the problems that are generated in an\
    \ agricultural operation, such as water management,\nirrigation planning, data\
    \ analytics, and monitoring of environmental parameters. The incorporation\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 1153\n9 of 20\nof other modules allows us to provide our solution\
    \ with more capabilities due to the possibility of\nintegrating new components\
    \ through connectors with NGSI-LD. The NGSI-LD interface is used to send\ndata\
    \ updates and receive notiﬁcations about data changes. A change in the conﬁguration\
    \ parameters\ntriggers control actions that are managed by subsystems at the user\
    \ level. As a result of the use of\nspeciﬁc connectors, the information is consulted\
    \ or notiﬁed to higher modules that are in charge of\npropagating it for other\
    \ interests, such as historical information, large-scale data management, or\n\
    integration with geographic information systems (GIS). For this purpose, a representational\
    \ state\ntransfer interface (REST) is used, which applies NGSI-LD for communication\
    \ between the ﬁnal\napplications and the analysis modules.\n3. Case Study in an\
    \ Irrigation Community\nThis section validates our data model and the architecture\
    \ of the platform. It was implemented in\nan irrigation community where different\
    \ systems, such as supervisory control and data acquisition\n(SCADA), GIS systems,\
    \ and sensors from different manufacturers, were integrated by the platform.\n\
    3.1. Scenario\nIrrigation communities are corporations attached to basin organizations,\
    \ which are responsible\nfor the management of the shared use of public common\
    \ water. To this end, they relied on automatons\nand speciﬁc irrigation systems\
    \ for years, which were tightly coupled, allowing for full interaction\nbetween\
    \ the devices and the software, but avoiding any other possibility of interacting\
    \ with third-party\ndevices and software applications.\nThe Miraﬂores irrigation\
    \ community is located in the municipality of Jumilla (Murcia) [30] in\nthe Segura\
    \ river basin and has almost 1000 community members. The area comprises about\
    \ 1330 ha\nof agricultural land, mostly devoted to woody crops and irrigated by\
    \ localized irrigation. The main\ncrops produced are fruit trees, especially pear,\
    \ peach, and apricot. The community uses surface water,\n3.8 hm3 annually, and\
    \ water from the Jumilla sewage plant, 1.5 hm3 annually. This treatment plant\n\
    delivers the reclaimed water at its exit, from where the community drives the\
    \ available ﬂows to six\ninterconnected regulation rafts, with a total capacity\
    \ of 1 hm3. The distribution network conducts\nwater from the rafts to the various\
    \ irrigated farms, equipped with automatic ﬂow control counters and\nsetpoints,\
    \ ensuring an average allocation of 4025 m3/ha/year/farm.\nOne of the main problems\
    \ to be solved is the integration of the different technological elements\n(SCADA,\
    \ drawing software, independent sensors, and third-party services) that provide\
    \ information\nto the community in a single control point. The data from SCADA\
    \ that are integrated into the platform\nare shown in Table 1. The results derived\
    \ from the water analysis conducted at least twice a month\nwere also integrated\
    \ into the platform.\nTable 1. Type of facilities from supervisory control and\
    \ data acquisition (SCADA) that are integrated\ninto the platform and the associated\

    \ Equipment and Implementation\nFigure 4 shows the general scheme that was followed\
    \ to address the deployment of the platform.\nThe ﬁrst step was to channel water\
    \ from the headwater reservoir, with its corresponding water analyses,\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 1153\n10 of 20\nto the agricultural plots. The plot is one of the\
    \ key elements of the system. All the devices needed for\nits deﬁnition are integrated\
    \ using dataloggers and IoT connectors. Through this process, SCADA data\nand\
    \ the sensors that interact with the plot (soil moisture sensors, agricultural\
    \ weather station, and\nhydrants) are integrated into the systems. The information\
    \ is transferred to the data model for later\nvisualization (using mobile or web\
    \ applications) and analysis by the users of the irrigation community.\nFigure\
    \ 4. Layout of the case study.\nThe deployment involved the installation of controllers\
    \ for monitoring, and remote control in\noutdoor environments were provided by\
    \ Odin Solutions [31]. The cost of implementing the platform\nwas reduced due\
    \ to the open source feature of the platform. This feature decreased the budget\
    \ needed\nfor dataloggers managing different devices or sensors in the platform.\
    \ In this instance, the cost of\nthe chosen datalogger, IPex12, has an average\
    \ price of around 600 euros (including conﬁguration\nand installation) and varies\
    \ according to the number of sensors integrated into the system. The main\ncharacteristics\
    \ of IPex12 are: 32-bit CPU and 4 MB of memory expandable with microSD, Ethernet,\n\
    USB, CAN, 3xRS232, 1xRS485, and 12 I/O ports, which can be conﬁgured by software\
    \ as digital or\nanalogue input/outputs. It supports Third-generation Networks\
    \ (3G), IPv6 over Low power Wireless\nPersonal Area Networks (6LowPAN), Sigfox,\
    \ Narrow Band IoT (NB IoT), and LoRA. Each IPex12\nis able to manage eight additional\
    \ slaves I/O boards using CAN. The controllers are conﬁgured\neffortlessly through\
    \ their web server, which permits us to conﬁgure tasks independently from the\n\
    MQTT commands received from the cloud computing layer. IPex12 is specially designed\
    \ for outdoor\nsettings such as the agricultural scenarios, since it is provided\
    \ with water- and dust-proof enclosure.\nIt is provided with a battery and a solar\
    \ panel.\nThe dataloggers have the ability to monitor sensor readings of soil\
    \ conductivity, soil moisture,\nsoil temperature, water meter readings, and meteorological\
    \ parameters, among others, and to operate\nthe solenoid valves to control the\
    \ irrigation system.\nThe cloud server is a PowerEdge R7515 Server, with an AMD\
    \ EPYC 7402 2.80 GHz, 32 GB of\nRAM, and two solid state drives (SSD) of 480 GB\
    \ each. It also runs the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Server and\nLibVirt/KVM. A single virtual\
    \ machine was used here for the global broker, data saving, big data\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 1153\n11 of 20\nprocesses, and to host management with web services.\
    \ The virtual machine uses 28 GB of memory and\n400 GB of hard disk capacity.\
    \ A good performance is possible at the moment, but given the ﬂexibility\nof our\
    \ architecture, more resources could be added by modifying or moving virtual images.\n\
    Once the different modules that form the platform were conﬁgured, the entities\
    \ were deﬁned\nin the broker so that their subscriptions could be made later.\
    \ The broker manages subscriptions\nto the creation or changes of entities. All\
    \ these changes are stored in MongoDB, a nonrelational\nJSON-LD object-based database,\
    \ to provide fast and ﬂexible access to information. The speed of\nprocessing\
    \ is fundamental because, otherwise, a bottleneck is created that would slow down\
    \ the rest of\nthe implementations.\nTo improve the data of the irrigation plots,\
    \ the data model proposed in Section 2.1 was used\naccording to the needs proposed\
    \ by the users of the irrigation community. A model instantiation was\nconstructed\
    \ through NGSI-LD of an apricot tree plot where a soil moisture sensor was installed.\
    \ The\nsoil moisture sensor is listed in Listing 1 and the crop is deﬁned in Listing\
    \ 2.\nListing 1. Next generation service interfaces with linked data (NGSI-LD)\

    \ and Validation\nThis section describes the validation of the platform in a community\
    \ of irrigators from three\ndifferent perspectives. The tests were conducted under\
    \ a controlled environment with the equipment\ndescribed in Section 3.2.\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 1153\n14 of 20\n4.1. Information Broker Evaluation\nThe main element\
    \ of the platform is a NGSI-LD broker, which is responsible for storing all the\n\
    information as well as processing the different queries, answers, subscriptions,\
    \ and the management\nof the information providers. For this reason, an analysis\
    \ was performed by selecting the following\nmetrics: CPU usage, memory consumed,\
    \ and response times, according to the operations performed.\nFirstly, different\
    \ execution tests were conducted to check the platform ability to perform the\n\
    changes without losing the quality of service. The tests were performed with the\
    \ same type of requests,\nchecking their response time in terms of both CPU and\
    \ RAM. All tests were based on a one-minute\nexecution varying the number of simultaneous\
    \ communications or connections with which it was\nperformed. Figure 5 shows the\
    \ results of the tests of the behavior of the processor and the memory.\n(a) CPU\
    \ usage\n(b) RAM usage\nFigure 5. Evaluation of platform scalability.\nFigure\
    \ 5a shows that the CPU requirements increased by around 20% in the ﬁrst intervals\
    \ (2, 4,\nand 8 threads). From this moment on and up to 1024 threads, the CPU\
    \ remained stable with average\nvalues close to 90%. Figure 5b shows that the\
    \ behavior in the use of the RAM remains practically stable\nfrom the beginning\
    \ to the end without altering the consumed resources. The increase in the use\
    \ of the\nRAM during the tests performed varied between 5% and 9%, values that\
    \ are considered optimal.\nThe behaviour of the platform was evaluated based on\
    \ the information distribution characteristic\nthat the broker had acquired. To\
    \ this end, the response time obtained after performing various\noperations on\
    \ the different broker operating modes is analyzed; Table 2 shows the most signiﬁcant\n\
    values obtained in the tests. The graphs shown in Figure 6 show the times for\
    \ the different modes:\nentity management, subscription management, and context\
    \ provider control.\n•\nThe publication/subscription model enables the reduction\
    \ of the number of queries because it is\nnot necessary to make periodic queries\
    \ to receive updates to the data stored on the platform. The\ncreation time is\
    \ longer since it has to be adjusted to the proposed data model;\n•\nThe management\
    \ of external context suppliers is a process that speeds up access to the information,\n\
    making the process more transparent for the ﬁnal client. The broker’s mission\
    \ is to act as a proxy\nbetween the client and the context provider. For this\
    \ reason, search and consultation times are\nshorter compared with the rest of\
    \ the operations.\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n15 of 20\n(a) Entities\n(b) Subscriptions\n\

    This section provides an evaluation of the response times of the platform based\
    \ on the three layers\nthat form its architecture. Figure 7 shows the times obtained\
    \ for the system after the execution of\n100 requests. Figure 7a shows the notiﬁcation\
    \ times at its two levels: at MQTT level (MQTT broker\nnotiﬁes the IoT Agent)\
    \ and at NGSI-LD broker level. The times of the Information Management Layer are\n\
    longer, with an average of 21.69 s, since all the semantic enrichment provided\
    \ by the use of the data\nmodel is performed in the database (MongoDB). However,\
    \ in exchange for this increase in time, it is\npossible to have all the relevant\
    \ information of the irrigation community homogenized and integrated\ninto a single\
    \ point. Figure 7b shows the system’s capabilities in terms of performance management.\n\
    The graph shows that if the device is connected, the response time is less than\
    \ if it is not; the average\nresponse time of 31.18 ms is considered low.\nSensors\

    \ Use of the Platform at the Agricultural Level\nData interoperability is of critical\
    \ importance. Here, the proposed solution (data model and\nplatform) provides\
    \ the necessary data translation mechanisms by combining the use of a data model\n\
    together with standardized solutions, such as those provided through NGSI-LD.\
    \ This proposal enables\nthe integration of multiple systems/devices or data sources,\
    \ resulting in an open and interoperable data\nintegration model according to\
    \ the changing requirements of farms. The use of data models contributes\nto obtaining\
    \ performance indicators, decision making, and sharing data with different farms.\n\
    Figure 8 shows the evolution of irrigation before the platform was installed.\
    \ The analysis of\nthe data revealed the irregularity of the irrigation system.\
    \ To have a continuous and homogeneous\nirrigation system, we deemed it necessary\
    \ to deﬁne irrigation thresholds provided by the agricultural\ntechnicians. As\
    \ the ﬁeld capacity and the wilt point determine the maximum and minimum limits\
    \ of the\nsoil humidity that can be used by the crops, we concluded that the amount\
    \ of water between these\ntwo values is the functional water or humidity available\
    \ to the plant. Once the community technicians\ndeﬁned the limits for the crops,\
    \ tests were conducted on an apricot tree plot to evaluate the irrigation\nefﬁciency:\
    \ the ﬁrst as soon as the platform was deployed (between March and April), and\
    \ another after\nimproving the irrigation programming based on the results of\
    \ the ﬁrst test (between June and July).\nFigure 8. Evolution of the humidity\
    \ of an apricot crop based on set water levels.\nOnce the ﬁrst test was analyzed,\
    \ Figure 8, we found that during irrigation, two critical zones\nwere generated,\
    \ A and B, with extreme peaks that were outside the recommended limits, indicating\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 1153\n17 of 20\nthat water use was not efﬁcient, thus a scarce\
    \ resource was being wasted. Zone A indicates that root\nasphyxiation was produced\
    \ (a limitation of the capacity of the plants to breathe through the roots)\n\
    in the crop by excess water; Zone B indicates that the plant does not have ability\
    \ to supply itself\nwith water, consequently reducing the quality of the production\
    \ of the crop. Once the maximum and\nminimum thresholds are set, rules can be\
    \ deﬁned for efﬁcient irrigation. When the thresholds are\nexceeded or not reached,\
    \ the platform generates notiﬁcations to users through the mobile application.\n\
    These rules can also be associated with the activation of digital inputs for the\
    \ start-up of any device\nthat improves irrigation efﬁciency.\nAs a result of\
    \ the use of the platform and the analysis of the data obtained, and with the\
    \ help of\nan agricultural technician, the relevant irrigation limits are established\
    \ or adjusted. In addition, other\nuseful parameters can be established, such\
    \ as the root network, the type of soil, or the disposition of\nthe probes. Once\
    \ the irrigation programming was changed, Figure 9 shows that the irrigation was\n\
    efﬁciently applied. The water contributions and vertical column are in line with\
    \ the humidity curves,\nshowing stable and uniform sharing. By controlling the\
    \ hydrants and applying ﬁlters based on the\nlimits set, irrigation was controlled\
    \ to maintain the humidity within the desired parameters, or to\ninform of possible\
    \ alerts to activate programmed irrigation to avoid a reduction in production.\n\
    Figure 9.\nEvolution of efﬁcient irrigation, comparing soil moisture and water\
    \ contribution by\nthe hydrant.\nThe versatility of the platform is stressed by\
    \ the ability to export selected data for further\nprocessing or study, as shown\
    \ in Figures 8 and 9 using the export to CSV option.\n5. Conclusions\nThis work\
    \ demonstrated the importance of interoperability in the ﬁeld of agriculture,\
    \ water\nmanagement, and irrigation systems. Herein, an interoperable and open\
    \ platform is presented which\nis capable of integrating heterogeneous data sources\
    \ at the IoT level to aid and improve the decision\nmaking in a community of irrigators.\
    \ The platform enables the integration of controllers and sensors\nfrom different\
    \ manufacturers, and thus represents a unique access point for all this information.\n\
    As such, improving the techniques used in the agricultural sector is possible,\
    \ thereby sustainably\nobtaining higher economic, environmental, and social yields.\
    \ As a result of its interoperable nature,\nthe platform can be combined with\
    \ other systems to expand its range of services. The interoperability\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 1153\n18 of 20\naspect was tested in a real-world context where successful\
    \ integration with other systems already\ndeployed in the facilities of the irrigation\
    \ community was possible thanks to this characteristic. The\nplatform integrates\
    \ different protocols at the IoT level, such as MQTT, CoAP, LoRa, SigFox, and\
    \ HTTP.\nThey transport the information following different data formats. Nevertheless,\
    \ a set of them promote\ninteroperability, such as Lightweight Machine to Machine\
    \ (LWM2M), JSON, and UltraLight. These\nrepresentation formats were adopted by\
    \ the presented platform as to facilitate its integration into IoT\ndevices, making\
    \ use of this technology. The agents of the IoT backend of our platform perform\
    \ the\nadaptation of this information to the NGSI-LD interface and data model.\
    \ After analyzing the obtained\nresults in the community of irrigators, the following\
    \ conclusions were obtained:\n1.\nA homogeneous data model was proposed that meets\
    \ the speciﬁc needs of agriculture, such\nas efﬁcient water management. This model\
    \ was validated on the platform using an NGSI-LD\nbroker. The application of this\
    \ model in an irrigation community provides its managers with the\ncapacity to\
    \ manage the agronomic information and its relationship with the devices that\
    \ provide\ninformation to improve irrigation water;\n2.\nThe platform was validated\
    \ using metrics to check its behavior. Firstly, the scalability of the main\n\
    component, the NGSI-LD broker, was analyzed based on the average use of the CPU\
    \ (83.21%) and\nmemory (56.39%). At the latency level, measures were recorded\
    \ on the most relevant operations\nof the broker, highlighting among them the\
    \ average time, 510.28 ms, of the creation of a context\nprovider. The platform\
    \ was validated as a whole, showing the time delay from the moment the\ndevice\
    \ receives the information and when it is received by the platform (2.97 s); and\
    \ from the\nmoment the action is performed (31.17 ms);\n3.\nAt the user level,\
    \ the platform was validated in several apricot tree plots, improving the\nmanagement\
    \ of the water used. This improvement was achieved because of the deﬁnition\n\
    of optimal irrigation thresholds for each crop and by generating ﬁlter notiﬁcations\
    \ that, under\ncertain conditions, allow the hydrants to be adjusted, thus enabling\
    \ efﬁcient water use.\nIn the future, the speed of computing and latency should\
    \ be compared by replicating the platform\nin edge computing with current cloud\
    \ computing to detect which one provides better performance and\nresponse times.\
    \ One of these involves the processing of satellite images. At the plot level,\
    \ this feature\nwill monitor the main characteristics of the crop with applications\
    \ based on remote sensors. This new\nattribute will focus on the diagnosis, management,\
    \ and control of irrigation. Currently, this feature\nuses images of the Sentinel\
    \ 2 satellite, which is more focused on agricultural issues, but soon the PAZ\n\
    satellite (the ﬁrst Spanish radar earth observation satellite, which is included\
    \ within the National Earth\nObservation Programme) will be used. Another future\
    \ line of research is the development of a data\nanalysis module that will allow\
    \ us to cross check and analyze the history of the data acquired. This\nwill generate\
    \ better results in agricultural management, increase productivity, and reduce\
    \ expenses,\nsuch as by reducing the consumption of water, nutrients, and phytosanitary\
    \ products.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualisation, J.A.L.-M., J.A.M. and A.F.S.;\

    Cited By: 16 Abstract In the last few years, while the COVID-19 pandemic affects
    food supply chains around the world, the agriculture sector also has faced many
    global problems, such as global warming, environmental pollution, climate change,
    and weather disasters. It has known that technological opportunities are available
    for human beings to get out of these predicaments, solving the interconnections
    between food-water-energy- climate nexus, and achieving agricultural transformation
    from traditional to digital. The aim of this review is to gain holistic solutions
    in a systematic view, based on water-energy-food resources to agricultural digital
    transformation that will play role in sustainable development. The transition
    from primitive to digital is given with road maps covering agricultural and industrial
    revolutions at four stages on timeline. Digital agriculture combined under precision
    agriculture and Agriculture 4.0 are handled based on domains covering monitoring,
    control, prediction, and logistics. Digital technologies are explained with application
    examples such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, big data, artificial
    intelligence, decision support systems, etc. Wearable sensor technologies, real-time
    monitoring systems tracking whole conditions of animals in livestock, the IoT-based
    irrigation and fertilization systems that help enhance the efficiency of irrigation
    processes and minimize water and fertilizer losses in agricultural fields and
    greenhouses, blockchain-based electronic agriculture, and solutions based on drones
    and robotics that reduce herbicide and pesticide use are handled systematically.
    Moreover, renewable energy technologies to be provided synergy between technologies
    such as agrivoltaics and aquavoltaics combining food and energy production in
    rural are explained, besides solar-powered pivot and drip irrigation systems and
    environmental monitoring systems. As a result, for a sustainable future, technological
    innovations that increase crop productivity and improve crop quality, protect
    the environment, provide efficient resource use and decrease input costs can help
    us facing in agriculture of today overwhelm many the economic, social, and environmental
    challenges. Keywords Smart Farming, Digital transformation, Sustainable development,

    \ water more efﬁciently. Such solutions\ninvolve the development of smart irrigation\
    \ systems where Internet of Things (IoT) nodes are\ndeployed throughout large\
    \ areas. In addition, in the mentioned areas, wireless communications\ncan be\
    \ difﬁcult due to the presence of obstacles and metallic objects that block electromagnetic\n\
    wave propagation totally or partially. This article details the development of\
    \ a smart irrigation\nsystem able to cover large urban areas thanks to the use\
    \ of Low-Power Wide-Area Network\n(LPWAN) sensor nodes based on LoRa and LoRaWAN.\
    \ IoT nodes collect soil temperature/moisture\nand air temperature data, and control\
    \ water supply autonomously, either by making use of fog\ncomputing gateways or\
    \ by relying on remote commands sent from a cloud. Since the selection\nof IoT\
    \ node and gateway locations is essential to have good connectivity and to reduce\
    \ energy\nconsumption, this article uses an in-house 3D-ray launching radio-planning\
    \ tool to determine the best\nlocations in real scenarios. Speciﬁcally, this paper\
    \ provides details on the modeling of a university\ncampus, which includes elements\
    \ like buildings, roads, green areas, or vehicles. In such a scenario,\nsimulations\
    \ and empirical measurements were performed for two different testbeds: a LoRaWAN\n\
    testbed that operates at 868 MHz and a testbed based on LoRa with 433 MHz transceivers.\
    \ All the\nmeasurements agree with the simulation results, showing the impact\
    \ of shadowing effects and\nmaterial features (e.g., permittivity, conductivity)\
    \ in the electromagnetic propagation of near-ground\nand underground LoRaWAN communications.\
    \ Higher RF power levels are observed for 433 MHz\ndue to the higher transmitted\
    \ power level and the lower radio propagation losses, and even in the\nworst gateway\
    \ location, the received power level is higher than the sensitivity threshold\
    \ (−148 dBm).\nRegarding water consumption, the provided estimations indicate\
    \ that the proposed smart irrigation\nsystem is able to reduce roughly 23% of\
    \ the amount of used water just by considering weather\nforecasts. The obtained\
    \ results provide useful guidelines for future smart irrigation developers and\n\

    \ of the network in terms of coverage, cost, and energy consumption.\nKeywords:\

    The lack of water and water-stressed areas are becoming serious problems to many\
    \ places around\nthe world. According to the United Nations (UN), by 2025, water\
    \ scarcity will affect 1.8 billion\npeople and two thirds of the population will\
    \ live under water-stressed conditions [1]. In addition,\nwater demand is expected\
    \ to grow 50% by 2050 due to the increase in the number of people living in\n\
    urban areas. As a consequence, drought is expected to have a widespread short\
    \ and long-term impact\non the everyday life of many people. Together with that,\
    \ climate change is increasing ﬂood risks and\nextreme precipitation events [2].\n\
    To tackle the previous issues, the UN recommends taking actions on three aspects\
    \ [1]:\nthe development of drought monitoring systems, the assessment of the potential\
    \ risks and vulnerabilities,\nand the design of drought risk mitigation strategies.\
    \ The present article deals with the latter by designing,\nimplementing, and validating\
    \ empirically a smart irrigation system that can be deployed in urban and\nsuburban\
    \ scenarios.\nSpeciﬁcally, the irrigation system proposed in this article has\
    \ been deployed on a university\ncampus and makes use of Internet of Things (IoT)\
    \ nodes able to collect environmental data\n(e.g., soil temperature/moisture and\
    \ air temperature) and that can be activated remotely, either through\nmanual\
    \ commands or through intelligent automated actions. In addition, the proposed\
    \ system\novercomes the main communications challenges that arise in urban scenarios\
    \ (e.g., the need for\nlong-range communications, long battery life, or high network\
    \ node capacity) by using Low-Power\nWide-Area Network (LPWAN) transceivers based\
    \ on LoRa and LoRaWAN, a standard that has recently\nattracted a lot of attention\
    \ from industry and academia [3–5].\nThis article also deals with another emerging\
    \ technology that has gained momentum:\nfog computing [6]. Fog computing is a\
    \ type of edge computing [7–9] that allows for extending certain\ncloud computing\
    \ features to the edge of the network through the use of low-power computational\n\
    devices like Single-Board Computers (SBCs). Thus, low-cost fog computing devices\
    \ have proven to be\nable to provide responses to IoT nodes signiﬁcantly faster\
    \ than a cloud [10], besides bringing location\nawareness to such responses (i.e.,\
    \ the responses provided by a fog device to the monitored IoT nodes\ncan be adapted\
    \ and reﬁned depending on their physical location).\nThe optimization of the deployment\
    \ of fog computing gateways and IoT nodes requires carrying\nout radio planning\
    \ tasks. Such tasks are essential for scenarios like the one modeled for this\
    \ paper\n(i.e., an university campus), which are specially challenging in terms\
    \ of radio propagation due to\ntheir large dimensions and the numerous obstacles\
    \ that impact electromagnetic waves. For that\npurpose, empirical models are usually\
    \ employed, which give rapid results but, with high errors,\nsince they are very\
    \ site-speciﬁc. In order to obtain accurate estimations, in this work, an in-house\n\
    developed 3D-Ray Launching (3D-RL) deterministic algorithm has been used to characterize\
    \ the\nLoRa/LoRaWAN radio channel at 868 MHz and 433 MHz. As it will be later\
    \ described in Section 4,\nthe algorithm provides a good trade-off between accuracy\
    \ and computational time. In addition,\nin order to complete the radio planning\
    \ study of the scenario under analysis, and validate the\nobtained simulation\
    \ results, empirical RF measurements were obtained for both 868 MHz and 433 MHz\n\
    frequency bands. Speciﬁcally, the following are the main contributions of this\
    \ article:\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n3 of 33\n•\nA comprehensive state-of-the-art\
    \ section is provided on the most relevant academic smart\nirrigation systems\
    \ and on the use of LoRa/LoRaWAN for underground scenarios.\n•\nAn architecture\
    \ is proposed for building novel smart irrigation systems based on the deployment\n\
    of LoRa/LoRaWAN transceivers and fog computing nodes.\n•\nThe implementation of\
    \ the proposed system and its hardware is described in detail so as to allow\n\
    future developers to replicate it easily.\n•\nThe radio planning analysis of the\
    \ scenario (i.e., a university campus) is presented together with\nan empirical\
    \ measurement campaign to corroborate the analytical results.\nThe rest of this\
    \ article is structured as follows. First, Section 2 analyzes the most relevant\
    \ previous\nworks on smart irrigation systems and on the use of LoRa and LoRaWAN\
    \ in underground scenarios.\nSection 3 describes thoroughly the proposed communications\
    \ architecture, the deployment scenario,\nand the implementation of the different\
    \ components of the smart irrigation system. Section 4 provides\ndetails on the\
    \ performed radio analysis: its characteristics, the conﬁguration of the used\
    \ 3D-RL tool,\nand the obtained simulation results. Finally, Section 5 is dedicated\
    \ to the description and analysis of the\nresults obtained during an empirical\
    \ measurement campaign, while Section 6 is devoted to conclusions.\n2. State of\
    \ the Art\n2.1. IoT Smart Irrigation Systems\nIoT has gained in the last few years\
    \ a lot of interest as a key enabler technology in smart\nagriculture [11]. With\
    \ respect to smart irrigation systems, there are a number of recent academic works\n\
    focused on decision planning and operation support. For instance, Khan et al.\
    \ [12] describe a Decision\nSupport System (DSS) that uses Xbee devices to cover\
    \ a relatively small area. Another interesting work\nwas presented by Togneri\
    \ et al. [13], who designed a ﬂexible IoT platform that enables developing\nMachine\
    \ Learning (ML)-based solutions for smart irrigation. Its core components are\
    \ a set of software,\nhardware, and communication technologies (e.g., LoRaWAN)\
    \ that include soil moisture sensor probes,\nthe use of an open-source platform\
    \ (FIWARE), a SPARQL event processing architecture, as well as\nspeciﬁc services\
    \ for irrigation planning and operation. Unfortunately, the mentioned article\
    \ does not\nprovide further details on the communications architecture. Recently,\
    \ Boursianis et al. [14] proposed\na sophisticated smart irrigation system that\
    \ exploits the capabilities of 5G networks and energy\nharvesting. A different\
    \ approach is proposed by Munir et al. [15], which uses an intelligent method\n\
    based on a fuzzy logic to schedule irrigation based on different parameters. Since\
    \ the design of smart\nirrigation systems involves several considerations, Table\
    \ 1 shows an overview of the main aspects\nto be taken into account. A complete\
    \ and detailed overview of the current state-of-the-art regarding\nthe IoT irrigation\
    \ system for precision agriculture is presented in [16]. The authors review in\
    \ detail\ncommon sensors and actuators to develop the IoT irrigation systems,\
    \ most common parameters to be\nmonitored, the type of irrigation, the type of\
    \ node, the type of wireless communication technology,\namong others.\nSensors\

    Among the most popular LPWAN communications technologies (e.g., Sigfox, LoRa/LoRaWAN,\n\
    WavIoT, Random Phase Multiple Access (RPMA), Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) or LTE-M),\
    \ LoRa and\nLoRaWAN were selected due to their expected communications range and\
    \ performance in scenarios\nwhere signiﬁcant signal attenuation occurs, like is\
    \ the case for underground communications. In fact,\nsome authors already performed\
    \ thorough comparisons among LPWAN technologies and showed that\nRPMA and LTE-M\
    \ incur additional path losses in comparison to Sigfox or LoRAWAN technologies\
    \ [17].\nIn the case of LoRa or LoRaWAN, they use a proprietary Chirp Spread Spectrum\
    \ (CSS) modulation in\nthe PHY layer, but their MAC layer is an open speciﬁcation.\
    \ On the contrary, Sigfox makes use of an\nopen chipset, but its network is closed\
    \ (i.e., it is necessary to pay a periodic fee). Nonetheless, it must\nbe noted\
    \ that there is no fully open LPWAN protocol stack (for PHY and MAC layers).\n\
    To provide coverage for large areas, LoRa/LoRaWAN solutions have been suggested\
    \ for\ndeveloping smart irrigation systems. For example, Gloria et al. [18] describe\
    \ a Wireless Sensor\nNetwork (WSN) controlled by a single gateway (a broker) that\
    \ is in constant communication with\nan online server that uses LoRa peer-to-peer\
    \ connections. Message Queuing Telemetry Transport\n(MQTT) via a WiFi connection\
    \ is used for exchanging messages between the server and the nodes.\nAnother solution\
    \ was presented by Usmonov et al. [19], who detailed a LoRaWAN-based cost-effective\n\
    wireless control system for drip irrigation. Such a solution uses a master station\
    \ to relay packets\nbetween the control application and the deployed end-device\
    \ nodes. It is also worth mentioning the\nwork described in [20], which details\
    \ the design and implementation of a LoRaWAN smart irrigation\nsystem in a typical\
    \ urban environment. In such a work, the authors indicate that the communications\n\
    distance between the irrigation node and the gateway can reach up to 8 km (covering\
    \ an area of up to\n2 km2) and provide energy-consumption results that consider\
    \ different operating modes of the end\nnodes. Note that larger areas could be\
    \ easily covered with LoRa. Finally, it is relevant to mention the\nwork of other\
    \ authors like Citoni et al. [21], who studied the deployment limitations of large-scale\n\
    LoRaWAN IoT applications. Speciﬁcally, such a work analyzed the impact of packet\
    \ collision on the\nscalability of a LoRaWAN deployment.\n2.3. LoRa and LoRaWAN\
    \ in Underground Scenarios\nIn this article, underground scenarios are deﬁned\
    \ as the ones that make use of wireless\ncommunications transceivers to send and\
    \ to receive data from under the soil. Such transceivers have\nto be able to avoid\
    \ the communications issues that arise when operating underground in a number\n\
    of industrial applications, like maintenance [22], mining [23,24], agriculture\
    \ [25,26], or structural\nengineering [27].\nIn underground scenarios, the radio\
    \ signal absorption loss caused by the soil severely affects\nthe performance\
    \ of traditional wireless communications technologies. In particular, factors\
    \ that\naffect signal propagation in underground scenarios are the soil type and\
    \ density, the soil moisture,\nthe existence of certain elements (e.g., plant\
    \ roots, rocks or underground pipelines), and the burial\ndepth [28].\nAlthough\
    \ authors like Akyildiz et al. [29] suggest some interesting preliminary results,\
    \ the existing\nresearch on in-soil underground communications is still not mature.\
    \ For instance, one of the ﬁrst\nempirical studies on the topic was presented\
    \ in 2010 by Silva et al. [30]. In such a work, the authors\ntested ZigBee MICA2\
    \ and MICAz motes in an agriculture ﬁeld.\nTheir results showed a high\nasymmetry\
    \ between underground and above ground communications, being highly dependent\
    \ on\nburial depth and soil moisture (e.g., a 21% increase in water content decreased\
    \ the signal coverage\nby more than 70%). Besides ZigBee, other authors have tested\
    \ in similar scenarios some of the most\npopular traceability technologies like\
    \ Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation (RFID) [31,32] for developing\nunderground applications\
    \ [33,34].\nLoRa and LoRaWAN make use of a chirp spread modulation that offers\
    \ several advantages for\nunderground communications [35]: better coverage than\
    \ technologies like WiFi or ZigBee, a sensitivity\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n6 of\
    \ 33\non the order of –130 dBm, low energy consumption, and low cost. There are\
    \ a number of recent papers\nthat study the performance of LoRa/LoRaWAN in underground\
    \ scenarios. For instance, Wan et al. [36]\ndesigned and evaluated a LoRa propagation\
    \ test node. They concluded that, if rainfall and irrigation\nhappen frequently,\
    \ their associated channel losses need to be compensated with increased transmission\n\
    power or with the use of high-gain antennas, the latter being the recommended\
    \ approach. Moreover,\nthe authors provide additional recommendations: with respect\
    \ to the burial depth of the node, it should\nbe as close as possible to the surface\
    \ and, regarding the Packet Success Rate (PSR) of underground\ncommunications,\
    \ a shorter LoRa payload is required for a higher PSR.\nLoRa in-soil propagation\
    \ was also studied by Xue-fen et al. [37], who proposed a smartphone-based\nLoRa\
    \ underground measurement system. Thus, the authors described thoroughly two scenarios\n\
    (a farmland and a garden) that considered the type of soil (e.g., homogeneous\
    \ loam) and plants\n(e.g., mainly rice), the root depth of grass and camphor trees,\
    \ and the characteristics of underground\niron pipelines that are used for municipal\
    \ drainage and communications. They also considered\ntwo different paths: underground-underground\
    \ (UU) and underground-above ground-underground\n(UAU). In their experiments,\
    \ the attenuation of the radio signals in the UU path, which is related\nto the\
    \ soil characteristics and to other underground obstructions, was higher than\
    \ for the UAU\npath. Thus, the actual attenuation in the analyzed environment\
    \ needed to be obtained through\nmeasurements, due to the randomness of the soil\
    \ and the obstructions. Xue-fen et al. also note\nthe negative impact of soil\
    \ moisture on LoRa in-soil propagation considering the precipitation rate,\nthe\
    \ randomness of rainfalls, and the amount of irrigation water in the area for\
    \ the last 12 h. Since the\nwater content in deep soil is usually higher than\
    \ the one of the surface, the packet success rate decreases\nwith deeper burial\
    \ depth. A similar approach was taken in [38], where, after developing an in-soil\n\
    propagation test node, the authors performed measurements and analyses of the\
    \ results in a riverside\npark. In the case of Lin et al. [39], they focused their\
    \ research on an experimental analysis on the\ninﬂuence of various physical layer\
    \ parameters (e.g., spreading factor, coding rate, bandwidth) on\nLoRa’s propagation\
    \ performance.\n2.4. Key Findings\nAfter reviewing the state-of-the art, it can\
    \ be concluded that there are a number of recent articles\nthat make use of LoRa/LoRAWAN\
    \ as preferred wireless technology for IoT smart irrigation systems.\nIn contrast\
    \ to the proposed system, previous research is mainly focused on DSS capabilities\
    \ introducing\nstatistical or ML/AI (Artiﬁcial Intelligence) techniques for decision-making,\
    \ or on the proper irrigation\nsystem design, focused on optimizing hardware capabilities.\
    \ Thus, there is barely any system that proposes\nthe use of fog or edge computing.\
    \ In addition, in relation to radio signal absorption loss in underground\nscenarios,\
    \ most authors recommend performing in-soil wireless propagation measurements\
    \ before the\ndesign, installation, and maintenance of any smart irrigation system,\
    \ but the use of scenario simulators\ntogether with practical deployments has\
    \ been barely documented.\nTable 2 compares the main features of the most relevant\
    \ smart irrigation systems. As it can be\nobserved, in contrast to the compared\
    \ systems, this article presents an IoT LPWAN smart irrigation\nsystem with a\
    \ fog computing-based architecture whose node and gateway locations can be optimized\n\
    for urban areas thanks to the help of an in-house developed 3D-ray launching radio\
    \ planning simulator.\nThe system proposed in this article is based on the use\
    \ of LoRa or LoRaWAN due to their ability\nto provide medium and long-range coverage\
    \ in both indoor and outdoor scenarios, thus ﬁtting into\nthe traditional areas\
    \ where smart irrigation is required. Speciﬁcally, previous literature evaluated\
    \ LoRa\nrange, obtaining up to 30 km for boat communications and 15 km for car\
    \ communications [40], up to\n8 km (but losing many packets) and up to 4 km (losing\
    \ a few packets) within urban environments [41],\nup to 500 m for very dense-vegetation\
    \ environments [42] and a radius coverage of 1.8 km for a soil\nmonitoring system\
    \ in agriculture by means of LoRa devices with worse performance in terms of\n\
    sensitivity than the ones used in this article [43].\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n\

    \ smart irrigation\ndeployments: their energy consumption is relative low (RX\
    \ current is usually around 10 mA,\nwhile deep-sleep current is under 200 nA),\
    \ its robustness against interference has been proven [44,45],\ntransceiver cost\
    \ is also low (less than US$ 8, as of writing) and there is no need to pay monthly\
    \ fees to a\nmobile carrier. Nonetheless, developers must note that LoRa and LoRaWAN\
    \ have not been devised to\ntransfer large data payloads fast (the theoretical\
    \ maximum data rate is usually 50 Kbps for LoRa and\n27 Kbps for LoRaWAN) and\
    \ they make use of Industrial-Scientiﬁc-Medical (ISM) bands, so interference\n\
    may arise from other devices that operate in the same radio frequency.\n3. Design\
    \ and Implementation of the System\n3.1. Smart Irrigation Scenario\nBefore describing\
    \ the design and implementation of the proposed smart irrigation system, it is\n\
    ﬁrst necessary to detail the characteristics of the scenario where it is deployed\
    \ in order to understand\nthe choices made. Such a scenario is located in the\
    \ Campus of Elviña, at the University of A Coruña\n(Spain), in an area that covers\
    \ 7500 m2 (with 50 m of width and 150 m of length). The speciﬁc area\nis shown\
    \ in Figure 1 together with the locations of the deployed smart irrigation nodes\
    \ (red circles,\nnumbered 1 through 8) and communication gateways (purple circles,\
    \ numbered 9 to 11).\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n8 of 33\n1\n2\n3\n5\n6\n7\n8\n4\n\
    9\n11\n10\nFigure 1. Analyzed scenario with deployed nodes (red circles) and gateway\
    \ locations (purple circles)\n(Map source: ©2020 Google).\nThe area where the\
    \ smart irrigation system was deployed includes elements typically found in\n\
    urban and suburban environments: besides the gardens to be irrigated (composed\
    \ by lawn and diverse\ntypes of trees), there are several buildings, roads, and\
    \ cars. As an example, the pictures in Figure 2 show\nthe areas where smart irrigation\
    \ nodes 1, 3, and 4 were located, and where the mentioned elements\nof the scenario\
    \ can be observed. It is important to note that the size of the scenario and the\
    \ speciﬁc\narea were selected for convenience reasons, as they are close to the\
    \ lab of the researchers, and they are\nrepresentative of the entire campus. In\
    \ such a scenario, gateways and nodes were deployed in an area\nthat is large\
    \ enough to validate the proposed communications architecture and the smart irrigation\n\
    system, but larger areas could be easily covered by adding more LoRaWAN nodes\
    \ and, if needed,\nadditional gateways. Moreover, the scalability provided by\
    \ LoRa for the communication between\nnodes and the gateway can be easily replicated\
    \ by the used 3D-RL simulator, which, once the scenario\nto be simulated is created,\
    \ only requires specifying the desired number of nodes and their location in\n\
    order to obtain simulation results. Nonetheless, it must be emphasized that the\
    \ higher the number of\nnodes, the higher the computational cost/time that will\
    \ be required for the simulations.\nFigure 2. Areas where smart irrigation nodes\
    \ 3 and 4 (left) and 1 (right) were located.\n3.2. Designed Communications Architecture\n\
    Figure 3 shows the communications architecture of the proposed system. In such\
    \ a ﬁgure,\nthe different components are connected through arrows that indicate\
    \ the way communications are\nperformed (e.g., the two-way arrow that connects\
    \ Remote Services with Third-Party Services indicate\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n\
    9 of 33\nthat the former make requests to the latter to ask for certain information\
    \ and the latter respond with\nthe requested data). Speciﬁcally, the proposed\
    \ architecture is composed of three layers:\nRemote Users\nIoT Node Layer\nMain\

    Weather Forecast\nFigure 3. Designed communications architecture of the proposed\
    \ system.\n•\nIoT Node Layer. This layer consists of smart irrigation IoT nodes\
    \ that exchange information with\nlocal gateways. The double arrows that communicate\
    \ the IoT Node Layer with the Fog Computing\nLayer in Figure 3 represent bidirectional\
    \ communications, which indicate that remote commands\ncan be sent to the IoT\
    \ nodes, while such nodes can send information about the successful execution\n\
    of the commands (e.g., in order to determine whether the system works properly)\
    \ or on the state\nof their sensors.\n•\nFog Computing Layer. This layer is composed\
    \ by local gateways distributed over different\nlocations to extend network connectivity\
    \ across large areas. Such gateways provide redundancy,\nlow-latency responses\
    \ and distributed processing, thus off-loading tasks from the remote cloud.\n\
    •\nRemote Service Layer. This layer is located in the cloud and collects data\
    \ from the deployed\ncomponents of the smart irrigation system. The collected\
    \ data can be processed and stored on\nthe cloud database in order to be later\
    \ shown to remote users through a user-friendly interface.\nMoreover, the services\
    \ on the cloud can exchange information with useful third-party services\n(e.g.,\
    \ an external weather forecast service).\n3.3. LoRa and LoRaWAN\nThe LoRa physical\
    \ layer operates in the ISM bands (e.g., 868 MHz, 433 MHz, and 915 MHz).\nIn Europe,\
    \ only the 868 MHz and 433 MHz bands can be used. Transmitted power is limited\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 6865\n10 of 33\nto 14 dBm Effective Isotropic Radiated Power\
    \ (EIRP) with a 1% duty cycle limit of on-air time.\nLoRa integrates a Forward\
    \ Error Correction (FEC) to increase robustness against noise and burst\ninterference.\n\
    Transmissions can be sent on different spreading factors, and, depending on the\n\
    modulation and transmission power, the link budget can be as high as 155 dB.\n\
    LoRaWAN involves a protocol stack with LoRa as the physical layer. It uses Adaptive\
    \ Data Rate\n(ADR) for managing individual data rates and maximizing the battery\
    \ lifetime of each connected\ndevice. The LoRaWAN network architecture has a star\
    \ topology in which end nodes communicate\nwith gateways which in turn connect\
    \ to network servers. A summary of LoRa/LoRaWAN main\ncharacteristics can be seen\
    \ in Table 3. In addition, the interested reader can obtain further details in\
    \ [46].\nTable 3. LoRa/LoRaWAN main speciﬁcations (Europe).\nParameter\nValue\n\

    \ the proposed system making use of LoRa/LoRaWAN, the three different layers deﬁned\n\
    in Figure 3 were implemented as illustrated in Figure 4. Note that Figures 3 and\
    \ 4 show an identical\nRemote Service Layer, but they differ signiﬁcantly on their\
    \ fog computing layer and on the way\nthey manage IoT nodes. Regarding Figure\
    \ 4, it is worth pointing out that, for the sake of clarity,\nit only refers to\
    \ LoRaWAN, since a LoRa-based architecture would be a subset. The main difference\n\
    between a LoRa-based and a LoRaWAN-based architecture is that LoRa does not need\
    \ a speciﬁc LoRa\nServer, while, in the case of LoRaWAN, such a server is necessary\
    \ to manage different aspects of the\nLoRaWAN network, like its security or certain\
    \ packet management tasks. For such a reason, the rest of\nthis subsection and\
    \ the next would only refer to LoRaWAN. Considering the previous clariﬁcation,\n\
    the layers depicted in Figure 4 were implemented as follows:\n•\nIoT Node Layer.\
    \ This layer is composed of IoT nodes that embed LoRaWAN transceivers, soil\n\
    sensors, and irrigation actuators. The LoRaWAN packets sent by the IoT nodes can\
    \ be collected\nby one or more nearby LoRaWAN gateways.\n•\nFog Computing Layer.\
    \ In this layer, LoRaWAN gateways collect packets from the deployed smart\nirrigation\
    \ nodes and then send them to a central LoRaWAN server, where they are decoded\
    \ and\nprocessed in order to provide fog computing services.\n•\nRemote Service\
    \ Layer. It works as it was previously described in Section 3.2.\nSensors 2020,\

    Node 2\nFigure 4. Implemented communications architecture.\n3.5. Implemented IoT\
    \ Node Layer\nThe implemented LoRaWAN IoT nodes send and receive information using\
    \ the LoRaWAN\nprotocol. Speciﬁcally, the deployed nodes are able to send periodically\
    \ the data collected from their\nsoil temperature/moisture and air temperature\
    \ sensors. In addition, the nodes can receive remote\ncommands to carry out different\
    \ tasks (e.g., to activate the irrigation actuator or to establish the\nwatering\
    \ schedule).\nIt must be noted that LoRaWAN end devices can be divided into three\
    \ classes (A, B, and C)\ndepending on their needs regarding downlink communications\
    \ (i.e., for transmitting data from a\nLoRaWAN gateway to the irrigation nodes)\
    \ [47]. In order to reduce node stand-by power consumption,\nthe smart irrigation\
    \ nodes were chosen to be of class A. Such a class allows the nodes to remain\
    \ asleep\nmost of the time to save power and to receive commands only during a\
    \ short period of time after\nsending data (this fact implies that remote commands\
    \ will not be executed in real time).\nEach IoT node was designed so that different\
    \ sensors can be used. For illustration purposes,\nFigure 5 shows one of the smart\
    \ irrigation IoT nodes disassembled. As it can be observed, each node\nincludes\
    \ interfaces for a DS18820 temperature sensor [48] and an SHT15 temperature and\
    \ moisture\nsensor [49]. In addition, each node provides an interface to connect\
    \ a 12 V-DC solenoid valve (Seafront\nG763hwmgsk) to control water irrigation.\n\
    The IoT node main board is based on a Heltec LoRa 32 V2 [50], which provides WiFi\
    \ connectivity,\nan OLED Display, and an SX1276 LoRa module. Moreover, a Real-Time\
    \ Clock (RTC) was embedded\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n12 of 33\nso that the microcontroller\
    \ can take time-accurate actions when the network time is not available\n(i.e.,\
    \ based on the local time indicated by the RTC).\nSHT15 \nSolenoid\nValve \nPower\
    \ \nRegulation \nHeltec LoRa 32 V2\nRTC\nDS18820\nFigure 5. Disassembled smart\
    \ irrigation node and its internal components.\nIt is possible to make use of\
    \ the characteristics of the previously described hardware to determine\nthe performance\
    \ of the system. Speciﬁcally, the characteristics of the selected valve allow\
    \ for estimating\nthat its water ﬂow is about 8 L per minute (a more precise estimation\
    \ could be calculated by embedding\na water ﬂow meter in every IoT node, but this\
    \ will also derive into the development of more expensive\nand power hungry nodes).\
    \ Assuming that the approximate amount of water required by the lawn to\nstay\
    \ green is about 10 L per square meter per day, it is possible to calculate the\
    \ savings yielded by the\nproposed smart irrigation system.\nFor calculating water\
    \ savings, it is necessary to consider that the smart irrigation system can\n\
    irrigate depending on the weather, since the system will not activate the node\
    \ valves if the weather\nforecast indicates that it is going to rain. Thus, if\
    \ the rainfall prediction is higher than 10 L per square\nmeter, it is not necessary\
    \ to irrigate throughout the whole day. On the contrary, if sunny weather\nconditions\
    \ are expected, with high solar radiation and low humidity, water evaporation\
    \ increases and,\nas a consequence, the amount of required irrigation will be\
    \ higher.\nThe proposed system allows, by means of automatic planning systems\
    \ or by manual programming,\nto reduce the amount of water to the minimum necessary\
    \ when weather conditions are adequate and\nto increase it when soil is too dry,\
    \ thus making a more efﬁcient use of water and thus reducing the\nwaste of water\
    \ considerably.\nSpeciﬁcally, considering only weather forecasts and by using\
    \ local forecasts data (provided by\na regional government agency called Meteogalicia\
    \ [51]) to obtain average rainfall over a year in\nthe selected irrigation area,\
    \ it has been estimated that 22.8% water savings would be achieved in\ncomparison\
    \ to a ﬁxed-schedule irrigation system. Such an estimation comes from the results\
    \ shown\nin Figure 6, which depicts the amount of water used throughout a whole\
    \ year (from November 2019\nto November 2020) by the smart irrigation system (red\
    \ line) depending on the amount of rainfall\n(blue line). As an additional example,\
    \ Figure 7 shows a more detailed graph for the month of September\n2020 in order\
    \ to illustrate the difference in water usage depending on weather conditions.\
    \ As it can\nbe clearly observed in Figure 7, the smart irrigation system makes\
    \ use of roughly 10 L per square\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n13 of 33\nmeter when\
    \ there is no rain, but such an amount decreases in proportion to the rainfall,\
    \ thus saving a\nsigniﬁcant amount of water.\nFigure 6. Estimated irrigation per\
    \ day during a year when depending on rain forecasts.\nFigure 7. Estimated irrigation\
    \ per day during the month of September 2020 when depending on\nrain forecasts.\n\
    3.6. Implemented Fog Computing and Remote Service Layers\nThe higher layers of\
    \ the architecture depicted in Figure 4 were implemented as follows:\n•\nFog Computing\
    \ Layer. It makes use of a central LoRaWAN server and LoRaWAN gateways\nthat can\
    \ be scattered throughout large areas. The LoRaWAN gateways are based on a regular\n\
    microcontroller (STM32L1), while the LoRaWAN server can be executed on a regular\
    \ PC. When IoT\nnodes need to send data, they send a LoRaWAN packet that will\
    \ be received by the nearest gateway.\nThen, the gateway forwards the packet to\
    \ the LoRaWAN server in the local network, which can\nsend it later to the cloud,\
    \ where all the information from the different LoRaWAN networks is\naggregated.\
    \ The LoRaWAN server is also able to perform local actions based on the received\n\
    information from a speciﬁc area before interacting with the cloud.\nSensors 2020,\
    \ 20, 6865\n14 of 33\n•\nRemote Service Layer. The core of the Remote Service\
    \ Layer manages data collection through\nNode-RED [52].\nIn addition, a MongoDB\
    \ database [53] is used to store the collected data.\nFurthermore, this layer\
    \ is able to make use of third-party services like weather forecasters\n(for deciding\
    \ irrigation schedules), which can be easily integrated with the Remote Service\
    \ Layer\nthrough Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming\
    \ Interfaces (APIs).\n3.7. Enabled Applications\nThe proposed smart irrigation\
    \ system provides numerous advantages with respect to traditional\nsystems thanks\
    \ to the intelligent automation of the irrigation process. Speciﬁcally, the following\
    \ are\nsome of the most relevant features of the proposed system that enable the\
    \ development of advanced\nirrigation applications:\n•\nIrrigation scheduling\
    \ can be adjusted dynamically and in a smart way by considering multiple\ninformation\
    \ sources like weather forecasts.\n•\nThe system can adjust dynamically to changing\
    \ environmental conditions, like soil moisture,\nground temperature, or real-time\
    \ weather conditions.\n•\nThe system is able to adjust the irrigation schedule\
    \ dynamically so as to adapt it to the species\nthat are grown on each individual\
    \ green area.\n•\nIn case of having directional irrigators on the IoT nodes, it\
    \ is possible to establish speciﬁc dynamic\nirrigation patterns with the objective\
    \ of watering very speciﬁc areas.\n•\nThe system can be easily scaled (it autonomously\
    \ connects to the nearest gateway), thus being\nable to cover large areas thanks\
    \ to the use of LPWAN technologies.\n•\nIt is straightforward to add additional\
    \ IoT sensor nodes (which do not need to embed irrigation\nactuators, but only\
    \ sensors like rain or leaf moisture sensors) in order to provide accurate data\
    \ on\nthe monitored green areas, thus enhancing the accuracy of the decisions\
    \ made on the irrigation.\n4. Campus Radio Channel Analysis\n4.1. Radio Analysis\
    \ Characteristics\nThis section introduces the radio planning tasks performed\
    \ prior to the deployment of the smart\nirrigation system. Since the considered\
    \ outdoor scenario is especially complex in terms of radio\npropagation, a precise\
    \ analysis of radio wave propagation must be performed.\nThe main factor that\
    \ makes the scenario so challenging is the underground wireless channel,\nwhich\
    \ is a heterogeneous layer of soil, rocks, water, and organic matter, among others.\
    \ Moreover,\nthe underground channel can also vary depending on the location and\
    \ weather conditions. In fact,\nelectromagnetic wave propagation through soil\
    \ and rock has been previously studied extensively for\nground-penetrating radar\
    \ applications [54–56]. However, a comprehensive channel model for the\nunderground\
    \ environment does not exist yet.\nThe main problems that impact communications\
    \ when using electromagnetic waves in an\nunderground environment are the following:\
    \ extreme path loss, reﬂection/refraction, multi-path\nfading, reduced propagation\
    \ velocity, and noise. A detailed description on the impact of these\nphenomena\
    \ in the underground communication can be found in [57].\nIt must be noted that\
    \ electromagnetic wave propagation depends on the dielectric constant of\nmedium\
    \ materials, which, in a smart irrigation scenario, is a heterogeneous mixture\
    \ of air, water,\nand soil. If the porosity of the soil particles is high, propagation\
    \ will be better due to the higher\namount of air present in the medium. On the\
    \ contrary, if the presence of water in the soil is high,\nelectromagnetic propagation\
    \ in the medium will be worse. Thus, particles of sand, clay, and silt of the\n\
    soil impact communications performance. Moreover, node burial depth also impacts\
    \ electromagnetic\npropagation [58,59].\nDue to the previously mentioned issues,\
    \ electromagnetic wave propagation in near-ground\nand underground environments\
    \ is challenging. To tackle them, this work makes use of an in-house\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 6865\n15 of 33\ndeterministic three-dimensional ray launching (3D-RL)\
    \ simulation tool together with an intensive\nmeasurement campaign for characterizing\
    \ the wireless channel within the scenario under analysis.\nThe used algorithm\
    \ is based on Geometrical Optics (GO) and the Uniform Theory of Diffraction\n\
    (UTD), making use of the 3D environment to efﬁciently launch rays from the transmitter\
    \ source.\nThus, the algorithm launches hundreds of rays from the transmitter\
    \ source with a predetermined\nangular separation. Such rays are traced in the\
    \ scenario according to the presence and distribution\nof obstacles. Along their\
    \ trajectory, when they encounter an obstacle, electromagnetic phenomena\nlike\
    \ reﬂection, refraction, and diffraction are considered. The 3D-RL principles\
    \ of operation and\nthe different considered phenomena are represented schematically\
    \ in Figure 8 for a transmitter\nlocated underground.\nFigure 8. Operation principles\
    \ and propagation phenomena of the used 3D-RL algorithm.\nThe used RL technique\
    \ is also referred in the literature as brute-force Ray Tracing (RT),\n‘shooting\
    \ and bouncing rays’ or beam-launching method [60–62]. The technique assumes a\
    \ space\ndiscretization in the simulated scenario, which limits ﬁeld prediction\
    \ accuracy and depends on the\nscenario dimensions. The optimal space discretization\
    \ for different scenarios has been obtained\nby experimental measurements in [63].\
    \ A detailed description of the used 3D-RL algorithm can\nbe found in [64]. Its\
    \ validation has been performed for different applications such as vehicular\n\
    communications [65], smart cities [66], or in homogeneous vegetation environments\
    \ [67]. It is worth\nnoting that, although the employed 3D-RL algorithm has inherent\
    \ constraints which lead to estimation\nerrors, mainly the limitation to create\
    \ the objects present within the scenario by tetrahedrons, and the\nnon-application\
    \ of the scattering effect due to rough surfaces, the obtained simulation results\
    \ are very\naccurate, and, therefore, the approximation valid.\n4.2. 3D-RL Scenario\n\
    Before deploying IoT nodes on a real scenario, it is worth realizing that a smart\
    \ irrigation system\nmay be impacted by certain limitations. First, the position\
    \ of the nodes on the ground depends on\nthe access to water supply and on the\
    \ surface to irrigate. Moreover, the deployment of the LoRaWAN\ngateway can be\
    \ optimized based on radio planning analysis. To contemplate such factors, the\
    \ scenario\nwas modeled in 3D with the 3D-RL tool as it can be observed in Figure\
    \ 9 (this scenario is actually part\nof a larger scenario created and used previously\
    \ in [4]).\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n16 of 33\nFigure 9. Scenario created for 3D-RL\
    \ simulations (Map source: ©2020 Google).\nTo obtain accurate RF power distribution\
    \ estimations, the simulation scenario was created as\ndetailed as possible, thus\
    \ including the most relevant elements that may inﬂuence electromagnetic\npropagation\
    \ (e.g., buildings, roads, trees, and vehicles) and their speciﬁc material properties\n\
    (permittivity and conductivity, as indicated in Table 4). Then, the input parameters\
    \ of the 3D-RL\ntool were carefully selected, including the operation frequency,\
    \ the transmitter, and receiver radiation\npatterns, the number of permitted reﬂections\
    \ and the ray angular/spatial resolution. In addition,\nin order to obtain accurate\
    \ simulation results in a limited amount of time, it was necessary to\nset correctly\
    \ the number of reﬂections and the angular/spatial resolution parameters through\
    \ a\nproper analysis [63]. The resulting parameters for the scenario under analysis\
    \ are indicated in Table 5.\nTable 4. Material properties for the 3D-RL simulations.\n\

    \ locations were virtually placed on the ground on the positions\ndepicted in\
    \ Figure 10, following the deployment structure previously depicted in Figure\
    \ 1. In Figure 10,\nthe red circles represent irrigation node locations, while\
    \ purple circles represent gateway locations.\nEight different irrigation node\
    \ potential locations were analyzed and simulated when exchanging\ndata with a\
    \ gateway that could be positioned into three different locations. Two of the\
    \ gateway\nlocations were outdoors (locations 9 and 10, which have a height of\
    \ 1.8 m), while the other was indoors\n(location 11, at a height of 5.5 m). The\
    \ outdoor locations were chosen by considering aspects such as\nease of installation\
    \ (e.g., access to electrical power) and the existence of line of sight with respect\
    \ to\nmost of the deployed IoT nodes and to the surrounding buildings. The gateway\
    \ indoor location was\nselected to be inside one speciﬁc building due to its challenging\
    \ outside enclosure (such a building can\nbe observed on the picture on the left\
    \ of Figure 2), which is covered by an external metal mesh that\nacts as a sort\
    \ of Faraday cage, thus blocking electromagnetic waves partially.\nFigure 10.\
    \ Schematic upper view of the deployment of the irrigation nodes and the gateways.\n\
    Since the 3D-RL tool provides the RF power distribution for the whole volume of\
    \ the scenario, it is\npossible to optimize node and gateway deployment locations.\
    \ Considering that the developed smart\nirrigation nodes provide a sensitivity\
    \ of –148 dBm (both for 433 MHz and 868 MHz), deterministic\nestimations of the\
    \ received RF power level at each gateway position can be obtained. Thus, the\
    \ validity\nof the proposed locations can be inferred.\nBefore showing the obtained\
    \ simulation results, it is important to mention that the created scenario\nwas\
    \ previously validated by means of empirical results obtained during a measurement\
    \ campaign [4].\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n18 of 33\nThe obtained results showed\
    \ a very good agreement between measurements and 3D-RL estimations,\nobtaining\
    \ a mean error of 0.53 dB and a standard deviation of 3.39 dB.\nThe results obtained\
    \ for the 868 MHz and 433 MHz transceivers are presented in Figures 11\nand 12,\
    \ respectively. Speciﬁcally, such ﬁgures show bi-dimensional planes of the RF\
    \ power distribution\nestimations for all the eight smart irrigation nodes at\
    \ the ground level. As expected, 433 MHz\npropagation is better in the same conditions.\
    \ This is due to the higher transmitted power and to its\nlower radio propagation\
    \ losses in comparison to the higher 868 MHz frequency.\nFigure 11. 868 MHz simulation\
    \ results: RF power level distribution in a bi-dimensional plane on the\nground\
    \ level.\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n19 of 33\nFigure 12. 433 MHz simulation results:\
    \ RF power level distribution in a bi-dimensional plane on the\nground level.\n\
    When the gateway is located at position 9, irrigation nodes 2 and 8 obtain their\
    \ worst results due\nto the shadowing created by the building. Even in such a\
    \ situation, due to the low sensitivity values\nof both 433 and 868 MHz devices,\
    \ the received power level is higher than the sensitivity threshold\n(−148 dBm).\
    \ This fact was corroborated during the empirical measurement campaign (described\
    \ later\nin Section 5).\nIn the case of placing the gateway into position 10,\
    \ the worst results are clearly obtained by\nirrigation node 2, again due to the\
    \ shadowing created by the building. Like in the previous case,\nthe low sensitivity\
    \ of LoRaWAN devices facilitates wireless communications also in cases when the\n\
    shadowing effect due to buildings absorbs a great amount of energy of the propagated\
    \ wave.\nThe third analyzed gateway location corresponds to position 11, which\
    \ is inside the building,\nat a height of 5.5 m from the street ground level.\
    \ Figures 13 and 14 show estimations of the RF power\nlevel distribution at a\
    \ height of 5.5 m for 868 MHz (Figure 13) and 433 MHz (Figure 14) transceivers\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 6865\n20 of 33\n(note that, for this simulation, the irrigation\
    \ nodes remained on the ground). Like in the previous\nsimulations, higher RF\
    \ power levels are observed for 433 MHz due to the higher transmitted power\n\
    level and the lower radio propagation losses. However, in comparison to the results\
    \ obtained for\ngateway positions 9 and 10, the results obtained in position 11\
    \ are worse. As it can be observed,\nposition 11 is inside blue areas or next\
    \ to them. This means that the received RF power is signiﬁcantly\nlower in comparison\
    \ to the other two gateway positions, which, in some cases, can lead to packet\n\
    losses and even to a wireless communication outage. This behavior is conﬁrmed\
    \ by the empirical\nmeasurements presented in the next section.\nFigure 13. 3D-RL\

    \ was carried out to validate the simulation results detailed in\nthe previous\
    \ section and to determine node performance on the selected scenario. Thus, signal\
    \ strength\nmeasurements from LoRa and LoRaWAN IoT nodes were collected by gateways\
    \ when exchanging\ndata from different potential locations. The next subsections\

    \ and analyze the obtained results comparing them with the\nones obtained by the\
    \ 3D-RL tool.\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n22 of 33\n5.1. LoRa/LoRaWAN Smart Irrigation\
    \ Testbeds\nIn order to determine the performance of LoRa and LoRaWAN for the\
    \ deployment of smart\nirrigation IoT nodes, two different testbeds were created:\
    \ one based on LoRaWAN that works at\n868 MHz and another one that uses LoRa at\
    \ 433 MHz.\nFigure 15 shows an 868 MHz LoRaWAN-based IoT node and its components.\
    \ Speciﬁcally, the\nnode is based on a WisTrio RAK5205 LPWAN tracker, which makes\
    \ use of a Semtech SX1276 LoRa\ntransceiver and an STM32L1 microcontroller. The\
    \ main speciﬁcations of the node are indicated in\nTable 6. Regarding the 433\
    \ MHz node, it is based on a Heltec LoRa 32 v1 board (as it can be observed\n\
    in Figure 16) and its main speciﬁcations are detailed in Table 7.\nFigure 15.\

    \ that the RAK5205 board comes with a built-in GPS and different environmental\
    \ sensors,\nwhile the used 433 MHz LoRa board uses an ESP32 as a main controller,\
    \ which also embeds WiFi and\nBluetooth transceivers.\nFinally, with respect to\
    \ the gateways of the testbeds, whose main characteristics are summarized\nin\
    \ Table 8, they make use of the following hardware:\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n\

    \ Tests\nThe tests consisted of transmitting packets from every IoT node outdoor\
    \ location to the respective\ngateway (depending on the link quality, between\
    \ none and roughly 60 packets were received). It is\nimportant to note that, since\
    \ different protocols were used for each testbed, the considerations for\nmeasuring\
    \ their performance and signal strength differ slightly:\n•\nLoRaWAN is more complex\
    \ than LoRa. By default, most LoRaWAN transceivers make use of an\nadaptive algorithm\
    \ (Adaptative Data Rate, ADR) when transmitting, which implies that their\nspreading\
    \ factor and transmission power are adjusted dynamically. In the performed tests,\
    \ it was\nobserved that, after the transmission of the ﬁrst packet, the spreading\
    \ factor was adjusted to a\nvalue that remained static for the rest of the transmissions.\
    \ Likewise, there were no variations in\nthe power level, which was always set\
    \ in level 1, which implies a transmission power of 14 dBm.\n•\nIn the case of\
    \ LoRa, the ADR algorithm is not executed, so spreading factor and transmit power\n\
    values remain static and thus independent from the communications conditions.\
    \ During the tests,\nthe maximum allowed transmission power for the EU433 band\
    \ was used, which corresponds to a\nspreading factor of 12 and a power transmission\
    \ of 20 dBm.\nRegarding the measurement locations, they were the ones analyzed\
    \ with the 3D-RL simulator and\ndepicted in Figure 1. For every IoT node position,\
    \ the node was placed on the ground or underground\n(at a burial depth of roughly\
    \ 10 cm; one of the moments of the burying process is illustrated in Figure 17)\n\
    depending on the experiment. Regarding the gateway, during the measurements in\
    \ position 11,\nthe gateway was located indoors, next to a window at a 5.5-meter\
    \ height above the ground level. In the\ncase of positions 9 and 10, the gateway\
    \ was outdoors and its antenna was placed in a tripod, as it is\nshown in Figure\
    \ 18.\nAt every measurement location, the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)\
    \ values were\ncollected for the node-to-gateway communications. It is important\
    \ to note that RSSI depends on\ndiverse factors [69], so the results and conclusions\
    \ presented in the next section cannot be extrapolated\ndirectly to other scenarios\
    \ and, therefore, they should be considered as an example of the validation of\n\
    the appropriateness of the proposed smart irrigation system design approach and\
    \ on the usefulness of\nperforming simulations with the used 3D-RL tool prior\
    \ to a real hardware deployment.\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n25 of 33\nFigure 17.\
    \ Deployment of one of the smart irrigation nodes.\nFigure 18. Location of the\
    \ gateway antenna during the experiments at position 9.\n5.3. Results\nThe measurement\
    \ campaign provided a lot of information regarding the performance on the\nwireless\
    \ link for all the eight irrigation nodes and the three gateway potential positions.\
    \ Figure 19\nshows a summary of the results obtained with an operating frequency\
    \ of 868 MHz, for both the\nnear-ground (i.e., on the ground) and underground\
    \ locations of the irrigation nodes. The same\nkind of measurements but for the\
    \ 433 MHz nodes are shown in Figure 20. As it can be observed,\nwhen an irrigation\
    \ node is underground, the RSSI measured by the gateways is generally lower,\n\
    which is expected due to the losses of the ground. Nonetheless, in most cases,\
    \ the difference between\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n26 of 33\nnear-ground and underground\
    \ transmissions is not critical, due to the burial depth of the underground\n\
    nodes (10 cm). It is worth noting that, when the gateway was located at position\
    \ 11 (i.e., inside the\nbuilding), it collected the lowest RSSI levels from all\
    \ the irrigation nodes. Moreover, it is the only\ngateway position where some\
    \ packets were lost (in fact, no packets were received from irrigation\nnodes\
    \ 1, 2, and 3), showing the worst performance of all gateway positions. Thus,\
    \ the obtained results\nagree with the estimations obtained by the 3D-RL algorithm\
    \ and previously described in Section 4.3.\nIn order to gain insight into the\
    \ obtained measurements, Figure 21 presents, as an example,\nthe RSSI received\
    \ at the three potential gateway locations for each 868 MHz irrigation node position\n\
    for the near-ground case. Again, it can be observed how the signal sent by irrigation\
    \ nodes 1, 2, and 3\ndoes not reach successfully the gateway when it is located\
    \ at position 11. Moreover, the RSSI received\nby the gateway at position 11 is\
    \ the lowest of all the cases.\nFigure 19. Summary of the measurements at 868\
    \ MHz.\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n27 of 33\nFigure 20. Summary of the measurements\
    \ at 433 MHz.\nRegarding positions 9 and 10, the RSSI collected by the gateways\
    \ depends on the distance\nbetween them and the speciﬁc transmitting irrigation\
    \ node, as well as on the presence of obstacles\nlike buildings or cars (as previously\
    \ depicted and modeled in Figure 10). For example, for irrigation\nnode 8, the\
    \ gateway in location 10 received much better quality signal than the one in location\
    \ 9\ndue to the shorter distance and also the shadowing effect caused by the near-by\
    \ building. On the\ncontrary, in the case of irrigation node 6, the gateway at\
    \ location 9 received better signal levels than the\none at 10, even despite location\
    \ 9 being further from the irrigation node. This effect was due to the\nfact that\
    \ several vehicles (which are mainly metallic) were parked between node 6 and\
    \ location 10,\nthus blocking partially radio waves and leading to higher RF losses.\n\
    All the measurements agree with the simulation results presented in Section 4.3,\
    \ both at 433 MHz\nand 868 MHz, and lead to the same conclusions: position 11\
    \ is the worst position for placing the\ncommunications gateway. On the other\
    \ hand, locations 9 and 10 present different performance in terms\nof RSSI depending\
    \ on the irrigation node positions, but in both cases the performance in terms\
    \ of lost\npackets is the same (zero packets were lost for near-ground and underground\
    \ nodes, both for 433 MHz\nand 868 MHz), so such positions are valid for the proposed\
    \ application. In any case, if larger areas\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n28 of 33\n\
    were monitored and controlled by irrigation nodes, the better radio propagation\
    \ achieved at 433 MHz\ncould lead to the use of such nodes instead of the ones\
    \ that operate at 868 MHz. Furthermore, once the\n3D-RL simulator has been validated,\
    \ new RF power distribution estimations could be obtained in\norder to assess\
    \ the impact of transmitting with lower power levels (for energy saving), which\
    \ will\nimpact the RSSI and, therefore, the possibility of losing packets due\
    \ to Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and\nto the sensitivity threshold of the devices.\
    \ In the same way, new gateway and irrigation node positions\ncould be easily\
    \ analyzed without the necessity of new extensive measurement campaigns.\nFigure\

    This article proposed a smart irrigation system based on LoRa/LoRaWAN IoT nodes\
    \ and gateways\nwith a novel communications architecture able to exchange data\
    \ with local fog computing nodes and\nwith a remote cloud in a campus scenario.\
    \ The prototype of the proposed IoT system was developed\nand described in detail\
    \ so as to allow future developers to replicate it easily. In order to validate\
    \ the\nproposed system and assess the potential locations for the nodes to be\
    \ deployed, an in-house 3D-ray\nlaunching radio-planning tool was used in conjunction\
    \ with an accurate 3D model of the simulated\nscenario (a university campus).\
    \ In such a scenario, simulations and empirical measurements were\ncarried out\
    \ for 433 MHz LoRa-based and 868 MHz LoRaWAN-based testbeds. The obtained results\n\
    validate the accuracy of the used radio planning tool (the results obtained in\
    \ this scenario showed a\nvery good agreement between measurements and 3D-RL estimations,\
    \ obtaining a mean error of 0.53 dB\nand a standard deviation of 3.39 dB), which\
    \ allows for estimating the RF power level distribution of the\ninvolved nodes\
    \ and gateways for the whole volume of the scenario. Thus, the potential coverage\
    \ of the\ndifferent areas can be identiﬁed prior their deployment. The obtained\
    \ radio propagation results also\nremark, on one hand, the negative effect that\
    \ some architectural elements of a building (such as the\nmetallic facade in this\
    \ case) may have in terms of radio propagation, and, on the other hand, that the\n\
    impact of underground communications in signal attenuation may not be critical\
    \ if the burial depth is\nshallow (10 cm in this case). The conclusions obtained\
    \ show that the proposed tool provides useful\nguidelines for future developers\
    \ on the design of smart irrigation systems in similar large scenarios.\nFurther\
    \ work will add additional intelligence (e.g., predictive models with AI to ﬁne-grained\
    \ the\namount of water) to the IoT nodes layer and will study in depth the effect\
    \ of burial depth in LoRaWAN\nunderground wireless channels.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    Abstract: A low power wireless sensor network based on LoRaWAN protocol was designed\
    \ with\na focus on the IoT low-cost Precision Agriculture applications, such as\
    \ greenhouse sensing and\nactuation. All subsystems used in this research are\
    \ designed by using commercial components and\nfree or open-source software libraries.\
    \ The whole system was implemented to demonstrate the\nfeasibility of a modular\
    \ system built with cheap off-the-shelf components, including sensors. The\nexperimental\
    \ outputs were collected and stored in a database managed by a virtual machine\
    \ running\nin a cloud service. The collected data can be visualized in real time\
    \ by the user with a graphical\ninterface. The reliability of the whole system\
    \ was proven during a continued experiment with two\nnatural soils, Loamy Sand\
    \ and Silty Loam. Regarding soil parameters, the system performance\nhas been\
    \ compared with that of a reference sensor from Sentek. Measurements highlighted\
    \ a good\nagreement for the temperature within the supposed accuracy of the adopted\
    \ sensors and a non-\nconstant sensitivity for the low-cost volumetric water contents\
    \ (VWC) sensor. Finally, for the low-cost\nVWC sensor we implemented a novel procedure\
    \ to optimize the parameters of the non-linear ﬁtting\nequation correlating its\
    \ analog voltage output with the reference VWC.\nKeywords: soil water content;\

    \ recent years, the rapid development and broad application of the IoT (Internet\
    \ of\nThings) concept pushed towards the improvement of best practices in Wireless\
    \ Sensor\nNetworks (WSNs) [1] in Precision Agriculture (PA) applications, also\
    \ relevant to Green-\nhouses [2,3]. Smart, cheap, and powerful connected sensor\
    \ nodes (things) are transforming\nfrom stand-alone devices to parts of collaborative\
    \ systems [4,5]. Data are stored, aggregated,\nand analyzed to improve the precision\
    \ of temporal-spatial parameters on croplands [6,7].\nWSN could be made of simple\
    \ and cheap components: the results provided by complex\ntechnology systems are\
    \ not necessarily signiﬁcantly better than the results derived from a\ncombination\
    \ of descriptive statistics and simple sensors: intrinsic limitations of the sens-\n\
    ing element could be overcome [8] also providing the measurement readout in a\
    \ digital\nformat [9].\nCurrently, the sensor networks that characterize the IoT\
    \ technology have the main\npurpose of collecting data from the surrounding world\
    \ on intelligent systems for environ-\nmental applications [10,11]. Additionally,\
    \ in cloud computing approaches, the collected\ndata are analyzed, processed,\
    \ and used to undertake the correct decisions to optimize\nnatural resources:\
    \ it follows that the set of sensors, devices, and storage systems, by\nSensors\

    Sensors 2021, 21, 5110\n2 of 28\nwhich the IoT is composed, is very similar to\
    \ a huge, distributed measurement system, as\nclearly outlined in [12]. The management\
    \ of such complex systems is part of the present\nBig Data paradigm. Details on\
    \ sampling techniques, distributed smart monitoring, and\nmathematical theories\
    \ of distributed sensor networks can be found in [1,13].\nIn [14] the authors\
    \ made a very good literature review on the use of machine learning\n(ML), a subset\
    \ of artiﬁcial intelligence having a considerable potential to handle numerous\n\
    challenges in the establishment of knowledge-based farming systems. In the paper,\
    \ the\nauthors considered four main generic categories of applications: crop,\
    \ water, soil, and\nlivestock management. In the paper the authors underlined\
    \ also that (i) the majority of\nthe journal papers focused on crop management\
    \ [15,16]; (ii) several ML algorithms have\nbeen developed to handle the heterogeneous\
    \ data coming from agricultural ﬁelds [17];\n(iii) multispectral or RGB images\
    \ constituted the most common input for ML algorithms,\nthus justifying the broad\
    \ usage of Convolutional Neural Networks due to their ability to\nhandle this\
    \ type of data more efﬁciently [18,19]. Moreover, a wide range of parameters\n\
    regarding the weather as well as the soil, water, and crop quality was used. The\
    \ most\ncommon means of acquiring measurements for ML applications was remote\
    \ sensing,\nincluding imaging from satellites, unmanned vehicles (both ground\
    \ (UGV) and aerial\n(UAV)), while in situ and laboratory measurements were also\
    \ used [20].\nVery good reviews of the most common sensors used in agriculture\
    \ applications are\nreported in [21,22]. In [23], agricultural sensors have been\
    \ divided into three main classes:\nphysical property type sensors, biosensors,\
    \ and micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS)\nsensors. Near and remote sensing\
    \ techniques use IoT sensors for monitoring multiple\nparameters, such as soil\
    \ water content, temperature, and pH level, air humidity, temper-\nature, light,\
    \ and pressure [23–26]. The determination of soil water content is a subject\n\
    of great value in different scientiﬁc ﬁelds, such as agronomy, soil physics, geology,\
    \ soil\nmechanics, and hydraulics. Physical, mineralogical, chemical, and biological\
    \ properties\nare also involved. Moreover, soil water content measurements could\
    \ be affected by soil\ntemperature [27]. Ambient Relative Humidity (RH) affects\
    \ leaf growth, photosynthesis,\npollination rate, and ﬁnally crop yield. A prolonged\
    \ dry environment or high temperature\ncan make the delicate sepals dry quickly\
    \ and cause the death of ﬂowers before maturity.\nHence it is very crucial to\
    \ control air humidity and temperature. Recent technological ad-\nvances have\
    \ enabled real-time sensors to be used directly in the soil, wirelessly transmitting\n\
    data without the need for human intervention. It is now possible to set up a large\
    \ number\nof low-cost devices not only capable of transducing a physical quantity\
    \ of interest but\nalso of performing some post-processing on raw data to extract\
    \ useful information, fully\ncomplying with current regulations [27–29]. Due to\
    \ the rapid advancement of technologies,\nthe size and the cost of sensors have\
    \ been reduced, making WSN the foremost driver of\nPA [30].\nWhile most previously\
    \ cited parameters (including soil temperature) can reliably be\nmonitored through\
    \ low-cost sensors available in the market, the experimental and accurate\ndetermination\
    \ of soil water content with low-cost sensors is still an issue. A summary of\n\
    state of the art on soil water content measurement techniques has been reported\
    \ in [31].\nThe prices of the most reliable soil water content sensors range between\
    \ USD 150 and USD\n5000, thus positioning these sensors far from the IoT world.\
    \ Instead, the reliability of very\nlow-cost soil water content sensors easily\
    \ purchasable in the worldwide internet market is\nstill a matter of scientiﬁc\
    \ debate [8,32–37] as further highlighted in the next sections.\nIn this scenario,\
    \ the objectives of the present work can be summarized as follows:\n•\nAcquisition\
    \ of basic physical parameters of plants and ambient with low-cost sensors:\n\
    soil water content and temperature, greenhouse ambient RH, temperature, and light.\n\
    Even if the present paper will mostly be focused on soil water content and most\
    \ param-\neters will not be discussed, the availability of multiple parameters\
    \ could be exploited\nin the future to build a more intelligent system by using\
    \ machine learning algorithms.\n•\nAvailability of a modular system built with\
    \ cheap off-the-shelf components also\nproviding capabilities for automation and\
    \ management of plant irrigation.\nSensors 2021, 21, 5110\n3 of 28\n•\nComparison\
    \ of the performance of a very low-cost soil moisture sensor with a com-\nmercially\
    \ available expensive system using two different types of soil with an original\n\
    modeling approach which helps us to compare measurement results taken at different\n\
    soil depths.\n2. IoT Architecture in Precision Agriculture Scenario\n2.1. Water\
    \ Waste and Agriculture\nThe integration of information and control technologies\
    \ in agriculture processes is\nknown as Precision Agriculture. To obtain the greatest\
    \ optimization and proﬁtability PA\nadapts common farming techniques to the speciﬁc\
    \ conditions of each point of the crop,\nby applying different technologies: micro-electro-mechanical\
    \ Systems, Wireless Sensor\nNetworks (WSN), computer systems, and enhanced machinery.\
    \ PA optimizes production\nefﬁciency, increases quality, minimizes environmental\
    \ impact, and reduces the use of\nresources (energy, water) [38].\nThe application\
    \ of IoT allows farmers to boost the production process through planta-\ntion\
    \ monitoring, soil and water management, irrigation scheduling, fertilizer optimization,\n\
    pest control through chemicals as herbicides, delivery tracking. These tasks can\
    \ be accom-\nplished by using data from sensors, images, agricultural information\
    \ management systems,\nglobal positioning systems (GPS), and communication networks.\
    \ This integration results\nin the optimization of scarce resources [39].\nAtmospheric\
    \ changes and, in particular, the sudden rise in temperatures worsen the\nproblem\
    \ of searching for fresh water and water storage resources [40]. These problems\n\
    are exacerbated in countries characterized by drought and rare rainfall, where\
    \ the difﬁ-\nculty in ﬁnding the raw material prevents the development of crops\
    \ (e.g., the California\ndrought [41]). The scarcity of water in some regions\
    \ of the world has led farmers to re-\nevaluate conventional agricultural methods\
    \ to reduce waste. To this purpose, innovative\nsystems and methods aimed at PA\
    \ are needed, where sensor technology, electronic and\ncommunication engineering,\
    \ and farming machinery are blended with cloud storage and\ncomputing. If on one\
    \ hand, there is a tendency to optimize traditional irrigation systems us-\ning\
    \ intelligent drip systems [42–44], on the other hand, systems and sensors [8]\
    \ are sought\nto measure the soil water content in real-time [45]. In this way,\
    \ it is possible to know the\nexact time and the speciﬁc position of soil that\
    \ requires irrigation. However, regardless of\nall the advances in the IoT domain,\
    \ the adoption of PA has been limited to some developed\ncountries. Because of\
    \ the lack of resources, remote sensing-based techniques to monitor\ncrop health\
    \ are uncommon in developing countries, thus resulting in a loss of yield. [25]\n\
    The development of WSN applications in PA makes it possible to increase efﬁciency,\n\
    productivity, and proﬁtability in many agricultural production systems while minimizing\n\
    unintended impacts on wildlife and the environment. The real-time information\
    \ obtained\nfrom the ﬁelds can provide a solid base for farmers to adjust strategies\
    \ at any time. Instead\nof making decisions based on some hypothetical average\
    \ conditions, which may not exist\nanywhere, a precision farming approach recognizes\
    \ differences and adjusts management\nactions accordingly [46].\nThe combination\
    \ of WSN, which are cheaper to implement than wired networks [29],\nwith intelligent\
    \ embedded systems and applying on this combination the technology of\nubiquitous\
    \ systems [40], leads to the development of the design and implementation\nof\
    \ low-cost systems for monitoring agricultural environments, suitable for developing\n\
    countries and difﬁcult access areas.\n2.2. IoT Architectures\nWireless Sensor\
    \ Networks (WSNs) have extensively been adopted in agriculture [47] as\nwell as\
    \ in livestock farming [48] due to installation ﬂexibility especially when wireless\
    \ trans-\nmission introduces a signiﬁcant reduction and simpliﬁcation in wiring\
    \ and harness [30,49].\nIn addition, greenhouse technology proﬁts from this technology\
    \ through automation and\ninformatization. In [46] an intelligent system, controlling\
    \ and monitoring greenhouse tem-\nSensors 2021, 21, 5110\n4 of 28\nperature has\
    \ been described, aiming at reducing consumed energy while maintaining good\n\
    conditions that improve productivity. A review of the common wireless nodes and\
    \ sensors\ncapturing environmental parameters related to crops in the agriculture\
    \ domain is reported\nin [29]. Agriculture in the Internet era is quickly becoming\
    \ a data-intensive industry. Farm-\ners need to gather and evaluate a massive\
    \ amount of information from meteorological and\nphysical sensors to increase\
    \ production efﬁciency [50]. In [51] a description of a modular\nIoT architecture\
    \ for several applications including but not limited to healthcare, health\nmonitoring,\
    \ and PA is reported. All the proposed subsystem choices used in that research\n\
    are cheap off-the-shelf components with open-source software libraries.\n2.3.\
    \ Radio and Wireless Protocols in PA\nThe goal of optimizing water use for crops\
    \ leads also to the development of auto-\nmated irrigation systems. In [52] wireless\
    \ sensors are linked by ZigBee radio transceivers,\nimplementing a WSN where soil\
    \ water content and temperature data are transferred. The\nwireless information\
    \ unit also features a GPRS module that connects to a web server via the\npublic\
    \ mobile network. An online graphical application through Internet access devices\n\
    allows operators to remotely monitor the information data. The feasibility of\
    \ the imple-\nmented automated irrigation system was demonstrated. However, the\
    \ total cost was high\nfor some applications. The cost of each wireless sensor\
    \ unit was ∼USD 100, whereas the\nwireless information unit cost was ∼USD 1800.\n\
    In addition to ZigBee, the IoT world is pushing new technologies. The Long-Range\n\
    (LoRa) technology, originally developed for IoT, is investigated in [10] to demonstrate\
    \ its\nuse for implementing Distributed Measurement Systems. The LoRa wireless\
    \ technology\nis designed for sending small packets at a low data rate (0.3–5.5\
    \ kbps) at relatively long\ndistances. The protocol can be used in IoT nodes where\
    \ energy efﬁciency is considered the\nmost critical parameter.\nThe LoRaWAN™ protocol\
    \ exploits the unlicensed radio spectrum in the Industrial,\nScientiﬁc, and Medical\
    \ band. Operating frequencies (433 MHz, 868 MHz, or 915 MHz) de-\npend on the\
    \ particular geographical region. Formally, LoRaWAN™ is a member of the low\n\
    power LPWAN family, i.e., WAN wireless communications that are designed to minimize\n\
    the power consumption while covering large areas but offering a relatively small\
    \ bit rate.\nThe speciﬁcation deﬁnes the device-to-infrastructure of LoRa physical\
    \ layer parameters\nand the LoRaWAN™ protocol. The LoRa physical layer or PHY\
    \ exploits a Chirp Spread\nSpectrum (CSS) modulation. Fundamental keywords are\
    \ low power transmission, low\nthroughput, and optimum coverage. The LoRaWAN™\
    \ network architecture is deployed\nin a star-of-stars topology in which gateways\
    \ relay messages between end-devices and a\ncentral network server. The gateways\
    \ are connected to the network server via standard IP\nconnections and act as\
    \ a transparent bridge, simply converting RF packets to IP packets\nand vice versa\
    \ [53].\nLoRa is having success, as conﬁrmed by the high number of papers adopting\
    \ it\n(see e.g., [54–58] and references therein). The LoRa alliance sponsors the\
    \ integration of\nLoRaWAN™ into the IoT, and some open implementations of network\
    \ servers are available\nhelping the constant growth of the LoRaWAN™ ecosystem.\
    \ A fairly complete analysis of\nthe scalability of networks based on LoRaWAN™\
    \ is reported in [58]. Employing analytic\nand simulation-based approaches, the\
    \ authors explore the dimensions of the LoRa network\nconﬁguration. The chosen\
    \ spreading factor, a parameter directly related to the bitrate of\nthe LoRa message,\
    \ signiﬁcantly depends on the number of sensors deployed in the ﬁeld\nand on the\
    \ transmission rate, given in packets/day.\n3. System Architecture\nThe modular\
    \ design of the proposed approach splits the architecture into different lay-\n\
    ers (Figure 1): (i) wireless nodes (encompassing sensors, actuators, low-power\
    \ embedded\nprocessor, battery), (ii) internet gateway/concentrator, and The Things\

    \ consumption, as \nthe valve will drain current only during switching. Power\
    \ supply for temperature and \nwater content sensors was delivered through the\
    \ GPIOs of the microcontroller to feed the \nsensors only when a measurement must\
    \ be accomplished. In fact, the maximum allowed \ncurrent delivered by the GPIOs\
    \ of the STM32L152RE microcontroller is more than enough \nfor the low power sensors\
    \ we adopted. However, it must be pointed out the present ver-\nsion of the system\
    \ is designed to provide maximum flexibility and is not conceived for \npower\
    \ optimization. For example, the STM NUCLEO boards still include the ST-\nLINK/V2-1\
    \ programming and debugging tool, whose power consumption is way larger \nthan\
    \ that of the main STM32L152RE microcontroller. \nSeveral plant nodes have been\
    \ manufactured (Figure 3). After some design steps, the \npresent version of the\
    \ Plant Node is composed of (i) a waterproof junction box (including \nall electrical\
    \ and electronic components) connected with (ii) a 3D printed PET-G shell \nwhich\
    \ protects the soil sensor and the temperature sensor. \n \nFigure 3. The final\
    \ version of the Plant Node. \nFigure 3. The ﬁnal version of the Plant Node.\n\
    Regarding the soil water content sensor, most papers presented in the literature\
    \ either\nmeasure the capacitance of the soil, which, of course, depends on the\
    \ water content, or\nadopt high frequency (around 100 MHz) AC measurements to\
    \ characterize the dielectric\nconstant of the soil [58]. Other papers describing\
    \ low-cost IoT nodes adopt fork-like\nmetallic sensors that, when used with a\
    \ DC bias, mainly characterize the ionic content of\nthe soil by measuring the\
    \ electrical resistance between the two arms of the fork. AC could\nSensors 2021,\
    \ 21, 5110\n7 of 28\nalso be used with fork-like sensors to limit electrolysis\
    \ and consequent metal electrode\netching/degradation and DC ion currents in the\
    \ soil. Examples can be found in GardenBot\nliterature [60] or [27] and references\
    \ therein.\nFor this prototype of the system, we use the commercial, blade-shaped,\
    \ “Capacitive\nSoil Moisture Sensor v1.2” (also dubbed SKU: SEN0193 in its version\
    \ 1.0 by DFROBOT [61])\nfor sensing water content in the soil. This sensor is\
    \ undoubtedly the least expensive water\ncontent sensor in the market and was\
    \ also exploited in other scientiﬁc papers (see for\nexample [32,33]) and well-documented\
    \ internet projects [62]. In [32] the authors found that\nthis sensor did not\
    \ perform acceptably in predicting soil moisture content in a laboratory\nsoil\
    \ mixture prepared by mixing organic-rich soil and vermiculite, while it can estimate\
    \ soil\nwater in gardening soil in the so-called “ﬁeld capacity” range. In [33]\
    \ the author linearly\ncorrelates the voltage provided by the sensor reading to\
    \ the gravimetric moisture approxi-\nmations, providing an effective relationship\
    \ between the reading from the capacitive sensor\nand the water content in the\
    \ soil. This calibration procedure demonstrated that low-cost\ncapacitive-type\
    \ soil moisture sensors are capable of predicting the water content in soils to\n\
    a high degree of accuracy, with little required outside of the device itself,\
    \ which is in direct\ncontrast to the time it takes to traditionally measure the\
    \ water content in soils.\nBeing that the water content sensor is the hearth of\
    \ our plant nodes and since a detailed\ndata sheet is not available for the sensors,\
    \ an accurate study of the sensor electronics was\ninitially accomplished to get\
    \ acquainted with the operation of the sensors [8]. A low\ndropout 3.3 V voltage\
    \ regulator (omitted in a very recent version–v1.2 and v2.0–of this\nsensor) feeds\
    \ a TL555I CMOS timer (Figure 4) which generates a trapezoidal waveform in\nastable\
    \ mode running at about 1.5 MHz. The trapezoidal shape is because the operating\n\
    frequency of the timer is pushed beyond the physical limit for the TL555I device,\
    \ speciﬁed\nin the datasheet as guaranteed for 1.2 MHz in astable mode. On the\
    \ other hand, the\nnon-steep rising and falling edges of the waveform help in\
    \ minimizing the electromagnetic\ninterference possibly generated by the sensor\
    \ and would be beneﬁcial in the case of “CE”\nor “FCC” compliance certiﬁcation.\n\

    \ Fitting Equations\nWater content measurements were previously accomplished in\
    \ silica sandy soil with\nthe Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v1.2 in conditions\
    \ such that the dry unit weight\nγdry = Ws/V (Ws = dry soil weight, V = total\
    \ volume of the soil) could be assumed\nas a constant [8]. It was demonstrated\
    \ that this condition guarantees a monotonically\ndecreasing Vs output voltage\
    \ as a function of gravimetric water content (GWC), which\nwas approximated using\
    \ a 2nd order polynomial or an exponential function. In this paper,\nwe will deal\
    \ with volumetric water content (VWC) instead of GWC. However, the two\nparameters\
    \ are proportional to each other for a given soil where the dry unit weight is\n\
    constant. In the remainder of this paper, we will use the following exponential\
    \ ﬁtting\nequation between the output voltage Vs of the Capacitive Soil Moisture\
    \ Sensor v1.2 and\nthe VWC:\nVs = A exp\n\x12\n−VWC\nB\n\x13\n+ C,\n(1)\nSensors\

    \ and C suitable constants. Other ﬁtting equations were also adopted in the\n\
    literature for the same sensor. In [32] a 3rd order polynomial function VWC =\
    \ f(Vs) was\nimplemented. In [33] the following equation was used:\nVWC = P\n\
    Vs\n− Q\n(3)\nbeing P = 2.48 V and Q = 0.72 for a soil composed of dried coconut\
    \ coir. In the remainder\nof this paper, we will mainly deal with ﬁtting Equations\
    \ (2) and (3).\n3.1.2. Embedded Software Implementation of Nodes\nThe C++ code\
    \ exploits ARM Mbed OS libraries. Mbed OS is an open-source Real-Time\nOperating\

    \ soil where the dry unit weight is con-\nstant. In the remainder of this paper,\

    As shown in Figure 1, in the network architecture The Things Network is located\
    \ \nbetween the LoRa concentrator/gateway and the applications. TTN is composed\
    \ of three \nmain structures: Router, Brokers, and Handler. The Router is in charge\

    \ a device to an application, to forward \nuplink messages to the proper application,\
    \ and to forward downlink messages to the cor-\nrect Router-Gateway path. A Handler\
    \ is responsible for treating the data of different Ap-\nplications. To do so,\
    \ it deals with a Broker where it registers devices and applications. The \nHandler\

    \ hand, it is well known that for data transmission, MQTT could rely on the TCP\n\

    \ we installed a Linux virtual machine (Figure 8) that includes:\n•\nWeb site\
    \ (HTML, PHP, CSS, and JavaScript) within a web server;\n•\nMySQL Database Management\
    \ System (DBMS) server.\nThe database is divided into two units: (i) node data\
    \ section and (ii) web application\nuser data section (e.g., username and password).\
    \ The node data section is further composed\nof two tables: the ﬁrst one identiﬁes\
    \ the node and the second one the sensor with its\ndata. Finally, the webserver\
    \ fetches data in the database using PHP and shows them\non a web page. CanvasJS\
    \ is used for the Graphical User Interface (GUI). CanvasJS is\ndescribed as a\
    \ JavaScript Charting Library for High Performance and ease of use. It is\nbuilt\
    \ using the Canvas element and it can render thousands of data points in a matter\
    \ of\nmilliseconds. CanvasJS is also interactive and can be updated dynamically.\

    \ on the Plant Nodes, the system has been tested during a continued experi-\n\
    ment where the two different greenhouse soils were watered several times, to verify\
    \ if the\nsensor was able to reliably acquire, transmit, and store the ambient\
    \ temperature and the\nsoil water content parameters in real time and to show\
    \ them on the custom GUI.\nThe measurements were made in a plastic box initially\
    \ ﬁlled with expanded clay\naggregate which allowed percolated water to outﬂow\
    \ and where a Sentek Drill & Drop\nProbe (hereafter named “reference sensor”)\
    \ was driven (Figure 11a). Then the remaining\ntop 30 cm of the box was ﬁlled\
    \ with the chosen soil, either Loamy Sand or Silty Loam.\nBoth soils were packed\
    \ in 0.05 m lifts and gently tapped into place. This accurate packing\nmechanism\
    \ was adopted to achieve homogeneity vertically, to keep perfect contact at the\n\
    interface, and to minimize preferential ﬂow along the sides of the box. The reference\
    \ sensor\nwas placed at the center of the box. It features an array of water content\
    \ and temperature\nsensors placed at 5 cm, 15 cm, 25 cm, 35 cm, and 45 cm from\
    \ the top surface.\nSensors 2021, 21, 5110\n14 of 28\n \nThen our Plant Node #1\
    \ was inserted in the soil at a distance of 10 cm from the Sentek \nsensor (Figure\
    \ 11b, where Node #1 is shown without the lid and connected to a 230 ACV-\n5 DCV\
    \ adapter during a test measurement). Since the reference sensor and the Plant\
    \ Node \n#1 are installed in different positions/depths, this has an impact on\
    \ the measurements, as \nexplained in the following sections. Data of Plant Node\
    \ #1 were collected every 5 min for \nseveral days while the automatic acquisition\
    \ system of the reference sensor stored the \nmeasurement results every minute.\
    \ In carrying out the measurements, the soil was wa-\ntered in consecutive steps.\

    \ content of 10%), then four synchronous \nwaterings, clearly visible at a depth\
    \ of 5 cm, were performed during the last two days of \nthis measurement. The\

    \ considerations that will help to clarify the experimental\nobservations and\
    \ will allow us to extract the VWC from the output voltage of the Capacitive\n\
    Soil Moisture Sensor v1.2.\nIn principle, the results of the reference sensor\
    \ and the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor\nv1.2 could not exactly be correlated\
    \ since:\n•\nNode #1 is 10 cm far from the reference sensor and soil compaction\
    \ and watering\ncould not be perfectly uniform in that area;\n•\nMeasurement results\
    \ from Node #1 could be inﬂuenced by temperature variations;\n•\nThe Capacitive\
    \ Soil Moisture Sensor v1.2 measures an average water content of\napproximately\
    \ the ﬁrst 5 cm of the soil where it is inserted, while the reference sensor\n\
    is placed at 5 cm from the soil surface with a wider thickness of inﬂuence (spanning\
    \ a\ndepth between 0 and 10 cm).\nRegarding the ﬁrst observation, sample preparation\
    \ described in Section 4 included\nan accurate packing mechanism to achieve vertical\
    \ homogeneity. However, this sample\npreparation does not guarantee uniform compaction\
    \ of the soil. In [8] we demonstrated\nthat compaction has an obvious strong inﬂuence\
    \ on the results of the Capacitive Soil\nMoisture Sensor v1.2. The 10 cm distance\
    \ between the reference sensor and the Capacitive\nSoil Moisture Sensor v1.2 could\
    \ affect water content measurement accuracy and cause\na discrepancy between the\
    \ reference and the low-cost sensor. Non-uniform watering is\na second source\
    \ of non-uniformity, even if watering was manually performed trying to\nevenly\
    \ distribute water. Therefore, non-uniform soil compaction and watering represent\n\
    a random added error to our measurements, which should be kept at a minimum using\n\
    experience and best practices.\nRegarding the temperature variations during the\
    \ measurements, temperature compen-\nsation of VWC could be feasible. This task\
    \ has been demonstrated to be necessary in the\ncase of a temperature spanning\
    \ about 20 ◦C [27]. In that case, backpropagation neural net-\nworks have been\
    \ successfully adopted for correcting the soil moisture information from a\nlow-cost\
    \ sensor using soil temperature data. However, in our experiment, the temperature\n\
    variations are signiﬁcantly smaller, about 2 ◦C, and a correction was not implemented.\n\
    Differently from the previous sources of error, the possible error due to different\
    \ depths\nof the reference and the low-cost sensor could be taken into account\
    \ by properly modeling\ninﬁltration and redistribution of water during and after\
    \ rainfall [69–71] as explained in\nSensors 2021, 21, 5110\n18 of 28\nthe next\
    \ subsections. In detail, in Section 6.1 we introduce a consolidated inﬁltration\n\
    model available in the literature to obtain the soil water content at any depth,\
    \ whereas in\nSection 6.2 we correlate the described Capacitive Soil Moisture\
    \ Sensor v1.2 output voltage\nwith the prediction of the inﬁltration model for\
    \ the two different soils.\n6.1. The Modeling Inﬁltration and Redistribution of\
    \ Water\nTo obtain the soil water content at any depth, z, the Corradini et al.\
    \ [72] inﬁltration\nmodel was used (hereafter named “C et al. (97)”). As shown\
    \ by Melone et al. [70,71], this\nmodel can accurately represent the inﬁltration\
    \ process during complex rainfall patterns\ninvolving rainfall hiatus periods.\n\
    The model was derived considering a constant value of the initial soil water content,\
    \ θi,\nand combining the depth-integrated forms of the Darcy law and continuity\
    \ equation [72].\nIn addition, as the event progresses in time, t, a dynamic wetting\
    \ proﬁle, of the lowest\ndepth Z and represented by a distorted rectangle through\
    \ a shape factor β(θ0) ≤ 1, was\nassumed. The resulting ordinary differential\
    \ equation is\ndθ0\ndt =\n(θ0 − θi)β(θ0)\nF′\nh\n(θ0 − θi) dβ(θ0)\ndθ0\n+ β(θ0)\n\
    i\n\x14\nq0 − K0 − (θ0 − θi)G(θi, θ0)β(θ0)pK0\nF′\n\x15\n(4)\nwhere p is a parameter\
    \ linked with the proﬁle shape of the soil water content, θ, θ0 is the soil\n\
    water content at the surface, K0 is the hydraulic conductivity at the soil surface,\
    \ F′ is the cu-\nmulative dynamic inﬁltration amount, and G(θi,θ0) is expressed\
    \ by the following equation:\nG = 1\nKs\nθs\nZ\nθi\nD(θ)dθ\n(5)\nwhere θ0 and\
    \ K0 were replaced by θs and Ks, with Ks the saturated hydraulic conductivity.\n\
    D(θ) is the soil water diffusivity, deﬁned by D(θ) = K(θ) ∂ψ\n∂θ , where K is\
    \ the hydraulic\nconductivity and ψ the soil water matric potential. Equation\
    \ (4) can be applied until a\nsecond rainfall pulse happens, with the proﬁle shape\
    \ of θ(z) approximated [72] by\nθ(z) − θi\nθ0 − θi\n= 1 − exp\n\x14 βz(θ0 − θi)\
    \ − F′\n(β − β2) − F′\n\x15\n(6)\nFunctional forms for β and p were obtained by\

    \ silty loam soil, speciﬁcally:\nβ(θ0) = 0.6 θs − θi\nθs − θr\n+ 0.4\n(7)\nβ·p\

    Figure 24. Comparison among the best results obtained from the correlation procedure\
    \ for the three \nconsidered models. \n7. Conclusions \nA low-power WSN based\
    \ on LoRaWAN™ was designed with a focus on low-cost \nPA applications, such as\
    \ greenhouse sensing and actuation. Two types of wireless nodes \nwere envisaged,\
    \ greenhouse node and plant node, and the whole LPWAN was designed \nand implemented,\
    \ including an 8-channel gateway/concentrator. The first experimental \nresults\
    \ were collected and stored in a database managed by a virtual machine running\
    \ in \na cloud service. Since all subsystems adopted in this research are off-the-shelf\
    \ elements \nwith available open-source software libraries, only a minimal effort\
    \ is needed when the \nsystem is implemented for a different application. \nMeasurement\
    \ results were focused on measurements of water content and were col-\nlected\
    \ using plant nodes in Loamy Sand and Silty Loam, proving the functionality and\
    \ \nreliability of the whole system (sensor nodes, gateway, GUI, Node-RED, and\
    \ Cloud) and \ncomparing the system behavior with a reference sensor from Sentek.\
    \ Temperature meas-\nurements of our plant nodes compare as expected with the\
    \ reference sensor within the \nsupposed accuracy of the adopted sensors. Regarding\
    \ water content measurements, a cor-\nrelation was attempted between the results\
    \ of the cheap Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor \nv1.2 and those of the Sentek\
    \ reference sensor. We realized the low-cost water content sen-\nsor suffers from\
    \ a non-constant sensitivity; therefore, non-linear fitting equations are nec-\n\
    essary for correlating its voltage output with the VWC. We adopted for the Capacitive\
    \ Soil \nMoisture Sensor v1.2 two VWC fitting equations taken from the literature.\
    \ Since the ref-\nerence sensor and the cheap water content sensor span different\
    \ soil depths (5 cm and 2-\n3 cm, respectively), we first modeled the theoretical\
    \ VWC profiles at different depths us-\ning a proven water infiltration and redistribution\
    \ model, calibrating the model on the ref-\nerence sensor results at a depth of\
    \ 5 cm. Then we used the two fitting equations for the \nCapacitive Soil Moisture\
    \ Sensor v1.2 and calculated multi-parameter least squares fit to \nthe hydraulic\
    \ model at 2 and 3 cm depths. A very satisfactory correlation coefficient of \n\
    0.94 was obtained for Silty Loam using the exponential/logarithmic “P” model at\
    \ a depth \nof 3 cm. Instead, the best correlation value we obtained using the\
    \ same fitting procedure \napplied to the results in Loamy Sand was 0.58 at a\
    \ depth of 2 cm using the hyperbolic “H” \nmodel. Despite the low correlation\
    \ coefficient, the VWC values we obtained with the hy-\nperbolic “H” model can\
    \ be considered as representative of the real VWC at a depth of 2 \ncm, since\
    \ differences of a few percent are often irrelevant for practical applications\
    \ of sen-\nsors for measuring the soil water content. \nFigure 24. Comparison\
    \ among the best results obtained from the correlation procedure for the three\n\

    \ of a few percent are often irrelevant for practical applications of\nsensors\
    \ for measuring the soil water content.\nIn this work, we demonstrated the lack\
    \ of linearity of the adopted soil water content\nsensor. Notwithstanding this\
    \ lack of linearity, the introduction of the inﬁltration model\nSensors 2021,\
    \ 21, 5110\n25 of 28\nand of a dedicated statistical analysis allowed us to extract\
    \ reliable values of the volumet-\nric water content for both Silty Loam and Loamy\
    \ Sand. This procedure represents the\nnovelty and the potential of the proposed\
    \ approach. Therefore, future work will address\nthe optimization of the sensor\
    \ performance. To this purpose, it will be useful to better\nunderstand the behavior\
    \ of the sensor from simulations and to optimize the layout of\nthe sensor without\
    \ impacting signiﬁcantly on the cost, also considering the mechanical\nintegration\
    \ constraints needed for industrialization.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    \ \n1.1. A worldwide dilemma of food security\nFood security is a multifaceted\
    \ notion that aims to eliminate hunger by \nassuring a steady supply of nutritious\
    \ food. It is defined by a four-pillar para-\ndigm, each of which is necessary\
    \ to provide food security [1]. Food security \nis becoming a severe global concern\
    \ as a result of anthropogenic factors such \nas rapid population expansion, urbanization,\
    \ industrialization, farmland loss, \nfreshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation.\
    \ This is due to the fact that \n424\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nthese factors have a direct impact on the agricultural industry,\
    \ which is the \nworld’s principal source of agri-food production. By 2050, it\
    \ is expected that \nthe global population will rise from 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion,\
    \ urban population \nwill rise by 66 percent, arable land will decline by approximately\
    \ 50 million \nhectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO 2 – promote crop disease\
    \ and \npest growth) will rise by 50 percent, agri-food production will decline\
    \ by 20%, \nand food demand will rise by 59 to 98 percent, posing an imminent\
    \ threat. To \nmeet rising food demands, agricultural practitioners around the\
    \ world will need \nto increase crop and livestock production to maximize agricultural\
    \ output. The \nemphasis of this review paper is crop farming, which includes\
    \ the production \nof both food and cash crops. \nA typical agri-food value chain\
    \ displaying three key stages in the production \nof agricultural products: pre-field\
    \ (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and \nharvesting stage), and post-field\
    \ (post-harvesting stage). All of the stages are \nimportant in the value chain,\
    \ but in this examination, we will focus on the sec-\nond stage, in-field, which\
    \ includes numerous crop-growing operations such as \nploughing, sowing, spraying,\
    \ and harvesting, among others. Traditional agricul-\ntural approaches are now\
    \ used in these procedures, which are labor-intensive, \nrequire arable land,\
    \ time, and a significant quantity of water (for irrigation), and \nmake it difficult\
    \ to produce enough food [5]. A part of the problem is also due \nto the improper\
    \ application of pesticides and herbicides, as well as the misuse \nof available\
    \ technologies, both of which hurt crops and ultimately result in \nagricultural\
    \ waste [6]. These problems can be solved by combining advanced \ntechnologies\
    \ and computer-based applications that ensure higher crop yields, \nless water\
    \ use, better pesticide/herbicide use, and improved crop quality. This \nis where\
    \ the concept of smart agriculture comes into play.\n1.2. Smart Agriculture\n\
    Every industry is being revolutionized and reshaped by Industry 4.0. It’s a \n\
    strategic initiative that combines emerging disruptive digital technologies like\
    \ \nthe Internet of Things (IoT), big data and analytics (BDA), system integration\
    \ \n(SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous robotic systems (ARS),\
    \ \naugmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless sensor networks\
    \ \n(WSN), cyber-physical systems (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive manu-\n\
    facturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. \nAgriculture 4.0,\
    \ also known as smart agriculture, smart farming or digital \nfarming [7], is\
    \ the next phase of industrial agriculture, fueled by the integra-\ntion of these\
    \ technologies in agriculture. Farmers can use smart agriculture to \naddress\
    \ a variety of agricultural food production concerns such as farm pro-\n425\n\
    Siberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nductivity,\
    \ environmental impact, food security, crop losses, and sustainability. \nFarmers,\
    \ for example, can connect to farms remotely, regardless of location \nor time,\
    \ using IoT-enabled equipment based on WSNs to monitor and control \nfarm operations.\
    \ Drones outfitted with hyper spectral cameras can collect data \nfrom a variety\
    \ of sources on farmlands, while autonomous robots can assist \nor complete repetitive\
    \ chores on farms. Data analytics techniques can be used \nto examine the obtained\
    \ data, and computer programs can be utilized to help \nfarmers make decisions.\n\
    Similarly, smart agriculture can monitor and analyze a wide range of pa-\nrameters\
    \ related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production status, \nwater\
    \ management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides and pes-\nticides,\
    \ and controlled environment agriculture to increase crop yields, reduce \ncosts,\
    \ improve product quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of \nmodern\
    \ systems [8].\n1.3. Research Motivation and Contribution \nThe reason for writing\
    \ this assessment is that digital technologies in agri-\ncultural systems provide\
    \ new strategic solutions for increasing farm output ef-\nficiency and effectiveness.\
    \ Furthermore, digital transformation paves the door \nfor modern farming technologies\
    \ like vertical farming (hydroponics, aquapon-\nics, and aeroponics) to be used,\
    \ which has the potential to solve food security \nissues. However, there are\
    \ a number of issues and restrictions connected with \nthis change from a technological,\
    \ socioeconomic, and management perspective \nthat must be overcome in order to\
    \ fully realise the potential of agricultural 4.0 \n[9].A number of publications\
    \ [9–18] have examined developing trends in the \ndevelopment of agriculture 4.0\
    \ by offering concise information on essential \nuses, benefits, and research\
    \ problems of smart farming. These studies’ research \nfocuses on either explaining\
    \ more general technical aspects while focusing on \nonly one or a few digital\
    \ technologies, or improving agricultural supply chain \nperformance, or developing\
    \ an agriculture 4.0 definition, or achieving sustain-\nable agronomy through\
    \ precision agriculture, or proposing a smart farming \nframework. Nonetheless,\
    \ these studies do not include an explicit discussion of \nthe tools and techniques\
    \ utilized to construct various systems, as well as their \nmaturity level. There\
    \ are also few studies that look at the consequences of dig-\nital technology\
    \ in modern soilless farms including hydroponics, aquaponics, \nand aeroponics\
    \ (indoor/outdoor). As a result, in order to promote conversation \nin this field,\
    \ it is necessary to examine the emergence of agriculture 4.0 from \nmany angles.\
    \ This research seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of dig-\nital technologies\
    \ used in the second stage of the agricultural production value \n426\nSiberian\
    \ Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nchain (in-field)\
    \ for various farm types as described in section 1.1. The study’s \nkey theoretical\
    \ contribution is the analysis and dissemination of the tools and \ntechniques\
    \ used, as well as the farm type, maturity level of produced systems, \nand potential\
    \ obstacles or inhibiting factors in agriculture 4.0 development. Re-\nsearchers\
    \ and agricultural practitioners will benefit from the review’s insights \nin\
    \ future study on agriculture 4.0. \n1.4. Paper organization \nThe following is\
    \ the structure of the paper after the introduction: \nSection 2 discusses the\
    \ methodology used to collect relevant literature; Sec-\ntion 3 then presents\
    \ the statistical results obtained after a general analysis of the \nselected\
    \ research studies; Section 4 then provides a detailed overview of the \ncore\
    \ technologies used in agricultural digitization; Section 5 then highlights the\
    \ \ntechnical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital integration in agriculture;\
    \ \nand finally, Section 6 outlines a discussion of the research questions.\n\
    2. Research Methodology \nA systematic literature review (SLR) is a technique\
    \ for organizing and iden-\ntifying research related to a specific topic [19].\
    \ SLR is used in this study to look \ninto the state of Industry 4.0 technologies\
    \ in the agricultural industry. Cases \nwhere the phrase ‘agricultural’ occurred\
    \ in the title, abstract, or keywords of \nan article with any of the ‘Industry\
    \ 4.0 technologies’ described in section 1.2 \nare specifically sought. A review\
    \ procedure is established prior to conducting \nthe SLR to ensure a transparent\
    \ and high-quality research process, which are \nthe features that distinguish\
    \ a systematic literature review [20]. By conducting \nthorough literature searches,\
    \ the review methodology also helps to reduce bias. \nThe creation of the research\
    \ questions, the defining of the search method, and \nthe specification of inclusion\
    \ and exclusion criteria are all part of this process. \nTo conduct SLR, this\
    \ paper uses a recommended reporting item for system-\natic reviews and meta-analysis\
    \ (PRISMA) approach. PRISMA is a minimum \ncollection of items based on evidence\
    \ that is used to guide the construction of \nsystematic literature reviews and\
    \ other meta-analyses [19].\n2.1. Review Protocol \nBefore doing the bibliographic\
    \ analysis, a review methodology is estab-\nlished to identify, analyze, and interpret\
    \ data that are relevant to the research \nfocus. To begin, research questions\
    \ are developed in order to provide insight \ninto the study of published studies\
    \ in the research area of interest from many \nperspectives. These are the questions\
    \ that must be addressed in the research. The \nsearch strategy is then created,\
    \ which aids in the identification of appropriate \n427\nSiberian Journal of Life\
    \ Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nkeywords later in the search equation,\
    \ as well as the identification of relevant \ninformation sources, such as academic\
    \ databases and search engines that allow \naccess to vast amounts of digital\
    \ documentation. Science Direct, Scopus, and \nIEEE Xplore are three online research\
    \ archives that are utilized to find relevant \nstudies. Finally, boundaries are\
    \ created by predefining inclusion and exclusion \ncriteria for further inquiry\
    \ and content assessments of selected articles in order \nto narrow the search\
    \ results of each database.\n2.2. Evaluation Process \nIdentification, screening,\
    \ eligibility, and inclusion are the four stages of the \nliterature search process\
    \ that are evaluated. Consolidation is done for the re-\nmoval of duplicate items\
    \ in the identification step after initial metadata filtering \nby the use of\
    \ search expressions. After this phase, the number of publications is \nreduced.\
    \ The titles and abstracts of the papers are reviewed during the screening \n\
    stage, and the most relevant publications are chosen for integral reading. In\
    \ the \nthird stage, full-text screening of these papers is done to ensure that\
    \ they are \neligible for this paper’s goal.\n2.3. Threats to Validity \n(i) SLR\
    \ replication: Because the current search is confined to only three on-\nline\
    \ repositories, the provided SLR is vulnerable to risks to validity. \nAdditional\
    \ sources could potentially lead to the discovery of more pub-\nlications. Validity\
    \ can be regarded satisfactorily addressed because the SLR \nprocess is clearly\
    \ defined in sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2. However, it is possible \nthat slightly\
    \ different publications will be found if this SLR is replicated. This \nvariation\
    \ could be due to various personal choices made throughout the PRIS-\nMA screening\
    \ and eligibility phases, but it’s highly improbable that the overall \nresults\
    \ would alter.\n(ii)The search string used to discover the relevant papers covers\
    \ the entire \nspectrum of SLR; however it’s possible that some important studies\
    \ were over-\nlooked. More research may be found if more keywords and synonyms\
    \ in the \nsearch are included.\n3. Digitization Trends in Agriculture \nAlthough\
    \ the agriculture business is making significant progress in terms \nof digital\
    \ technology adoption, it is still lagging behind other industries such \nas healthcare,\
    \ manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, and others [15]. The \ncrop farming\
    \ method considered while designing an application or framework \nis referred\
    \ to as the farm type. The farming method, for example, can be soil-\nbased or\
    \ soilless. Open-air fields (conventional outdoor agricultural farms) and \n428\n\
    Siberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ngreenhouse\
    \ farms are included in the soil-based farming category (indoor). The \nsoilless\
    \ farming category, on the other hand, includes modern farming tech-\nniques such\
    \ as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor). In \nthe recent\
    \ decade, autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned guided \nvehicles and\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), the internet of things, and \nmachine learning\
    \ appear to be the most commonly used technology in agricul-\nture. Agriculture’s\
    \ growing sectors include big data, wireless sensor networks, \ncyber-physical\
    \ systems, and digital twins. Furthermore, in contrast to indoor \nfarms, open\
    \ air farms are the most usually examined in research investigations. \nFew publications\
    \ exist for soilless farming systems (aquaponics, aeroponics, \nand hydroponics),\
    \ implying that these modern farming practices are still in \ntheir infancy. Similarly,\
    \ each use case’s services are identified and classified \ninto nine service categories:\
    \ I crop management, CM (estimation/harvesting \nperiod and seed plantation/prediction\
    \ of crop yield/ growth rate/harvesting/ \npollination/ spraying (fertilizer/\
    \ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM \n(fresh weight, green biomass,\
    \ height, length, width, leaf density, piment content \n(chlorophyll), and phytochemical\
    \ composition); iii) water and environmental \nmanagement, WEM (monitoring and\
    \ control of flow rate, water level, water \nquality (nutrients), temperature,\
    \ humidity, CO2, and weather forecasts, among \nother things); iv) irrigation\
    \ management, IM (water stress detection and sched-\nuling); v) farm management,\
    \ FM (monitoring of farm operations, tracking and \ncounting products, determining\
    \ production efficiency, financial analysis, energy \nconsumption analysis, technology\
    \ integration, and decision-making);\nPDM (pest and disease management) is a term\
    \ used to describe the man-\nagement of pests and diseases (pest identification\
    \ and disease detection) SM \n(Soil Management) vii) (moisture content, soil nutrients,\
    \ fertilizer needs and \napplication) WUVM (weed/unknown vegetation mapping, classification,\
    \ and \npesticide application) viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management FDC\
    \ \n(fruit detection and counting), and ix) \nThe role of various digital technologies\
    \ in smart farming is depicted in \nthese categories. Crop management characteristics\
    \ such as crop yield prediction, \ngrowth rate estimation, and harvesting period\
    \ evaluation are the most 4.0 in the \nprevious decade, whereas soil management,\
    \ fruit identification and counting, \nand crop quality management receive very\
    \ less attention. The European Union’s \nTRL scale, which divides system maturity\
    \ into three generic categories [21], is \nused to assess the technology readiness\
    \ level (TRL) of all use cases. The first \nlevel is conceptual, which corresponds\
    \ to European TRL 1–2 (use case is in \nconcept phase), the second level is prototype,\
    \ which corresponds to Europe-\n429\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\nan TRL 3–6 (use case is functional even without all planned\
    \ features), and the \nthird level is deployed, which corresponds to European\
    \ TRL 7–9. (Use case \nis mature with all the possible functions). Each use case’s\
    \ TRL was produced \nin a few experiments. It has been noticed that smart agricultural\
    \ systems have \nmade little progress from the concept and prototype stages to\
    \ the commercial \nstage. The majority of use cases, for example, are still in\
    \ the prototype stage.\n4. Agriculture 4.0 enabling technologies \n4.1. Internet\
    \ of Things driven agricultural systems \nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a network\
    \ of interconnected computing de-\nvices, sensors, appliances, and machines that\
    \ are all connected to the internet \nand have their own unique identities and\
    \ capacities for remote sensing and \nmonitoring [21]. Network layer (communication),\
    \ perception layer (hardware \ndevices), , middleware layer (device management\
    \ and interoperability), service \nlayer (cloud computing), application layer\
    \ (data integration and analytics), and \nend-user layer are the six layers of\
    \ the IoT reference architecture (user-inter-\nface). IoT devices on the physical\
    \ layer in the agricultural domain collect data \non environmental and crop characteristics\
    \ such as temperature, humidity, pH \nvalue, water level, leaf colour, fresh leaf\
    \ weight, and so on. The network layer is \nresponsible for transmitting this\
    \ information, and its architecture is determined \nby the field size, farm location,\
    \ and type of farming method. ZigBee, LoRa, and \nSigfox, for example, are widely\
    \ utilized and employed in outdoor fields because \nthey are less expensive, have\
    \ low energy consumption, and have a long trans-\nmission range [22, 23]. Bluetooth,\
    \ despite being a secure technology, is only \nemployed in indoor farms due to\
    \ its limited transmission range [22]. Due to its \nhigh costs and high energy\
    \ consumption, Wi-Fi is not a promising technology \nfor agricultural applications\
    \ [22]. On the other hand, RFID (radio frequency \nidentification) and NFC (near\
    \ field communication) technologies are increas-\ningly being used in agricultural\
    \ systems for product tracking [24]. For periodic \nmonitoring of environmental\
    \ and soil characteristics, GPRS or mobile commu-\nnication technology (2G, 3G,\
    \ and 4G) is utilized. Furthermore, HTTP, WWW, \nand SMTP are the most commonly\
    \ utilized communication protocols in agri-\ncultural contexts. Similarly, middleware\
    \ HYDRA and SMEPP are commonly \nused in agricultural systems to enable interoperability\
    \ and system security for \ntheir context-aware functionalities [25]. \nCloud\
    \ computing approaches are used in the service layer to store data. \nThis information\
    \ is then used on the application layer to create smart apps that \nfarmers, agriculture\
    \ experts, and supply chain professionals can use to improve \n430\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nfarm monitoring and productivity.\
    \ The use of IoT in agriculture is intended to \nprovide farmers with decision-making\
    \ tools and automation technologies that \nallow them to seamlessly integrate\
    \ knowledge, products, and services in order to \nincrease production, quality,\
    \ and profit. A slew of research have been conduct-\ned and presented on the incubation\
    \ of IoT concepts in the agricultural industry. \nThe development of IoT-based\
    \ agricultural systems has addressed a variety of \ntechnological and architectural\
    \ concerns. However, most of these technologies \nare now in the conceptual stage\
    \ or in prototype form (not commercial). Farm \nmanagement, irrigation control,\
    \ crop development, health monitoring, and dis-\nease detection are all priorities.\
    \ \nSome of these studies also explained how IoT is being used in current ag-\n\
    ricultural systems like vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics, hydro-\n\
    ponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Furthermore, the\
    \ \nmajority of studies have been focused on a single issue.\n4.2. Wireless sensor\
    \ networks in agriculture \nA wireless sensor network (WSN) is a technology that\
    \ is utilized in an Inter-\nnet of Things (IoT) system. It is defined as a collection\
    \ of spatially distributed \nsensors for monitoring environmental physical conditions,\
    \ temporarily storing \nobtained data, and transferring the information to a central\
    \ point [22]. A wire-\nless sensor network (WSN) for smart farming is made up\
    \ of multiple sensor \nnodes connected by a wireless connection module. These\
    \ nodes have a variety \nof skills that allow them to self-organize, self-configure,\
    \ and self-diagnose (for \nexample, processing, trans- mission, and feeling).\
    \ There are various varieties of \nWSNs, which are classified based on the environment\
    \ in which they are used. \nTWSNs (terrestrial wireless sensor networks), WUSNs\
    \ (wireless underground \nsensor networks), UWSNs (underwater wireless sensor\
    \ networks), WMSNs \n(wireless multimedia sensor networks), and MWSNs (mobile\
    \ wireless sensor \nnetworks) are a few examples [26]. TWSN and UWSN are commonly\
    \ utilized \nin agricultural applications. TWSN nodes are sensors that collect\
    \ data from \nthe environment and are located above ground. The second type of\
    \ WSN is \nWUSNs, which are WSNs with sensor nodes embedded in the soil. Lower\
    \ fre-\nquencies easily enter the soil in this environment, whereas higher frequencies\
    \ \nare severely attenuated [27]. Because of the limited communication radius,\
    \ the \nnetwork requires a larger number of nodes to cover a big area. Many research\
    \ \npublications on the use of WSN for various outdoor and indoor farm applica-\n\
    tions, such as irrigation management, water quality testing, and environmental\
    \ \nmonitoring, are accessible in the literature. The goal of these experiments\
    \ was \nto create WSN architectures that were simple, low-cost, energy-efficient,\
    \ and \n431\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n\
    scalable. However, several aspects of WSNs, such as minimum maintenance, \nrobust\
    \ and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability, require more study. \n\
    4.3. Cloud computing in agriculture \nCloud computing (CC) is defined as a model\
    \ for enabling convenient, ubiq-\nuitous, on-demand network access to a shared\
    \ pool of configurable computing \nresources (e.g., networks, servers, storage,\
    \ applications, and services) that can \nbe rapidly provisioned and released with\
    \ minimal management effort or ser-\nvice provider interaction, according to the\
    \ National Institute of Standards and \nTechnologies (NIST) [28]. The datacenter\
    \ (hardware), infrastructure, platform, \nand application layers make up the primary\
    \ architecture of CC [29]. Each of \nthese layers corresponds to one of three\
    \ cloud service models: SaaS (software \nas a service), PaaS (platform as a service),\
    \ and IaaS (infrastructure as a service) \n(IaaS). In the agriculture sector,\
    \ cloud computing has gotten a lot of attention in \nthe last decade because it\
    \ provides: 1) low-cost storage for data collected from \nvarious domains via\
    \ WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale \ncomputer systems\
    \ to make intelligent decisions by converting raw data into \nusable knowledge,\
    \ and 3) a secure platform for developing agricultural based \nIoT applications\
    \ [30]. \nCC is used to develop various agricultural applications in conjunction\
    \ with \nIoT and WSN. CC technology is also utilized to develop operational farm\
    \ man-\nagement systems (FMSs) that help farmers and farm managers monitor farm\
    \ \nactivities more efficiently. The traceability of agri-product quality is another\
    \ \narea of interest that is being investigated in global research [31]. However,\
    \ only \npreliminary research has been done to see if traceability complies with\
    \ food \nsafety and quality criteria. The usage of cloud-based agricultural systems\
    \ has \nthe potential to address issues such as rising food demand, pollution\
    \ from pes-\nticides and fertilizers, and the safety of agricultural products.\
    \ These FMSs, on \nthe other hand, lack the flexibility to offer run-time customization\
    \ in response \nto specific farmer needs. Furthermore, because most farm data\
    \ is fragmented \nand distributed, recording farm operations accurately in existing\
    \ FMSs systems \nis problematic [32].\n4.4. Edge/fog computing in agriculture\
    \ \nThe rapid expansion of IoT has resulted in an explosion of sensors and smart\
    \ \ndevices, creating massive amounts of data. The processing and analysis of\
    \ such a \nlarge volume of data in real time is difficult since it puts a strain\
    \ on the cloud serv-\ner and slows response times. When dealing with such a massive\
    \ data set, a cloud \nserver alone will not be able to offer real-time responses.\
    \ Furthermore, because \nIoT applications require a constant exchange of information\
    \ between devices and \n432\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nthe cloud, they are susceptible to network latency, making\
    \ CC unsuitable for these \napplications [23]. The introduction of the edge computing\
    \ idea has the potential \nto overcome the CC issues. This novel computing architecture\
    \ places computa-\ntional and storage resources (such as cloudlets or fog nodes)\
    \ closer to data sources \nlike mobile devices and sensors at the network’s edge.\
    \ This allows for real-time \nanalytics while maintaining data security on the\
    \ device [23]. Although edge com-\nputing has exciting potential for smart agriculture,\
    \ its applications in agricultural \nsystems are still in their infancy. As a\
    \ result, there are limited research studies in \nthis field. The majority of\
    \ the edge computing-based agricultural systems covered \nin these papers are\
    \ prototypes that solve a small number of challenges across a \nvariety of agricultural\
    \ disciplines. Interoperability and scalability issues haven’t \ngotten enough\
    \ attention so yet. Agricultural robots combine emerging technolo-\ngies such\
    \ as computer vision; wireless sensor networks (WSNs), satellite navi-\ngation\
    \ systems (GPS), artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing (CC), and the \n\
    Internet of Things (IoT) to help farmers improve productivity and quality of ag-\n\
    ricultural products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile or fixed [33]. Mobile\
    \ \nAARS can move around the working field. Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) \n\
    and unidentified aerial vehicles (UAVs) are the two types of mobile AARSs, as\
    \ \ndiscussed in the following sections. \n4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in\
    \ agriculture\nUnmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that work\
    \ with-\nout the use of a human operator on the ground. A platform for locomotive\
    \ ap-\nparatus and manipulator, navigation sensors, a supervisory control system,\
    \ an \ninterface for the control system, communication links for information exchange\
    \ \nbetween devices, and system architecture for integration between hardware\
    \ and \nsoftware agents are the main components of UGVs [34]. The control architec-\n\
    ture of a UGV can be remote-operated (controlled via an interface by a human \n\
    operator) or totally autonomous (operated without the use of a human control-\n\
    ler using artificial intelligence technology) [34]. Locomotive systems, likewise,\
    \ \ncan be based on wheels, tracks, or legs [34]. Legged robots are uncommon in\
    \ \nagriculture, despite their great terrain flexibility, inherent Omni directionality,\
    \ \nand soil protection. These robots, however, offer a disruptive locomotion\
    \ mech-\nanism for smart farms when paired with wheels (wheel-legged robots).\
    \ UGVs \nshould meet specific requirements, such as small size, maneuverability,\
    \ resil-\nience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety, in addition\
    \ to the nec-\nessary features for infield operations, in order to improve crop\
    \ yields and farm \nproductivity. A 4WD locomotive system is used in the majority\
    \ of agricultural \nrobotic systems due to its ease of manufacture and control.\
    \ \n433\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n\
    The disadvantage of 4WD is that terrains with stone elements and/or voids \nhave\
    \ a significant impact on the wheels [34]. As a result, other mechanisms, \nsuch\
    \ as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems, should be investigated. \nAlthough\
    \ some robots include computer vision systems, most of these robots \nare designed\
    \ with a low-cost computer vision system, such as traditional RGB \ncameras, due\
    \ to the difficulties of establishing an accurate and dependable sys-\ntem that\
    \ can replace manual labour. Furthermore, the majority of the systems \nmentioned\
    \ above are still in the research phase, with no large-scale commer-\ncial application.\n\
    4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture \nUnmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),\
    \ sometimes known as aerial robots, are \nplanes that do not have a human pilot\
    \ on board. There are many different types \nof UAVs [35] depending on the technology\
    \ used to fly (wing structure) and the \nlevel of autonomy. Fixed-wing (planes),\
    \ single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid system \n(vertical takeoff and landing), and\
    \ multi-rotor UAVs are examples of wing types \n(drone). Drones (multi-rotor technology),\
    \ which are raised and driven by four \n(quad-rotor) or six (hex-rotor) rotors,\
    \ have grown in popularity in the agricul-\nture sector because to their mechanical\
    \ simplicity in comparison to helicopters, \nwhich rely on a much more complex\
    \ plate control mechanism [36]. Similarly, \nUAVs can be tele-operated or tele-commanded,\
    \ depending on their autonomy \nlevel, with the pilot providing references to\
    \ each actuator of the aircraft to con-\ntrol it in the same way that an onboard\
    \ pilot would, or tele-commanded with the \naircraft relying on an automatic controller\
    \ on board to maintain a stable flight \n[35]. Agricultural UAVs with the right\
    \ sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, \nand hyper spectral cameras, for\
    \ example) can collect data (vegetation, leaf area, \nand reflectance indexes)\
    \ from their fields to monitor dynamic changes in crops \nthat aren’t visible\
    \ from the ground [37]. Farmers can deduce information about \ncrop illnesses,\
    \ nutrient deficits, water level, and other agricultural growth char-\nacteristics\
    \ using this data. Farmers might plan possible cures using this knowl-\nedge (irrigation,\
    \ fertilization, weed control, etc.). \nThe majority of the systems mentioned\
    \ above are still in the research stage, \nwith no large-scale commercial use.\
    \ Other issues with these UAVs include bat-\ntery life and flight time [35]. Lithium-ion\
    \ batteries are currently in use because \ntheir capacity exceeds that of conventional\
    \ batteries. \nHowever, increasing the battery capacity increases the weight of\
    \ the drone, \nand research is currently underway to overcome this issue. \nFurthermore,\
    \ existing UAVs have complicated user interfaces that can only \nbe used by experts\
    \ to accomplish agricultural chores. People who are elderly \n434\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nor unfamiliar with UAV\
    \ technology will be able to control it more readily if \nthe user interface is\
    \ improved and made more human-centered with multimod-\nal feedback. \n4.6. Big\
    \ data and analytics in agriculture \nRapid advancements in IoT and CC technologies\
    \ have massively expanded \nthe amount of data available. Textual content (structured,\
    \ semi-structured, and un-\nstructured) and multimedia content (e.g., videos,\
    \ photos, and audio) are included \nin this data, also known as Big Data (BD)\
    \ [38]. Big data analytics is the practice \nof analyzing large amounts of data\
    \ to find hidden patterns, unknown relationships, \nmarket trends, client preferences,\
    \ and other important information (BDA). Big \ndata is usually classified into\
    \ five dimensions, each of which is represented by a V. \nThe concept of BD-driven\
    \ smart agriculture is very new, but its trend is \ngood because it has the potential\
    \ to make a dramatic change in the food supply \nchain and boost food security\
    \ through higher productivity. Agricultural big data \nis typically generated\
    \ from a variety of sources in agriculture, including ground \nsensors, aerial\
    \ vehicles, and ground vehicles equipped with special cameras and \nsensors; governmental\
    \ bodies in the form of reports and regulations; private \norganizations through\
    \ online web services; farmers in the form of knowledge \ngained through surveys;\
    \ and social media [39]. Depending on the agricultural \ndomain, the data can\
    \ be environmental (weather, climate, moisture level, etc.), \nbiological (plant\
    \ disease), or geospatial, and it comes in a variety of volumes, \nspeeds, and\
    \ formats [40]. The information is acquired and stored in a computer \ndatabase,\
    \ where it is analyzed using computer algorithms for seed characteris-\ntics,\
    \ weather patterns, soil attributes (such as pH or nutrient content), marketing\
    \ \nand trade management, consumer behaviour, and inventory management. In \n\
    agriculture, a range of strategies and tools are used to examine large data. The\
    \ \nmost often employed techniques include machine learning, cloud-based plat-\n\
    forms, and modelling and simulation. Machine learning technologies are used \n\
    to solve problems like prediction, clustering, and classification, while cloud\
    \ \nplatforms are utilized for large-scale data storage, preprocessing, and visual-\n\
    ization. There are still numerous potential areas where BDA can be used to \n\
    address various agricultural concerns that are not well covered in existing lit-\n\
    erature. For example, data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical farming \n\
    systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and indoor\
    \ \nfarms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to help farmers design\
    \ \nindoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers to help them\
    \ make \ndecisions about the physical ecosystem’s sustainability. Finally, the\
    \ majority of \nsystems are still in the prototype stage.\n435\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n4.7. Artificial intelligence\
    \ in agriculture \nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the study of theories and computer\
    \ systems that \ncan perform activities that need human intelligence, such as\
    \ sensory percep-\ntion and decision-making [41]. AI, particularly in the areas\
    \ of machine learning \n(ML) and deep learning (DL), is seen as one of the primary\
    \ forces driving the \ndigitization of agriculture when combined with CC, IoT,\
    \ and big data. These \ntechnologies have the potential to increase crop production,\
    \ harvesting, pro-\ncessing, and marketing in real time [42]. ML and DL algorithms\
    \ are being used \nto determine various parameters such as weed detection, yield\
    \ prediction, and \ndisease identification in a number of intelligent agricultural\
    \ systems. The fol-\nlowing two sub-sections go through these systems.\n4.7.1.\
    \ Machine learning in agriculture \nsupervised learning (linear regression, regression\
    \ trees, non-linear regres-\nsion, Bayesian linear regression, polynomial regression,\
    \ and support vector \nregression), and unsupervised learning (hierarchal clustering,\
    \ k-means cluster-\ning, neural networks (NN) anomaly detection, principal component\
    \ analysis, \nindependent component analysis, a-priori algorithm, and singular\
    \ value decom-\nposition (SVD)). Weed detection, Crop yield prediction, disease\
    \ and weather \nprediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation ( moisture content,\
    \ type, pH, \ntemperature, etc.), water management, fertilizer amount determination,\
    \ and \nlivestock production and management all use machine learning techniques\
    \ and \nalgorithms [2, 43]. According to the study of these publications, “crop\
    \ yield \nprediction” is an extensively researched area, with the most widely\
    \ utilized ML \napproaches to allow smart farming being linear regression [4],\
    \ neural network \n(NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM)\
    \ [2]. \nThe presented use cases are still in the research phase, and no commercial\
    \ \nuse has been recorded as of yet. Furthermore, AI and machine learning ap-\n\
    proaches are found to be underutilized in greenhouse and indoor vertical farm-\n\
    ing systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are \n\
    only a handful publications that use machine learning techniques. To enable \n\
    digital farming, new methodologies such as federated learning and privacy \npreserving\
    \ methods are being developed in light of the digital transformation’s \ncyber-security\
    \ and data privacy problems [44]. These methods create machine \nlearning models\
    \ from local parameters rather than sharing private data samples, \nreducing security\
    \ concerns.\n4.7.2. Deep learning in agriculture \nDeep learning (DL) is an extension\
    \ of classical machine learning (ML) \nbecause extra “depth” (complexity) is added\
    \ to the model, it can accomplish \n436\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ndifficult tasks (predictions and classification)\
    \ extraordinarily well and quick-\nly. DL’s main benefit is feature learning,\
    \ which includes extracting features \n(high-level information) from big datasets\
    \ automatically [45]. Long short term \nmemory (LSTM) networks, convolutional\
    \ neural networks (CNNs), recurrent \nneural (RNN) networks, generative adversarial\
    \ networks (GANs), radial basis \nfunction networks (RBFNs), multilayer perceptron\
    \ (MLPs), feed-forward ar-\ntificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing maps\
    \ (SOMs), deep belief net-\nworks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),\
    \ and autoencoders are \nexamples of deep learning algorithms Various sites [46]\
    \ provide a full overview \nof these methods, popular architectures, and training\
    \ systems. DL algorithms \nare commonly used in agriculture to solve problems\
    \ related to computer vision \napplications that aim to predict key parameters\
    \ such as crop yields, soil mois-\nture content, weather conditions, and crop\
    \ growth conditions; detect diseases, \npests, and weeds; and identify leaf or\
    \ plant species [47]. Computer vision is an \ninterdisciplinary field that has\
    \ exploded in popularity in recent years thanks to \nthe rise of CNNs. It provides\
    \ methods and techniques for accurately process-\ning digital images and allowing\
    \ computers to analyze and comprehend the vi-\nsual world [48]. CNNs, generally\
    \ is known as Convet and its derivatives, are \nthe most widely used deep learning\
    \ algorithms in agricultural applications. \nRegion-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN,\
    \ Faster-RCNN, YOLO, and Mask-\nRCNN are some of the CNN variants, with the first\
    \ four being the most typi-\ncally used to address object detection issues. On\
    \ the other side, Mask-RCNN \nis utilized to overcome instance segmentation issues.\
    \ The reader can find a \nthorough explanation of these algorithms and their applications\
    \ in the exist-\ning bibliography [47]. Other DL approaches have been employed\
    \ in a few re-\nsearch. When it comes to datasets, the majority of deep learning\
    \ models are \ntrained on photographs, with only a few trained on sensor data\
    \ collected in the \nfield. This demonstrates that DL can be used on a wide range\
    \ of datasets. It’s \nalso worth noting that the majority of the research is focused\
    \ on outdoor farms, \nwith next-generation farms (environment-controlled) receiving\
    \ less attention. \nThough digital farming has the potential to be enabled by\
    \ DL, most systems \nare still in the prototype stage. Furthermore, the additional\
    \ obstacles created \nby cyber-security and privacy concerns necessitate the improvement\
    \ of current \ndeep learning and computer vision technologies.\n4.8. Agricultural\
    \ decision support systems \nA decision support system (DSS) is a smart system\
    \ that assists stakehold-\ners and potential users in making decisions in response\
    \ to specific needs and \nchallenges by offering operational responses based on\
    \ meaningful informa-\n437\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\ntion retrieved from raw data, documents, personal knowledge,\
    \ and/or models \n[49]. Data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven,\
    \ and \nknowledge-driven DSS are all possibilities. The following source [50]\
    \ lists the \nkey features of these DSSs. The volume of farming data has exploded\
    \ as a re-\nsult of the advent of agriculture 4.0. Platforms like agricultural\
    \ decision support \nsystems (ADSS) are necessary to convert this heterogeneous\
    \ data into practical \nknowledge in order to make evidence-based and precise\
    \ judgments about farm \nmanagement and facility layout [51]. ADSSs have gotten\
    \ a lot of interest in the \nagriculture industry over the last few years. A variety\
    \ of agricultural concerns, \nsuch as farm management, water management, and environmental\
    \ management, \nhave been addressed by a number of ADSSs. Most ADSSs have been\
    \ found \nto ignore expert knowledge, which is extremely useful since it enables\
    \ for the \nconstruction of systems that are tailored to the demands of the users.\
    \ Complex \nGUIs, insufficient re-planning components, a lack of prediction and\
    \ forecasting \nabilities, and a lack of ability to adjust to unpredictable and\
    \ dynamic elements \nare some of the other identified faults with some of these\
    \ ADDSs. It’s also worth \nnoting that all of the ADSSs are for outside agriculture\
    \ systems and are still in \ndevelopment. In comparison, the use of ADSS in indoor\
    \ soilless agriculture is \ncurrently underutilized.\n4.9. Agricultural cyber-physical\
    \ systems \nA cyber-physical system (CPS) is an automated distributed system that\
    \ inte-\ngrates physical processes with communication networks and computing infra-\n\
    structures [52], and it is one of the key technologies of Industry 4.0. There\
    \ are \nthree standard CPS reference architecture models: 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA,\
    \ \nwhich may be found in full at the following source [53]. Among these, the\
    \ 5C \nis a well-known and widely used reference model. CPS takes advantage of\
    \ a \nnumber of existing technologies, including agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented\
    \ \nreality, big data, and machine learning (ML) [54]. Scalability, flexibility,\
    \ au-\ntonomy, reliability, resilience, safety, and security are all improved\
    \ as a result \nof its adoption.\nOne of the most difficult domains that can benefit\
    \ from CPS technology is \nagriculture. Agricultural cyber-physical systems (ACPSs)\
    \ combine advanced \nelectronic technology with agricultural infrastructure to\
    \ create integrated farm \nmanagement systems that interact with the physical\
    \ environment to keep crops \ngrowing at their best [55]. ACPSs collect high-accuracy\
    \ data regarding climate, \nsoil, and crops and utilize it to manage watering,\
    \ humidity, and plant health, \namong other things. For the management of various\
    \ services, a range of ACPSs \nhave been created; however, most of these systems\
    \ are still in the prototype and \n438\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nconceptual stages. Furthermore, the majority\
    \ of studies are for outdoor farms, \nwith only a few publications published on\
    \ soil-based greenhouse systems. There \nhas been no research on indoor soilless\
    \ agricultural methods. Since of its pro-\nspective applications in a variety\
    \ of fields, ACPSs have sparked a lot of academ-\nic interest; nevertheless, deploying\
    \ CPS models in real-world applications is \nstill a difficulty because it requires\
    \ the right hardware and software [56]. When \ndesigning ACPSs, special emphasis\
    \ should be paid to autonomy, robustness, and \nresilience in order to deal with\
    \ the unpredictable nature of the environment and \nthe unknown characteristics\
    \ of agricultural facilities. ACPSs are influenced by \na variety of factors,\
    \ including humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data.. ACPSs \nmust be properly\
    \ and extensively developed to provide a seamless operation \nwhile avoiding conflicts,\
    \ errors, and disturbances.\n4.10. Digital twins in agriculture \nA digital twin\
    \ (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical) \nobject that mimics\
    \ its behaviours and states across multiple stages of the ob-\nject’s lifecycle\
    \ by combining real-world data, simulation, and machine learning \nmodels with\
    \ data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning \n[57]. The\
    \ physical and virtual entities, the physical and virtual environments, \nthe\
    \ metrology, and realization modules that perform the physical to virtual and\
    \ \nvirtual to physical connection or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate,\
    \ and \nthe physical and virtual processes are all required for a complete description\
    \ of \nthe DT concept for any physical system [58]. Because of advancements in\
    \ tech-\nnology such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks,\
    \ and \ncloud computing, the DT concept has gained traction. This is due to the\
    \ fact that \nthese technologies enable real-time monitoring of physical twins\
    \ at high spatial \nresolutions using both small devices and distant sensing,\
    \ which generate ev-\ner-increasing data streams [21]. In comparison to other\
    \ fields, the notion of DT \nin agricultural applications is relatively new, with\
    \ the first references appearing \nin 2017; as a result, its added value has not\
    \ yet been thoroughly studied [21]. \nBecause of its reliance on natural circumstances\
    \ (temperature, soil, humidity), \nas well as the presence of living and non-living\
    \ physical twins (plants and an-\nimals), framing is a very complex and dynamic\
    \ realm (indoor farm buildings, \ngrow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural\
    \ machinery). \nNon-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with\
    \ plants and \nanimals (living physical twins), posing more obstacles for DT in\
    \ agriculture, \nwhereas non-living physical twins are the focus of DT in other\
    \ domains such \nas manufacturing. The majority of research has been on open-air\
    \ agricultur-\nal systems. There is just one study that proposes DT for a soil-based\
    \ vertical \n439\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6,\
    \ 2022\nfarming system and one study that implements DT for a soilless vertical\
    \ farm-\ning system (aquaponics). This could be due to the difficulty of designing\
    \ and \nmanaging modern farming systems. Furthermore, the majority of DTs are\
    \ still \nin the research phase, with no commercial deployment planned. Cost savings,\
    \ \ndisaster prevention, clearer decision making, and efficient management oper-\n\
    ations are all reported benefits of DT applications in agriculture, which can\
    \ be \napplied to a variety of agricultural subfields such as plant and animal\
    \ breeding, \naquaponics, vertical farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming.\
    \ While \nDT technology offers a lot of promise, achieving synchronization between\
    \ the \nreal and digital worlds is difficult. Due to the quirks of living physical\
    \ twins, \nthe intricacy of this procedure is magnified in agricultural settings.\
    \ As a result, \nagricultural DT should begin with micro-farms, which can then\
    \ be gradually up-\ngraded to a more intelligent and autonomous form by adding\
    \ more components.\n4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry \n\
    This section outlines a series of interconnected hurdles to a wider adoption of\
    \ \ndigital technologies in agriculture. Following a review of the literature,\
    \ 21 barri-\ners were found, which were divided into technical and socioeconomic\
    \ categories.\n4.12. Technical roadblocks \n•Interoperability: Data is regarded\
    \ as a critical component in the success of \nsmart systems. Agricultural data\
    \ is typically gathered from a variety of sources, \nincluding thousands of individual\
    \ farmlands, animal industries, and business ap-\nplications. Data can be in a\
    \ variety of formats, making data integration difficult. \nAs a result, after\
    \ systematic data collection, storage, processing, and knowledge \nmining, data\
    \ interoperability is critical to increasing the value of this widely \ndistributed\
    \ data [59]. Interconnected and interoperable devices are also required \nfor\
    \ successful communication between heterogeneous devices. The system’s in-\nteroperability\
    \ can be improved through cross-technology communication [60].\n•Standardization:\
    \ Standardization of devices is required to fully use digital \ntechnologies for\
    \ smart farming applications. Differences in output can occur \nas a result of\
    \ misinterpretation and changes over time. Device, application, and \nsystem interoperability\
    \ concerns can also be overcome by standardization [25].\n•Data quality: Data\
    \ quality, as well as data security, storage, and openness, \nare essential for\
    \ producing meaningful outcomes. Another impediment to the \nadoption of smart\
    \ farming technologies is the lack of decentralized data man-\nagement systems\
    \ [9]. Multiple actors’ willingness to exchange farm data is be-\ning harmed as\
    \ a result of this problem.\n•Hardware implementation: It is incredibly difficult\
    \ to establish a smart agri-\ncultural setup in large-scale open areas. This is\
    \ due to the fact that all hardware, \n440\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences\
    \ and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nincluding IoT devices, wireless sensor networks,\
    \ sensor nodes, machinery, and \nequipment, is directly exposed to harsh environmental\
    \ conditions such as heavy \nrainfall, extreme temperatures, extreme humidity,\
    \ high wind speeds, and a vari-\nety of other dangers that can destroy electronic\
    \ circuits or disrupt their normal \nfunctionality [61]. A possible answer is\
    \ to construct a sturdy and lasting casing \nfor all of the expensive devices\
    \ that can withstand real-world conditions [62].\n•Adequate power sources: Typically,\
    \ wireless gadgets used on farms func-\ntion for an extended period of time and\
    \ have a limited battery life. \nBecause replacing a battery in the event of a\
    \ failure is difficult, especially in \nopen-air farms where devices are strategically\
    \ located with limited access [61], a \nproper energy-saving system is required.\
    \ Low-power sensors and proper commu-\nnication management are two viable strategies\
    \ for reducing energy consumption \n[24, 63]. Other intriguing technologies to\
    \ eliminate the need for battery renewal by \nrecharging batteries using electromagnetic\
    \ waves include wireless power transfer \nand self-supporting wireless systems.\
    \ In most agricultural applications, however, \nlong-distance wireless charging\
    \ is required [9]. Another potential alternative is to \ncapture ambient energy\
    \ from rivers, fluid flow, vehicle movement, and the ground \nsurface using sensor\
    \ nodes; however the converted electrical energy is current-\nly restricted, necessitating\
    \ the need to enhance power conversion efficiency [64].\n•Reliability: The dependability\
    \ of devices, as well as the software applica-\ntions that run on them, is critical.\
    \ This is due to the fact that IoT devices must \ncollect and transmit data from\
    \ which judgments are made utilizing a variety of \nsoftware packages. Unreliable\
    \ sensing, processing, and transmission can result \nin erroneous monitoring data\
    \ reports, significant delays, and even data loss, all \nof which can have a negative\
    \ impact on agricultural system performance [25].\n •Adaptability: Agriculture\
    \ is a complicated, dynamic, and continuously \nchanging environment. As a result,\
    \ when building a system, it is critical for de-\nvices and applications to react\
    \ proactively with other entities in the face of un-\nknown and dynamic elements\
    \ in order to provide the required performance [65].\n•Robust wireless architectures:\
    \ Low-cost, wide-area coverage, enough net-\nworking flexibility, and high scalability\
    \ are all advantages of wireless networks \nand communication technologies. However,\
    \ in a dynamic agriculture environ-\nment, such as temperature swings, the movement\
    \ of live objects, and the ex-\nistence of impediments, dependable wireless connection\
    \ is a major difficulty. \nFor example, multipath propagation effects cause signal\
    \ strength oscillations, \nresulting in unstable connectivity and insufficient\
    \ data transmission [66]. These \nelements have an impact on the agricultural\
    \ system’s performance. As a result, \nrobust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures\
    \ with proper sensor node place-\n441\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\nment, antenna height, network topology, and communication\
    \ protocols are re-\nquired, as well as low-maintenance wireless systems [11].\n\
    •Interference: Because of the extensive deployment of IoT devices and wire-\n\
    less sensor networks, another difficulty is wireless interference and quality\
    \ of \nservice degradation. Effective channel scheduling between heterogeneous\
    \ sens-\ning devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and upcoming networking prim-\n\
    itives like concurrent transmission [67] can all help to solve these problems.\
    \ \nBecause agriculture equipment are dispersed in indoor greenhouses, outdoor\
    \ \nfarmlands, underground locations, and even aquatic areas, cross-media com-\n\
    munication between underground, underwater, and air is also necessary for full\
    \ \nintegration of smart technologies [68].\n•Security and privacy: Because smart\
    \ agricultural systems are dispersed, \nthey are vulnerable to cyber-attacks such\
    \ as eavesdropping, data integrity, de-\nnial-of-service assaults, and other sorts\
    \ of disruptions that could jeopardize the \nsystem’s privacy, integrity, and\
    \ availability [69]. With various privacy-preserv-\ning techniques and federated\
    \ learning approaches, cyber-security is a funda-\nmental concern that needs to\
    \ be addressed in the context of smart farming [44].\n•Compatibility: in order\
    \ to meet the fragmentation and scalability standards, \nthe models or software\
    \ applications developed must be adaptable and able to \nrun on any equipment\
    \ in the agricultural system [13]. \n•Resource optimization: To boost farm profitability,\
    \ farmers need a resource op-\ntimization procedure to determine the ideal number\
    \ of IoT devices and gateways, \ncloud storage size, and volume of transmitted\
    \ data. Resource optimization is diffi-\ncult since farms vary in size and require\
    \ different types of sensors to assess different \nvariables [70]. Second, most\
    \ farm management systems do not support run-time \nchanges to match the demands\
    \ of individual farmers. To estimate adequate resource \nallocation, complicated\
    \ mathematical models and algorithms are necessary [32].\n•Scalability: Due to\
    \ technological improvements, the number of gadgets, \ngear, and sensors put on\
    \ farms is continually expanding. \nGateways, network applications, and back-end\
    \ databases should all be de-\npendable and scalable in order to serve these entities\
    \ [71].\n•Human-centered user interfaces: Existing agricultural software and gadgets\
    \ \nhave complicated user interfaces, which are limiting smart farming methods.\
    \ \nThe majority of graphical user interfaces are constructed in such a way that\
    \ \nonly specialists can use them to accomplish agricultural activities. By making\
    \ \nthe user interface more human-centered and providing multimodal feedback,\
    \ a \nbigger group of individuals will be able to use it to complete various agricul-\n\
    tural tasks [35].\n442\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol.\
    \ 14, №6, 2022\n4.13. Socio-economic roadblocks \n•Gap between farmers and researchers:\
    \ Farmers’ engagement is critical to \nthe success of the agriculture industry’s\
    \ digitization. Agricultural specialists are \nfrequently unaware of the concerns\
    \ that farmers encounter during the agri-food \nproduction process, which smart\
    \ technologies could solve [16]. Furthermore, it \nis critical to completely comprehend\
    \ the nature of problems in order to create \nan appropriate smart solution. \n\
    As a result, bridging the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, \n\
    and AI researchers is critical.\n•Expenses connected with smart systems: the costs\
    \ associated with adopt-\ning smart technology and systems are a major impediment\
    \ to the agriculture \nsector’s digitization. These expenses typically include\
    \ deployment, operation, \nand maintenance. Smart system deployment costs are\
    \ typically significant since \nthey include: I hardware installation, such as\
    \ autonomous robots and drones, \nWSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure,\
    \ and ii) paying trained labour \nto do particular agricultural tasks [72]. Similarly,\
    \ subscriptions to centralized \nnetworks and software packages are necessary\
    \ to support data processing, con-\ntrol of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge\
    \ exchange, which eventually \nraises operating expenses [73]. Even if service\
    \ providers occasionally provide \nfree subscription packages with limited capabilities,\
    \ storage capacity is limited. \nPeriodic maintenance is essential to ensure the\
    \ proper operation of the smart \nsystem, which adds to the total costs.\nEnvironmental,\
    \ ethical, and societal costs may also be connected with the \nadoption of smart\
    \ devices. Initiatives focusing on cooperative farming are need-\ned to overcome\
    \ cost-related roadblocks by providing: I support services for \nbetter cost management\
    \ and needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to \ntransform conventional\
    \ equipment into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce \nhigh initial costs [73].\n\
    •Digital division: a lack of awareness of digital technology and their appli-\n\
    cations is another problem limiting the digitalization of the agriculture sector.\
    \ \nThe majority of farmers have no understanding what digital technologies are,\
    \ \nhow to install and utilize them, or which technology is appropriate for their\
    \ farm \nand matches their needs [14]. As a result, farmers must be educated on\
    \ current \nfarming technologies and processes. \nFurthermore, various tactics\
    \ are required to develop tools that use natural \nlanguage and are easily understood\
    \ by farmers with low levels of education [74]. \n•Return on investment: In agriculture,\
    \ like in other industries, the profit \nmargin is critical. When it comes to\
    \ implementing modern technologies, farm-\n443\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences\
    \ and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\ners are concerned about the time it will\
    \ take to recoup their investment and the \ndifficulty in assessing the benefits\
    \ [12].\n•Building faith in the effectiveness of smart technology in agriculture\
    \ is \ndifficult, unlike in other disciplines, because many decisions influence\
    \ systems \nthat involve both living and non-living elements, and the results\
    \ can be difficult \nto reverse [16]. In addition, the lack of verification of\
    \ the influence of digital \ntools on farm productivity exacerbates the current\
    \ difficulties.\n•Legal frameworks: different regions and nations have distinct\
    \ legal frame-\nworks that influence the deployment of digital technologies in\
    \ agriculture, par-\nticularly in monitoring and agri-food supply [31]. Similarly,\
    \ laws governing \nresource allocation (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy,\
    \ and security \ndiffer from country to country [31].\n•Connectivity infrastructure:\
    \ In most developing nations, connectivity in-\nfrastructure is poor, limiting\
    \ access to advanced digital technologies that could \nhelp turn data from disparate\
    \ sources into useful and actionable insights [10].\n4.14. Discussion \nThe goal\
    \ of this study was to describe the new digital technologies that are \nbeing\
    \ used in the agricultural industry in order to predict the future trajectories\
    \ \nof agriculture 4.0. Big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-phys-\n\
    ical systems, and digital twins are among the technologies that have yet to be\
    \ \nfully explored in agriculture. This disparity could be due to the fact that\
    \ install-\ning advanced technologies with more complex processes can be costly,\
    \ at least \nin the early stages of their acceptance. The agricultural industry’s\
    \ development \nof these technologies is expected to speed up in the next years.\
    \ The findings of \nSLR also reveal that IoT is widely used in farms. This is\
    \ owing to the IoT’s di-\nverse capabilities, which include monitoring, tracking,\
    \ and tracing, agricultural \nmachinery, and precision agriculture [21]. One of\
    \ the key research aims within \nthe farm 4.0 techniques can be regarded to be\
    \ IoT. Nonetheless, when building \nan intelligent agricultural system, only a\
    \ few researches have examined data \nsecurity and dependability, scalability,\
    \ and interoperability. The outcomes of \nthe study also revealed that the majority\
    \ of use cases are still in the prototype \nstage. The reason for this could be\
    \ that most agricultural activities involve live \nsubjects, such as animals and\
    \ plants, or perishable products, and establish-\ning systems for living subjects\
    \ is more difficult than developing systems for \nnon-living human-made systems.\
    \ Another explanation could be that, due to the \ntrans-disciplinary character\
    \ of agriculture, it is a late adopter of technology. As a \nresult, in order\
    \ to construct intelligent systems, the agricultural community must \nbecome conversant\
    \ with all digital technologies. Finally, differences in plant/\n444\nSiberian\
    \ Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ncrop species and\
    \ growth conditions complicate agricultural system digitaliza-\ntion [55]. In\
    \ contrast to indoor farms, the majority of the technologies created \nby SLR\
    \ are for open-air soil-based farms (soilless and soil-based). This is owing \n\
    to the complicated design and maintenance of indoor farms, particularly soilless\
    \ \nfarms, where the parameters and elements to be maintained are numerous (pH,\
    \ \nair temperature, humidity, etc.) [5]. However, by incorporating digital technol-\n\
    ogy and data-driven computer applications into indoor farms, a more reliable \n\
    control of the process can be attained. Furthermore, SLR reveals that insufficient\
    \ \nresearch is undertaken in three of the nine service areas described in section\
    \ 3 \n(soil management, fruit detection and counting, and crop quality management).\
    \ \nThis supports the notion that significant research and development is required\
    \ \nin some areas to ensure the successful digitization of the agriculture business\
    \ \nin both developed and developing countries. The agriculture ecosystem’s com-\n\
    plexity creates a set of interrelated hurdles that prevent full integration of\
    \ digital \ntechnology for agriculture 4.0 implementation. As a result, identifying\
    \ possible \nbottlenecks is critical in order to devise strategic strategies to\
    \ overcome them. \nThis research aims to figure out what these stumbling barriers\
    \ are. Following \nthe investigation, 21 barriers were found and characterized\
    \ on both a technical \nand socioeconomic level. These impediments are addressed\
    \ in section 5, which \noutlines what needs to be done on a bigger scale to digitize\
    \ the agricultural \neconomy. However, it is still unknown how much removing or\
    \ mitigating these \nhurdles aids in the successful integration of digital technologies.\
    \ \n4.16. Added value of agricultural digitization \nSeveral benefits that can\
    \ inspire framers and other actors to assist agriculture \nindustry digitization\
    \ have been discovered and outlined based on analysis. The \nbenefits described\
    \ here have the potential to increase farm productivity and im-\nprove product\
    \ quality, but they should not be viewed as a cure for the problems \nthat come\
    \ with smart agriculture [73]. \n•Improved agility: Farm operations can now be\
    \ more agile thanks to digital \ntechnologies. Farmers and agricultural professionals\
    \ can quickly respond to \nany anticipated changes in environmental and water\
    \ conditions using real-time \nsurveillance and forecasting technologies to save\
    \ crops [72].\n•Green process: By lowering the use of in-field fuel, nitrogen\
    \ fertilizers, \npesticides, and herbicides, digital technologies make farming\
    \ more ecologically \nfriendly and climate-resilient [75].\n•Resource efficiency:\
    \ By increasing the quantity and quality of agricultural \noutput while reducing\
    \ the use of water, energy, fertilizers, and pesticides, digital \nplatforms can\
    \ improve resource efficiency [3]. \n445\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n•Time and cost savings: By automating various\
    \ tasks such as harvesting, sow-\ning, or irrigation, managing the application\
    \ of fertilizers or pesticides, and sched-\nuling irrigation, digital technologies\
    \ provide significant time and cost savings [76].\n•Asset management: digital\
    \ technologies enable real-time observation of \nfarm holdings and equipment,\
    \ allowing for theft prevention, component re-\nplacement, and routine maintenance\
    \ [10].\n•Product safety: By eliminating fraud [17, 18] linked to adulteration,\
    \ coun-\nterfeiting, and artificial enhancement, digital technologies maintain\
    \ appropriate \nfarm output and ensure a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food\
    \ products [69].\n4.17. Considerations and future prospects \nThe agricultural\
    \ industry would see major benefits as a result of the planned \nmeasures. However,\
    \ the impediments identified in section 5 must be solved first \nin order to make\
    \ things sustainable for small and medium-scale growers. Some \nof the above hurdles\
    \ can be mitigated by awareness campaigns emphasizing the \nimportance of smart\
    \ agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and \nencouraging\
    \ novel techniques (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders \nto take\
    \ an active role in the digital transformation [9]. Initiatives at the federal\
    \ \nlevel, grants and endowments, public-private collaborations, data transparency,\
    \ \nand regional research efforts can all help overcome potential hurdles. Finally,\
    \ \nwhen constructing a smart agriculture system, a roadmap can be used, starting\
    \ \nwith a basic architecture with few components and simpler functionality and\
    \ \ngradually adding components and functionality to develop a sophisticated sys-\n\
    tem with full digitization potential [21]. These issues can pave the road for\
    \ ag-\nriculture 4.0’s successful adoption. The use of explainable artificial\
    \ intelligence \nto monitor crop development, estimate crop biomass, evaluate\
    \ crop health, and \ncontrol pests and diseases is one of the future prospects\
    \ of digital technologies \nin smart agriculture. Explainable AI eliminates the\
    \ old black-box approach of \nmachine learning and allows for a better understanding\
    \ of the reasoning behind \nany given decision [15]. The use of common semantics\
    \ and ontologies to de-\nscribe big data, as well as the adoption of open standards,\
    \ has the potential to \naccelerate research and development in the field of smart\
    \ farming. Similarly, \n5G technology must be thoroughly investigated in order\
    \ to enable improved \nconnectivity and live streaming of crop data [6]. By executing\
    \ precise crop in-\nspections remotely, 5G technology will reduce internet costs\
    \ and enhance the \nentire user experience of farm management and food safety\
    \ [77]. It would also \nhelp to close the gap between stakeholders by keeping\
    \ them informed about \ncrop availability. Finally, blockchain can be used in\
    \ conjunction with IoT and \nother technologies to address data privacy and security\
    \ concerns [78]. \n446\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol.\
    \ 14, №6, 2022\n4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 \nThe agriculture sector has\
    \ traditionally had a breakthrough during industri-\nal revolutions. Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 offers significant potential to offset rising food \ndemands and prepare\
    \ for the future by reinforcing agricultural systems with \nWSN, IoT, AI, and\
    \ other technologies, as formally mentioned in preceding \nsections. While agricultural\
    \ 4.0 is still being implemented, agriculture 5.0 is \nalready being discussed.\
    \ \nAgriculture 5.0 builds on agriculture 4.0 by incorporating industry 5.0 prin-\n\
    ciples to provide healthy, affordable food while also ensuring that the environ-\n\
    ments on which life depends are not degraded [79]. Industry 4.0 focuses less \n\
    on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability and more on dig-\n\
    italization and AI-driven technologies for increasing efficiency and flexibility,\
    \ \nthe European Commission formally called for the Fifth Industrial Revolution\
    \ \n(industry 5.0) in 2021 [80]. Industry 5.0 adds to and expands on the industry\
    \ 4.0 \nconcepts by emphasizing human-centricity, sustainability, and resiliency\
    \ [81]. \nIt entails improving human-machine collaboration, decreasing environmental\
    \ \neffect through the circular economy, and designing systems with a high degree\
    \ \nof robustness to reach an ideal balance of efficiency and productivity. Among\
    \ \nthe enabling technologies of industry are cobots (collaborative robots), smart\
    \ \nmaterials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient\
    \ \nand secure data management, renewable energy sources, and others 5.0[80].\n\
    Farm production efficiency and crop quality can be improved in agriculture \n\
    5.0 settings by delegating repetitive and boring activities to machines and those\
    \ \nthat need critical thinking to humans. For this reason, agricultural cyber\
    \ physical \ncognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment and conduct\
    \ ap-\npropriate actions, comparable to those established for the manufacturing\
    \ sector, \nshould be developed. This might include collaborative farm robots\
    \ that work in \nthe fields to aid crop growers with time-consuming operations\
    \ like seed sowing \nand harvesting. Similarly, digital twins in agriculture 5.0\
    \ can add substantial value \nby recognizing technical difficulties in agricultural\
    \ systems and resolving them \nmore quickly, detecting crop illnesses, and producing\
    \ more accurate crop output \nestimates. This demonstrates that agriculture 5.0\
    \ has the potential to pave the way \nfor climate-smart, sustainable, and resilient\
    \ agriculture, but it is still in its infancy. \n5. Conclusions \nConcerns about\
    \ global food security have heightened the demand for \nnext-generation industrial\
    \ farms and agricultural intensive production systems. \nDigital technologies,\
    \ such as those given by the Industry 4.0 programme, are at \n447\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nthe vanguard of this modern\
    \ agricultural period, providing a wide range of in-\nnovative solutions. Disruptive\
    \ technologies are being integrated into traditional \nagriculture systems by\
    \ scientists and researchers in order to boost crop yields, \ncut costs, reduce\
    \ waste, and sustain process inputs. This report includes an SLR \nthat discusses\
    \ the current state of various technologies in the agriculture sector. \nSeveral\
    \ findings are drawn, including the fact that big data and analytics inte-\ngration,\
    \ wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins in \nagriculture\
    \ are still in their infancy, with the majority of use cases still in the \nprototype\
    \ stage. Similarly, 21 technological and socioeconomic impediments \nare found\
    \ and categorized. These impediments must be identified and addressed \nif the\
    \ agriculture industry is to be digitalized. The report also identifies and \n\
    presents the additional value of digital technology in the agriculture industry.\
    \ \nOverall, this research contributes to the ongoing research on agricultural\
    \ 4.0. \nThe review’s principal restriction is twofold: first, only three online\
    \ reposito-\nries (Scopus, IEEE, and Science Direct) are considered for literature\
    \ searches, \nand second, new keywords and synonyms may return more papers. The\
    \ main \nconclusions are highly unlikely to alter in either scenario. Additional\
    \ research \ndatabases and areas can be considered for future study in order to\
    \ provide a \ncomplete overview of the agriculture industry in terms of digitization.\
    \ In addi-\ntion, papers focusing on agriculture 5.0 in general will be featured.\n\

    Abstract From last decade, Big data analytics and machine learning is a hotspot
    research area in the domain of agriculture. Agriculture analytics is a data intensive
    multidisciplinary problem. Big data analytics becomes a key technology to perform
    analysis of voluminous data. Irrigation water management is a challenging task
    for sustainable agriculture. It depends on various parameters related to climate,
    soil and weather conditions. For accurate estimation of requirement of water for
    a crop a strong modeling is required. This paper aims to review the application
    of big data based decision support system framework for sustainable water irrigation
    management using intelligent learning approaches. We examined how such developments
    can be leveraged to design and implement the next generation of data, models,
    analytics and decision support tools for agriculture irrigation water system.
    Moreover, water irrigation management need to rapidly adapt state-of-the-art using
    big data technologies and ICT information technologies with the focus of developing
    application based on analytical modeling approach. This study introduces the area
    of research, including a irrigation water management in smart agriculture, the
    crop water model requirement, and the methods of irrigation scheduling, decision

    Article Open access 11 January 2024 1 Introduction WATER-Every drop is precious,
    save it. Water is the main limiting factor of agricultural development in semi-arid
    and arid climates. It is a critical input for enhancing agricultural productivity.
    Arthur Keith said that the advancement of agriculture is the first major step
    for civilized life [1]. Even after six decades of planned development, agriculture
    has played an important role in the Indian economy. However, the agriculture sector
    of India has been transformed via the effective deployment of Information and
    Communication Technologies (ICTs) in traditional to modern practices which provide
    various services (such as- IoT agriculture, smart water management, soil management,
    plant diseases, crop management, geo-spatial image and livestock monitoring).
    In India, the demand of water for the agriculture and industry sectors is continuously
    increasing to fulfill the needs of 1.366 billion people. Central Indian Punjab
    is well-known for its agricultural activities and has occupied a high percentage
    of the land area all over India, and its agricultural production mainly depends
    on irrigation. Punjab has 97.95% highest gross irrigation of the total cropped
    area [2]. Recently, the achievement of the Green Revolution is endangered by a
    significant decline in water resources. As a result, water conservation and precision
    agriculture are becoming vital issues in tropical climate areas. Wheat and Maize
    are the most commonly cultivated crops and have high water consumption in Punjab,
    India. The major challenge in agriculture sustainability and dawdling is due to
    climate change; therefore, every drop of freshwater needs to be utilize effectively
    and efficiently. To overcome these challenges, the multivariate, complex, and
    unpredictable agricultural ecosystems must be well understood by continuously
    analyzing, measuring, and monitoring several physical aspects and phenomena [3].
    New technologies and knowledge can help in this complex decision-making. The fundamental
    idea is that the DSS should serve as a farm management tool, supporting farm managers
    in making decisions on irrigation, whether to irrigate and, if so, which field
    with how much water. Wani et al. [4] presented a thorough investigation to evaluate
    the possibility of using Machine Learning models to identify plant diseases. In
    the early twentieth century, irrigation is the most crucial practice no doubt
    and needs effective utilization. Farmers required to predict the need of water
    for the crops, to confirm the data provided by agricultural weather stations or
    to get insight the free water surface evaporation in lakes or dams. Agricultural
    irrigation scheduling is becoming a very important managerial activity whose ultimate
    purpose is to achieve effective and efficient utilization of water. The primary
    objective of good irrigation scheduling is to apply the right amount of water
    at right time. Irrigation scheduling improves the water use efficiency and focus
    on evapotranspiration (ET) estimation methods for understanding of spatial variations
    of ET. It determine irrigation applications such as identifying the water balance
    component, integrated various sensing technologies into irrigation scheduling
    models and control, new improved sensor technology and integrated water quality
    constraints into irrigation scheduling and control [5]. Figure 1 presents the
    six identified relevant works, indicating the smart water management related research
    work such as crop water modeling, soil monitoring, water quality, drones field
    monitoring, weather forecasting, and irrigation scheduling. Fig. 1 Smart water
    management in smart agriculture Full size image The ultimate irrigation potential
    of India has been estimated to be 139.5 million ha, comprising 58.5 million ha
    from major and medium schemes, 15 million ha from minor irrigation schemes, 66
    million ha from groundwater exploitation, and an estimated 77 million ha beyond
    2025 from freshwater use for irrigation [6]. It is approximated that after gaining
    the full potential of the irrigation, nearly 50% of the total cultivated area
    will hold out rain-fed. Irrigation is the most important factor for escalating
    the agricultural production of plants. It is essential to determine the quantity
    of water to get the optimal benefits from the irrigation, which depends on some
    factors such as the environment, type of crop, subsurface geo-hydrological condition,
    and the stage of its growth. The questions arise in the irrigation scheduling
    are as follows: (i) How to apply irrigation water?, (ii) How much to irrigate?,
    (iii) When to irrigate. Currently, irrigation decision-making systems are enforced
    to the agricultural field aiming for specific crop at a given area [7]. It is
    difficult to be practiced to different crops and areas. Under the growing environment,
    the amount of irrigation is defined as the depth of water required to meet the
    crop water loss through evapotranspiration. It can be obtained via prediction
    using indirect channels or field measurement techniques. However, the amount and
    timing of water have major impact on quality of crop and its yield. Several methods
    are applied for the irrigation scheduling such as pan evaporation, soil moisture
    basis, leaf water potential, and based on growth-stages. The demand of water can
    be fulfill by full or partial irrigation in all methods. 1.1 Motivation As technology
    rapidly spread in a few decades, precision agriculture is the key to fostering
    a new revolution in Irrigation scheduling. The United Nations statistical data
    indicate that agriculture consumes 70% of the overall use of water worldwide,
    compared with 20% for industry and 10% for domestic use [8]. To ensure the proper
    use of water supplies in irrigation we need more effective technologies. Automatic
    irrigation scheduling techniques replaced manual irrigation which was based upon
    crop water estimation. The crop evapotranspiration can be determined by weather
    parameters such as max–min temperature, humidity, wind speed, solar radiations,
    and even the crop factors such as the stage of growth, crop height, and the soil
    properties for the development of irrigation scheduling. The machine learning
    and deep learning advanced technologies provide direction and motivation to propose
    a novel application on crop water modeling. The influence of several factors on
    crop yields and temperature, precipitation have been found to have maximum influence
    on the yields of different crops [9]. 2 Reference Evapotranspiration ET “Evapotranspiration
    contains two processes, evaporation in which water is lost from the soil and plant
    surface, and transpiration from plant surfaces to the atmosphere” [10]. The water
    irrigation is enforced to match the needs of evapotranspiration of crop. Therefore,
    the irrigation scheduling needs to estimate the daily crop evapotranspiration
    accurately. Evapotranspiration of crops differs significantly over the growing
    season mainly due to alterations in climatic conditions and crop cover. It also
    varies among the crops. The information about crop water demand (i.e., ET) is
    a crucial practical consideration in the planning, developing, and working of
    water and irrigation management systems. Figure 2 presented the concept of ET
    . Table 1 presented the ET that affecting by weather element. The reference evapotranspiration
    is approximated from meteorological data (humidity, temperature, wind run/wind
    speed, sunshine hours/solar radiation) by using the Penman-Monteith equation.
    However, the adjusted pan evaporation measurements are also used. Fig. 2 Reference
    evapotranspiration (ET ) process Full size image 2.1 Factors Affecting ET Climate
    and weather play crucial role in determining long-term and day-to-day activities
    in the agriculture. The demand of crop water is determined largely by weather
    variables. Rainfall is the foremost weather variable that affects the water resources
    development planning, irrigation planning and agricultural cropping. The main
    climatic/weather components crucial for agriculture are rainfall, maximum/minimum
    temperature, solar radiation, sunshine duration, humidity, photo-period or sunshine
    hour, wind speed, and night temperature [11] as depicted in Fig. 3. Table 2 shows
    the different empirical methods with weather parameters for estimation of ET .
    Weather elements controls the crop water demand and crop ET. The ET depends upon
    the different weather elements such as humidity, temperature, sunshine hour, solar
    radiation, wind speed, etc. It is also affected by rainfall. The weather elements
    affect ET as follows: Table 1 Weather affecting parameters Full size table Fig.
    3 Factors affecting evapotranspiration Full size image 2.2 FAO ET Estimation Method
    There are various mathematical models used to calculate the reference evapotranspiration
    (ET ). The updated procedures for calculating the ET were introduced by FAO. The
    Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) recommends the method for calculating
    the ET are as follows: Although, the method FAO-56 Penman–Monteith (Allen et al.
    1998) [10] is the most dominant as compared to others empirical methods [20, 21].
    But, it requires several climatic data factors [22]. The FAO-56 Penman-Monteith
    (FAO-PM56) [10] has been broadly used to analyze ET from meteorological factors
    and it is suggested as the standard technique by the Food and Agriculture Organization
    of the United Nations (FAO) [23] and calculated by Eq. (1). (1) where, ET is the
    reference evapotranspiration ;  = slope of saturation vapor pressure function
    (kPa °C ); R = net radiation (MJ ); = psychometric constant (kPa °C−1); G = soil
    heat flux density (MJ ); W = average 24-h wind speed at 2 m height ; T = mean
    air temperature (°C); e = actual vapour pressure(kPa); e = saturation vapour pressure(kPa);
    and (e ) = vapour pressure deficit (kPa). However, ET can be determined accurately
    by this method, large scale meteorological data requirement at specific spatio-temporal
    scales (vapor pressure deficit, wind speed, minimum and maximum air temperatures,
    and solar radiation) are quite often not available in many developing countries
    [24]. Thus, the alternate models are needed to estimate ET when the available
    data are either insufficient or limited. So, it is important to explore a simpler
    model to calculate ET using fewer weather properties and a reasonable precision.
    The need of crop water depends on some factors: crop growth/stages, crop type
    and the climate are given in detail [25]: Table 2 ET estimation empirical methods
    Full size table 3 Crop Evapotranspiration ET “The crop evapotranspiration denoted
    as ET ,is the crop water requirements or crop water need.” Fig. 4 Various crop-growth
    developement stages Full size image The need for crop water is the depth (or quantify
    of water required to cope with the loss of water through evapotranspiration. In
    other words, water needs to be cultivated optimally by different crops. Crop-growth
    models were developed to improve the understanding of crop dynamics and to predict
    crop growth and production under various agronomic conditions [35]. The continuous
    monitoring of the soil status water, the conditions of crop growth, and its spatial
    and temporal patterns will help in irrigation and precision water planning. Evaporation
    and transpiration variations in the field and grass crops can be integrated into
    dual crop coefficient or single crop coefficient (K ): a soil evaporation coefficient
    (K ) and a basal crop (K ) and calculated by Eq. (2). (2) 3.1 Climate Based ET
    The combination of two different processes by which water evaporates from the
    soil surface and transpiration from the plant is referred as evapotranspiration.
    It is determined by climatic factors including solar radiation, temperature, wind,
    and humidity as well as environmental factors. The evaporation account for approximately
    10% of the overall evapotranspiration and the transpiration of crops constitutes
    the remaining 90%. Hence, there is a need for crop water in hot, dry, windy, and
    sunny areas. For the lowest values when the wind is cold, humid, and cloudy, with
    little to no wind. Climate impact on crop water requirements is determined by
    reference crop evapotranspiration ET and generally expressed per unit of time
    in millimeters., e.g. mm/day, mm/month, or mm/season. 3.1.1 Crop Type The effect
    of the crop type in daily crop water requirements is often referred to as a fully
    grown crop; Plant height has reached maximum; Plants cover the ground optimally;
    probably they began to flowering or developing to set grain; The water demand
    is greatest when the crop is fully cultivated. Their water needs are called the
    “peak period”. The type of crop that has also affected the total growing duration
    of crop development is known by seasonal crop water need and can be obtained.
    The best possible local data can be obtained on the duration of the total seasons
    of the various plants cultivated in a region. Such data can be collected from,
    for example, the seed supplier, the Extension Service, the Irrigation Department,
    or the Ministry of Agriculture. Fig. 5 Irrigation methods Full size image 3.1.2
    Growth Stages of the Crop While planting and in the initial stage, evaporation
    is more essential than transpiration. When the crop is fully developed, the need
    for crop water is estimated to be 50% during the mid-season phase. At the stage
    of development, the crop demand moderately increases from 50% of the maximum crop
    water requirement to the maximum crop water. Thus, the maximum amount of crop
    water is extended to the end of crop development stage, which is the starting
    of mid-season stage. The value of K depends on different factors such as canopy
    cover density, agriculture operations, weather variable, type of crop, soil moisture,
    and growth stage [10]. The idea of crop coefficient K is proposed by Jensen [36]
    and has been improved by many researchers [37, 38]. However, K method has the
    capability to determine the actual crop evapotranspiration ET precisely. According
    to the FAO methodology, the four growing stages of a crop are the initial stage,
    crop development stage, mid-season stage, and end-season stage (Allen et al. 1998)
    [10]. The crop coefficient method can be expressed as follows: The two-step crop
    coefficient K reference evapotranspiration has been a successful method to predict
    the evapotranspiration (ET) and crop water requirements. The total growing period
    is divided into 4 growth stages shown in Fig. 4 [39]: The initial stage the period
    ranges from transplanting or sowing till crop covers the 10% of ground. The crop
    development stage the period begins at the completion of the initial stage and
    remains until the full ground has been covered (ground cover 70–80%). It does
    not certainly mean that the crop is at its maximum height. The mid-season stage
    the period begins at the completion of the crop development stage and remains
    till maturity; it consists grain-setting and flowering. The late-season stage
    the period starts at the completion of mid-season stage and remains until the
    last day of the harvest; it consists ripening. (3) where ET represents the requirement
    of crop water (mm d ), ET the reference crop water requirement (mm d ), and K
    the crop coefficient and calculated by Eq. (3). Besides, Kingra et al. (2004)
    computed crop water requirement for Wheat and transplanted Rice at Ludhiana, reported
    that the Wheat crop used about 315 mm water whereas the rice crop used about 780
    mm water during its growing season [40]. Saggi et al. [41] collected the K values
    as case study from Punjab agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana and estimated
    the ET for two crops. The K values of Wheat crop were 0.4, 1.15 & 0.4 while for
    Wheat were 0.5, 1.36, 1.42, and 0.42 for the initial, mid and last stage of growth
    respectively. The length of time (days) for four seasons of Wheat were 29, 55,
    14 32 days while for Wheat 24, 46, 35, 42 days. The K values of Maize crop were
    0.7, 0.85, 1.15 & 1.05 for the initial, mid, and end-stage of growth respectively.
    The length of time (days) for four seasons of Maize were 35, 18, 17, and 15 days
    used in different stages. Detail of selected crops and period of data for the
    study. 4 Irrigation Scheduling In 1996, Howell explored the effects on water use
    and irrigation scheduling [42]. It is an application mechanism that can lead to
    the effective and efficient use of water. This efficiency can be enhanced by using
    advanced methods of irrigation. However, even in advanced irrigation methods,
    irrigation scheduling at the farm level is required. It is necessary when rainfall
    is deficient to remunerate for the water lost by evapotranspiration. The irrigation
    water need is described as the crop water requirement minus the fruitful rainfall.
    It is defined in mm/month or mm/day. The main goal of good irrigation scheduling
    is to apply the correct amount of water at the right time, and make sure that
    water is accessible when the crop requires it. According to predetermined schedules,
    the irrigation water is supplied to the cultivation by keep track of the following
    [43]: The status of soil water; The need of crop water. Fig. 6 Types of irrigation
    scheduling Full size image The purpose of our research work is to present, analyze,
    and optimize some measure of performance of the crop production under a set of
    specified conditions, such as the limited or unlimited total volume of water for
    the growing season. The main factors that influence the solution and implementation
    of the irrigation scheduling problem are the characteristics of climate soil,
    crop, irrigation water, and irrigation technology. Judicious usage of water for
    crop production needs knowledge of water quality, soil, weather, crop, and drainage
    situation. The increase in efficiency of pumping systems and conveyance need to
    review. The soil types and climatic conditions have a considerable effect on the
    major practical aspects of irrigation such as how much amount of water should
    be supplied and when to a selected crop. A time-consuming and complex process
    is a precise estimation of the irrigation schedule [25]. However, the advent of
    advanced technology has made it simpler and the water supply can be scheduled
    precisely to meet the water requirements of cultivation. The timing for irrigation
    applications can be fixed dates or on flexible dates. The quantity should not
    exceed the crop requirements per application, including the leaching of salts;
    otherwise, any excess water would not only reduce the efficiency of its usage
    but can hinder the crop development. Standard irrigation schedule performance
    metrics are crop yields and net benefits per unit area. The optimal irrigation
    schedule is any schedule that optimizes the adopted output measurement while meeting
    several defined constraints. Any schedule that optimizes the adopted measure of
    performance while satisfying some specified constraints is the optimal irrigation
    schedule. 4.1 Methods of Irrigation Scheduling Different techniques can be apply
    to the plants with irrigation water and each approach has its benefits and limitations.
    In this context, the best approach to accommodate local conditions should be taken
    into account. Earlier, the primary irrigation method is applied via the source
    of supply such as a bucket watering or a well. Although, it is a time-consuming
    method. More advanced water application methods are used in larger areas where
    irrigation is needed. The suitability of several irrigation methods, i.e. sprinkler,
    surface, or drip irrigation, depends on the following aspects: Natural conditions,
    type of crop, type of technology, previous experience with irrigation, required
    labor inputs and costs and benefits. Surface irrigation may be categorized based
    on mode of water application as depicted in Fig. 5. [44] and Fig. 6 shown the
    different types of irrigation methods. Table 3 presented the different types of
    irrigation methods, advantages and their applications. 4.1.1 Border Irrigation
    Surface irrigation is where the water is applied to the surface of field by gravity
    flow. The water is applied into small channels (furrows) or complete surface is
    flooded with water (basin irrigation) or strips of land (borders). Border irrigation
    is a modern method of surface irrigation. Borders are uniformly graded strips
    of land and long, set apart by earth bunds. They are also known as border strips.
    There are several ways to fed the irrigation water to the border such as by using
    small gates, launching the channel bank, using spiles or siphons. A sheet of water
    is guided by the earth bunds and flows down the slope of the border. It is mostly
    suited to generate long uninterrupted field lengths for facility of machine operations
    in the huge mechanized farms. Borders can be up to 3-30m wide and at least 800m
    in length depend on several factors. It is less applicable to farms on small-scale
    consisting animal-powered cultivation techniques or hand labor. 4.1.2 Sprinkler
    Irrigation It is equivalent to natural rainfall, where water is pumped using a
    pipe system and then rotating sprinkler heads used to spray onto the crops. Further,
    the spray is applied into the air via sprinklers to breaks it into small drops
    of water that fall on the ground. The sprinklers, pump supply system, and operating
    conditions must be developed to apply the water uniformly. It is well suited for
    the most field, row, and tree crops. Water can be sprayed under or over the crop
    canopy. Although, large sprinklers are not suggested for delicate crops such as
    lettuce due to the large size water drops generated by the sprinklers can harm
    the crops. Table 3 Different types of irrigation systems Full size table 4.1.3
    Drip Irrigation It involves application of dripping water to the soil from a small
    diameter plastic pipe systems attached with outlets called emitters or drippers
    at very low rates (2–20 l/h). It is also called as trickle irrigation. Water is
    applied very close to plants so that only part of the soil in which the roots
    grow is wetted, instead of sprinkler and surface irrigation, which consists wetting
    the complete soil profile [25]. It is well suited for trees, vine crops and row
    crops (vegetables, soft fruit), where one or more emitters can be given for each
    plant. It is considered for high-value crops only due to high capital costs required
    for installation of a drip system. 4.1.4 Need of Irrigation Scheduling Hydrological,
    climatologist, and agronomical processes play an significant part in the development
    of irrigation agriculture production. These studies were mainly developed to estimate
    daily, weekly, or monthly evapotranspiration. The precise approximation of evapotranspiration
    is an important process that plays a key role in crop planning, deployment and
    production of irrigation systems. In recent years, several approaches have been
    developed to overcome the problems and obstacles that occur with smart farming,
    such as species recognition, yield prediction, disease detection, drought, crop
    productivity problems and irrigation management. So, there is a great need to
    explore more research studies to enhance the scalability of irrigation scheduling
    based on advanced data analytic and machine learning. Some research has been done
    in the decision support system to improve the right decision on agriculture data.
    5 Decision Support System The idea of a decision support system (DSS) for irrigation
    water management is introduced in the 1970’s to assist users in complex decision-
    making processes and efficient use of irrigation water at the farm level [53].
    Decision support system (DSS) has great potential in agriculture era, if the water
    irrigation management research is combined with the modeling approach using machine
    learning analytics and agriculture statistical, the research level will be achieved
    in different levels of the agricultural development sector. The decision support
    system for crop water irrigation scheduling based on crop water model by estimation
    of evapotranspiration as weather parameter, historical dataset, and using of different
    Irrigation water management methods. The decision support system is an integrated
    approach to solve complex problems, combining the computer calculation and data
    storage capacities with human language and perception, support of mathematical
    model statistics, providing decision-maker. It is known as a primary tool in management
    for better decision making and environmental resources. In 1985, Guariso et al.
    firstly introduced the concept of DSS. Various researchers surveyed the advanced
    use of the management of DSS for water resources [54]. Today, it is required for
    the on-farm irrigation water management due to its use of the computer to relate
    soil, crop, and water quality conditions. It can be used for analyzing and determining
    how much water is needed and when it should give next time. 5.1 Statistics The
    statistical approach leads to the process of collection, presentation, analyze,
    and apply the data to make decisions, problems solving, design products, and processes.
    It is very useful for us to explore the description and understand the variability.
    Statistical methods contributed for making scientific judgments in the face of
    variation uncertainty. Russo et al. (2015) Bayesian method is used to estimate
    the hydrological properties and irrigation needs for an under-constrained mass
    balance model. They presented an approach Markov chain Montecarlo algorithm to
    solve for spreading of values for each unknown parameter in a conceptual mass
    balance model [55]. 5.2 Machine Learning From the last decade, machine learning
    and data analytics is a hot-spot research area in the domain of agriculture. Among
    the other definitions, machine learning is described as the scientific are that
    allows the machines to learn without being strictly programmed [56]. Machine learning
    models have demonstrated excellent results for crop-based modeling in recent days.
    There is a variety of machine learning models based on prediction for reference
    crop evapotranspiration. The main contribution of our research prediction, by
    applying machine-learning and data analytics based modeling to predict crop evapotranspiration.
    Fig. 7 Big data based machine learning framework for agriculture application Full
    size image Yamaç and Todorovic [57], revealed the satisfactory outputs of ML with
    R2 ranged from 0.81 to 0.97 [58] by applying several ML models on the climatic
    data. A comparative analysis was performed by Shiri et al. [59] to estimate the
    ET using various intelligent models, namely ANN, ANFIS, support vector machine
    (SVM), and GEP. In the domain of agriculture, big data analytic technologies have
    offered newly predictive models for ET estimation, e.g. generalized neuro-fuzzy
    models [60], artificial neural network (ANN), [61], adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference
    system [62], multi-layer Perceptrons neural network (MLPNN), Zaji and Bonakdari
    [63], extreme learning machine (ELM) Abdullah et al. [64], multivariate adaptive
    regression splines (MARS) and least square support vector regression (LSSVM) [65],
    GRNN (2016), ELM, WNN and GANN [66]. Moreover, the Auto-ML technique is found
    to show excellence in application of irrigation scheduling where border irrigation
    and sprinkler irrigation methods are deployed. 5.3 Deep Learning The deep learning
    technique is now practical to address millions or even billions of weights among
    neurons for better understanding of behaviors due to current advances in computational
    power, in terms of software, hardware and parallel processing. It is accepted
    to have established a revolutionary era since it can address the issues that have
    countered AI for a long time. Deep feed-forward neural networks are based on multi-layer
    Perceptrons (MLPs) published by Alexey Ivakhnenko and Lapa in 1965 [67]. It can
    be used to model the complicated relationship between input and output due of
    its high hierarchical structure model training, construction and feature learning
    [68]. It has been used in the hydrological and agricultural fields because of
    the difficulty of software data availability, costs, and complexity, e.g., approximation
    and modeling of crop evapotranspiration [42], Wang et al. (2018) determined that
    traditional ML and DL models are equivalent as a data-driven artificial intelligence
    method that can be used to model the complicated relationship between input and
    output [68]. However, DL has a benefit over traditional ML, due to wits high hierarchical
    structure model. 5.4 Big Data Analytics Big Data is a fascinating new field at
    the joint of advanced analytics, data science, statistics, and machine learning.
    Big data and analytics have tremendous development benefits in the agriculture
    economy. Advanced big data analytics have improved the tools and technologies
    that changed the way of real-time applications to make better decision processing,
    high-performance platform to efficiently analyze, capturing, storing and managing
    large scale of big data. In addition, agriculture practices are becoming increasingly
    data-derived and data-enabled with the recent development of 5G, artificial intelligence,
    Internet of Things and big data technologies [69]. To obtain insights from these
    data Saggi et al. [70] investigated the state-of-the-art framework for decision-making
    and different methods of integrating big data analytical methods with smart applications
    such as smart agriculture, healthcare, and cyber security. Figure 7 presented
    the framework of big data analytics and machine learning analytics for agriculture
    application as follows: Data sources The domain of data is expressed by variety
    of descriptive terms such as:-structured, unstructured, machine and sensor generated

    article types and publication title Full size image The objective of this study
    is to introduced the several advanced analytic techniques to develop a flexible
    system that would lead to better irrigation decisions (allocation, application,
    and optimization). This study is expected to provide a decision tool that will
    assist irrigators and water managers in determining reference evapotranspiration
    (ET ), crop water requirement (CWR), irrigation water requirement (IWR), and irrigation
    scheduling for more effective water allocation and application. 6 Literature of
    Irrigation Scheduling Agriculture is the world’s biggest water user, that consume
    70% of fresh water in average. However, these percentages will go as high as 95
    percent in few developed nations and Punjab is one of India’s largest contributors
    to the central grain pool. In India, ground-water (GW) is an essential source
    of water supply in agriculture and Rice-Wheat cropping system has resulted in
    significant increase in irrigation water need approximately 73% with GW in Punjab.
    India is a seventh largest subcontinent country by geographical area in South
    Asia, nowadays India ranks 2nd worldwide in farm production and 1st largest country
    in irrigated land area. Water conservation and precision agriculture is becoming
    a vital issue in the tropical climate areas. Central Indian Punjab is a well-known
    for its agriculture activities and occupied high percentage of land area in all
    over India. 6.1 A Bibliometric Perspective of Irrigation Scheduling In this section,
    the articles from Science direct digital database is considered. Figure 8 shows
    the number of papers published from 1995 to 2021 in field of irrigation scheduling,
    reference evapotranspiration and crop evapotranspiration. We have selected only
    elsevier science direct library to find out research articles, where we found
    34,083 results in area of irrigation scheduling, 32,775 papers in reference evapotranspiration
    and 14,261 results articles in crop evapotranspiration (crop water need). Irrigation
    scheduling, ET and ET trends are represented by Green, Blue, and Yellow colored
    lines respectively. Figure 8 shows the article type in which review reports, case
    reports, data articles, mini review, and many more articles. Figure 8 shows the
    number of top-journal publications. Several computer simulation techniques and
    decision support systems have been developed to estimate ET , ET and Crop Water
    Requirement (CWR). It is important to identify changes in the hydrological cycle
    when we want to predict the impacts of climate change. However, current studies
    on climate change must be expanded to cover the entire globe. The two main components
    of the global water cycle are evaporation and precipitation. Methods for measuring
    evapotranspiration from meteorological data include a number of climatology, and
    the physical inputs which is directly estimated in weather stations. Other parameters
    are associated with measured data and can be obtained by directly or empirical
    methods. Meteorological data can be expressed in several units. 6.2 Estimation
    and Forecasting of Evapotranspiration ET The application of Evapotranspiration
    (ET ) in irrigation scheduling is divided into different categories for literature
    section such as statistical, machine learning, evolutionary models, and decision
    support system [42, 71, 72]. We have presented a comprehensive review literature
    for reference evapotranspiration as follows: Fig. 9 Process of DSS for crop water
    irrigation scheduling Full size image Figure 9 presented the process of DSS for
    crop water irrigation scheduling. ET is an imperative aspect of the hydrological
    cycle that is stirring water availability on the earth surface. It is one of the
    significant criteria of accurate quantification of crop water requirement that
    influence various hydrological processes, planing of water management and resources
    [62], and requirement of irrigation [73]. Traditionally, the ET is estimated at
    the field scale, but it consumes lot of time and is difficult to process by complex
    mathematical calculations with various climatic variables. Methods for measuring
    evapotranspiration from meteorological data include a number of climatology, and
    the field inputs which is directly estimated in weather stations. Some parameters
    are associated with measured data, where as others can be obtained directly or
    through empirical methods. 6.2.1 Existing Methods Based on Empirical Since many
    years, various researchers have established reference evapotranspiration ET estimation
    with empirical methods. There are few categories of ET estimation methods: Temperature-based,
    Radiation-based, Empirical, Pan, and many more. Commonly, FAO-56 Penman-Monteith
    method is applied as the scientific, standard and temperature based method to
    estimate the ET [10, 74]. FAO-PM has been extensively adopted because to its positive
    outcomes in a variety of climates across the world. However, it needs a significant
    amount of meteorological data obtained from regular meteorological observation
    stations [75]. To overcome the existing limitation of the FAO-PM model, various
    attempts aiming to estimate ET with limited observed data have been made. A large
    number of studies have focused on estimating ET using empirical methods with limited
    ground-level data such as the Hargreaves and Samani equation, Priestley-Taylor
    equation, and Thornthwaite equation have been used for estimating (ET ) by Tomas-Burguera
    et al. [76]. ET is estimated with simplified or empirical methods (e.g. Lysimetric
    measurements) and it is highly difficult to achieve more precise and robust approaches
    [77, 78]. HS equation is the most simple and accurate approach based on temperature
    [10, 31]. There are many empirical approaches to predict the ET using five mass
    transfer-based models (Ivanov, WMO, Penman, Trabert, and Mahringer), five radiation-based
    approach (Tu, PT, Ab, JH, and Mk), and five temperature-based approach (HS, modified
    Hargreaves-Samani ) (Th, BC, MHS , and MHS ) [79]. Table 4 shows the literature
    of empirical methods for estimation of ET . Table 4 Estimation of evapotranspiration
    ET with empirical methods Full size table Malamos et al. [80] investigated the
    monthly Geo-spatial ET with FAO Penman–Monteith using line, polygon, and point
    through a geometry independent algorithm. They selected various climate parameters
    such as T , u , R , latitude , altitude (m), I . Tegos et al. [81] applied the
    radiation based model to calculate the daily potential evapotranspiration ET with
    FAO-56 Penman–Monteith using T , u , R ,and I parameters. The Potential ET is
    estimated for current and future drought condition using PDSI tool, Spatial, and
    Temperature based models such as Penman–Monteith, Thornthwaite, and Hamon methods.
    They have selected T , u , R , I input variable, and analyzed on MATLAB GUI [82].
    Yang et al. [83] analyses the daily reference evapotranspiration (ET ) using short-term
    forecasting with FAO-56 Penman–Monteith equation, Hargreaves–Samani equation,
    and Reduced-set Penman–Monteith (RPM). The R language is used to simulate with
    various climate parameters including T , T , T , u , RH , I , and Vapor pressure
    (ea). 6.2.2 Existing Methods Based on Machine Learning There have been many studies
    on hybrid models with machine learning, and evolutionary algorithms to estimation
    of ET with few climate parameters around the world. Patil and Deka [85] investigated
    the performance of extreme machine learning (ELM) to quantify the weekly ET in
    the Thar Desert of India. Also, they have showed the comparison of Artificial
    Neural Network (ANN) with three input variable. The ELM model gives slightly higher
    accuracy than empirical, and ANN models. Wu et al. [86] proposed hybrid model
    using machine learning and soft-computing to estimate the monthly ET in south
    China with 26 data stations. The proposed (Kmeans-FFA-KELM) approach developed
    with the three approaches (K-means clustering, Firefly Algorithms, and Kernel
    Extreme Learning Machine model) found higher accuracy using three input variables
    (Temperature , Temperature , and R ). Another study showed performance of six
    remote-sensing based ML models to predict the daily ET in the Andalusian. The
    two ELM and MLP models found higher accuracy than RF, SVM, GRNN, and XGBoost models
    [87]. Stacking and blending ensemble based ML models are used to calculate the
    daily ET with limited input variables. Two-layer ensemble model is build with
    RF, SVR, MLP, LR and KNN models and found higher accuracy in terms of R ranged
    from (0.66 to 0.99) as compared to empirical models [88]. Another, ensemble based
    model is build with ANN, SVM and RF to estimate the ET with geno-types and optimize
    the ET with time series data, and found the correct results [89]. Bai et al. [90]
    proposed ensemble-based four ML models with RF, BMA, KNN, SVM and MLP to calculate
    the ET . The MLP-based ensemble model provides the efficient results. However,
    the ML and DL based models are proposed to estimate a urban ET with Flux Footprint,
    Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) data. The RF model provides
    slightly better result in terms of R of (0.840) and RMSE of (0.0239 mm) than CNN
    model [91]. Adnan et al. [92] demonstrated the capability of different Neuro-Fuzzy
    methods to estimate the pan evaporation monthly using climatic inputs of different
    parameters obtained from Uttarakhand, (India). Recently, Adnan et al. [93] demonstrated
    the capability of dynamic evolving Neural-Fuzzy Inference System (DENFIS) and
    Least-Square Support Vector Regression with a Gravitational Search Algorithm (LSSVR-GSA)
    for estimating ET . It has been shown that the extraterrestrial radiation or temperature-based
    LSSVR-GSA models are superior to DENFIS model for estimating monthly ET . They
    [94] forecasted the monthly and daily stream flows of poorly gauged mountainous
    watershed with Fuzzy Genetic Algorithm (FGA), Least Square Support Vector Machine
    (LSSVM), and M5 model tree (M5T) models. Heddam et al. [95] estimated and compared
    daily reference evapotranspiration (ET ) using the Online Sequential Extreme Learning
    Machine (OSELM) and Optimally Pruned Extreme Learning Machine (OPELM) in the Mediterranean
    region of Algeria. The OPELM models showed good performances as compared to OSELM
    models. Recently, Tikhamarine et al. [96] combined the Support Vector Regression
    and Grey Wolf Optimizer (SVR-GWO) to predict the monthly ET at Annaba, Algiers,
    and Tlemcen stations in North Algeria. Moreover, the proposed model is compared
    with the existing variants of SVR and showed that the performance of the SVR-GWO
    gives occasionally competitive and very promising results. Maroufpoorb et al.
    [34] proposed the concept of hybrid Artificial Neural Network-Gray Wolf Optimization
    (ANN-GWO) model and predicted the ET for Iran. Further, the proposed model showed
    more efficient and accurate results as compared to ANN and LS-SVR. Mohammadi and
    Mehdizadeh [97] proposed a hybrid of two models Support Vector Regression and
    Whale Optimization Algorithm to predict the daily reference evapotranspiration
    at three stations in Iran. It has been shown that hybrid models outperformed the
    support vector regressions models. Kisi [65] obtained weather dataset from Turkish
    Meteorological Organization (TMO) for 2 stations from 1982 to 2006 and applied
    MARS, LSSVR, and M5-Tree to estimate ET . Valipour et al. [79] collected data
    for the period of (1961–2010) with 50 climate parameters from 18 regions of Iran
    to estimate monthly ET using five models namely (mass transfer, radiation and
    temperature based). Mattar [98] obtained 32 weather stations of data from United
    Nations Food & Agriculture Organization (UN-FAO) known as CLIMWAT for (2013 to
    2015) and presented gene expression programming (GEP) and empirical models to
    estimate ET . Table 5 Estimation of evapotranspiration ET based on ML and EA Full
    size table Tao [99] presented the hybrid intelligent ET model using data of three
    meteorological stations during 1998 to 2012. They used the Adaptive Neuron Fuzzy
    Inference System (ANFIS), Firefly Optimization Algorithm with ANFIS (ANFIS-FA)
    and Penman–Monteith models. Co-active Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (CANFIS) model
    is proposed for modeling the monthly evaporation of Lake Nasser, Egypt [110].
    The Gene Expression Programming (GEP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Classification
    and Regression Tree (CART), the Cascade Correlation Neural Network (CCNNs), and
    are proposed for estimating evaporation by Yaseen et al. [100]. Falamarzi et al.
    [101] estimated the daily ET for water resources with ANN and WNN models from
    the period of 2009 to 2012. They have applied RMSE, APE, N.S., R metrics to check
    the model accuracy with three input parameters such as T , T , and u . Models
    LS-SVM, MARS, and M5 models have been applied to estimate the Pan evaporation
    for Reservoir and water resources management. They have applied four input variable,
    T , R , u , and R with dataset of period 1986 to 2006 [102]. Another, ANN model
    is applied to forecast the ET for application of real-time irrigation scheduling
    with T , R , u , and R input parameters using dataset of (2011 to 2012) [103].
    Yassin et al. [73] analyzed the performance of ANN, and GEP models to quantify
    the ET with various climate parameters using dataset from 1980 to 2010. The GeneXpro
    Tools 5.0, and Propagation version 2.2.4 were used to developed the model and
    also provide the accuracy on the basis of these metrics MAE, RMSE, R , and OI.
    Gocic et al. [71] forecasted the ET using SVM, FFA, DWT, ANN, and GEP models with
    climate parameters for the period of 1980 to 2010. Goyal et al. [104] explored
    the four ML models namely ANN, LS-SVR, FL, ANFIS, and Gamma Test to estimate the
    pan evaporation for the duration of 2000 to 2010. They have found the efficient
    results with the FG and LS-SVR models using various climate parameters on MATLAB
    platform. However, Chen et al. [105] found the best performance of Bayesian Model
    Averaging Model to estimate the terrestrial ET using KGE and Cubist software.
    Mehdizadeh et al. [106] proposed the hybrid model to estimate the monthly ET with
    GEP, SVM-Poly, SVM-RBF, and MARS models for duration of 1951 to 2010. The performance
    of the applied models is compared with the empirical methods, where the MARS and
    SVM-RBF models give the most accurate results. The hybrid ELM model revealed a
    superior performance to estimate the daily ET at the four major countries of (US,
    Germany, Belgium, and Sweden) using 9 years of dataset [72]. Mohammadi et al.
    [97] proposed an approach that couples Support Vector Regression with Whale Optimization
    (SVM-WO) to estimate the daily ET .The T , T , RH , u , R , and SSD parameters
    are used to build the model and found accurate result with SVM-WO model. The recent
    estimation of reference evapotranspiration based on machine learning modeling,
    e.g. H2O-Deep Learning,Distributed Random Forest,Gradient Boosting Machine and
    Generalized Linear Model [107], Ensemble Extreme Machine Learning, Multi-layer
    Perceptrons-Neural Network, Support Vector Machine [108], Quantum Matrix Product
    State [111], CNN-LSTM and Conv-LSTM used for combine the features and modeling
    of ET [109], Deep learning versus gradient boosting used for predicting the pan
    evaporation [112], In the domain of agriculture, ML offered new predictive models
    for ET estimation, e.g. Generalized Neuro-Fuzzy Models (GNFM) [60], ANN model
    [61], ANFIS model [62], MLP-NN [63] [113], ELM algorithm [64] [90], M5 Model Tree
    [113], LS-SVR , MARS, ELM, WNN and GANN [66]. The DL model and ML model are applied
    in various domains such the COVID-19 analysis [114], proposed a novel method based
    on artificial intelligence (AI) to identify COVID-19 disease [115], developed
    genetically optimized Deep Neural Network [116], Tripathy et al. [117] investigated
    the performance of MARPUF approach and it is found to be better resistant to such
    modelling attacks, image classification using deep learning [118], Artificial
    Intelligence approaches used to classifying various types of cancer [119], enhanced
    the grip functionality of myoelectric hands based on deep learning [120], and
    classifiers for on-line handwriting recognition based on SVM and KNN algorithms
    [121], and a survey for software fault prediction [122]. Singh et al. [123] presented
    the efficient results and reliable algorithm for optimal design of water distribution
    networks.The literature summary of ML and EA are given in Table 5. 7 Estimation
    of Crop Evapotranspiration (ET ) Crop evapotranspiration (ET ) one the most essential
    element of the hydrological system for irrigation scheduling. The crop coefficient
    K method multiplied with (ET ) is most widely-used to determine the (ET ) Eq.
    (3). Different estimations and methods having their own advantages and disadvantages
    are available. For the estimation of ET using Machine Learning, Deep Learning
    and Evolutionary Algorithms, some potential literature work are presented in this
    section. The literature analysis of crop evapotranspiration methods is presented
    in Table 6. 7.1 Existing Methods Based on Statistics The need of precise estimation
    of crop water is an crucial aspect of agricultural planning and there exists several
    methods for determining ET in crop land [124]. The significant field based estimations
    are required, appropriate for monitoring the crop-water status at the land-scale
    level [125, 126]. The FAO-Penman, PM, and 1963 Penman applied to forecasting the
    ET for rice crop using meteorological data by Shah and Edling (2000). They have
    found the crop coefficients for initial, middle and late stage as 1.39, 1.51,
    and 1.43 [127]. The derivation and development of crop K were identified for Castor
    and Maize crops of Rajendranganagar by Reddy et al. [128]. Ko et al. [129] conducted
    study to estimate the crop water requirement for Cotton and Wheat crops at Uvalde,
    TX, USA. Fang and Ping (2013) presented an optimal the uncertainty approaches
    of interval regression analysis and crop water production function for irrigation
    and Penman-Monteith method used to obtain ET . LINGO software introduced to solve
    above model [57]. 7.2 Machine Learning and Evolutionary Models The Back-propagation
    Neural Network (BP-NN) model is proposed to evaluate the crop evapotranspiration
    ET with combination of various climate parameters (T , T , RH , S , RF and crop
    coefficient K ). It is observed that the combination of Eddy Covariance method
    and BP model achieved the best accuracy in terms of R (0.87) and accuracy (91.44%)
    than MLR model [130]. Mehta et al. [131] estimated the ET , ET and K of Wheat
    and Maize crops of Gujarat using climate data. They applied the various temperature
    and radiation based empirical methods to calculate and estimate the crop water
    requirement. It is observed that the accurate value of K for Wheat crop is more
    efficient as compared to FAO-56 Penman–Monteith method results. Whereas in case
    of maize crop the outcomes were found less accurate at Surat and higher outcomes
    as compared to FAO method at Bharuch station. Saggi et al. [41] proposed a novel
    multi-layer ensemble model based on fuzzy-genetic and regularization random forest
    (FG-RRF) for predicting the K and ET of Ludhiana station. They found that the
    models had high performance for modeling K and ET . Table 6 Estimation of ET based
    on empirical, ML and EA Full size table Elbeltagi et al. [132] presented the deep
    learning model to estimate the Wheat ET from 1970-2017 and forecasting the future
    changes from 2022-2035 of Nile Delta in Egypt using Visual Gene Developer technology.
    For calibration R of 0.95, 0.96, 0.97 and for testing R of 0.94, 0.95, 0.95 have
    been found efficient result respectively. Russo et al. [55] presented the MCMC
    and Bayesian algorithms to analysis the irrigation requirements for ground water
    mass balance with soil tensiometer of Rice crop. They have optimized the management
    decisions on crop replacement and increased the irrigation efficiency. The NN
    model and regression model are explored to estimate a greenhouse tomato crop yield,
    its growth, and efficiency in use of water with CropAssist and NeuralWare platforms
    [133]. Maurya et al. [134] developed a novel fuzzy-based energy-efficient routing
    protocol based on automated irrigation system for Maize crop on MATLAB platform.
    The FIS-DSS (Flexible Irrigation Scheduling Decision Support System) is proposed
    to analyze the optimal allocation of water resources of irrigation system. Fuzzy-inference
    and knowledge based user-friendly optimization tool is developed for Wheat and
    corn crops [135]. Chauhan et al. [136] proposed a web-based DSS to enhance irrigation
    water management for peanut crop on APSIM platform. Gavilán et al. [137] measured
    the daily greenhouse crop evapotranspiration for strawberry and found more accuracy
    using empirical methods and sensors based on soil moisture. Tabari et al. [138]
    explored a ANFIS and SVM model performance for Potato crop evapotranspiration
    ET using meteorological data. Yamaç et al. [139] applied the four scenarios based
    on features subset to accurately estimate the ET of Potato crop using ANN, ABM
    and KNN models. Further, ANN and SVM models are also applied to estimate the garlic
    ET by Abyaneh et al. [140] and the outcomes are found accurate as compared to
    lysimeter performance. The need of precise estimation of crop water is an crucial
    aspect of agricultural planning and there exists several methods for determining
    ET in crop land [124]. The field based estimations are required and appropriate
    for monitoring the crop-water status at the land-scale level [125] [126]. The
    FAO-Penman and Penman methods are applied to forecast the ET for rice crop using
    meteorological data [127]. They have found the crop coefficients for initial,
    middle and late stage as 1.39, 1.51, and 1.43. The derivation and development
    of crop K are identified for Castor and Maize crops of Rajendranganagar by Reddy
    et al. [128]. Ko et al. [129] conducted a analyses report to evaluate the crop
    water requirement for Cotton, and Wheat crops at Uvalde, TX, USA. Fang and Ping
    [57] presented an optimal solution to estimate the ET using interval regression
    analysis, crop water production function and Penman-Monteith method with LINGO
    software. Numerous experiments have been conducted in recent decades to investigate
    the possible effect of climate change on evapotranspiration ET . For efficient
    crop evapotranspiration ET modeling using VIP (Vegetation Interface Processes)
    for Wheat and Maize [141], durum Wheat in Tunisia [142], APSIM-Maize model [143],
    SEBAL model for yield, WUE, IWUE and HUE for Wheat crop [144], weighing lysimeter
    for K and ET [145], farm-level operational services in smart agriculture [146],
    crop water model based on Crop2ML framework [147] have been used. The ET estimation
    results proved that the ML and EA approaches performed better than existing classical
    methods. However, several studies have investigated the estimation of ET with
    empirical methods. But limited studies have reported the estimation of ET using
    ML, and EA models as shown in Table 6. 8 Decision Support System for Irrigation
    Scheduling This section considers the Decision support system (DSS) based on research
    that have included ET , ET , and irrigation requirement. An irrigation management
    system can offer farmers with appropriate decision-making tools in order to regulate
    the amount of water supplied to crops. A decision support system PETP V2.0.0 is
    developed to analysis and estimate the potential evapotranspiration ET using various
    empirical approaches namely Hargreaves, Jensen-Haise, Penman-Monteith, Priestley-Taylor,
    etc. Visual Studio 2010 software is used to build the computational tool to estimate
    the accurate results for water requirement of crop [148]. Navarro et al. [149]
    developed smart irrigation DSS for managing the irrigation scheduling. They purposed
    2 ML techniques i.e. PLSR and ANFIS. Maximum and minimum relative humidity, temperature,
    and direction of wind, global radiation, vapour pressure deficit, rainfall, dew
    point are the variables used to predict the daily ET with FAO Penman–Monteith
    method. Zizhong and Zenghui [150] presented a single irrigation system that enhanced
    higher corn production and also provided efficiency in use of water in Northeast
    China. They include climate parameters namely average, max and min of air temperatures,
    max and min of relative humidity, wind speed, and sunshine hours from 1980 to
    2012. Penman–Monteith approach is used to determine the soil evaporation and ET
    . Table 7 Estimation of evapotranspiration ET , ET , and Irrigation with DSS systems
    Full size table The knowledge of the irrigation management has an impact on crop
    water requirements, maintaining water balance and is the practical considerations
    to enhance productivity of crop [157]. Various research work in Punjab have demonstrated
    the requirements of crop water irrigation, irrigation water based on ET and pan
    evaporation, [158], but few studies have focused on Soil Water Deficit (SWD) [159].
    Paraskevopoulos and Singels [151] investigated the integrated content of soil
    water recordings of real-time field into the MyCanesim system to estimate its
    use in 15 sugarcane fields of South Africa for supporting irrigation system. It
    is used to determine the decision making for irrigation scheduling based on the
    status of forecasts of crop, soil water, and the next irrigation date. Ying et
    al. [152] represented the evaluation for summer Wheat and winter Maize cropping
    system for optimal irrigation scheduling. Further, they described topical versions
    of the SWAP and Wofost models for crop growing simulation and obtaining efficiency
    in use of water. Afzal et al. [160] improved water resources management using
    different irrigation strategies and water qualities by field, and modeling study.
    To deficit irrigation PRD and RDI methods are used to estimate the effects of
    waste and fresh water on salinity distribution, soil moisture, and crop yield
    of Potato, Maize in Italy, Bologna through field experiments. The fuzzy, evolutionary,
    and machine learning models are used to develop a DSS model for irrigation scheduling.
    Gaiqiang et al. [135] developed a FIS-DSS software based on knowledge, interface
    for user, and an inference engine for wheat, corn and cotton crops. It is a fuzzy
    interval programming model having multiple objectives and constraints, flexibility
    of model, data processing, and an alternative solving algorithm. The main objective
    is to maximize the economic-based benefits for crop-land in China. The NN model
    is used to train the model with precipitation and historical climate parameters.
    Giusti and Marsili-Libelli [153] developed a fuzzy-DSS to schedule the daily irrigation
    need of crop based on soil moisture as a predictive model and an inference model
    as irrigation decision maker. This model determines the actual need of water for
    kiwi, corn, and potato crops with past irrigation soil moisture, climatic parameters,
    and ET . They used meteorological data including temperature, solar radiation,
    wind, rain, etc. The objective of FDSS model is to reduce the water usage and
    provide the efficient result in terms of saving water up-to 13.55, 18.3, and 72.95
    water units for irrigating three crops respectively. Sahoo et al. [161] proposed
    fuzzy multi objective linear programming approach for planing of land-water-crop
    system. The meteorological data like daily rainfall, evaporation, temperature,
    solar radiation, daily sunshine hours, humidity, wind velocity, and albedo are
    collected from the Central Rice Research Institute, Cuttack. The objective function
    is to optimize, maximized crop production, net return, and to minimize the labor
    requirement for various vegetables and pulses. Reddy and Kumar [162] demonstrated
    a multi-objective method for the optimal crop pattern and multi-crop irrigation
    reservoir scheme by several procedures. Adeyemo and Otieno [163] explored a method
    to solve the multi objective crop planning model by an evolutionary algorithm.
    They have found excellent results in minimizing total water irrigation, maximizing
    the yield productivity, and net income from farming. Irrigation water management
    is numerically intensive for computations and provides model interpretation and
    discretization. Neural networks and evolutionary algorithms demonstrated to estimate
    the irrigation volume and also determined the effectiveness to diminish irrigation
    application and maximize production [164]. Ortega Álvarez et al. [154] proposed
    a non-linear model to recognize yield schemes and water irrigation management
    plannings using the genetic algorithms. Further, they estimated crop yield, gross
    margin and production as a function of irrigation depth. Schmitz et al. [165]
    simulated 92 percent greater production for corn using evolutionary algorithm
    as compared to dynamic programming. Application and web based DSS models are developed
    for the irrigation water scheduling by various researchers. Recently, a web-based
    DSS is proposed to estimate the soil-water balance for irrigation system with
    limited input parameters such as (dual crop-coefficient and meteorological). The
    irrigation parameters are computed through soil moisture and requirement of water.
    A web-based irrigation decision support system is introduced with limited inputs
    (WIDSSLI) for summer corn and winter Wheat irrigation management in North China
    Plain (NCP) [155]. Table 7 presents the estimation of ET , ET , and irrigation
    with DSS systems. Antonopoulou et al. [166] presented an appropriate decision
    support system for crops which is implemented on web-based software. They introduced
    this approach by using the Java and PHP technologies for specific irrigation technique
    and soil improvement instructions. Dutta et al. [167] developed a mobile application
    based on sustainable irrigation DSS. They proposed cloud sensors based approach
    to evaluate the ground water usage and availability of water. This approach includes
    the CSIRO sensor based cloud computing organization and integrated big data that
    includes machine learning technologies. Bonfante et al. [168] proposed an irrigation
    water supply management tool to obtain the maximum yield of Maize with W-tens,
    IRRISAT, and W-Mod approaches. W-Mod and IRRISAT models found more accurate results
    as compared to W-Tens in terms of irrigation water use efficiency. A Climate-Smart
    Decision-Support System (CSDSS) tool is proposed to evaluate the requirement of
    rice crop in Malaysia. They determine a daily crop-water balance based on input
    data (2010 to 2099) and (1976 to 2005) from Global climate models (GCM) and integrate
    with evapotranspiration using MATLAB simulator [156]. Ragab et al. [169] proposed
    a SALTMED model which includes the to partial root drying or deficit irrigation,
    subsurface irrigation, soil nitrogen fertilizer application, fertigation, dry
    matter production, plant nitrogen uptake, and nitrate leaching. For the model
    calibration and endorsement the statistical measurements are used such as R2 coefficient,
    RMSE, and percentage error. The DIDAS software package for irrigation system decision-making
    strategies of drip irrigation systems is developed [46]. A DSS framework have
    been introduced which includes 22 ET estimation approaches using user-friendly
    GUI (Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0) of 133 selected stations of India [170]. Potential-ET
    and FAO56-PM ET are used to estimate the ET in the Geisenheim Irrigation Scheduling
    (GS) for vegetable crops using sprinkler irrigation [171]. Ballesteros et al.
    [103] estimated the ET using FORETO software with Hargreaves Samani (HS) equation
    or the Penman Monteith (PM) and Artificial neural networks (ANNs) models. Modern
    platforms (.NET and Java) software applied to calculate the daily/monthly ET using
    meteorological parameters [172]. There are various crop simulation based models
    exists such as CropSyst [173], STICS (Brisson et al. 1998) [174], EPIC [175],
    DSSAT [176], VegSyst simulation model [177], and CERES [178]. A single approach,
    that can address all operational circumstances (weather information, crop growth
    monitoring, field data, agricultural expertise and infrastructure etc.), as well
    as the associated expenses for farmers which may limit the usage of these systems.
    Therefore, DSS’s for irrigation scheduling have been developed to integrating
    various approaches in terms of (data collection from meteorological), pre-processing
    techniques and modeling based on empirical or artificial intelligence. 9 Conclusion
    Overall agricultural systems modeling needs to rapidly adopt and absorb state-of-the-art
    data and ICT technologies with a focus on the needs of beneficiaries and on facilitating
    those who develop applications of their models. In spite of the vast literature
    available, the subject of irrigation water management and crop water modeling
    for machine learning techniques are yet in its emerging phase. Although there
    is wide literature available on statistics, machine learning, decision support
    system for general manifolds. To estimate crop water modeling on general manifolds,
    we have different approaches available in literature. Moreover, the water balance
    is well-entrenched approach for estimating irrigation amount and time (i.e. irrigation
    frequency) in irrigation scheduling. This approach is simple to use, typically
    inexpensive and very effective approach to estimates the ET , and ET . The major
    objective is to adopt the several approaches to develop a flexible system that
    supports irrigation water requirement system, which may fit into diverse fields
    of operational activities (weather information, field data collection, crop coefficients
    etc.). This study provides an overview of the irrigation water scheduling. It
    also presented the concept of reference evapotranspiration and crop evapotranspiration
    for crop water modeling. It also presents the various methods of irrigation scheduling.
    It also address the need of decision support system and its various approaches
    that lead to irrigation water management. References Keith SA (1948) A new theory

    \ to the ongoing domestic and international\nlockdown for COVID-19. Many have\
    \ already lost their jobs, and businesses have been unstable in the\nCorona era.\
    \ Apart from educational institutions, banks, privately owned institutions, and\
    \ agriculture,\nthere are signs of economic recession in almost all sectors. The\
    \ roles of modern technology, the\nInternet of things, and artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ are undeniable in helping the world achieve economic\nprosperity in the post-COVID-19\
    \ economic downturn. Food production must increase by 60% by\n2050 to meet global\
    \ food security demands in the face of uncertainty such as the COVID-19 pandemic\n\
    and a growing population. Given COVID 19’s intensity and isolation, improving\
    \ food production\nand distribution systems is critical to combating hunger and\
    \ addressing the double burden of\nmalnutrition. As the world’s population is\
    \ growing day by day, according to an estimation world’s\npopulation reaches 9.6\
    \ billion by 2050, so there is a growing need to modify the agriculture methods,\n\
    technologies so that maximum crops can be attained and human effort can be reduced.\
    \ The urban\nsmart vertical farming (USVF) is a solution to secure food production,\
    \ which can be introduced at\nany adaptive reuse, retroﬁt, or new buildings in\
    \ vertical manners. This paper aims to provide a\ncomprehensive review of the\
    \ concept of USVF using various techniques to enhance productivity\nas well as\
    \ its types, topologies, technologies, control systems, social acceptance, and\
    \ beneﬁts. This\nreview has focused on numerous issues, challenges, and recommendations\
    \ in the development of the\nsystem, vertical farming management, and modern technologies\
    \ approach.\nKeywords: automation; smart vertical farming; sensors; Internet of\
    \ Things; urban farming\n1. Introduction\nIn the 21st century, urbanization will\
    \ be faster, and the population will reach 6.3 billion\nby 2050. 67.2% or 6.5\
    \ billion of these, are expected to live in urban areas [1]. To feed this\ngrowing,\
    \ increasingly urbanized population, the United Nations estimates food demand\n\
    needs to rise by 70% [2,3]. Rapid changes in urban built-up areas and skylines\
    \ in providing\nbuildings and infrastructures to cater to the city center’s larger\
    \ population have altered the\nurban climate into unhealthy living conditions.\
    \ This situation threatens the demand for\nthe basic needs of urban dwellers for\
    \ a livable urban living environment. Furthermore, a\nlarger urban population\

    \ of Vertical Farming\nVertical farming (VF) is a practical technology through\
    \ which large quantities of food\ncrops and medicinal plants can be produced in\
    \ a very small space only with the help of\nadvanced technology [25].\n2.1. Types\
    \ of Vertical Farm\nVF is practiced in about 13 different ways in the modern world\
    \ and each way is so\ntechnologically advanced that it is enough to revolutionize\
    \ agriculture [26]. The following\nsection represents a few types of VF utilized\
    \ for smart UF that are rapidly evolving,\ndiversifying, and improving in the\
    \ future of agriculture [7].\n2.1.1. Hydroponics\nHydroponics is a system that\
    \ can be called a key part of VF [26,27]. Very slowly,\nthis system has gained\
    \ popularity. Hydroponics is an approach to developing vegetation\nbarring soil.\
    \ Instead of having their roots supported and nourished by soil, the plant is\
    \ often\nirrigated and supported with the aid of an inert developing medium like\
    \ cocopeat and is\nfed through nutrient-rich water that is indispensable to maintain\
    \ plant growth. Hydroponic\nstructures use 60–70% much less water than regular\
    \ conventional agriculture [28,29]. In\nthis method, the plant roots are immersed\
    \ in the mixture of essential nutrients of the plant\ninstead of the soil, in\
    \ which case the nutrients have to be mixed in the right proportions.\nFigure\
    \ 2 shows the structure of the hydroponics VF in Sweden [30]. Hydroponic VF\n\
    provides many advantages over traditional agriculture, including more productive\
    \ use\nof water and soil, and a substantial reduction in transport costs is carried\

    \ Vertical Farm\nCommercial urban agriculture can be made more sustainable because\
    \ it can re-\nduce irrigation water waste by 40–60% and increase yields by 3–4\
    \ times when hydro-\nponically nutrient-rich water is stored and reused in automatic\
    \ and climate-controlled\nbuildings [45,46]. Although the use of this technology\
    \ in indoor VF will be more costly\ndue to the use of artiﬁcial materials, the\
    \ cost will be higher due to the use of local mate-\nrials. However, in [47],\
    \ the authors indicated it is also possible to make commercial UF\nsustainable\
    \ and proﬁtable by using smart technologies.\n2.3.1. Soil\nSoil plays a vital\
    \ element in VF topology in terms of its measurements, quality for\neach tree.\

    \ of soil which widely\nused in advanced greenhouses worldwide.\n2.3.2. Lighting\n\
    Lighting plays an important role in making food for a crop in VF [53]. In the\
    \ VF\nsystem, since the trees are one on top of the other, sunlight cannot reach\
    \ the trees in the\nmiddle of the day. However, to solve this problem, the trees\
    \ should be kept in a place\nwhere they get enough sunlight at the beginning of\
    \ the day and artiﬁcial light all time. The\nconventional light-emitting diode\
    \ (LED) technologies produce 28% efﬁciency. However,\nmaking an indoor agriculture\
    \ system cost-effective LED requires more efﬁciency, at least\naround 50–60% [54,55].\
    \ The work in [55] proposed two techniques LED or high-pressure\nsodium, to overcome\
    \ such lighting issues to grow better crops in VF. In [56], the authors\nindicated\
    \ the application of LED as greenhouse lighting, and it becomes popular in VF\
    \ in\nterms of its lower energy requirements, long lifetime, low cost.\nPlants\
    \ require blue light with a wavelength of 610–720 nm and red light with a\nwavelength\
    \ of 400–520 nm. The study in [57], evaluated the use of LEDs in place of natural\n\
    light to illuminate the plant. The ﬁndings indicated that the LED light would\
    \ assist plants\nin growing with the used of 3:1 ratio of red and blue LED light\
    \ to produce a reddish purple\ncolor. The perfect color combination for plants\
    \ and vegetables has been determined to be\nblue and red. This composition is\
    \ ideal for promoting rapid plant growth. The combination\nof 23% blue and 77%\
    \ red produces optimal plant growth performance [58].\n2.3.3. Solar PV\nSolar\
    \ PV is a farming method but different from the other traditional methods such\
    \ as\nrooftop VF. It is gaining more popularity in terms of enormous used solar\
    \ which is available\nin the urban area [59]. Usually, the crop growth boosts\
    \ up in the VF by photosynthetic\nactive radiation, and it is not enough Solar\
    \ power must be collected by a collection of\nmirrors from the city’s structures\
    \ to reduce the need for supplemental artiﬁcial light [60].\nAs a result, VF is\
    \ looking for alternatives by looking at solar PV as a source of energy.\n2.3.4.\
    \ Water\nIn agriculture such as VF, water is used to produce fresh crops. The\
    \ use of agricultural\nwater makes it possible to produce crops, vegetables. The\
    \ study in [61] addressed a VF\ntechnology that requires 70% less water and the\
    \ amount of water required is also recyclable.\nHistorically, users of traditional\
    \ agricultural systems were expected to manually check the\nwater level in their\
    \ water tanks. Moreover, uncontrolled water use leads to wastage of\nwater, which\
    \ ultimately causes water scarcity to terminate. In [25], the author indicated\n\
    that showers and washing hand water could be used by ﬁltered other than rainwater\
    \ in\nthe smart VF system, which may help optimize water use. In [61,62], the\
    \ authors indicated\nthrough the geoponics method, water utilizes less than 70%\
    \ in VF, while the hydroponics\ntechnique still using 70% water. Water automation\
    \ systems can be used in VF technologies\nto reduce human effort and error. Additionally,\
    \ users can use an Android program to turn\non and off the water pump. This is\
    \ an effective and cost-effective method of minimizing\nwater waste and human\
    \ labor. Additionally, [62] addressed an integrated device built on\nan Android\
    \ application that controls and tests the water pump and water level in smart\n\
    farming (SF).\n3. Technologies in Smart Vertical Farming\nVF is a state-of-the-art\

    \ The use of pH sensors plays a vital role in the industry,\nagriculture, manufacturing,\

    \ are largely used in the SF to predict and assist with necessary\nmaintenance\
    \ [96,97]. The study reported in [96] presented accelerometer sensor plays an\n\
    important role in monitoring the conventional use of equipment in the SF. In [98],\
    \ the\nauthors indicated accelerometer sensors detect running components or motor’s\
    \ health\nconditions through motion, speed, vibration inconsistencies. Therefore,\
    \ users can easily\ntrack the component health condition using an android application\
    \ in SF.\n3.3.2. Gyroscope Sensor\nA gyroscope is a system that uses the theory\
    \ of conservation of angular momentum\nto determine or retain orientation. Nowadays,\
    \ gyroscope sensors are used in a variety of\nareas, including science ﬁction\
    \ and mobile devices [94,99]. In [94], the authors indicated a\ngyroscope sensors\
    \ application to detect conventional equipment rotation in SF using an\nandroid\
    \ phone. However, the drawback of this gyroscope sensors application in smart\
    \ VF\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n14 of 40\ndifﬁcult to implement in terms of\
    \ requiring a complex mathematical model to conducts a\nsignal.\n3.3.3. Light\
    \ Sensor\nThe term “smart agriculture techniques” refers to the practice of using\
    \ a sensor system\nto regulate the amount of light available [100,101]. The light\
    \ sensor is a semiconductor chip\nthat detects the presence or absence of light\
    \ and darkness. Photoresistors, photodiodes,\nand phototransistors are all examples\
    \ of light sensors. The study in [100] proposed artiﬁcial\nlighting as a suitable\
    \ option to conﬁrm most of the time availability of light for the healthy\nplant\
    \ in smart agriculture. However, the drawback of artiﬁcial lighting in the SF\
    \ fault\nﬁnds out and unnecessary light in the daytime. Therefore, to detect the\
    \ fault and On/OFF\nartiﬁcial light system in the smart farm using an android\
    \ phone application which reduces\nthe human effort and optimize cost [102].\n\
    3.3.4. Magnetometer Sensor\nBasically, magnetometer sensors are used in SF to\
    \ measure the direction of the workers,\nsuch as walk forwards, walk backward,\
    \ run, harvest fruit. The advantages of using the\nsensors by mobile phone which\
    \ help farmers with decision-making, enabling them to have\na deeper, richer knowledge\
    \ about their farms [94].\n3.3.5. Proximity Sensor\nThe proximity sensors utilize\
    \ to monitor crop ﬂow during collection data in VF [94].\nIn [71], the authors\
    \ usually indicated crop plant temperature control from a heat source\nmeasured\
    \ by a proximity sensor in SF. The study in [94,103] reported proximity sensors\
    \ are\nutilized to measure grain yield in the agriculture farm, which helps to\
    \ reduce human effort,\nmeasure accurate crop, save time, and can work in harsh\
    \ environmental conditions. How-\never, proximity sensors’ drawbacks can detect\
    \ only the metallic target, and the operation\nrange also limited.\n3.3.6. Humidity\
    \ Sensor\nNowadays, the demand for humidity sensors is gaining popularity in SF\
    \ [104,105].\nThe work in [105] addressed humidity sensors play an important role\
    \ in SF, such as tracking\nthe water level of plants, environmental monitoring,\
    \ which suitable time for proper crop\nselection. The authors also indicated the\
    \ humidity sensors are steady and ﬂexible at\nmeasure bio-interface. Nevertheless,\
    \ challenges still occur for the awareness of capable\nand wide-scale manufacture\
    \ of adjustable humidity sensors for bio-interface applications.\nIn [106], the\
    \ authors indicated humidity sensors increase their demand in agriculture\nfarming\
    \ by controlling the humidity created by porous materials, namely metal-organic\n\
    structure due to their large porosity and tunable shape. However, the drawback\
    \ of this\nmetal-organic structure is its response time is high and displays a\
    \ narrow sensing range.\n3.3.7. Carbon-Based Sensor\nThe carbon-based sensor has\
    \ many beneﬁts as opposed to other types of sensors. The\ncarbon-based structures\
    \ used in sensor applications are carbon nanotube (CNT), nanodia-\nmond (ND),\
    \ fullerene (FLN) and graphene (GPN). Due to their superior electrical, thermal,\n\
    mechanical, and chemical properties, nanodiamonds, fullerenes, graphenes, nanotubes,\n\
    and hybrid structures have been widely used. Carbon nanostructures, as described\
    \ in [107],\nexhibit a high degree of selectivity, especially when functionalized.\
    \ Carbon nanostructures\nhave grown in popularity as gas sensor applications due\
    \ to their promising structure,\nwhich enables gas detection and quantiﬁcation.\
    \ The high surface-to-volume ratio and\nhollow composition make this material\
    \ suitable for gas adsorption and desorption. The\nidentiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation\
    \ of polluting gases, especially hydrogen sulﬁde (H2S),\ncarbon monoxide (CO),\
    \ carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx), ammonia (NH3), and\nmethane, is\
    \ one of the primary applications of carbonaceous materials as gas sensors (CH4).\n\
    Electronics 2021, 10, 1422\n15 of 40\nThe special properties of nanomaterials,\
    \ such as their compact scale, large surface area, and\nreactivity, make them\
    \ ideal for use in agriculture. CNTs (carbon nanotubes) are primarily\nused in\
    \ agriculture for germination rate, initial crop production, pesticides, and biosensor\n\
    diagnostic tools and evaluation [108]. Nanotechnology is important in the puriﬁcation\n\
    of water. Carbon nanotubes can be used to purify wastewater [109,110]. Adsorption\
    \ and\ndegradation/detoxiﬁcation are the primary strategies for removing contaminants\
    \ from\nsamples using carbon nanotubes. Additionally, not only is it necessary\
    \ to remove toxins\nfrom various environmental compartments, but it is also necessary\
    \ to control pollution\nlevels. Carbon-based nanomaterials can be used to create\
    \ novel, highly effective biochemi-\ncal sensors for the detection of chemical\
    \ compounds at extremely low concentrations in\na variety of environments. In\
    \ [111], the authors stated that carbon-based nanomaterials\nwill account for\
    \ 40% of all nanotechnology contributions to agriculture, both as additives\n\
    and active parts. The bulk of these implementations are currently in their infancy,\
    \ and this\nsection will highlight some interesting methods.\n3.4. Sensors Technology\
    \ in Farming to Monitoring of the Healthy Growth of Crops\nThe proper growth of\
    \ plants is important to enhance the quality of the crop in the smart\nVF. The\
    \ economic and beneﬁt depend on the proper healthy growth of the plant. However,\n\
    there are some essential elements that are required for the growth of plants,\
    \ such as crop life,\nnutrients, crops health condition, and micronutrients [112,113].\
    \ Therefore, monitoring the\nhealth condition of each plant of agriculture farming\
    \ is essential [114]. Therefore, different\ntypes of sensors utilize to overcome\
    \ such issues in smart VF. Table 2 shows the summary of\nthe method used for crop\
    \ health growth monitoring using a different type of camera model\nsensors in\
    \ SF. This list consists of various types, brands, model numbers and application\
    \ in\nSF. The sensor application in SF includes counting faster crop damage accuracy,\
    \ monitoring\nand detecting defect crop growth, and diagnosing the nitrogen of\
    \ crop and tracking leaf\ndamage from the insect.\nTable 2. Review of methods\

    Electronics 2021, 10, 1422\n17 of 40\nIn [115,128] authors proposed Canon PowerShot\
    \ SX20 and Canon PowerShot SX30\nsensors in farming applications because of cheap,\
    \ easy to manage, and potential versatility\nto count faster crop damage accuracy.\
    \ The study in [116,122] reported a Canon EOS REBEL\nT2i and Sony DSC-W80 sensors\
    \ in agriculture application used to monitor and detect crop\ngrowth. However,\
    \ these sensors’ drawback is that image quality is still inferior and not\nperforming\
    \ well in low light. On the other hand, its advantage performs well in a suitable\n\
    lighting atmosphere and low cost. In [117,121], the authors reported visible spectrum\n\
    cameras and 8 MP camera sensors to measure the early stages of crops grown in\
    \ SF\napplications. The merit of such sensors might work in various lighting environments\
    \ with\nstrong controlling efﬁciency and robustness. Therefore, it is suitable\
    \ for VF applications.\nThe study reported in [119,124] proposed high-resolution\
    \ and Raspberry Pi camera sensors\nin agriculture applications to diagnose the\
    \ nitrogen of crops and track leaf damage from\ninsects. It is suitable in VF\
    \ terms of its longevity, fast counting capability, and continuous\nact without\
    \ damage. The study in [120,123] addressed E450 Olympus and ﬂoral reﬂectance\n\
    sensors in agriculture application to observation insects on each leaf and plant\
    \ growth. The\nsensors gain popularity in terms of simple to use, deliver robust\
    \ real data in a short time,\nand strong controlling capability. In [125,137],\
    \ the authors reported an inverted microscope\nand plant village sensors in SF\
    \ application to automatically monitor health conditions in\nplants, which is\
    \ easy to implement, no need complex mathematical model. The authors\nin [138–140]\
    \ reported DFK 23GM021, Hyper HAD CCD, and Logitech digital webcam\nsensors in\
    \ agriculture application to monitor selecting crops in a greenhouse environment\n\
    and various weeds automatically. However, those sensors’ limitation is the accuracy\n\
    required to be enhanced in terms of data delivery time, efﬁciency, and cost. Therefore,\
    \ to\novercome these issues optimization techniques can be utilized.\nThe study\
    \ in [126,141] reported 0.9R-G and JAI AD-130GE sensors in agriculture\napplication\
    \ for proper identiﬁcation of crops cherries and sweet pepper automatically\n\
    in the USVF. However, the challenges are its complexity, cost, and overall efﬁciency\
    \ still\nvery poor. In [127,142,143], the authors proposed a camcube 3.0, UniﬂyM216,\
    \ and MV-\nVDM033SM/SC sensors in agriculture application to harvest the crops\
    \ such as apple,\ncarrot automatically by a robot in SF. The approach has high\
    \ efﬁciency, low cost, and high\nprecision for the overall system compared to\
    \ conventional methods. However, the main\nlimitations are its monitoring accuracy,\
    \ such as nighttime, tracking the exact position of\ncrops. In [129,131,132],\
    \ the authors proposed Monochrome CCD, SONY NEX5N, and\nSONY DSC-W530 sensors\
    \ in agriculture applications to detect crop growth such as tomato,\npotatoes.\
    \ Therefore, the main advantages of such sensors in USVF overall efﬁciency, large\n\
    accuracy, low error, and easy maintenance. In [133,144,145], the authors proposed\
    \ an\nunmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with geolocation, a UAV platform equipped,\
    \ quadrotor\nUAV-RGB, senseFly eBee with RGB and CIR sensors in agriculture application\
    \ to detect\nheight, biomass automatically of crop plants. Therefore, the main\
    \ advantage of such sensors\nin SF is that they are stable, perform well, have\
    \ small defects, are easy to adapt to new\ntechnology, and they have a simple\
    \ operation.\nFigure 11 shows the smartphone applications in agriculture and the\

    4. IoT Framework on Smart Farming\nWith the development of technology and knowledge-science,\
    \ human thought-\nconsciousness is developing. As a result, everything is changing.\
    \ The revolutionary\ndevelopment of life and human thought in the world over the\
    \ last few decades is far more\nexemplary than the changes in the previous few\
    \ centuries. The transformation of the\nagricultural sector, like all other sectors,\
    \ is much more pronounced. Information-driven\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n19\
    \ of 40\nadvances, when all is said in done, are rapidly progressing with the\
    \ improvement of the IoT\nand may turn into a signiﬁcant piece of things to come\
    \ of farming [146–148]. All modern\nmethods are now being followed to ensure more\
    \ production on less land to meet the needs\nof the age, for example, IoT technology\
    \ in USVF. In [149–151], the authors proposed an IoT\na very modern technology\
    \ in SF in which farmers can ﬁnd out problems of yield, such as\nlacking water,\
    \ crop productivity, yield weakness, and also provide quick solutions to such\n\
    issues. In the study [152,153], authors reported a producing efﬁcient yield controlling\
    \ the\natmosphere situation, soil preparation, crop monitoring by IoT. The study\
    \ also indicated\nIoT delivers real-time sensing data which aids in efﬁcient crop\
    \ production.\nFigure 12 shows details IoT based SF structure. The IoT-based SF\
    \ framework consists\nof six interconnected sub-systems: a physical layer, network\
    \ layer, middleware layer,\nservice layer, analytics layer, and user experience\
    \ layer [154–156]. The physical layer\nof SF is consists of various types of components\
    \ such as sensors, actuators, controllers,\nswitches, network gateways, routers,\
    \ etc. The controller is an essential part of this layer\nwhich plays an important\
    \ role in SF to connect network-related functionalities as well\nas other operations\
    \ of sensors and actuators. The main feature of the network layer is\ncapable\
    \ of transferring root-level data from sensors which use different purpose in\
    \ VF.\nThe network layer is a vital technical layer for smart cultivating, which\
    \ is important for\nsending speciﬁc information, network connectivity to the application\
    \ layer. The network\nlayer incorporates various types of wired and remote interfaces\
    \ for associating the weeding\nmachine, food harvester, and for correspondence\
    \ of machines and sensors with cloud\nframeworks. However, the challenge of the\
    \ network layer in SF where IoT generated a\nhuge amount of data is not only the\
    \ reason for storage or maintenance but also the reduction\nof network efﬁciency\
    \ [157,158]. The middleware layer assumes an essential function to\nboost IoT\
    \ security in SF. In [159,160], the authors indicated an IoT-based middleware\
    \ acts\nas device controlling, setting management, sensation, platform ability,\
    \ and surveillance\nrelevant tasks. Middleware remains in the middle of the utilization\
    \ layer and network\nlayer which are capable of handling information and gives\
    \ a combination for connection\nbetween these layers. However, the middleware\
    \ layer includes safe and sensitive data\nstorage, and data transfer over wireless\
    \ is extremely difﬁcult in IoT deployments. IoT\ncloud support service layer assumes\
    \ a vital part in giving distributed storage, Software-as-\na-Service (SaaS) to\
    \ farming issues. Sensor information procurement, materials recognition,\ncrop\
    \ health condition data monitoring, factual investigation administrations are\
    \ cleared to\nencourage the detecting, activating, and infection recognition operation\
    \ [21,68,161]. The\nanalytics layer’s aim is to ensure big data processing for\
    \ crop production investigation\nyield efﬁciency based on environment condition.\
    \ Another sensor-based IoT system for\nthe analytics layer was presented in [162],\
    \ which ensures crop implement fragmentation,\ncompression, and a reassembly mechanism.\
    \ However, the main drawback of the analytics\nlayer in SF since its direct use\
    \ on IoT devices is not viewed as sensible [149,163,164]. The\nuser experience\
    \ layer is developed to aid the purpose of farmer yield productivity, such\nas\
    \ crop growth condition, efﬁciency, soil quality, and environmental situation.\
    \ IoT plays\na vital role to monitor, control, and deliver to farmers an overall\
    \ situation of VF yield\ncondition by different sensors. However, the main challenges\
    \ still most of the IoT sensors\npower by the battery. Therefore, to overcome\
    \ these issues, energy harvesting technology\ncan be utilized to replace batteries.\n\

    \ 2021, 10, 1422\n27 of 40\nAgriculture operates somewhat differently today than\
    \ it did a few decades before,\nprimarily due to technical advancements such as\
    \ sensors, processors, robots, and informa-\ntion technology. Agriculture now\
    \ routinely makes use of emerging technology, including\nrobotics, temperature\
    \ and moisture sensors, aerial photography, and GPS. These advanced\ntechnologies,\
    \ precision agriculture, and robotic systems allow businesses to operate more\n\
    proﬁtably, efﬁciently, safely, and sustainably. The primary objective of the Internet\
    \ of things\nis to create a vast network by integrating various sensor devices\
    \ such as GPS, remote\nsensing (RS), radio-frequency identiﬁcation (RFID), laser\
    \ scanners, and networks in or-\nder to comprehend the knowledge exchange of global\

    \ of accumulating data about themselves,\ntheir world, and other connected smart\
    \ devices and linking this data to other devices and\nsystems through the ubiquitous\
    \ Internet [195].\nAmbient daylight, ambient temperature, soil moisture, and humidity\
    \ are all control-\nlable parameters of vertical farming. In addition to the vertical\
    \ columns, the ambient\nparameters must be controlled for each stack, necessitating\
    \ the use of a separate collection\nof sensors for each vertical stack. These\
    \ sensors produce a large amount of data, necessitat-\ning the use of an effective\

    \ Vertical Farming System\nThe growth of a country’s population and massive industrial\
    \ development, mainly in\nurban areas, lead to a variety of urbanization problems,\
    \ including housing, food demands,\nschooling, health, and poverty. A new farming\
    \ technique that utilizes minimal land\narea while producing a large crop with\
    \ a secure aspect is highly desired. In [196], the\nauthors addressed a two-factor\
    \ authentication (2FA) scheme to bolster the system’s security\nmeasures. Since\
    \ the electronic device mounted on the indoor farming hydroponic system\ncommunicates\
    \ over the Internet, the 2FA technique is used. Due to the fact that this\nhydroponic\

    will be wired to the user’s home’s network or WIFI. This linking of the computer\
    \ to the\nInternet necessitates proper network protection to mitigate the possibility\
    \ of data leakage\nand sabotage. The 2FA framework will be applied in this system\
    \ through access codes\ngenerated by the gateway (NodeMCU) and a mobile application\
    \ for access veriﬁcation.\nFigure 16 illustrates the total security scheme’s ﬂowchart\

    \ permission to send and receive data over\nthe network via the ThingsSentral-based\
    \ web module. ThingsSentral (TS) is a cloud-based\nIoT device network founded\
    \ by Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia. By supplying the user,\nprogram, and portal\

    \ of Urban Farming\nThe study in [197] addressed as far as a social responsibility\
    \ of USVF contributes more\nin terms of reducing pollution, produce clean air\
    \ and fresh food without using artiﬁcial\nfertilizer. The authors in [198] indicated\
    \ USVF totally brings new technology to produce\nmore food using less water, without\
    \ soil which falls a very good impact on society. In [199],\nthe authors reviewed\
    \ 386 urban tenants in Berlin based on yield farming space capacity\nin an urban\
    \ area, cost, human effort, and overall food production efﬁciency. While over\n\
    80% of the occupants favored VF on the rooftop of the building in terms of sufﬁcient\
    \ light\nfacility, clean air, low pollution, environmental and ﬁnancial beneﬁts,\
    \ fresh food, easy to\nmonitor, simple maintenance, etc. Moreover, the greater\
    \ part of the respondents was eager\nto purchase agricultural items. The study\
    \ also reported in [199] presented a lack of food\ninsecurity produced from VF\
    \ of urban dwellers because of air contamination levels in urban\nareas. The work\
    \ in [200] analyzed 18 rooftop farming leaves and soil conditions compared\nwith\
    \ the natural crop leaf and soil in Korea. The authors in [201] demonstrated the\
    \ effect of\nrising temperatures on air quality at an outdoor rooftop farm atop\
    \ a seven-story building\nin Brooklyn through an on-site observation attempt.\
    \ In [202], the authors measured the\npollution level, crop production costs,\
    \ and monitoring capability in rooftop vegetable farms.\nTherefore, a USVF is\
    \ required to overcome the problem such as air pollution, huge cost,\nsufﬁcient\
    \ food production, various type of crop production all season.\nAdvantages of\
    \ Urban Smart Vertical Farming\nDue to rapid urbanization, USVF has been introduced\
    \ to achieve food security in\nan urban area. VF can be conceivably gainful in\
    \ expanding crop production and adding\nto maintainable UF. Notable beneﬁts of\
    \ rising food inside the urban area can be helpful\necologically, socially, and\
    \ monetarily. VF can also offer solutions for expanding food safety\nworldwide\
    \ [203]. In [203], the authors indicated several advantages in USVF such as raise\n\
    aesthetic beauty, energy generation, urban growth, organic food, preparation for\
    \ the future,\nconservation of resources, VF ﬂexibility, growing higher quality\
    \ produce, and halting mass\nextinction. Besides, the study in [204] addressed\
    \ that USVF has the beneﬁt of absorbing\npolluted carbon-di-oxide from the air\
    \ and increasing the level of pure oxygen in the air,\nenvironmentally friendly,\
    \ helps to control air pollution and noise pollution. As a result, it\nhas a fair\
    \ weight to maintain air quality. The advantages of USFV protect large houses\
    \ in\nthe city from direct sunlight and helps to keep them cool, helps in air\
    \ ﬁltration by absorbing\ndust. On the other hand, the work in [205] addressed\
    \ beneﬁts of these USVF include\nprotection from weather-related problems, utilize\
    \ technologies and devices, helps in air\nﬁltration by absorbing dust, year-round\
    \ production, huge food production within a small\narea of land.\nIn [206], the\
    \ authors described a VF plant structure that delivers a controlled environ-\n\
    ment, the efﬁciency of farms would generally be autonomous of weather and secure\
    \ from\na weather-related problem. The work in [22] addressed VF can produce foods\
    \ year-round.\nThe study in [22] also presented some crops such as different vegetables,\
    \ strawberries can\nproduce all seasons of the year which provides beneﬁt in terms\
    \ of crops could be sold in\nthe same infrastructures, they will not need to be\
    \ transported between production and sale.\nTherefore, USVF provides less spoilage,\
    \ reduces cost, infestation, and energy required than\nconventional farming encounters.\
    \ The advantages of VF reduce the unemployment rate\nand make a new job opportunity\
    \ for urban people who have less education and low expe-\nrience. The study reported\
    \ in [113] also presented a USVF with much ﬂexibility for crop\nproduction, such\
    \ as water protection, healthy food, cash income, not being labor-intensive,\n\
    manageability, marketability, affordability, and sustainability urban growth.\
    \ The authors\nalso indicated VF utilize for drip and hydroponics crop production,\
    \ which can save 50%\nlesser water than typical planting and can hold water. The\
    \ study in [44] also reported\ndelivering vegetables via VF is simply manageable\
    \ and farmers do not need much focus\non soil and plant during growing.\nElectronics\
    \ 2021, 10, 1422\n30 of 40\nBringing back vegetation in any approach deﬁnitely\
    \ improves the quality of the\nurban environment, which is the main goal of urban\
    \ VF. Urban agriculture via SF is also\nexpected to provide environmental beneﬁts\
    \ to urban dwellers. The improvements in urban\nthermal performance and air quality\
    \ reduce air temperature and energy usage for cooling\nloads. Despite providing\
    \ food security for urbanites, this SF system also able to promote a\nconducive\
    \ and liveable living urban environment. VF can manage by family workers such\n\
    as old people, women, young persons because of clean, safe, less dust, ease to\
    \ marketability\nwith high proﬁt. All these beneﬁts indicated a signiﬁcant impact\
    \ on the application of UF\nin the city context. USVF is to provide efﬁcient and\
    \ effective extension services based on\nthe needs of all classes of growers so\
    \ that they can make the best use of their resources and\ncontribute to sustainable\
    \ agricultural and socio-economic development.\n6. Issues and Challenges\nVF technology\
    \ plays an essential role in reducing future food demand, which is one of\nthe\
    \ world’s biggest problems today. However, existing VF technology faces few challenges\n\
    due to various issues, such as high starting cost, low yield variability, energy\
    \ reliance and\nutilization, producing heat by artiﬁcial lighting was presented\
    \ in [41,71,73,74]. In [73,74],\nthe authors reported VF technology would be gradually\
    \ becoming a non-proﬁt industry if\nnot focus on addressing the current issues\
    \ such as energy use, pollution, economy. As a\nresult, current farming is heading\
    \ for a crisis due to the evils of climate change and the lack\nof signiﬁcant\
    \ response to the use of more materials. As a result of high production costs\n\
    and the adverse effects of harmful chemicals used in agriculture on the environment,\
    \ smart\ntechnology’s high-material grain production technologies do not seem\
    \ to be viable enough\nto meet the needs of a growing population. Future crop\
    \ production is considered to be\nvery risky due to the prevalence of diseases\
    \ and inorganic impacts in the changing climate.\nOther than that, equipment location,\
    \ space, and environmental issues have to be taken\nseriously depending on VF’s\
    \ design to maximize crop production. Additionally, shape\nconsiderations such\
    \ as the form and dimensions of the increasing installation, as well as\nthe spacing\
    \ between plants, are a source of difﬁculty for VF. Leafy greens and herbs, for\n\
    example, the needless vertical spacing between tiers of a vertical rack than ﬂowers\
    \ or fruit\nplants. Additionally, lighting systems should be evaluated for their\
    \ heat management\ncharacteristics and conﬁgured to mitigate the warmth generated\
    \ by VF in order to minimize\nany possible adverse effect on development, while\
    \ allowing for adequate air circulation and\nventilation. It is crucial to keep\
    \ in mind that, while food developed using VF techniques\nmay be safer to eat\
    \ than food grown conventionally, hazards may still exist during the\ngrowing\
    \ phase. Dirt and microorganisms from employees, environmental hazards in the\n\
    nutrient medium, water cleanliness and protection, and post-farm handling activities\
    \ such\nas sorting, trimming, and transportation are all examples of such risks.\
    \ Thus, food safety\nmanagement methods such as hazard analysis critical control\
    \ point analysis, as well as food\nsafety assessment and testing, are critical\
    \ in VF, just as they are in traditional agriculture.\n7. Conclusions and Recommendations\n\
    USVF is a current improvement that shows promise for the future. They will be\
    \ open\nto the insistent and additional combination of current technologies and\
    \ in turn use growing\nconvenience and reduce the effort for humans. This review\
    \ considers the diverse ways of\nhow a USVF may be monitored, controlled, and\
    \ built using the IoT, AI, and sensors. The\ncontinuous ﬂow of real data accrued\
    \ from various sensors or systems deployed in a USVF\nis analyzed, and suitable\
    \ actions must be engaged. Although numerous trends exist, only\na few are being\
    \ utilized, and they suffer from certain drawbacks. Thus, the utilization of\n\
    smart technology shows better performance compared with the existing techniques.\n\
    The aim of this study is to recognize SF by conducting a comprehensive analysis\
    \ of the\nstate-of-the-art of IoT in USVF and identifying the most commonly used\
    \ hardware, plat-\nforms, network protocols, and technologies, as well as their\
    \ applicability to the proposed\nsolution. AI and image processing techniques\
    \ have become more prevalent in recent work\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n31 of\
    \ 40\nto develop intelligent farming management. According to the listed IoT applications\
    \ for SF,\nthe most prevalent application is crop monitoring. Signiﬁcant advancements\
    \ in technical\napplications have made it possible to integrate and link multiple\
    \ sensors in networks\nquickly. The microcontroller has been instrumental in the\
    \ rapid growth of IoT projects,\nespecially in the ﬁeld of precision agriculture.\n\
    Based on the literature survey, many past research works are summarized along\
    \ with\nthe various sensor types, technology, and techniques that are suitable\
    \ for the research. This\npaper reviews the USVF sensors categories, IoT technology,\
    \ and hardware components\nsuitable for monitoring and controlling water level,\
    \ crop health condition, moisture of soil,\nproduction of yield and environment.\
    \ The paper has also focused on a comprehensive\nexplanation of USVF technologies,\
    \ monitor and control operation, smart automation,\nstructure, materials, social\
    \ acceptance, beneﬁt, issues, and various trends and applications.\nFinally, the\
    \ study is suggested constructing a pervasive automation system USVF that\nreduces\
    \ human intervention to a minimum.\nThe review has proposed some signiﬁcant and\
    \ selective suggestions for the further\ntechnological developments of USVF based\
    \ on summarizing, synthesize and viewpoint\nfrom the reviewed literature. Some\
    \ possible improvements have been addressed in this\nreview below:\n•\nFocusing\
    \ on food production via USVF activities than using other conventional meth-\n\
    ods in the city, as mentioned in [7,25,203], USVF produces crops throughout the\
    \ year,\nwith greater control over food safety. This will reduce dependency on\
    \ imported\nvegetables.\n•\nEnhance the user control panel for non-technical users\
    \ who use SF. As a result, it is\npreferable to develop a user-friendly interface\
    \ for powerful applications in a control\npanel and based on user experience.\n\
    •\nAppropriate IoT architecture must be built to address the issue of partitioned\
    \ land\ncultivation, which is a concern in several countries around the world.\
    \ Adequate\nstrategy and preparations should be implemented in advance to address\
    \ this problem.\n•\nBy combining big data analytics and cloud-based computing,\
    \ a decision support\nframework can be developed to improve and forecast futuristic\
    \ yield estimation in\ncrop productivity, quality prediction, crop risk prevention,\
    \ and irregular growth.\n•\nRemote-controlled ﬁeld crop planting systems must\
    \ be built in such a way that au-\ntomated planting machines can plate farmers\
    \ more efﬁciently in the ﬁeld. Cloud\nmonitoring and remote multi-device visualization\
    \ have advanced to the point where\noperators/owners can track real-time manipulation.\n\
    •\nHaving a real-time livestock tracking system that enables cloud services to\
    \ improve\nthe farmer’s economic position intuitively. One basic limitation of\
    \ the majority of IoT\nsystems was their inability to conduct rapid data processing\
    \ over a wide range of\nsensor data sources.\n•\nUse big data analytics to address\
    \ disease management problems across many crops\nand to create a consolidated\
    \ farming machinery control system suitable for large-scale\nagriculture.\n•\n\
    Develop a predictive method for determining the pollination time.\n•\nDevelop\
    \ cost management strategies for large-scale agricultural industries dependent\n\
    on big data analytics.\n•\nProvide an easy-to-use climatic knowledge analytic\
    \ service for farmers.\n•\nAnalyze the proﬁt margins of agri-products using big\
    \ data modeling and a supply\nchain management framework.\n•\nAnalytics can provide\
    \ farmers with prior knowledge of the potential rot time of\nagricultural products,\
    \ thereby reducing loss and increasing beneﬁt in terms of value.\n•\nDevelop a\
    \ smart cell phone application to boost the physical farming situation.\n•\nDevelop\
    \ a web-based scheduling system for pesticide sprays based on crop type, rate,\n\
    and time.\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n32 of 40\n•\nCreate a warning system, as\
    \ most systems use warnings to inform the operator/farmer\nof critical events.\n\
    •\nEstablish irrigation schedules based on sensor data and current weather forecasts.\n\
    Irrigation is often applied using sensor data to predict the required amount of\
    \ water\nand electricity accurately. Irrigation schemes, for example, often make\
    \ use of real-time\nweather forecasts to minimize water and energy consumption\
    \ and prevent excessive\nirrigation.\n•\nDevice security is a critical issue.\
    \ Develop a two-factor authentication scheme to\nbolster the protection of the\
    \ affordable indoor hydroponic system.\n•\nAdditional research should be conducted\
    \ on plants’ tolerance for elevated EC and/or\npH. Knowing how resistant plants\
    \ are too extreme pH levels enables device designers\nto create solutions that\
    \ handle hydroponic systems efﬁciently.\n•\nDrone based pesticide sprayer can\
    \ be made for an automatic spray of pesticides and\nfertilizers to get better\
    \ quality of crops with increased quantity. It could help the\nfarmers to spray\
    \ pesticides evenly throughout their agricultural lands.\n•\nFor a smart storage\
    \ house, we can install humidity and temperature sensors that can\nautomatically\
    \ turn the exhaust fan ON when certain humidity or temperature reaches\nthe temperature\
    \ danger zone for food. For food, this danger temperature zone is\nbetween 41\
    \ and 135 degrees for height.\n•\nFor water and food control for cattle, we can\
    \ use conveyor belts to automatically\nsupply food to cattle.\n•\nIncrease in\
    \ monetary income for urban dwellers that uses the smart urban farming\nsystem\
    \ to grow vegetables and sells unconsumed vegetables.\n•\nWe can install a biogas\
    \ plant in the farmhouse to meet all the electric requirements\nand to fully use\
    \ the waste materials of cattle.\n•\nWe can also install a circuit to automatically\
    \ get the power meter reading and electricity\nbills on our cell phone and hence\
    \ get up to date about the power consumption of\nUSVF.\n•\nAtmospheric pollutants\
    \ due to being in an urban environment have a negative effect\non the plants,\
    \ therefore by providing sufﬁcient water to plants (this aids in pollution\nremoval\
    \ and temperature reduction), we utilize long-lived and low-maintenance trees.\n\
    •\nfsUtilize carbon-based nanomaterials can be used as gas sensors to combat air\
    \ pol-\nlution, which has a detrimental effect on plant health, by detecting and\
    \ quantifying\npolluting gases, primarily hydrogen sulﬁde (H2S) and carbon monoxide\
    \ (CO) based\nin [107,108].\nAuthor Contributions: Writing—original draft preparation,\

    Water management is crucial for agriculture, as it is the primary source of irrigation
    for

    crops. Eﬀective water management can help farmers to improve crop yields, reduce
    water

    waste, and increase resilience to drought. This can include practices such as
    precision

    irrigation, using sensors and technology to deliver water only where and when
    it is needed,

    and conservation tillage, which helps to reduce evaporation and retain moisture
    in the

    soil. Additionally, farmers can implement water-saving techniques such as crop
    selection,

    crop rotation, and soil conservation to reduce their water use. Thus, studies
    aimed at

    saving the use of water in the irrigation process have increased over the years.

    This

    research suggests using advanced technologies such as IoT and AI to manage irrigation

    in a way that maximizes crop yield while minimizing water consumption, in line
    with

    Agriculture 4.0 principles. Using sensors in controlled environments, data on
    plant growth

    was quickly collected. Thanks to the analysis and training of these data between
    several

    models among them, we ﬁnd the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine

    (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB), the KNN has shown interesting results with 98.4 accuracy

    rate and 0.016 root mean squared error (RMSE).

    1. Introduction

    A smart irrigation system is an innovative technology that uses advanced technologies
    such as IoT

    (Internet of Things), artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) to
    optimize the use of

    water in agricultural ﬁelds. These systems are designed to improve water use eﬃciency,
    reduce labor

    costs, and increase crop yields, while also reducing the potential for water waste.

    The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the interconnected of physical devices,
    such as appliances

    and machinery, which are embedded with sensors, software, and network connectivity
    that enable them

    to collect and exchange data. This allows for the automation and remote control
    of these devices, as

    well as the ability to monitor and analyze the data they generate. In our context,
    IoT-based systems

    utilize sensors to gather real-time data on soil moisture, weather conditions,
    and other factors that

    aﬀect plant growth. This data is then transmitted to a central hub where it is
    analyzed by AI and ML

    algorithms. These algorithms are able to make predictions and adjust irrigation
    schedules in real-time,

    based on the speciﬁc needs of the crops and the local environment. For example,
    the system can predict

    the weather and adjust the irrigation schedule accordingly, or detect when the
    soil is already saturated

    and stop irrigation [1].

    Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines
    that are programmed

    to think and learn like humans. It encompasses a wide range of technologies and
    techniques, including

    machine learning, natural language processing, robotics, and computer vision.

    AI systems can be

    trained on large datasets to perform tasks such as recognizing speech and images,
    making predictions,

    and controlling machines. The goal of AI research is to create systems that can
    perform tasks that

    typically require human intelligence, such as recognizing objects in images, and
    making decisions. AI

    has a wide range of application in areas such as healthcare and AgriTech.

    In this way we have a

    Smart irrigation systems with AI and ML that can help farmers to identify and
    manage potential

    issues such as pests, diseases, or nutrient deﬁciencies. These systems can also
    provide farmers with

    detailed information on water usage and crop yields, which can be used to make
    informed decisions

    about planting, fertilization, and other farming practices. Additionally, the
    use of IoT allows for remote

    monitoring and control of the irrigation system, saving time and resources for
    farmers [2].

    Machine learning (ML) is a method of teaching computers to learn from data, without
    being

    explicitly programmed. It is a subset of artiﬁcial intelligence that allows systems
    to automatically

    improve their performance with experience.

    It useful in Smart irrigation systems to optimize the

    watering schedule for crops, based on factors such as weather, soil moisture,
    and plant type. This can

    help to conserve water and improve crop yields. Some examples of machine learning
    techniques used

    in smart irrigation include decision tree algorithms, that make possible to predict
    when to water based

    on weather forecasts, and neural networks to estimate soil moisture. Additionally,
    computer vision

    can be used to monitor crop health and detect signs of disease or stress. Overall,
    the goal of machine

    learning in smart irrigation is to automate the process of determining how much
    water to apply, and

    when, to ensure that crops receive the optimal amount of water while minimizing
    waste [3].

    Agriculture 4.0 is a term used to describe the application of technology to agriculture,
    it refers

    to the use of technology in agriculture to improve eﬃciency, productivity, and
    proﬁtability. This can

    include precision farming techniques, such as data analysis and IoT to optimize
    crop yields. Drones

    and autonomous vehicles can be used for tasks such as crop spraying and monitoring.
    Robotics can be

    used for tasks such as harvesting and planting. Livestock monitoring systems can
    track the health and

    productivity of animals. Climate and weather monitoring systems provide farmers
    with real-time data

    on conditions in the ﬁeld. Smart irrigation systems can help farmers to conserve
    water. Crop disease

    and pest detection systems can detect and respond to problems early. Advanced
    data analytics and

    machine learning in agri-tech can help farmers make data-driven decisions [4].

    However, Smart irrigation systems are an innovative technology that can revolutionize
    the way

    water is used in agriculture. They use IoT, AI and ML to optimize irrigation schedules,
    improve water

    use eﬃciency, increase crop yields, reduce labor costs, and provide farmers with
    detailed information

    on water usage and crop yields, that can help them make informed decisions and
    improve their farming

    practices.

    The goal of this paper is to present a method for predicting irrigation needs
    and managing automatic

    irrigation systems eﬃciently.

    The approach includes four steps: installing sensors to measure soil

    moisture, temperature, and rain, linking the sensors to an acquisition system,
    using the Node-RED

    platform for monitoring, storage, and notiﬁcations, and analyzing the collected
    data using various

    algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors, support vector machine, and Naive Bayes.
    This method can

    be useful for large-scale irrigation systems or domestic applications, making
    plant watering easier and

    improving water management. The paper includes related works, methods used, discussions,
    as well

    as results, and conclusions.

    2. Related works

    In recent years, the use of smart irrigation systems has gained popularity as
    a means to conserve

    water and improve crop yield. Smart irrigation systems utilize various technologies
    such as weather

    forecasting, soil moisture sensors, and evapotranspiration (ET) data to optimize
    irrigation schedules

    and reduce water waste. These systems can also be integrated with other agricultural
    technologies such

    as precision farming and crop modeling to further enhance their eﬀectiveness.
    The implementation of

    smart irrigation has been shown to not only improve water use but also increase
    crop and reduce costs

    for farmers.

    For this, many researches came to existence like (M. Al-Sakib Khan Pathan and
    M. Rokibul Islam)

    in 2016. This study reviewed various IoT-based smart irrigation systems that have
    been developed for

    use in precision agriculture, including systems that use wireless sensor networks,
    cloud computing, and

    machine learning. The study found that these systems can signiﬁcantly improve
    water use eﬃciency

    and crop yields, but also highlighted the need for further research to address
    issues such as sensor

    reliability and data privacy [5].

    The paper “Smart Irrigation System Using IoT and Machine Learning” by Gore S.,
    et al. presents

    a system that uses IoT and machine learning to optimize water usage in agriculture
    by predicting

    the water requirements of crops based on weather conditions and soil moisture
    levels. The system

    utilizes sensors to collect data and transmit them to a cloud server for processing
    by machine learning

    algorithms. This allows the system to control irrigation automatically, turning
    it on or oﬀ as needed.

    The authors conducted an experimental evaluation of the system on a farm, and
    found that it was

    able to accurately predict the water requirements of crops, reducing water usage
    by up to 30% and

    improving crop yield by up to 15%. The authors conclude that the system can be
    an eﬀective tool

    for reducing water usage and improving crop yield in agriculture and suggest that
    the system can be

    further improved by incorporating more sophisticated machine learning algorithms
    and incorporating

    data from additional sensors [6].

    Another one, presented in 2018 proposed a smart irrigation system that uses IoT
    and machine

    learning to optimize irrigation schedules based on real-time data on soil moisture,
    weather conditions,

    and crop growth. The system was tested on a small scale and found to signiﬁcantly
    improve water use

    eﬃciency and crop yields.

    We continue with the study that compare the performance of three diﬀerent IoT-based
    smart

    irrigation systems, including one that uses wireless sensor networks, one that
    uses cloud computing,

    and one that uses both wireless sensor networks and cloud computing.

    The study found that the

    system that used both wireless sensor networks and cloud computing performed the
    best, with the

    lower water consumption [7].

    In 2020, (A. A. El-Shaﬁe, H. M. El-Sayed, and E. A. El-Sayed) developed a smart
    irrigation system

    that uses IoT and artiﬁcial intelligence to optimize irrigation schedules based
    on real-time data on soil

    moisture, weather conditions, and crop growth. The system was tested on a small
    scale and found

    interesting result [8].

    Generally smart irrigation system based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and machine
    learning

    can help to optimize the water use and improve crop yields. By using sensors to
    gather data on soil

    moisture, temperature, and weather conditions, and then applying machine learning
    algorithms to

    analyze this data, such a system can automatically adjust irrigation schedules
    and amounts to match

    the speciﬁc needs of the plants. This can lead to signiﬁcant water savings and
    improved crop yields,

    while also reducing the risk of over-watering or under-watering. Additionally,
    such a system can also

    enable farmers to monitor and control irrigation remotely, improving eﬃciency
    and reduce labor costs.

    Finally we present a comparative table that presents studies that have used artiﬁcial
    intelligence

    methods for smart irrigation detection, along with their results, technology used.

    These studies present diﬀerent machine learning techniques, data sources and evaluation
    methods,

    thus the results can be hard to compare. That is why our research presents data
    of diﬀerent plants

    and uses several machine learning models to have a better basis for comparison.

    3. Methods

    Based on the AI and IoT ecosystem, our research consists of intelligently managing
    plant irrigation

    by focusing primarily on domestic plants to help manage these plants as well as
    to collect data from

    concrete way and train them in supervised learning models with a labeled data
    (input = Sensor value

    – output pairs = Decision of pump) to make predictions about new, unseen data.
    The goal is to learn

    a general rule, or model, that maps inputs to outputs. The trained model can then
    be used to make

    predictions on new, unseen data.

    There are two main types of supervised learning: classiﬁcation and regression.

    — In classiﬁcation, the goal is to predict a categorical label for a given input.
    For example, an email

    classiﬁer would take an email as input and predict whether it is spam or not spam.
    Common

    classiﬁcation algorithms include logistic regression, decision trees, k-nearest
    neighbors, and support

    vector machines (SVMs).

    ! In regression, the goal is to predict a continuous value for a given input.
    For example, we would

    take a sensor value of temperature, soil humidity, rain, humidity as input and
    predict whether it

    is time for pumping or not. Common regression algorithms include linear regression,
    polynomial

    regression, and random forests.

    Fig. 1. Global schema of our realization.

    After that moving on to the next step which consists

    in generalizing these models to serve a large category of

    plants.

    To serve this need, we went through diﬀerent steps as

    shown in Figure 1:

    ! Realization of an intelligent model that includes sev-

    eral sensors (soil humidity sensor, air humidity sen-

    sors, temperature sensor, rain sensor) to serve data

    collection with the use of a programmed Arduino card

    through the acquisition of diﬀerent information about

    plants from agricultural engineers.

    ! Use of the Node-Red framework to collect, process, split and visualize this
    data.

    ! Store our data in the MongoDB Cloud database to have access at all times and
    in real time.

    ! Train our data in machine learning models (Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest
    Neighbors, Naive

    Bayes).

    3.1. Support Vector Machine

    The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is a supervised machine learning algorithm
    that is used

    for classiﬁcation and regression tasks. It is based on the idea of ﬁnding a hyper-plane
    that maximally

    Mathematical Modeling and Computing, Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 575–582 (2023)

    Implementation of smart irrigation using IoT and Artiﬁcial Intelligence

    579

    separates the diﬀerent classes in the data. The basic idea behind the SVM algorithm
    is to ﬁnd the best

    decision boundary (or hyper-plane) that separates the diﬀerent classes with the
    largest margin. The

    margin is deﬁned as the distance between the hyper-plane and the closest data
    points of each class [19].

    The mathematical function that represents the SVM algorithm is called the primal
    optimization

    problem, which can be written as the following optimization problem:

    Minimize 1

    2∥w∥2

    Subject to yi(wTxi + b) ⩾ 1 for all i = 1, 2, 3, . . . , n.

    Where w is the normal vector of the hyper-plane, b is the bias term, xi is the
    feature vector for the ith

    data point, yi is the class label for the ith data point, and n is the number
    of data points.

    In the case of non-linearly separable data, SVM algorithm uses the kernel trick,
    a technique that

    maps the input data into a higher dimensional space where it can be linearly separated.
    The kernel

    functions can be linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF) or sigmoid. These
    functions are used to

    compute the inner product between the inputs in a higher dimensional feature space,
    without actually

    computing the coordinates of the data in that space. The SVM algorithm has a lot
    of mathematical

    derivations, it is a powerful algorithm that has been widely used in many applications,
    and it has

    proven to be very eﬀective in practice.

    3.2. Naive Bayes

    The Naive Bayes algorithm is a probabilistic algorithm that uses Bayes’ theorem
    and probability

    density functions to classify data. The algorithm makes the assumption that all
    features in a dataset

    are independent of each other, which is often not the case in real-world data.
    Despite this assumption,

    the algorithm is often very eﬀective in classifying data and is used in a variety
    of applications such as

    spam detection and text classiﬁcation [20].

    The mathematical functions used in a Naive Bayes algorithm include:

    1. Bayes’ theorem, which is used to calculate the probability of an event occurring
    based on prior

    knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

    2. Probability density functions (such as the Gaussian distribution for continuous
    data or the multi-

    nomial distribution for discrete data) are used to model the likelihood of diﬀerent
    features given a

    certain class.

    3. Conditional probability is used to calculate the probability of a certain class
    given a set of features.

    4. The algorithm then uses these probabilities to classify new data points, where
    it calculates the

    posterior probability of a class given the features and the prior probability
    of the class.

    5. The probability estimates used in the algorithm are often calculated using
    maximum likelihood

    estimation (MLE) or the method of moments (MOM).

    In summary, the Naive Bayes algorithm is a simple yet eﬀective method for classiﬁcation
    tasks, which

    uses Bayes’ theorem, probability density functions and conditional probability
    to estimate the proba-

    bility of a class given a set of features, and uses these estimates to classify
    new examples.

    3.3. K-Nearest Neighbors

    K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a non-parametric, instance-based, supervised machine
    learning algo-

    rithm. It is used for classiﬁcation and regression tasks. The basic idea behind
    the KNN algorithm is

    that an object is classiﬁed by a majority vote of its neighbors, which are the
    k closest training examples

    in the feature space [21].

    The mathematical functions used in the KNN algorithm include:

    1. Distance functions, such as Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, or Minkowski
    distance, are

    used to measure the similarity between a new data point and the training examples.

    2. Sorting algorithms, such as quicksort, are used to ﬁnd the k closest training
    examples to a new

    data point.

    3. A voting process, typically based on majority vote, is used to classify the
    new data point based on

    the class labels of its k closest neighbors.

    580

    Tace Y., Elﬁlali S., Tabaa M., Leghris C.

    4. In the case of regression problems, the average of the k closest neighbors
    can be used to predict

    the target value for the new data point.

    The KNN algorithm is a simple and intuitive method, which does not make any assumptions
    about

    the underlying data distribution. It is often used as a benchmark method, it is
    simple and easy to

    understand, however, it requires a lot of computational resources and does not
    work well with large

    datasets.

    This table presents a small analysis of these data, we ﬁnd in this table two diﬀerent
    data: the

    incoming data such as the soil moisture data, the air humidity data, and outgoing
    data which is

    presented by a single type of data which is the pumping data.

    After that, we ﬁnd part of this data present in the form of a point chart between
    the pumping value

    “0 or oﬀ” presented in red and the pumping value “1 or on” presented in green
    (see Figure 2).

    For result of our model, we see in Table 3, it presents the diﬀerent models with
    their parameter,

    their accuracy, and their (RMSE) which is the root mean squared error according
    to an overall analysis

    of the latter, we ﬁnd that the most eﬃcient model with good accuracy and low RMSE
    is the Naive

    Bayes with an accuracy of 98.4% and the RMSE of 0.016.

    Implementation of smart irrigation using IoT and Artiﬁcial Intelligence

    5. Conclusion

    AgriTech is a rapidly growing ﬁeld that combines agriculture and technology to
    improve crop yields,

    reduce labor costs, and increase eﬃciency. Examples of AgriTech include precision
    agriculture, con-

    trolled environment agriculture, and the use of drones and robots in farming.
    The use of technology

    in agriculture has the potential to address many of the challenges facing the
    industry, such as climate

    change, water scarcity, and population growth. However, it is important to note
    that the implemen-

    tation of AgriTech must be done in a sustainable and responsible manner, taking
    into account the

    potential impact on small farmers, rural communities, and the environment.

    The use of intelligent irrigation is an important part of Agritech systems and
    it is vital to meet the

    increasing demand for food. By gathering data on irrigation usage, farmers can
    optimize their resources

    and make more informed decisions. A recent study suggests utilizing a database
    created with Node-

    RED and a data acquisition card to predict irrigation system eﬃciency and through
    machine learning,

    models providing decision support can be trained with an accuracy rate exceed
    98%. We are currently

    working on expanding the database by incorporating more data and researching other
    algorithms to

    ensure the most accurate and eﬃcient models are used. We also plan to integrate
    semi-supervised

    learning into our decision-making process. Intelligent irrigation plays a crucial
    role in meeting the

    world’s growing food needs by allowing farmers to make more informed decisions
    and use resources

    more eﬃciently.

    \ has been successfully applied to image recognition, speech recognition,\nand\
    \ natural language processing in recent years. Therefore, there has been an incentive\
    \ to apply\nit in other ﬁelds as well. The ﬁeld of agriculture is one of the most\
    \ important ﬁelds in which the\napplication of deep learning still needs to be\
    \ explored, as it has a direct impact on human well-being.\nIn particular, there\
    \ is a need to explore how deep learning models can be used as a tool for optimal\n\
    planting, land use, yield improvement, production/disease/pest control, and other\
    \ activities. The\nvast amount of data received from sensors in smart farms makes\
    \ it possible to use deep learning as a\nmodel for decision-making in this ﬁeld.\
    \ In agriculture, no two environments are exactly alike, which\nmakes testing,\
    \ validating, and successfully implementing such technologies much more complex\n\
    than in most other industries. This paper reviews some recent scientiﬁc developments\
    \ in the ﬁeld of\ndeep learning that have been applied to agriculture, and highlights\
    \ some challenges and potential\nsolutions using deep learning algorithms in agriculture.\
    \ The results in this paper indicate that by\nemploying new methods from deep\
    \ learning, higher performance in terms of accuracy and lower\ninference time\
    \ can be achieved, and the models can be made useful in real-world applications.\
    \ Finally,\nsome opportunities for future research in this area are suggested.\n\

    1. Introduction\nEuropean landscapes have been transformed primarily by human\
    \ activities, so that\npristine vegetation and real wilderness are currently extremely\
    \ rare in the European Union\n(EU). Agriculture plays a particularly important\
    \ role in the development of European\nlandscapes, as it now accounts for almost\
    \ half of the total area of the EU [1]. On the other\nhand, we are already exceeding\
    \ the Earth’s capacity with the current type of agricultural\nproduction. Climate\
    \ change, degradation of soils, pollution, rising costs of groundwater\nand pump\
    \ irrigation, the transition from a fuel-based to a bio-based economy, the scarcity\n\
    of freshwater as demand increases, and other environmental and economic issues\
    \ will\nmake access to fresh food an ever-greater challenge [2,3].\nMoreover,\
    \ it has already been shown that some of the aforementioned practices such\nas\
    \ climate changes and scarcity of freshwater lead to stagnation and sometimes\
    \ even a\ndecline in production. Thus, the question arises whether transforming\
    \ all agricultural\nsystems into high-intensity farming systems alone is not counterproductive\
    \ in an attempt\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14030638\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n2 of 43\n\
    to solve the world’s food problems. It is understandable, then, that the implementation\
    \ of\npractices adapted to the reality of a given production will have positive\
    \ effects in terms of\nbetter use of resources and even a different approach to\
    \ their use.\nOne way to address this challenge is to use new technologies, supplement\
    \ workers\nwith robots and machines, and better address biodiversity parameters\
    \ and functions\nas well as ecosystem state. Smart farms include farm management\
    \ systems that use\nnew technologies to increase food safety, quality, and quantity\
    \ and reduce environmental\nimpact. Increased control of production leads to better\
    \ cost management and reduced\nwaste [2,4]. These farms use sensors to monitor,\
    \ control, and treat animals and plants [2,4,5].\nWith the help of sensors in\
    \ the ﬁeld, we can collect data such as soil mapping, climate\nchanges, weather\
    \ data, among others [2,4,5]. The combined analysis of this data can provide\n\
    information to make the appropriate management decisions. Artiﬁcial Intelligence\
    \ (AI)\nreceives signiﬁcant attention in the development of decision-making algorithms.\
    \ AI is any\ntechnique that enables machines to learn from experience, adapt to\
    \ new inputs, and mimic\nhuman behavior [6,7].\nMachine Learning (ML) is a sub-area\
    \ of AI that uses computational algorithms to\nconvert raw data from the real\
    \ world into useful models and decision advice. By using\nML models, the system\
    \ can automatically learn from previous experiences and improve\nitself. ML techniques\
    \ include Support Vector Machines (SVM), decision trees, Bayesian\nlearning, K-means\
    \ clustering, association rule learning, regression, neural networks, and\nmany\
    \ others [6]. Liakos et al. [8] presented an overview of the application of the\
    \ ML model\nin various agricultural activities of agriculture.\nDeep learning\
    \ (DL) is a subﬁeld of ML. The algorithms of DL are more complex than\ntraditional\
    \ ML models. In a network, the layers between input and output are called hidden\n\
    layers. A shallow network has one hidden layer, while a deep network has more\
    \ than one.\nWith multiple hidden layers, deep neural networks can learn the features\
    \ of data and solve\nmore complex problems [6,7]. Since the models of DL are faster\
    \ and more efﬁcient compared\nto the shallow algorithms in ML, and unlike them,\
    \ they can automatically extract features\nfrom the input data, they have been\
    \ the most widely used models in recent years [6,7].\nIn 2012, AlexNet [9] won\
    \ the LSVRC competition for classiﬁcation. Sermanet et al. [10]\nshowed that DL\
    \ models could be used for classiﬁcation, recognition, and localization and\n\
    achieved excellent results. These achievements encourage researchers to apply\
    \ DL models\nto other areas of human life, including agriculture.\nLiu et al.\
    \ [11] reviewed advances in combining edge intelligence and remote sensing\nwith\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) in precision agriculture. This paper presented\
    \ a list\nof recent works using UAVs in combination with DL models. Since the\
    \ focus of the paper\nwas on UAV devices, this work was listed based only on the\
    \ application and model used in\nthe paper and did not include reviews and analysis\
    \ of the work.\nRegarding the diversity of environments in agriculture, the result\
    \ of a trained model\non one environment may not be transferable to others [12].\
    \ This makes the application of\ndeep learning models in agriculture more challenging\
    \ and requires more attention. This\npaper aims to review newly published works\
    \ to ﬁnd new techniques, challenges, and\npossible solutions for using deep learning\
    \ in agriculture since 2018. The following are the\nmain objectives of this paper:\n\
    •\nTo provide an overview of recent work and identify challenges related to data\
    \ acquisi-\ntion and preparation for deep learning models;\n•\nTo review of the\
    \ new DL model algorithms used in agriculture;\n•\nHighlight the challenges in\
    \ training the model;\n•\nExamine the challenges associated with applying the\
    \ trained model in the real world;\n•\nReview the new edge devices used to implement\
    \ the trained models.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n3 of 43\n2. Materials and Methods\n\
    The two most reputable databases for scientiﬁc papers, the Web of Science and\
    \ Sci-\nenceDirect, were searched for relevant journal articles and conference\
    \ proceedings. The\nterm “deep learning” was used in the keywords of the screening\
    \ titles with one of the\nfollowing keywords: “agriculture”, “plant diseases”,\
    \ “weed detection”, “yield estima-\ntion”, “fruit detection”, “species identiﬁcation”,\
    \ “crop classiﬁcation”, “soil management”,\n“automation and robotics” and “irrigation”.\n\
    The articles that did not deal with Deep Learning in agriculture were excluded.\
    \ In\nthe end, forty-six articles remained. Of these, ten articles were related\
    \ to plant diseases,\neleven articles were related to fruit detection, ﬁve articles\
    \ were related to weed detection,\nsix articles were related to species detection,\
    \ three articles were related to soil management,\nﬁve articles were related to\
    \ water management, and six articles were related to automation\nin agriculture.\n\
    The following criteria were considered in the analysis of the articles:\n•\nThe\
    \ way the dataset was collected for training the model and the challenges regarding\n\
    the dataset.\n•\nThe DL models/architectures used in the article and the performance\
    \ of the models.\n•\nThe metrics that were used to evaluate the model.\n•\nThe\
    \ inference time of the model (if speciﬁed), as it is a very important critical\
    \ for the\nuse of the model in the real-time application.\n•\nThe analysis of\
    \ the failure predicted by the model.\n•\nWhether the authors used a low-cost\
    \ device to deploy the trained model.\nThese articles base on the above criteria\
    \ are discussed in Section 3.8 and listed in the\nTables 1–9.\n3. An Overview\
    \ of Deep Learning\nDL models were inspired by human neural networks in the brain.\
    \ The word “deep”\nrefers to the number of hidden layers through which the data\
    \ is transformed. Through\ntraining, they send the input through a deep network\
    \ with different layers, where each layer\nhierarchically extracts speciﬁc features\
    \ at different scales or resolutions from the data and\ncombines them into a higher-level\
    \ feature, and uses these features to make predictions [6].\nDL models are divided\
    \ into supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and rein-\nforcement learning\
    \ [6]. Supervised learning is the task of learning a function from labeled\ntraining\
    \ data. In supervised learning, all data in the dataset is a pair consisting of\
    \ an input\nobject and the desired output value. A supervised learning model analyzes\
    \ the training\ndata and produces a function that can be used for prediction [6].\
    \ The most commonly\nused DL models included in this review are Convolutional\
    \ Neural Networks (CNN) and\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNN). Unsupervised learning\
    \ was used in three papers.\n3.1. Convolutional Neural Network\nThe CNN model\
    \ is a supervised learning model speciﬁcally designed for classiﬁcation,\nrecognition,\
    \ and segmentation. A CNN model consists of a stack of convolutional layers,\n\
    nonlinear functions, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. A convolutional\
    \ layer\ncontains a set of kernels whose parameters must be learned and is used\
    \ to extract features\nfrom the data. Each kernel slides over the height and width\
    \ of the input, and the dot\nproduct between the kernel entries and each position\
    \ of the input is computed (Figure 1).\nThe output of a convolutional layer can\
    \ be calculated by Equation (1):\nyi = X ∗ Wi + bi,\ni = 1, · · · , m\n(1)\nwhere\
    \ X is the input of the layer, yi is the output corresponding to the i-th convolutional\n\
    kernel, Wi is a matrix of the trainable weights of the i-th kernel, bi is the\
    \ i-th bias, and m is\nthe number of kernels.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n4 of\
    \ 43\nAfter each convolutional layer, a nonlinear activation function is used\
    \ to introduce\nnonlinear features into the model. Rectiﬁed Linear Units (ReLU)\
    \ have become state-of-the-\nart and are the most commonly used activation function\
    \ in Deep Learning models [6]. A\npooling layer is usually located between two\
    \ convolutional layers and is used to reduce the\nnumber of parameters to minimize\
    \ overﬁtting [6,7].\nFigure 1. The left side image is the example of the convolutional\
    \ operation, and the right side is the\nexample of a max-pooling operation with\
    \ pooling size (2,2).\nThe ﬁnal layers consist of fully connected layers that\
    \ take the features extracted by the\nprevious layer and generate class probabilities\
    \ or scores. These layers are fully connected to\nall neurons in the previous\
    \ layer. Figure 2 shows the architecture of the well-known CNN\nmodel called VGG19\
    \ and the visualization of the last layer of the VGG19 model in plant\ndisease\

    \ CNN model VGG19. The VGG19 network contains\nconvolutional layers, max-pool\
    \ layers, fully connected layers, and a soft-max classiﬁcation layer.\n3.1.1.\
    \ Classiﬁcation/Regression by CNN\nThe CNN model can be used for classiﬁcation\
    \ or regression problems.\nFor the\nclassiﬁcation task, the last layer of the\
    \ model is chosen as a fully connected layer with\nsoftmax activation function\
    \ and for the regression task as a fully connected layer, usu-\nally with linear\
    \ function. The most popular CNN architectures for classiﬁcation include\nAlexNet\
    \ [9], GoogleNet [13], VGG [14], and ResNet [15], as well as the new lightweight\n\
    models such as MobileNet [16], and EfﬁcientNet [17]. The lightweight models enable\n\
    to use mobile and low cost edge devices such as Jetson nano (https://developer.nvidia.\n\
    com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit, accessed on 8 November 2021), Raspberrypi\n\
    (https://www.raspberrypi.com/, accessed on 15 November 2021) and Google TPU Coral\n\
    (https://coral.ai/, accessed on 8 November 2021) to deploy the trained model in\
    \ robots\nand use them in the ﬁeld [11,18] (Figure 3).\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14,\
    \ 638\n5 of 43\nFigure 3. From left to right: Jetson nano, Raspberrypi, and Google\
    \ TPU Coral.\n3.1.2. Detection by CNN\nThe CNN model can also be used for object\
    \ detection. There are two types of modern\nobject detection algorithms, the two-stage\
    \ detectors such as R-CNN [19], Fast R-CNN [20],\nand Faster R-CNN [21] as well\
    \ as single-stage detectors such as You Look Once (YOLO) [22],\nSingle Shot multi-box\
    \ Detector (SSD) [23], and LedNet [24]. In the two-stage detector,\nregions of\
    \ interest are generated in one stage using a Region Proposal Network (RPN). In\n\
    the other stage, the proposed regions are evaluated for object classiﬁcation and\
    \ bounding\nbox regression using convolutional layers. Such models achieve high\
    \ accuracy rates but\nare very slow [23]. Single-stage detectors, on the other\
    \ hand, contain a single feed-forward\nconvolutional network that directly provides\
    \ the bounding boxes and objects classiﬁcation.\nThe single-stage detectors are\
    \ faster in detection but less accurate than two-stage detectors,\nand it depends\
    \ on the application which model should be chosen. Figure 4 shows the\narchitecture\
    \ of Faster R-CNN and SDD, and Figure 5 shows the result of peach detection\n\
    using the Faster R-CNN model [25].\nVGG Conv\nlayers\nRPN\nclassifier\nA. Faster\

    \ Each bounding box contains\npeach and the score above the box shows the conﬁdence\
    \ score for each detected object [25].\n3.1.3. Segmentation by CNN\nThe segmentation\
    \ task can also be performed with CNN models. In segmentation, an\nimage is divided\
    \ into groups of pixels, and each group is assigned a class. Figure 6 shows\n\
    the segmentation of the grape in the image.\nFigure 6. The left side shows the\
    \ original image and the right side shows the task of segmentation for\nand the\
    \ right side shows the task of segmentation for grapes [26]. Reprinted with permission\
    \ from\nref. [26]. Copyright 2020 Elsevier.\nThe fully Convolutional Networks\
    \ (FCN) [27], Mask R-CNN [28], and Deeplab [29] are\nDL models for segmentation.\
    \ Lottes et al. [30] used an encoder-decoder Fully Convolutional\nNetwork (FCN)\
    \ model to identify crops and weeds during ﬁeld operations. Ghiani et al. [31]\n\
    used Mask R-CNN with ResNet101 which was trained with the dataset COCO, as a back-\n\
    bone for detecting grape branches in the tree.\n3.2. Recurrent Neural Network\n\
    RNN is specially designed for handling sequential data. In RNN, the output from\
    \ the\nprevious step is fed into the current step as input. The output of an RNN\
    \ unit is determined\nusing a tanh function by Equation (2):\nht = tanh(Wxxt +\
    \ Whht−1 + bt)\n(2)\nThe main problem with RNN is the vanishing gradient, i.e.,\
    \ the gradient of the loss\nfunction approaches zero [32]. Long Short-Term Memory\
    \ networks (LSTM) [33] is a special\ntype of RNN created to solve the vanishing\
    \ problem in RNN. A standard LSTM unit\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n7 of 43\n\
    consists of an input gate (3), forget gate (4), an output gate (7), and a memory\
    \ cell (6).\nFigure 7 shows an LSTM unit and an RNN unit.\nit = σ(Wixxt + Wihht−1\
    \ + bi),\n(3)\nft = σ(Wf xxt + Wf hht−1 + bf ),\n(4)\nzt = tanh(Wzxxt + Wzhht−1\
    \ + bz),\n(5)\nct = ft ∗ ct−1 + it ∗ zt.\n(6)\not = σ(Woxxt + Wohht−1 + bo)\n\
    (7)\nThe weights (W) and biases (b) are trainable parameters that are adjusted\
    \ and opti-\nmized during the training of the model.\nFigure 7. (A) LSTM unit\
    \ diagram, (B) regular RNN unit. In an RNN unit, all input data is used for\n\
    output. However, in an LSTM unit, a set of gates is used to control the information\
    \ in memory and\ndecide how long and how much information may be stored.\n3.3.\
    \ Unsupervised Learning\nUnsupervised learning is a type of learning in which\
    \ hidden structures are found in\nunlabeled data with minimal human supervision\
    \ [6]. The primary method of unsupervised\nlearning is cluster analysis, such\
    \ as K-Means clustering. Cluster analysis groups or segments\ndatasets with common\
    \ attributes. In supervised learning, labeling a large amount of\nagricultural\
    \ data to train the model is expensive and time-consuming. Deep clustering\nmodels\
    \ can be used to avoid labeling and make the model more robust. Kang and Chen\
    \ [34]\nused automatic label generation by a clustering RCNN (C-RCNN) model to\
    \ identify the\napple on the trees. Tang et al. [35] used K-means clustering to\
    \ label the dataset and\nidentify weeds in the ﬁeld. Ferreira et al. [36] used\
    \ DeepCluster and Joint Unsupervised\nLearning from Deep Representations and Image\
    \ Clusters (JULE) to identify weeds in the\nﬁeld. However, many other new deep\
    \ clustering algorithms can be explored to avoid\nlabeling in agriculture [37].\n\
    3.4. Reinforcement Learning\nReinforcement Learning (RL) is concerned with how\
    \ an agent performs appropriate\nactions in an environment to maximize the rewards\
    \ in a given situation. RL agents must\ndetermine the best strategy to maximize\
    \ their expected cumulative rewards. An interactive\nenvironment receives the\
    \ current state and the action chosen by the agent and indicates\nthe next state\
    \ and reward (see Figure 8). This interaction between the DRL agent and the\n\
    training environment is repeated until the DRL agent converges to an optimal strategy\
    \ for\nchoosing an action.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n8 of 43\nFigure 8. Interaction\
    \ of the agent with the environment [38]. The agent chooses an action at in\n\
    the current state st based on a policy. The environment receives the action and\
    \ the current state\nand outputs the next state and the reward. Reprinted with\
    \ permission from ref. [38]. Copyright\n2022 Elsevier.\nDeep reinforcement learning\
    \ (DRL) combines deep learning and reinforcement learn-\ning [39]. As Bu and Wang\
    \ [39] mentioned, DRL is a promising model for building smart\nfarms. Chen et\
    \ al. [40] used Deep Q-Network to build a decision-making system for rice\nirrigation\
    \ based on weather forecasts.\n3.5. Data Acquired and Data Preparation\nAI models\
    \ convert raw data into usable models, so a training dataset is required to\n\
    train a model. The more data available, the better results are obtained. A dataset\
    \ can be\ncollected using advanced technologies such as sensors mounted on ground-based\
    \ platforms,\nsatellites, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) [41–46].\nA sensor\
    \ node is a specialized device capable of sensing physical parameters and\nprocessing\
    \ the sensed parameters using a microcontroller. In addition to processing, it\
    \ can\nalso transmit the processed data wirelessly to neighboring nodes or router\
    \ nodes using\ntransceiver [47]. Sensors mounted on ground-based platforms are\
    \ divided into hand-held,\nfree-standing in the ﬁeld (Figure 9), and agricultural\
    \ machinery-mounted sensors that can\nmeasure soil, plant, and weather characteristics\
    \ [41,42,48]. The advantages of ground-based\nsensors are that they are less expensive\
    \ than other sensors, they are not sensitive to humid\nconditions, and they are\
    \ more suitable for small farms. The disadvantage of these types of\nsensors is\
    \ that they are very time-consuming and, even when attached to farm machinery,\n\
    the information is very inefﬁcient for larger ﬁelds. Furthermore, some of these\
    \ sensors are\ninﬂexible in terms of the type of spectral data that can be collected\
    \ [49].\nFigure 9. From left to right: sensors mounted on ground-based platforms\
    \ to test vineyard stress\n(https://www.goodfruit.com/using-sensors-to-test-vineyard-stress/,\
    \ accessed on 9 December 2021),\nSentinel2 satellites (https://www.esa.int, accessed\
    \ on 3 November 2021), and unmanned aerial\nvehicles (UAVs: https://precisionagricultu.re/12-potential-uses-for-uas-in-agriculture/,\
    \ accessed\non 9 December 2021).\nSatellite remote sensing provides synoptic,\
    \ objective, and homogeneous data that\ncan be captured geographically and temporally,\
    \ and therefore could be an efﬁcient tool to\nprovide high-quality information\
    \ about agriculture over large areas, even across national\nRemote Sens. 2022,\
    \ 14, 638\n9 of 43\nborders [50]. Depending on the spatial and spectral resolution,\
    \ repetition frequency, and\ncost, the multitude of satellites and sensors orbiting\
    \ the Earth can be used to provide data\nfor many types of applications [48].\
    \ The main disadvantage of satellite imagery is that it is\nexpensive at high\
    \ spatial resolution. Another disadvantage is their ﬁxed schedule, thus the\n\
    data cannot be acquired in a speciﬁc time step. For example, the time step for\
    \ Sentinel2 is\nﬁve days. Another disadvantage of satellite images is that they\
    \ highly depend on climate\nand cannot be post-processed on cloudy days [48].\
    \ For a list of satellites launched since\n1970, we refer to [48,51].\nAn aircraft\
    \ system with no pilot on board that, once programmed, allows no outside\nintervention\
    \ during ﬂight. Originally intended for military use, they are now used in\nagriculture\
    \ to monitor crops and collect images and data from anywhere in the ﬁeld [11,49].\n\
    Unlike satellites, unmanned aerial systems can collect data at a speciﬁc time\
    \ step, and the\nresults of the collected data have a higher resolution than that\
    \ of satellites. Most unmanned\naerial systems can ﬂy in precipitation, but cloud\
    \ cover can affect the data unless a second\nsensor is used to measure the amount\
    \ of sunlight reaching the aircraft. The unmanned\naerial systems can also be\
    \ expensive, but there are models that are inexpensive. The\ndisadvantages of\
    \ unmanned aerial systems are the requirement of a human operator [49],\nlimited\
    \ ﬂight duration, the limited weight of cargo carried, energy consumption [41],\
    \ and\ndependence on weather conditions [41,52]. In addition, the processing of\
    \ data collected by\nUAS is higher than that of satellite imagery [49].\nIn addition\
    \ to using sensors, the dataset can also be collected from free online datasets\n\
    such as ImageNet, Microsoft COCO, and PlantVillage [46] or images can be generated\n\
    synthetically as described in [53] or by using simulation software in agriculture\
    \ such as\nAguaCrop and DSSAT [54]. For DL models, a large dataset is required\
    \ for training to\nextract appropriate features [55]. Collating and labeling a\
    \ large amount of data is time-\nconsuming. One strategy to overcome these challenges\
    \ is to increase the size of the dataset\nusing augmentation techniques [55].\
    \ Augmentation techniques artiﬁcially create different\nversions of a real dataset\
    \ to increase its size. These include rotation, blurring, scaling, and\nﬂipping\
    \ of images in the dataset [55,56].\nAnother strategy is transfer learning and\
    \ ﬁne-tuning the model [57]. In transfer\nlearning, the model is trained with\
    \ a large dataset such as ImageNet or COCO and then\nthe same model is reused\
    \ and re-trained for a similar task. If the dataset does not contain\nenough data\
    \ to train a model from scratch, this strategy can be used. Ghazi et al. [58]\n\
    investigated how ﬁne-tuning pre-trained models affects plant classiﬁcation results.\
    \ For\nthis purpose, the AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and VGGNet models were trained, once\
    \ from\nscratch, and another time using ﬁne-tuning from Caffe Models. The results\
    \ showed that\nﬁne-tuning the models improved their performance. Barbedo [55],\
    \ however, investigated\nhow the size and diversity of the dataset affect the\
    \ performance of DL techniques applied\nto plant diseases. The results showed\
    \ that even with transfer learning and augmentation\ntechniques, CNN might require\
    \ a large number of images to extract useful features from\nthe data. Figure 10\
    \ shows the transfer learning task.\nThe next challenge is how well the trained\
    \ datasets represent the real world. Ramcha-\nran et al. [12] trained the SSD\
    \ object detection model to identify three diseases in cassava.\nAlthough the\
    \ model was trained on the dataset collected in the ﬁeld with a camera, the\n\
    F1-score decreased by 32% on the images from other sources. Therefore, the main\
    \ focus\nwhen collecting datasets should be how well the dataset represents the\
    \ ﬁeld study.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n10 of 43\nA common Large\nDataset\n\

    to a similar model, the ﬁnal layers are replaced with modiﬁed new layers, and\
    \ then the model is\ntrained with a custom dataset.\n3.6. Training and Learning\n\
    In the training step of a DL model, the dataset is divided into the training set,\
    \ the\nvalidation set, and the test set. The training set is used to train the\
    \ model. The validation\ndataset is a sample of data retained by the training\
    \ model and used for model selection. The\nmodel structure is determined using\
    \ hyperparameters. Hyperparameters are parameters\nwhose values are set before\
    \ the learning process begins, such as the number of hidden\nlayers in the model,\
    \ the number of kernels in the CNN model, and the number of nodes in\neach LSTM\
    \ layer [32]. A test set is used to test a machine learning model after it has\
    \ been\ntrained on an initial training dataset. When the test set is used during\
    \ the training of the\nmodel, it does not provide information about how the network\
    \ will perform on unseen\ndata, and the evaluation of the result has no statistical\
    \ signiﬁcance [32]. Figure 11 shows\nthe general steps from preprocessing the\
    \ data to ﬁnalizing the model for prediction.\nThe error of a model is deﬁned\
    \ as the difference between the actual value the predicted\noutput, and it must\
    \ be minimized in the training step. The function that is used to compute\nthis\
    \ error is known as the loss function. It can be categorized into two types: Classiﬁcation\n\
    and Regression Loss. The loss function used for the classiﬁcation contains Hinge\
    \ loss,\nExpositional loss, cross-entropy, Log loss, and many more. For the regression\
    \ problems,\nthe loss function such as Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Absolute\
    \ Error (MAE), Huber\nloss, and log cosh loss can be used. Each of these gives\
    \ a different error for the same\nprediction. The choice of a loss function depends\
    \ on the algorithm. Training DL models\nare based on backpropagation [59]. Backpropagation\
    \ uses the chain rule and computes the\nloss function’s gradient concerning the\
    \ network’s weights and biases for a single input–\noutput example, adjusted network\
    \ weights, and biases. The optimization algorithm must\nbe selected to minimize\
    \ the loss function. The choice of optimization algorithm and loss\nfunctions\
    \ are critical. The same as loss function, there are several ways to optimize\
    \ the error,\nsuch as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), SGD with momentum, Root\
    \ Means Square\npropagation (RMSprop), and Adam [6]. Zhang et al. [60] built up\
    \ an experience to compare\nthe performance between SGD and Adam in identifying\
    \ tomato leaf disease. The ResNet\nwith the SGD optimization method obtained the\
    \ highest test accuracy of 96.51%. Figure 12\nshows the learning steps of a DL\

    Once the model is trained, the most crucial question is how good the model is.\
    \ There\nare several metrics for evaluating DL models. The most commonly used\
    \ metrics in this\nreview for the regression problems are:\n•\nMSE: is the average\
    \ of the squared differences between prediction and actual observation.\n•\nRoot\
    \ Mean Square Error (RMSE): is the square root of MSE.\n•\nMAE: is the average\
    \ of the absolute differences between prediction and actual obser-\nvation.\n\
    •\nR2: is a statistical measure calculated from the variance explained by the\
    \ model versus\nthe total variance. The higher R2 indicates, the smaller the differences\
    \ between the\nobserved data and the ﬁtted values.\nThe metrics that can be used\
    \ in evaluating a classiﬁcation or segmentation problem\nare as follows:\n•\n\
    Accuracy (AC) is the ratio of correctly predicted observation of the total observations.\n\
    •\nRecall (R): also known as sensitivity, measures how many actual positives capture\
    \ by\nthe model correctly.\n•\nPrecision (P): also known as a positive predictive\
    \ value, measures how accurate the\nprediction is in classiﬁcation, i.e., the\
    \ correct prediction.\n•\nThe Average Precision (AP) is given by the area under\
    \ the precision–recall curve\nabove. Since Precision and Recall always lie between\
    \ 0 and 1, AP also lies between 0\nand 1. The Mean Average Precision (mAP) is\
    \ calculated by taking the mean AP over\nall classes.\n•\nF1-score: is the weighted\
    \ average of Precision and Recall.\n•\nIntersection Over Union (IOU): is an evaluation\
    \ metric used to measure an object\ndetector’s accuracy on a particular dataset.\n\
    •\nArea Under the ROC Curve (AUC): measures the area underneath the entire ROC\
    \ curve.\n3.8. Brief Review of Papers\n3.8.1. Disease Detection\nPlant diseases\
    \ cause losses in agricultural production and endanger food security. The\nmost\
    \ common practice in pest and disease control is to spray the crop area evenly\
    \ with\npesticides [8]. This method requires signiﬁcant amounts of pesticides,\
    \ which results in\nhigh ﬁnancial and human resources and signiﬁcantly changes\
    \ the environment. The use\nof a deep learning algorithm that detects the exact\
    \ time, location, and affected crops and\nsprays the pesticides only on the affected\
    \ plants can reduce resource consumption and\nenvironmental changes.\nKerkech\
    \ et al. [61] used the SegNet model to segment and detect grapevine diseases\n\
    using images with RGB and infrared ranges. The dataset was acquired using a UAV\n\
    device with two MAPIR Survey2 camera sensors, including a visible light (RGB)\
    \ sensor\nset for automatic illumination and an infrared sensor. The dataset was\
    \ labeled using a\nsemi-automatic method, i.e., a sliding window to identify potentially\
    \ diseased areas. Then,\neach block was classiﬁed by a LeNet5 network for pre-labeling.\
    \ In the end, the labeled\nimages were manually corrected. The SegNet recognizes\
    \ four classes including the shaded\nareas, soil, healthy and symptomatic vines.\
    \ Two models were trained, one for the RGB\nimages and the other for the infrared\
    \ images. The segmentation results of the two models\nwere also fused in two ways.\
    \ The ﬁrst case was called “Fusion AND”, which means that\nthe symptom is considered\
    \ detected if it is present in both the RGB and infrared images.\nThe second case\
    \ is called “fusion by the union” and has the symbol ”fusion OR”, which\nmeans\
    \ that the symptom is considered detected if it is present in either the RGB or\
    \ the\ninfrared image. The model trained with RGB images (AC = 85.13) outperformed\
    \ the model\ntrained with infrared images (78.72). The fusion AND had the best\
    \ performance, and the\nfusion OR had the worst accuracy. The runtime of SegNet\
    \ on a UAV image was reported to\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n13 of 43\nbe 140\
    \ s for visible and infrared images. The fusion between the two segmented images\n\
    takes less than 2 s.\nKerkech et al. [62] used a CNN model to detect Esca disease\
    \ in grapevine using UAV\nRGB images. A CNN model was trained with different combinations\
    \ of patch sizes 16 × 16,\n32 × 32 and 64 × 64 with different color spaces including\
    \ RGB, HSV, LAB, and YUV, and\nvegetation indices such as ExG, ExR, ExGR, GRVI,\
    \ NDI, and RGI. All the different color\nspaces and vegetation indices used in\
    \ this study can be calculated from the RGB images.\nThe results show that the\
    \ CNN model trained with the RGB and YUV color spaces has a\nbetter performance\
    \ compared to the models trained with HSV and LAB. It was pointed\nout that the\
    \ lower accuracy of the models trained with HSV could be due to the Hue (H)\n\
    channel in HSV, which combines all color information into a single channel and\
    \ is less\nrelevant for the network to learn the best color features. The LAB\
    \ color space has one\nluminance channel (L) and two chrominance channels, which\
    \ do not reproduce the colors\nof the diseased vineyard well.\nIn the next experiment,\
    \ vegetation indices were added to the RGB and YUV data.\nCombining vegetation\
    \ indices with RGB and YUV improved classiﬁcation results in most\ncases. The\
    \ ﬁnal investigation concerned the models trained by combining the vegetation\n\
    indices alone. The combination of ExR, ExG, and ExGR vegetation indices with a\
    \ size of\n16 × 16 gave the best performance among the other inputs (including\
    \ color space) and sizes\nwith an accuracy of 95.80%. Furthermore, the combination\
    \ of YUV and ExGR vegetation\nindices with sizes of 32 × 32 and 64 × 64 achieved\
    \ similar performance but the run-time\nwas longer.\nFrom the results, the color\
    \ of the images and leaves is very important in the detection\nof grapevine diseases.\
    \ Furthermore, the number of channels in the input does not affect the\nrun-time\
    \ of the model, but the size of the input and the model structure do.\nBarbedo\
    \ [55] investigated how dataset size and diversity affect the performance of\n\
    DL techniques applied to plant diseases. An image dataset of leaves with a small\
    \ number\nof samples for the CNN model was used to investigate the behavior of\
    \ GoogLeNet under\ndifferent conditions. Data augmentation and transfer learning\
    \ methods were used to\ntrain the CNN. The results showed that even with transfer\
    \ learning and augmentation\ntechniques, CNN requires a large number of images\
    \ to extract useful features from the data.\nEven though a large number of images\
    \ can be easily acquired with the new technology,\nlabeling the dataset is time-consuming.\
    \ One option proposed in this paper was to share\nthe dataset, but as mentioned\
    \ earlier, the two environments are not the same in agriculture.\nThe effect of\
    \ removing the background of the images on the accuracy of the model was\nalso\
    \ investigated. The model has trained again with the images without background.\
    \ The\nmodel has trained again with the images without background. The results\
    \ show different\nbehaviors with respect to the accuracy of the model, including\
    \ no signiﬁcant effect, a\nsigniﬁcant improvement in accuracy in some cases, a\
    \ signiﬁcant decrease in accuracy, and\nmixed results (improved accuracy in some\
    \ diseases while the error rate increased in others).\nFrom the signiﬁcant decrease\
    \ in accuracy for some plants, it was inferred that the CNN\nmodel sometimes uses\
    \ the background of the model to classify the images. An attempt that\ncan be\
    \ made here is to train the model with both datasets (with and without background)\n\
    and investigate the accuracy of the model in this case.\nFerentinos (2018) [63]\
    \ used AlexNet, AlexNetOWTBn [64], GoogLeNet, Overfeat [10],\nand VGG models to\
    \ identify 25 plant disease in 58 different classes of (plant, disease) com-\n\
    binations, including some healthy plants. The dataset used was images of healthy\
    \ and in-\nfected leaves of the plants from the Plantvillag database (https://github.com/spMohanty/\n\
    PlantVillage-Dataset, accessed on 17 November 2021). More than 37.3% of the images\
    \ in\nthe dataset were taken under real cultivation conditions in the ﬁeld, and\
    \ the other images\nwere taken under laboratory conditions. In the ﬁrst experiment,\
    \ the number of images\nacquired under laboratory conditions and real conditions\
    \ was kept similar in the training\nand test set, and the models were trained\
    \ using this dataset. The VGG model performed\nbest on the test set with an accuracy\
    \ of 99.53%.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n14 of 43\nThey also investigated the\
    \ signiﬁcance of the presence of ﬁeld-captured images in\nthe training set. From\
    \ the 58 available classes of the form (plant, disease), the 12 that\ncontained\
    \ images of both types were selected. Two experiments were conducted with\nthese\
    \ 12 classes, and two CNN models were developed: one was trained with images\n\
    under laboratory conditions and tested with images under ﬁeld conditions, and\
    \ another\nwas trained with images under ﬁeld conditions and tested with images\
    \ under laboratory\nconditions. Although the number of images acquired under ﬁeld\
    \ conditions was less than\nthe number of images acquired under laboratory conditions,\
    \ the CNN model trained only\nwith images under ﬁeld conditions performed better\
    \ with an accuracy of 68% than the\nCNN model trained only with images under laboratory\
    \ conditions with an accuracy of\n33%. This result shows the importance of the\
    \ presence of the images acquired under ﬁeld\nconditions. From the misclassiﬁcation\
    \ image, they point out some problematic situations,\nincluding images with extensive\
    \ partial shading on the leaves, images with multiple objects\nin addition to\
    \ the image, images where the leaf occupies a very small and non-centric part\n\
    of the frame, and images without leaves.\nJiang et al. [65] implemented the CNN\
    \ models to detect ﬁve common apple leaf\ndiseases using images from the ﬁeld.\
    \ By applying data augmentation, such as rotational\ntransformations, horizontal\
    \ and vertical ﬂips, intensity disturbances, and Gaussian noise,\n26,377 disease\
    \ images were generated. The problem with SDD is that it cannot detect\na small\
    \ object, and also, an object can be detected multiple times. To overcome these\n\
    drawbacks, they developed an SSD model with a VGG-INCEP as the backbone, where\n\
    two GoogLeNet inception layers replace two convolutional layers of the VGG model.\n\
    Moreover, the structure of feature extraction and fusion is designed by applying\
    \ the\nRainbow concatenation method instead of the pyramid (which is used in the\
    \ SSD model) to\nimprove the performance of feature fusion. The results showed\
    \ that the data augmentation\nimproved the accuracy of the model by 6.91% compared\
    \ to the original dataset. Moreover,\nthe proposed model achieved the best performance\
    \ compared to faster R -CNN and SSD\nwith VGG and Rainbow SSD (RSSD) model.\n\
    To investigate the effect of using a deep model as a backbone, ResNet-101 was\
    \ used\nas a feature extractor for SSD. The results show that ResNet-101 does\
    \ not lead to any\nimprovement. In terms of speed, Faster RNN was the slower model\
    \ with more accuracy.\nThe proposed model with 78.80% mAP and 23.13 Frames Per\
    \ Second (FPS) was more\naccurate than SDD and RSSD, but SSD outperformed the\
    \ other models in terms of time\ninference. By examining the misclassiﬁed images,\
    \ it was indicated that similarity between\ndiseases, misclassiﬁed background,\
    \ and light condition were the challenges in classiﬁcation.\nKarthik et al. [66]\
    \ proposed a Residual Attention Network for disease detection in\ntomato leaves.\
    \ The main idea of attention is to focus on the relevant parts of the input to\n\
    produce outputs. The dataset was collected from the open-source website Plantvillage\
    \ and\ncontained one healthy class and three diseases. They implemented three\
    \ models. One was\na traditional CNN model, the second used the three residual\
    \ layers introduced into the\nCNN model as part of the ResNet architecture, and\
    \ the last used an attention mechanism\non top of the residual CNN for effective\
    \ feature learning. The traditional CNN-based\nmethods focus on ordered feature\
    \ learning, starting from basic image-level features such\nas edges, color, etc.,\
    \ to complex texture-based differences [66]. In the deeper layer, some\nimportant\
    \ features extracted in the ﬁrst layer may be lost. The residual layers are designed\n\
    to avoid this problem [66]. They concatenate the extracted features from the earlier\
    \ layers\nwith the deeper layers. In addition, the attention mechanism is used\
    \ to extract the relevant\nparts of the feature maps. The Residual Attention Network\
    \ CNN performed better with an\noverall accuracy of 98% than the Vanilla Residual\
    \ Network with an accuracy of 95% and\nthe traditional CNN model with an accuracy\
    \ of 84%.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n15 of 43\nLiu et al. [67] implemented the\
    \ model Cascade Inception to detect four common apple\nleaf diseases in images\
    \ captured in the ﬁeld. The Cascade Inception was a modiﬁed AlexNet\nmodel with\
    \ inception layers from GoogleNet. Various data enhancement methods such as\n\
    image rotation, mirror symmetry, brightness adjustment, and PCA jittering were\
    \ applied to\nthe training images. Moreover, the fully connected layers were replaced\
    \ by convolutional\nlayers, which results in fewer parameters and avoids overﬁtting.\
    \ The proposed model was\ntrained using the optimization method Nesterov Accelerated\
    \ Gradient (NAG) and achieved\nan accuracy of 97.62%. The performance of the proposed\
    \ model was compared with\nSVM and BP neural networks, standard AlexNet, GoogLeNet,\
    \ ResNet-20, and VGGNet-\n16. Transfer learning method was used to train VGGNet-16\
    \ and achieved 96% accuracy.\nStandard AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet-20 were\
    \ trained from scratch using SGD-\noptimization and achieved a maximum accuracy\
    \ of 95.69%. The SVM and BP, which\nachieved an accuracy of less than 60%, show\
    \ that the traditional approaches rely heavily\non the expert developed classiﬁcation\
    \ features to improve the recognition accuracy. They\nalso investigated the effect\
    \ of data augmentation methods and optimization algorithms\non accuracy. The model\
    \ with the SGD optimizer achieved 93.32% accuracy, while the\nmodel with NAG achieved\
    \ 97.62% accuracy. The data augmentation methods improved the\nperformance of\
    \ the model by 10.83%. The advantage of the model is that it outperformed\nother\
    \ CNN models in terms of training time and memory required. Furthermore, the\n\
    number of parameters of the model was less than AlexNet and GoogleNet. One point\n\
    that emerges from the paper is that GoogleNet and AlexNet were trained using the\
    \ SGD\noptimizer, and the proposed model was trained using the NAG method, but\
    \ as mentioned\nin the paper, SGD has the “local optimum” problem. In addition,\
    \ the models were not\ncompared based on the inference time.\nRamcharan et al.\
    \ [12] trained the SSD object detection model to identify three diseases,\ntwo\
    \ types of pest damage, and nutrient deﬁciency in cassava at the mild and pronounced\n\
    stages. A dataset was collected from the ﬁeld, which was divided into 80–20 as\
    \ training\nand testing sets. The model achieved 94 ± 5.7% mAP on the test dataset.\
    \ The trained model\nwas used on a mobile phone to investigate the performance\
    \ of the model in the real world.\nOne hundred twenty images of leaves were captured\
    \ using a mobile device of the study\nexperiment, and the model inference was\
    \ run on a desktop and mobile phone to calculate\nthe performance metrics of the\
    \ trained model. The results show that the average precision\nof the model on\
    \ the real dataset decreases by almost 5%, but the average recall decreases\n\
    by almost half, and the F1-score decreases by 32%. Furthermore, the results show\
    \ that the\nmodel performs better on the leaves with pronounced symptoms than\
    \ on the leaves where\nthe symptoms are only mildly pronounced.\nRemote Sens.\

    \ as multiple diseases on the same plant, similar visual symptoms\namong diseases,\
    \ images of early and early-stage diseases, and diseases of leaves, and stems.\n\
    To improve the accuracy of the model, the crop ID was used in the network. The\
    \ crop ID\nwas deﬁned as a categorical vector with K components, where K is the\
    \ number of crops in\nthe model. Several models were trained. The ﬁrst approach\
    \ was to train an independent\nmodel for each crop and the second approach was\
    \ to train a single model for the entire\ndataset. The results show that the multi-crop\
    \ model had a similar performance to splitting\nthe training dataset into the\
    \ different crops (1% increased accuracy). However, the class of\ndiseases with\
    \ fewer images in the training set may beneﬁt from the multi-crop model. The\n\
    second approach was to add the crop ID to the multi-crop model. The results show\
    \ that by\nadding crop id, the model can still beneﬁt from more images for training,\
    \ while crop ID\ninformation helps the network to discriminate between similar\
    \ diseases.\nChen et al. [69] used pre-trained MobileNet V2 networks to identify\
    \ twelve rice\nplant diseases. The dataset was collected from online sources and\
    \ real agricultural ﬁelds.\nAn attention mechanism was added to the model, and\

    \ grape yield from RGB\nimages taken in a vineyard on harvest day using the camera\
    \ of a Samsung Galaxy S3. The\nimages of 40 grapevines were split into two parts,\
    \ one for the left cordon and one for the\nright cordon, resulting in a total\
    \ of 80 cordons. A simple CNN was trained by inputting\nthe RGB images of the\
    \ left and right cordons and estimating the grape yield. The second\nmodel was\
    \ the same as the ﬁrst model, but the input to the model was the right cordon\n\
    images and the inversion of the left cordon images to look similar to right cordon\
    \ images.\nThe third model, an autoencoder network, is trained to a high level\
    \ of accuracy and the\nCNN encoder weights are transferred as starting weights\
    \ into the CNN model for the yield\nestimation model. In the fourth model, an\
    \ autoencoder model was trained to output the\ndensity map of the grapes in the\
    \ image. Then, the weights of the encoder are transferred as\ninitial parameters\
    \ into the CNN model for yield estimation. The last model was trained\nwith the\
    \ output of the autoencoder for the density map as input to the CNN model for\
    \ yield\nestimation instead of the RGB images. The CNN models with ﬂipped images\
    \ outperformed\nthe simple CNN model with an MAE % of 15.43. The models of transfer\
    \ learning from\nDensity Map Network Representation with MAE % of 11.79 achieved\
    \ the best performance\namong the other models. The last model with MAE % of 15.99\
    \ did not perform as well as\nthe fourth model because the accuracy of the density\
    \ map estimates was quite low. The\nresults show that transfer learning, when\
    \ used properly, can improve recognition accuracy.\nAguiar et al. [72] trained\
    \ SSD MobilenetV1 and the Inception model to detect Grape\nBunch in Mid Stage\
    \ and early stages and then transferred the trained model to the TPU-\nEdge device\
    \ to investigate the temporal accuracy of the model. The same strategy in [18]\n\
    was used to collect the dataset and it is publicly available (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.\n\
    5114142, accessed on 3 November 2021) with 1929 vineyard images and their annotation.\n\
    Overall, SSD MobileNet-V1 performed better than the Inception model, as it had\
    \ a higher\nF_1 score, AP, and mAP. The early stage was more difﬁcult to detect\
    \ than the middle growth\nstage. The ﬁrst class represented smaller clusters that\
    \ were more similar in color and\ntexture to the surrounding foliage, making them\
    \ more difﬁcult to detect. SSD MobileNet-V1\nshowed an AP of 40.38% in detecting\
    \ clusters at an early growth stage and 49.48% at a\nmedium growth stage. In terms\
    \ of time, SSD MobileNet-V1 was more than four times faster\nthan the Inception\
    \ model on TPU-Edge Device.\nGhiani et al. [31] used Mask R-CNN with ResNet101\
    \ as a backbone which was pre-\ntrained with the dataset COCO (https://cocodataset.org/#home,\
    \ accessed on 18 November\n2021) for detecting grape branches on the tree. An\
    \ open-source dataset GrapeCS-ML [73]\ncontaining more than 2000 images without\
    \ annotation of ﬁfteen grape varieties at different\nstages of development in\
    \ three Australian vineyards was used to train the model. In\naddition to the\
    \ GrapeCS-ML dataset, 400 images were collected from the island of Sardinia\n\
    (Italy). The result obtained by applying the detector to the test samples was\
    \ an mAP value\nof 92.78%. To investigate the generalizability of the proposed\
    \ model, the model trained on\nthe GrapeCS-ML dataset was tested on its internal\
    \ dataset. The dataset contained different\ngrape varieties, vegetation, and colors\
    \ than the GrapeCS-ML dataset. An mAP of 89.90%\nwas obtained with the internal\
    \ dataset, indicating that the model can be used in other ﬁelds.\nTo investigate\
    \ the signiﬁcance of the size of the dataset used for training and the importance\n\
    of the augmentation techniques, the size of the original dataset was reduced to\
    \ 10% of the\ntraining images in one case with augmentation and the other case\
    \ without augmentation of\nthe dataset. The mAP was reduced by up to 5%, especially\
    \ in the experiments performed\nwithout augmentation. It was observed that the\
    \ recognition accuracy decreased for images\nwith overlap between clusters.\n\
    In Milella et al. [74], a system for the automatic estimation of harvest volume\
    \ and for\ndetecting grapes in vineyards using an RGB-D sensor on board an agricultural\
    \ vehicle has\nbeen proposed. An RGB-D sensor is a special type of depth detection\
    \ device that works in\nconjunction with an RGB camera and is able to add depth\
    \ information to the conventional\nimage pixel by pixel. The approach to determine\
    \ the crop volume involved three steps: the\n3D reconstruction of the vine rows,\
    \ the segmentation of the vines using a deep learning\nmethod, and the estimation\
    \ of the volume of each plant. In the ﬁrst step, the depth output\nRemote Sens.\

    \ Matching (SGM) algorithm was used, which is a\ncomputer vision algorithm for\
    \ estimating a dense disparity map from a rectiﬁed stereo\nimage pair. A box-grid\
    \ ﬁlter is then used to merge the point clouds.\nIn segmentation, a segmentation\
    \ algorithm was ﬁrst used to separate the canopy from\nthe background using the\
    \ green–red vegetation index (GRVI), and then k-means were\nused to identify each\
    \ plant. Based on the results of the clustering algorithm, different\nplants were\
    \ calculated and an estimate of the volume per plant was performed. Finally, the\n\
    pre-trained AlexNet, VGG16 and VGG19, and GoogLeNet were trained to perform grape\n\
    cluster detection in 5 different classes (grapes, vineyard stakes, vine stems,\
    \ cordons, canes,\nleaves, and background). The VGG model performed the best with\
    \ an accuracy of 91.52.\nSantos et al. [26] used deep learning models and computer\
    \ vision models to estimate\ngrape wine yield from RGB images. Images were captured\
    \ with a Canon EOS REBEL T3i DSLR\ncamera and a Motorola Z2 Play smartphone from\
    \ five different grape varieties. The dataset\nnamed Embrapa Wine Grape Instance\
    \ Segmentation Dataset (WGISD) with 300 RGB images\nis publicly available (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo3361736,\
    \ accessed on 18 November\n2021). Models from DL such as Mask R-CNN, YOLOv2, and\
    \ YOLOv3 were trained to detect\nand segment grapes in the images. Then, an image\
    \ processing algorithm called Structure-\nfrom-Motion (SfM) was used to perform\
    \ spatial registration, integrating the data generated by\nthe CNN-based step.\
    \ In the final step, the results of the CV model were used to remove the\nclusters\
    \ detected in different images to avoid counting the same clusters in several\
    \ images. The\nMask R-CNN with ResNet101 as the backbone outperformed YOLOv2 and\
    \ YOLOv3 in terms\nof object detection, but the YOLO model outperformed the Mask\
    \ R-CNN in terms of detection\ntime. The worst performance was obtained with YOLOv3.\
    \ To verify the performance of Mask\nR-CNN+SfM, 500 key-frames of a video were\
    \ used, and the result is shown in a video at\nhttps://youtu.be/1Hji3GS4mm4, accessed\
    \ on 17 November 2021.\nPalacios et al. [75] applied the method of deep learning\
    \ to detect the flowering of\nthe vine and used it for the estimation of early\
    \ yield estimation. Images of six grapevine\nvarieties were acquired using a mobile\
    \ platform developed at the University of La Rioja.\nThe RGB camera was a Canon\
    \ EOS 5D Mark IV RGB with a full-frame CMOS sensor. The\nground truth was acquired\
    \ using the algorithm in [76]. This algorithm was developed to\nprocess only images\
    \ with a single inflorescence and a dark background. In the first step,\nSegNet\
    \ was used with VGG (VGG16 and VGG19) as a backbone to segment and extract\nthe\
    \ inflorescences contained in the images. Then, these regions were used to count\
    \ the\nflowers in each inflorescence using three algorithms, including SegNet,\
    \ Watershed Flower\nSegmentation, and a linear model. The SegNet with VGG19 as\
    \ backbone outperformed the\nmodel with VGG16 in terms of IOU and F1-score. For\
    \ flower recognition, the SegNet model\nwith VGG19 was trained to classify a group\
    \ of flowers per image into three classes including\ncontour, center, and background.\
    \ After segmentation, false-positive filtering of flower\nsegmentation was performed.\
    \ Here, the flowers whose center and contour was segmented,\nand whose contour\
    \ surrounded the center above a certain threshold were considered as\ntrue positives.\
    \ The F1-score reached its highest value when contour filtering was set to 50%,\n\
    resulting in an F1-score of 0.729. The best F1-score for the watershed approach\
    \ was 0.708\nand the worst performance in counting flowers was obtained with linear\
    \ regression in the\nform of the Root Mean Square metric. The number of flowers\
    \ counted using SegNet-VGG19\nfor inflorescence extraction and flower detection,\
    \ and flower counting using the algorithm\nof [76] showed a correlation with R2\

    22 of 43\nKang and Chen [34] implemented DaSNet-v2, which is an ’Encoder–Decoder\
    \ with\natrous convolution developed in Deeplab-v3+ to detect and segment the\
    \ apple in an\norchard for harvesting by a robot. Atrous convolution is a type\
    \ of convolutional layer that\nallows control of the resolution of the features\
    \ computed by the CNN. The dataset was\ncollected from an apple orchard as RGB-D\
    \ and RGB. The RGB-D was used to visualize the\nenvironment. A lightweight model,\
    \ Resnet 18, was used as the backbone of the DaNet-v2\nto ensure its deployment\
    \ on the Jetson-TX2 with limited computing capacity. In addition,\nthe model was\
    \ trained with the Resnet50 and Resnet101 backbones. The performance of\nthe model\
    \ with the Resnet101 backbone was compared with DaSNet-v1, YOLO-v3, faster-\n\
    RCNN, and the Mask-RCNN. DaSNet-v2 and Mask-RCNN with F1-score of 0.873 and\n\
    0.868, respectively, outperformed the other models. However, DaSNet-v2 outperformed\n\
    mask-RCNN with a computational efﬁciency between 306 and 436 ms with a time of\n\
    1.3 s. The results also show that single-stage detection models such as Yolo have\
    \ better\ncomputational efﬁciency compared to two-stage detectors. The model was\
    \ implemented\non Jetson-TX2, a lightweight backbone of Resnet-18, and the experimental\
    \ results show\nthat DaSNet-v2 with Resnet-18 can achieve similar performance\
    \ in recall and precision of\ndetection compared to YOLO-v3. Environmental factors\
    \ such as strong sunlight reﬂection,\nshadows, and appearance variations of fruits\
    \ in color, shape, occlusion, or viewing angle\ncould lead to false-negative detection\
    \ results. RGB-D images were processed using DaSNet-\nv2 and the PPTK toolbox,\
    \ a Python package for image visualization, to deploy the robot in\nthe orchard.\n\
    Koirala et al. [77] developed a DL model, called Mango-YOLO, based on YOLO-v3\n\
    and YOLO-v2 (tiny) for counting mangoes on trees. YOLOv2 (tiny) has a small architecture\n\
    with only nine convolutional layers, six pooling layers, and one detection layer,\
    \ sacriﬁcing\naccuracy for speed. YOLOv3 [22] is based on Darknet-53 and improves\
    \ upon YOLOv2 [78].\nThe Mango YOLO had 33 layers compared to 106 layers in YOLO-v3\
    \ and 16 layers in YOLO-\nv2 (tiny). The reduction in the number of layers is\
    \ expected to reduce computation time\nand detect mangoes more accurately. The\
    \ model was trained on the dataset collected from\nﬁve orchards. The Mango-YOLO\
    \ achieved better performance with an accuracy of 0.967%\ncompared to YOLO-v2\
    \ (tiny) (0.9% ) and YOLO-v3 (0.951%). In terms of time inference,\nthe Mango\
    \ YOLO with 15 ms was faster than YOLO-v3 (25 ms) and slower than YOLO-v2\n(tiny)\
    \ (10 ms). Moreover, Mango-YOLO was trained once from scratch on the augmented\n\
    dataset, and the second time transfer learning was used using the COCO dataset.\
    \ The\nmodels had the same performance on the test set, and the reason was explained\
    \ by the fact\nthat the COCO dataset does not contain Mango images. The false\
    \ detection over images\ntaken with Canon camera shows resizing of the images\
    \ and results in image distortion\nwith leaves taking a curved shape resembling\
    \ the fruit and overexposed areas on branches,\ntrunks, and leaves.\nLiang et\
    \ al. [79] applied the SSD network to detect mango and almond on tree fruits.\n\
    The dataset in [80] was used to train the model. The SSD model used the original\
    \ and\nsampled a patch such that the minimum Jaccard overlap with the objects\
    \ is 0.1, 0.3, 0.5,\n0.7, or 0.9, and ﬁnally randomly sampled the input image.\
    \ The size of each sampled area\nand the minimum Jaccard overlap are critical\
    \ for object detection. These two parameters\nwere changed to adopt the SSD model\
    \ for small mango detection. Using VGG16 as the\nbasic framework for the SDD outperformed\
    \ the SSD with ZFNet. Furthermore, using the\ninput image size of 400 × 400 and\
    \ 500 × 500 as the input of the model, the model achieved\nbetter performance\
    \ than SSD with an input size of 300 × 300. The model outperformed the\nfaster\
    \ RCNN in terms of speed and accuracy. The challenges related to mango detection\n\
    on the tree were considered in the paper: the size of mango on the whole image,\
    \ blocking\nthe mango with leaves, branches, resizing the original image, making\
    \ mango smaller, and\nsimilarity between mango and background.\nTian et al. [81]\
    \ developed YOLO-V3 with DenseNet as the backbone to detect apples\non trees.\
    \ They used two datasets for training. The ﬁrst one contained images of apples\
    \ at\none growth stage, and the second one contained images taken at different\
    \ growth stages.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n23 of 43\nThe model showed better\
    \ performance for mature apples than for young and growing\napples because the\
    \ color features were more prominent, the individual volume was larger,\nand there\
    \ was less overlap. The results also showed that the F1-score of the model trained\n\
    with the ﬁrst dataset was higher than that of the model trained with the second\
    \ dataset.\nThe performance of the trained model decreased for images with partial\
    \ occlusion of apples\nwith branches and leaves but is still an acceptable result\
    \ (IOU = 0.889 for mature apples ).\nThe model achieved the best performance compared\
    \ to Faster R-CNN, YOLOV2, and\nthe original YOLOv3. In terms of time inference,\
    \ the model was faster than Faster R-CNN\nand similar to YOLOv3. The F1-score\
    \ and IOU of the model without data augmentation\nmethods decreased by 0.033 and\
    \ 0.058, respectively.\nZhou et al. [82] implemented an SSD model with two lightweight\
    \ backbones Mo-\nbileNetV2 and InceptionV3, to develop an Android APP called KiwiDetector\
    \ that detects\nkiwis in the ﬁeld. Quantization is a technique for performing\
    \ computations and storing\ntensors with bit widths smaller than ﬂoating-point\
    \ numbers. When training a neural net-\nwork, 32-bit ﬂoating-point weights and\
    \ activation values are typically used. A quantized\nmodel performs some or all\
    \ operations with tensors using integers instead of ﬂoating-\npoint values. This\
    \ allows the computational complexity to be reduced and the trained\nmodel can\
    \ be used on devices with lower resource requirements. The quantization method\n\
    was used to compress the model size and improve the detection speed by quantizing\n\
    the weight tensor and activation function data of convolutional neural networks\
    \ from 32\nto bit ﬂoating-point numbers to an 8-bit integer. The results showed\
    \ that MobileNetV2,\nquantized MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, and quantized InceptionV3\
    \ achieve a true detec-\ntion rate of 90.8%, 89.7%, 87.6%, and 72.8%, respectively.\
    \ The quantized MobileNetV2 on\nthe Huawei P20 smartphone outperformed the other\
    \ models in terms of detection speed\n(103 ms/frame) and size. Although the SSD\
    \ with MobileNetV2 was more accurate than the\nSSD with quantized MobileNetV2,\
    \ the SSD with quantized MobileNetV2 was 37% faster.\nThe problem with kiwi detection\
    \ was that overlapping kiwis were reported, which the\nmodel counts as one kiwi.\n\
    3.8.3. Weed Detection\nBesides disease, weeds are considered to be a prevalent\
    \ threat to agricultural produc-\ntion. These are plants considered undesirable\
    \ in a particular situation, as they may compete\nwith crops for sunlight and\
    \ water, resulting in crop and economic loss. One signiﬁcant\nproblem in weed\
    \ control is that they are difﬁcult to detect and distinguish from crops\n[8].\
    \ DL algorithms can improve weed detection and discrimination at a lower cost\
    \ with\nreduced environmental problems and side effects. These technologies could\
    \ power robots\nthat detect and remove weeds.\nBah et al. [83] proposed a CNN\
    \ model with unsupervised training dataset annotation\ncollection for weed detection\
    \ in UAV images of bean and spinach ﬁelds. They assumed that\ncrops are grown\
    \ in regular rows and that plants growing between the rows are considered\nweeds.\
    \ The Hough transform was applied to the skeleton to detect the rate of plant\
    \ rows,\nand then a simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) algorithm was applied\
    \ to create a\nmarker and delineate the plant rows. This algorithm generated superpixels\
    \ based on\nk-mean clustering. After row detection, a blob coloring algorithm\
    \ was used to identify the\nweeds. The unsupervised training dataset was used\
    \ to train ResNet18 for weed detection\nin the images. The supervised learning\
    \ method performed 6% better than the unsupervised\nlearning method in the bean\
    \ ﬁeld and about 1.5% better in the spinach ﬁeld. The low\nnumber of weeds between\
    \ rows may explain the difference in performance in the bean\nﬁeld. The performance\
    \ of the model was compared with SVM and RF. In general, ResNet18\nshows better\
    \ performance in supervised and unsupervised learning methods than SVM\nand RF.\n\

    \ Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n25 of 43\nFerreira et al. [36] implemented the unsupervised\
    \ learning models JULE and Deep-\nCluster to detect weeds in the ﬁeld. The JULE\
    \ consists of stacked multiple combinations of\nconvolutional layer, batch normalization\
    \ layer, ReLU layer, and pooling layer. AlexNet and\nVGG16 were implemented as\
    \ the basis of the DeepCluster model to extract features, and\nthen K-means is\
    \ used as the clustering algorithm. Two datasets, Grass-Broadleaf [84] and\nDeepWeeds\
    \ [85] were used in this work. The DeepCluster model performed better than\nthe\
    \ JULE model on both datasets with a large number of clusters. The DeepCluster\
    \ with a\nbase of Alexnet and VGG achieved similar performance, with Alexnet performing\
    \ better\non DeepWeed and VGG on the other dataset. To investigate the effect\
    \ of transfer learning\non unsupervised learning, the pre-trained VGG and AlexNet\
    \ were used on ImageNet. The\npre-trained model did not improve the accuracy of\
    \ Grass-Broadleaf, but it did improve the\naccuracy of DeepWeed. The data augmentation\
    \ also improved the accuracy of the unsuper-\nvised learning methods. They also\
    \ used semi-supervised data labeling. Semi-supervised\nlearning is a machine learning\
    \ approach that deals with the use of labeled and unlabeled\ndata. In the semi-supervised\
    \ method, labeled images from the DeepCluster model were\nused to train Inception-V3,\
    \ VGG, and ResNet. Inception-V3 and VGG outperformed ResNet\non the Grass-Broadleaf\
    \ and DeepWeeds dataset, respectively.\nMilioto et al. [86] modiﬁed Encoder–Decoder\
    \ CNN architecture in [87] to distinguish\nweeds from crops and soil. The number\
    \ of convolutional layers was decreased to reduce\ntime inference, and additional\
    \ vegetation indices (14 channels) were included in the input\nfor more accurate\
    \ detection. The dataset of three ﬁelds was used. Three networks were\ntrained\
    \ with different inputs: one with RGB images, another with RGB and near-infrared\n\
    (NIR) images, and the last one was trained with 14 channels such as RGB, Excess\
    \ Green\n(ExG), Excess Red (ExR), color index of Vegetation Extraction (CIVE),\
    \ and Normalized\nDifference Index (NDI). To investigate the generalization ability\
    \ of the proposed model,\nthe model was trained on the images of one ﬁeld and\
    \ tested on images of all ﬁelds. The\nresults indicate that feeding these 14-channels\
    \ into the input can speed up the training\nand improve the performance of the\
    \ model on the unseen dataset compared to the model\ntrained on RGB images and\
    \ RGB+NRI but still, the recall and precision of the model on the\nunseen ﬁeld\
    \ drop sharply (11–50%).\nAnother experience was conducted to investigate the\
    \ generalization capacity of the\nproposed model. The trained model was retrained\
    \ on the unseen dataset with 10, 20, 50, or\n100 images in the training set. The\
    \ performance of the RGB network when retrained with\n100 images is almost the\
    \ same as the performance of the proposed model trained with ten\nimages. The\
    \ inference time of the proposed model on PC and Jetson TX2 platform was also\n\
    found to be 44 ms and 210 ms, respectively, which is slower than the model trained\
    \ with\nRGB images with 31 ms and 190 ms, respectively.\nLottes et al. [30] developed\
    \ an encoder–decoder Fully Convolutional Network (FCN)\nwith the sequential model\
    \ for weed detection in sugar beet ﬁelds. The encoder–decoder\nFCN was used to\
    \ extract features from the input images, and the sequential model processed\n\
    the ﬁve images in a sequence using 3D convolution and output a sequence code that\
    \ was\nused to learn sequential information about the weeds in ﬁve images in a\
    \ sequence. The\nresults showed that the encoder-decoder with a sequential model\
    \ improved the F1-score of\nthe module by almost 11–14% compared to the encoder-decoder\
    \ FCN. The results indicated\nthat the changes in the visual appearance of the\
    \ images in the training and test dataset\ncould lead to a decrease in model performance,\
    \ and adding additional information, such as\nvegetation indices, leads to better\
    \ generalization for other ﬁelds.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n26 of 43\nTable\

    \ with various inputs, including YCrCb and YCgCb\ncolor spaces and vegetation\
    \ indices such as Normalized Difference Index (NDI), Normal-\nized Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index (NDVI), Excess Green (ExG), Excess Red (ExR), Excess\nGreen\
    \ minus Excess Red (ExGR), Color Index of Vegetation (CIVE), Vegetative Index\
    \ (VEG),\nand Modiﬁed Excess Green Index (MExG), Combined Indices (COM1), and\
    \ COM2. For\nthe sugar beet dataset, the model trained with NIR images enhanced\
    \ by Auto Contrast\noutperformed the other models with a mean IOU of 87.13%. For\
    \ the Oilseeds dataset, the\nmodels were trained with RGB images only, and the\
    \ model trained with images enhanced\nby Deep Photo Enhancer outperformed the\
    \ other models (mIOU = 88.91%). Moreover, the\nauto-contrast method outperforms\
    \ other methods in terms of time inference.\n3.8.4. Species Recognition\nThe classiﬁcation\
    \ of species (e.g., insects, birds, and plants) is another critical aspect of\n\
    agricultural management. The traditional human approach to species classiﬁcation\
    \ requires\nspecialists in the ﬁeld and is time-consuming. Deep learning can provide\
    \ more accurate\nand faster results by analyzing real-world data.\nRußwurm and\
    \ Körner [90] trained LSTM and GRU models for multitemporal classiﬁ-\ncation,\
    \ which achieved high accuracy in crop classiﬁcation tasks for many crops. Images\n\
    were collected from SENTINEL 2A images between 31 December 2015 and 30 September\n\
    2016. For consistency with the LANDSAT series, the blue, green, red, near-infrared,\
    \ and\nshortwave infrared 1 and 2 bands were selected for this assessment. The\
    \ performance of the\nLSTM model was compared to the RNNs, the CNN model, and\
    \ a baseline SVM. The LSTM\nmodel outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy\
    \ in land cover classiﬁcation.\nLee et al. [91] used CNN to classify 44 plants\
    \ based on leaf images. Two datasets were\nprepared. One contained the entire\
    \ image of a leaf, and for the other, each leaf image was\nmanually cropped. The\
    \ accuracy of the CNN model trained with the second dataset was\nhigher than that\
    \ obtained with the ﬁrst dataset. The results showed that CNN can extract\nhigh-level\
    \ features such as structural subdivisions, leaf tip, leaf base, leaf margin,\
    \ etc., and\nis not limited to shape, color, and texture.\nAyhan et al. [92] implement\
    \ DeeplabeV3+, a CNN model developed from scratch\nand a machine learning method\
    \ that uses NDVI (NDVI+ML) to segment vegetation and\nnon-vegetation in the images.\
    \ The dataset of [93] belongs to two studied sites, Vasiliko in\nCyprus and Kimisala\
    \ in Rhodes Island, were used. The images were acquired using a UAV\nand a modiﬁed,\
    \ uncalibrated near-infrared camera. The image resolution of the Vasiliko\nimage\
    \ is 20 cm per pixel and these images were used to train the models. On the other\n\
    hand, the Kimisala dataset was used as a test set. The images in this dataset\
    \ contain two\ndifferent resolutions of 10 cm per pixel and 20 cm per pixel.\n\
    Two DeeplabeV3+ models were trained with RGB images as input and G, B bands\n\
    plus NDVI as the third channel. Although the loss of the DeeplabeV3+ model trained\
    \ from\nscratch with NDVI+GB was decreased, the test result was very poor. However,\
    \ the same\nmodel trained with transfer learning and NDVI+GB channels improved\
    \ the accuracy of the\nmodel compared to the model trained with RGB images (almost\
    \ one percent). The CNN\ndeveloped from scratch was also trained with two different\
    \ channels. The ﬁrst was trained\nwith RGB images and the second with four channels\
    \ of RGB and NIR. The model trained\nwith RGB and NIR outperformed the model trained\
    \ with RGB images with an accuracy of\n80.9% and an accuracy of 76%.\nIn the last\
    \ experience, the NDVI and the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) of the\nmachine learning\
    \ model were used to classify the images. This method includes several\nthresholds\
    \ that need to be adjusted by the user. The NDVI+ML method outperformed the\n\
    Remote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n28 of 43\nmodels from DL with an accuracy of 87%.\
    \ Note that the deep learning method in this work\nwas trained with a dataset\
    \ from one location and tested at another location with a different\nland cover.\
    \ This could be a reason why NDVI+ML outperformed the DL models.\nBhusal et al.\
    \ [94] used the pre-trained MobileNet on the ImageNet to classify bird\npests\
    \ in the image. Video data from a commercial vineyard captured with a GoPro Hero\n\
    4 outdoor camera with 1080P resolution was used as the dataset. In their work,\
    \ a motion\ndetection algorithm was used that is capable of detecting moving objects.\
    \ For each of these\nmoving objects, the abounded rectangle was extracted. These\
    \ moving objects were cropped\nfrom the original RGB image and reduced to 32 ×\
    \ 32. Each of these cropped images was\nreferred to as motion instance images\
    \ (MIIs). More than 5000 MIIs were collected from\ndifferent videos and classiﬁed\
    \ as bird or non-bird. In the next step, a CNN model developed\nin [95] was used\
    \ to improve image resolution. The images were converted from 32 × 32\nto 64 ×\
    \ 64, 96 × 96, and 128 × 128 and denoted as MIIs (e-MIIs), 2e-MIIs, 3e-MIIs, and\n\
    4e-MIIs, respectively. Five MobilNet models were trained with the MIIs, 2e-MIIs,\
    \ 3e-MIIs,\n4e-MIIs, and the entire Dataset. The worth results in terms of accuracy\
    \ were obtained with\na model trained with MIIs, and the best result was obtained\
    \ with the model trained with\nall the datasets.\nMac Aodha et al. [96] used the\
    \ CNN models from scratch to detect bats from audio\nﬁles. Two CNN models called\
    \ CNNFULL with three convolutional layers and 32 ﬁlters and\nCNNFAST consisting\
    \ of two convolutional layers and 16 ﬁlters were trained. The audio\nﬁles were\
    \ converted to a spectrogram and used as input to the CNN model. CNNFULL and\n\
    CNNFAST took 53 and 9.5 s, respectively, to run the entire detection pipeline\
    \ on the 3.2-min\nfull-spectrum test dataset. CNNFAST showed a trade-off between\
    \ speed and accuracy with\nslightly lower performance compared to CNNFULL.\nThe\
    \ performance of the models was compared with three existing commercial closed-\n\
    source detection systems, including SonoBat (version 3.1.7p) (https://sonobat.com/,\
    \ ac-\ncessed on 26 November 2021); SCAN’R (version 1.7.7), and Kaleidoscope (version\
    \ 4.2.0\nalpha4) (https://www.wildlifeacoustics.com/products/kaleidoscope-pro,\
    \ accessed on 26\nNovember 2021), as well as a machine learning method RF. The\
    \ CNN model signiﬁcantly\noutperformed the other algorithms in terms of mAP.\n\
    Ramalingam et al. [97] used Internet of Things (IoT) based architecture for insect\n\
    detection. The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks\
    \ that use\nTransmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) to connect\
    \ billions of computers\nworldwide [98]. The IoT, on the other hand, is a global\
    \ network of physical objects equipped\nwith sensors and actuators that connect\
    \ to the Internet in real-time to be identiﬁed, sensed,\nand controlled remotely\
    \ [98]. The IoT architecture used in [97] consists of four layers:\nperception\
    \ layer, transport layer, processing layer, and application layer. In the perception\n\
    layer, a smart wireless camera captures an image of a sticky insect trap. The\
    \ transport\nlayer uses WiFi communication and TCP/IP to send images to the processing\
    \ layer and\ntransmit processed data to the application layer. In the processing\
    \ layer, an Fast RCNN\nwith ResNet50 is used to detect the insect in the images.\
    \ In the ﬁnal stage, smartphones and\nweb interfaces are used to perform the application\
    \ layer tasks. The experimental results\nshow that the trained model achieves\
    \ 96% accuracy in insect detection and outperforms\nYOLO and SSD in terms of accuracy.\n\
    3.8.5. Soil Management\nFor experts in agriculture, soil is a heterogeneous natural\
    \ resource with complex\nprocesses and unclear mechanisms [8]. Its temperature\
    \ alone can provide insight into\nthe impact of climate change on regional yields.\
    \ Deep learning algorithms study the\nprocesses of evaporation, moisture, and\
    \ soil temperature to understand the dynamics of\nthe ecosystem and the implications\

    30 of 43\nLi et al. [99] used a bidirectional LSTM model to estimate soil temperature\
    \ at 30 sites\nunder ﬁve different climate types. Soil temperature (ST) measurements\
    \ were obtained\nfrom the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Water and\
    \ Climate Center, which\nhas established more than 200 sites across the country\
    \ to collect data on meteorology,\nsoil, and solar radiation. Two models were\
    \ trained with different inputs and outputs.\nThe ﬁrst model received the meteorological\
    \ weather conditions including daily hours,\nminimum and maximum air temperature,\
    \ minimum and maximum relative humidity,\nvapor pressure, average solar radiation,\
    \ and average wind speed, and outputted the soil\ntemperature amplitude obtained\
    \ by subtracting the daily average soil temperature from the\nhourly soil temperature.\
    \ The second model obtained the meteorological weather conditions\nincluding month,\
    \ day of the month, observed air temperature, dew point temperature,\nminimum\
    \ and maximum air temperature, minimum and maximum relative humidity,\nvapor pressure,\
    \ average solar radiation, average wind speed, and outputted the daily\naverage\
    \ ST. To calculate the hourly ST, the output of the ﬁrst model was added with\
    \ the\noutput of the second model and called the integrated BiLSTM model. The\
    \ result of the\nmodel was compared with the BiLSTM model, which directly estimates\
    \ the hourly ST, the\nLSTM model, the deep neural network, random forest, SVR,\
    \ and Linear Regression. The\nintegrated BiLSTM model outperformed the other models\
    \ in terms of MAE, RMSE, and R2.\nThe LSTM model achieved the second-best performance.\n\
    It was also found that the performance of each model is not as good in snowy areas\
    \ as\nin warm or dry areas and that, the accuracy of the other models increases\
    \ with soil depth\n(except for RF). This behavior could be due to a change in\
    \ the standard deviation of the soil\ntemperature at different depths and climate\
    \ types, but this is not investigated in the study.\nYu et al. [100] implement\
    \ CNN (Conv2D, Conv3D), ConvLSTM to estimate the soil\ntemperature. The difference\
    \ between Conv2D and Conv3D is the size of the input channels.\nIn the ConvLSTM\
    \ model [101], there are convolution structures in both the input-to-state\nand\
    \ state-to-state transitions. The model obtains the last ten days of historical\
    \ data from\nspatiotemporal ST and predicts the ST one, three, and ﬁve days in\
    \ advance. Each model\nwas trained with two different input channels. The ﬁrst\
    \ time the raw data from ST was\nfed into the model, the second time, the input\
    \ was processed using the Empirical Mode\nDecomposition (EMD) method, which is\
    \ a proposed method for processing signals. In\nthe EMD method, the number of\
    \ channels was increased from one to ten. To complement\nthe model DL, persistent\
    \ prediction (PF) is used, a simple prediction method that treats\nthe temperature\
    \ of the ﬁrst day as a prediction for the next day. When forecasting ST\nwith\
    \ one-day historical data, PF outperformed the models of DL with raw data input.\n\
    On the other hand, when the models of DL used the EEMD- processed data as input,\
    \ the\nprediction performance was signiﬁcantly improved. Among all the models,\
    \ EEMD-Conv3D\nperformed the best in predicting the spatiotemporal ST. It could\
    \ be noted that ST depends\nnot only on the historical data of ST but also on\
    \ the meteorological weather conditions,\nwhich can be used as input to the model\
    \ to improve the accuracy.\nAlibabaei et al. [102] used Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM),\
    \ CNN-LSTM, and a simple\nLSTM model to model daily reference evapotranspiration\
    \ and soil–water content. Meteo-\nrological weather data for three sites in Portugal\
    \ were collected from the stations Póvoa\nde Atalaia, Estação Borralheira, and\
    \ Direção Regional de Agricultura e Pescas do Centro,\nPortugal. Evapotranspiration\
    \ was calculated from meteorological data using the FAO\nPenman–Monteith equation\
    \ and soil water content was retrieved from ERA5 land. The\nBLSTM model with an\
    \ MSE of 0.014 to 0.056 outperformed the LSTM, CNN, and CNN-\nLSTM models. The\
    \ performance of BLSTM was also compared with traditional machine\nlearning methods\
    \ such as Random Forest and SVR and outperformed these two models.\nAmong the\
    \ machine learning methods, RF outperformed the SVR model. The model was\nnot\
    \ tested with data measured in the ﬁeld. For use in the ﬁeld, it can be re-trained\
    \ with a\nsmall set of ﬁeld-measured data to be used with more conﬁdence in real-world\
    \ applications.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n31 of 43\nTable 7. Feature descriptions\

    \ has implications for hydrological, climatological,\nand agronomic balance [8].\
    \ Five papers on the topic were reviewed, where machine learning\nmodels are employed\
    \ to estimate various values, such as evapotransition, allowing for\nmore effective\
    \ use of irrigation systems, and water table detection, which helps determine\n\
    crop water needs.\nSaggi and Jain [103] used multilayer perceptrons (MLP) to evaluate\
    \ daily evapotranspi-\nration for irrigation scheduling. They developed their\
    \ model from scratch. The developed\nDL model performed well in estimating evapotranspiration\
    \ and outperformed ML models\nsuch as RF, Generalized Linear Model (GLM), and\
    \ Gradient Boosting Models (GBM).\nZhang et al. [104] presented an LSTM-based\
    \ model for water management in agri-\ncultural areas. The LSTM model with a R2\
    \ value of 0.789–0.952 outperformed the fully\nconnected network. As mentioned\
    \ in the paper, the prediction of water table depth can\nhelp engineers and decision-makers\
    \ to develop an optimal irrigation scheduling system\nwhile controlling the effects\
    \ of salinity on intensive irrigation.\nLoggenberg et al. [105] applied hyperspectral\
    \ sensing and machine learning to model\nwater stress in vineyards. Stem water\
    \ potential (SWP) was measured in the ﬁeld by using a\npressure chamber to determine\
    \ vine water stress status. Vines with SWP values between\n−1.0 MPa and −1.8 MPa\
    \ were classiﬁed as water-stressed, while vines with SWP values\n−0.7 MPa were\
    \ classiﬁed as not stressed. Images were acquired using the SIMERA HX MkII\nhyperspectral\
    \ sensor, which detects 340 spectral wavebands in the VIS and NIR. A spectral\n\
    subset consisting of 176 wavebands with a spectral range of 473–708 nm was used\
    \ as\ninput to the models. Two ML models Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient\
    \ Boosting\n(XGBoost) were used for classiﬁcation. In the ﬁrst experience, RF\
    \ and XGBoost models\nused all wavebands (176 bands) as input. RF with an accuracy\
    \ of 83.3% outperformed\nXGBoost with an accuracy of 78%. When using a subset\
    \ of important wavebands (18 bands),\nthe accuracy of RF and XGBoost was improved\
    \ (RF = 93.3% and XGBoost = 90%). The\nresults show that the choice of input to\
    \ the model in ML is crucial and should be carefully\nselected. The effect of\
    \ smoothing the spectral data with the Savitzky–Golay ﬁlter in the data\npreprocessing\
    \ step was also investigated in the paper. The Savitzky–Golay ﬁlter reduces\n\
    the model accuracy ranging between 0.7% and 3.3%.\nChen et al. [40] used a deep\
    \ Q-learning (DQN) model for an irrigation decision\nstrategy based on short-term\
    \ weather forecasts for rice. Daily observed meteorological\ndata of the rice-growing\
    \ period at three stations, including daily minimum and maximum\ntemperature,\
    \ average temperature, average wind speed, sunshine duration, average relative\n\
    humidity, and precipitation were collected. The state-space consisted of Pt is\
    \ the predicted\nprecipitation sequence for the next 7 days on day t , mm; ht\
    \ is the water depth on day t, mm;\nhmin is the lower limit of water depth, mm;\
    \ hmax is the upper limit of water depth, mm;\nHp is the maximum allowable water\
    \ depth after precipitation. In the action space, three\npossible actions were\
    \ included, representing the fraction of the irrigation quota (irrigation\nto\
    \ hmax) to be supplied to the ﬁeld on day t. Action 0 returns 0%, action 1 returns\
    \ 50%, and\naction 2 returns 100%. The reward is based on the rainfall use reward\
    \ and the yield reward.\nThe results of the DQN irrigation strategy compared to\
    \ the results of the conventional\nirrigation strategy showed a signiﬁcant reduction\
    \ in irrigation water volume, irrigation\ntiming, and drainage water without yield\
    \ loss.\nAlibabaei et al. [38] uses the DQN model to schedule irrigation of a\
    \ tomato ﬁeld in\nPortugal using climate Big Data. Historical data are collected\
    \ from various sources and\nprocessed for use as input. Two LSTM models are trained\
    \ on the obtained historical data to\npredict the total soil water in the soil\
    \ proﬁle for the next day and the tomato yield at the\nend of a season, respectively.\n\
    The trained LSTM models were used in the DRL training environment, which takes\n\
    the current state (historical climate data) and action (amount of irrigation)\
    \ and then returns\nthe next state and reward. The reward was calculated as the\
    \ net return and the Q-value\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n33 of 43\nwas estimated\
    \ using an LSTM model. The results show that the agent learns to avoid water\n\
    waste at the beginning of the season and water stress at the end of the season.\
    \ Compared\nto the threshold and ﬁxed irrigation method, the DQN agent increases\
    \ productivity by 11%\nand avoids water waste by 20–30%.\n3.8.7. Automation in\
    \ Agriculture\nDeep learning is also being used to control sensors and robots\
    \ that enable automation\nand optimization of agricultural processes. These robots\
    \ can be used for a variety of\npurposes, including automated seeding, pesticide,\
    \ and crop nutrient application, damage\nrepair, irrigation, weed detection and\
    \ removal, harvesting, etc.\nLi et al. [52] used a deep-learning algorithm to\
    \ quickly and accurately detect and\nlocate longan fruit in imagery and pick the\
    \ fruit with a UAV device. An RGB-D camera\non the UAV was used to collect images\
    \ of the fruits. As mentioned in the paper, one of\nthe disadvantages of UAVs\
    \ is that they are easily affected by local circulation and airﬂow\nwhen capturing\
    \ images, resulting in blurred images of the fruits. In the preprocessing of\n\
    the data, a Fuzzy image processing algorithm was used to remove the blurred images\
    \ from\nthe data set.\nFPN, YOLOv3, YOLOv4, MobileNet-SSD, YOLOv4-tiny, and MobileNet-YOLOv4\n\
    models were trained on the images to detect and locate string fruits, simple fruits,\
    \ and fruit\nbranches. In the ﬁnal phase, the detection results are mapped onto\
    \ the optimized depth\nimage to extract the contours and spatial information of\
    \ the three targets. Based on this in-\nformation, the drone can detect and locate\
    \ the fruits and use them in harvesting. In general,\nthe YOLO models had faster\
    \ detection speed and achieved better accuracy than the FPN\nand SSD models. MobileNet-YOLOv4\
    \ achieved the best performance in terms of accuracy\n(mAP = 89.73) and inference\
    \ time (68 s), while FPN achieved the worst performance.\nTo test the model in\
    \ orchards, a picking platform was developed with a UAV, a Jetson\nTX2, an RGB-D\
    \ camera, a set of scissors with clamps, and a support frame. The accuracy\nrate\
    \ of successful harvesting in four cases was reported as 75, 75, 69.23, and 68.42.\n\
    Aghi et al. [106] presents a low-cost, energy-efﬁcient local motion planner for\
    \ au-\ntonomous navigation of robots in vineyards based on RGB-D images, low-range\
    \ hardware\n(a low-cost device with low power and limited computational capabilities),\
    \ and two control\nalgorithms. The ﬁrst algorithm uses the disparity map and its\
    \ depth representation to\ngenerate proportional control for the robot platform.\
    \ The second backup algorithm, based\non a deep learning algorithm, takes control\
    \ of the machine when the ﬁrst block brieﬂy fails\nand generates high-level motion\
    \ primitives.\nAn Intel RealSense Depth Camera D435i RGB-D camera was used to\
    \ capture images\nand compute the depth map on the platform. The video was captured\
    \ in different terrain,\nquality, and time of day. Then, a light depth map-based\
    \ algorithm processes the depth\nmaps to detect the end of the vineyard row and\
    \ then calculates control values for linear and\nangular velocities using a proportional\
    \ controller. Since, as in many outdoor applications,\nsunlight negatively affects\
    \ the quality of the results and interferes with the control provided\nby the\
    \ local navigation algorithm, MobileNet was trained to classify whether the camera\n\
    was pointed at the center of the end of the vineyard row or one of its sides,\
    \ and it was used\nwhen the ﬁrst algorithm failed due to outdoor conditions. The\
    \ CNN model was trained\nwith transfer learning and classiﬁed the images into\
    \ three classes: Middle, Left, and Right.\nFor the middle class, the video was\
    \ taken in rows with the camera pointed at the center,\nand for the other two\
    \ classes, the videos were rotated left and right with the camera at a\n45-degree\
    \ angle to the long axis of the row. The accuracy of the model on the test set\
    \ was\none. The model was trained on a small portion of the data set to investigate\
    \ the signiﬁcance\nof the size of the data set. The accuracy of the model decreased\
    \ by 6% with the small\ndata set.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n34 of 43\nTable\

    \ optimized by discarding all redundant operations and\nreducing the ﬂoating-point\
    \ accuracy from 32 to 16 bits. The accuracy of the optimized\nmodel was the same\
    \ as the original and the time inference was improved. The proposed\nmodel was\
    \ implemented on a robot and the tests were performed in a new vineyard\nscenario.\
    \ The ﬁrst algorithm can detect the end of the vineyard regardless of the direction\n\
    of the long axis of the robot. When the ﬁrst algorithm fails, the CNN model jumps\
    \ in and\ndetects the end of the vineyard.\nBadeka et al. [107] trained YOLOv3\
    \ to detect grape crates in the ﬁeld for use on robots\nharvesting grapes. The\
    \ images of the crate were taken under natural ﬁeld conditions. Three\ndata enhancement\
    \ techniques were used, including rotation, noise, processing, and blur\nprocessing.\
    \ The model achieved an accuracy of 99.74% (mAP%) with an inference time\nof 0.26\
    \ s. To use the trained model on robots, it must be deployed on edge devices and\n\
    report the inference time and accuracy of the model on these devices. Another\
    \ interesting\nproblem is that the robot can detect whether the box is full or\
    \ not.\nMajeed et al. [108] combined the DL model with mathematical models to\
    \ detect\ncordons in grape canopies and determine their trajectories. Images were\
    \ taken so that a tree\ntrunk was approximately in the center of the ﬁeld of view\
    \ of a high-resolution camera (Sony\nCyber-shot RX100 IV). A total of 191 images\
    \ of random RGB images were captured from two\ndifferent vineyard blocks with\
    \ different cultivars. Each image in the dataset was classiﬁed\ninto three classes:\
    \ Background, Trunk, and Cordon (http://hdl.handle.net/2376/16939,\naccessed on\
    \ 1 September 2021). Since the background pixels in the labeled images covered\n\
    most of the images, a weight was assigned to each class in the preprocessing of\
    \ the data,\nwhich was calculated using a median frequency class balancing method\
    \ to avoid bias during\ntraining. Data augmentation and transfer learning techniques\
    \ were used in this work.\nA fully convolutional neural network (FCN) and SegNet\
    \ with VGG and AlexNet\nbackbones were trained to segment the cordons in the images.\
    \ The FCN-VGG16 network\nachieved the best performance in terms of mean accuracy\
    \ and F1-score compared to the\nother networks. In the next step, the mathematical\
    \ model including the Fourier model,\nGaussian model, polynomial model, and sine\
    \ sum model was applied to estimate the\ntrajectory of the cordons. The sixth-order\
    \ polynomial equation with an average R2 value of\n0.99 had the best ﬁt for the\
    \ trajectories of the cordons compared to the other mathematical\nmodels tested.\n\
    Pinto de Aguiar et al. [109] trained seven different DL models for detecting grapevine\n\
    stems in two vineyards in Portugal. The trained models included Single Shot Multi-\n\
    box (SSD) MobileNet-V1 (α = 0.75), SSD MobileNet-V1 with different hyperparameters\n\
    (α = 0.75), SSD MobileNet-V2, Pooling Pyramid Network (PPN) MobileNet-V1, SSDLite\n\
    MobileNet-V2, SSD Inception-V2, Tiny YOLO-V3. In this work, Transfer Learning\
    \ was ap-\nplied using the COCO dataset. A dataset was created using a robotic\
    \ platform. This dataset\ncontains images captured in two different vineyards,\
    \ using two cameras each, including\nthe Raspberry Pi cameras and a conventional\
    \ infrared ﬁlter, and the other camera Mako\nG-125C and an infrared ﬁlter (dataset\
    \ is available at http://vcriis01.inesctec.pt/-DS_AG_39,\naccessed on 1 September\

    \ and NVIDIA’s Jetson Nano were used for real-time inference\nof the model in\
    \ a real-world application. The advantage of NVIDIA’s Jetson Nano over\nGoogle’s\
    \ USB Accelerator is that it supports ﬂoating points and more models. However,\n\
    Google’s USB Accelerator outperformed NVIDIA’s Jetson Nano in terms of inference\

    \ and thermal images of a single vineyard and include the anno-\ntations for each\
    \ image (http://vcriis01.inesctec.pt/datasets/DataSet/VineSet.zip, accessed\n\
    on 2 September 2021). A robotic platform AgRob V16 with a frontal stereo RGB camera\n\
    and a frontal thermal camera was used to capture a video from which the images\
    \ were\nextracted. Data augmentation methods such as rotation, translation, scaling,\
    \ ﬂipping, hue\nand saturation, Gaussian noise, and random combination were used\
    \ to resize the dataset\nto a suitable size for the seepage learning method. Two\
    \ training datasets were used to\nevaluate the effect of the training dataset\
    \ size on the performance of the detectors. The\noriginal VineSet dataset and\
    \ a small subset of it containing 336 non-augmented images\nwere used. The SSD\

    \ was faster\nthan SSD Inception. The performance of the models trained with a\
    \ small dataset dropped\nsigniﬁcantly (with a maximum of AP = 34.42), reinforcing\
    \ the importance of the dataset\nsize for the performance of the deep learning\
    \ model.\nThe SSD MobileNet-V1 trained with VineSet was published on the Google\
    \ Colabora-\ntory platform (https://colab.research.google.com, accessed on 1 September\
    \ 2021) to help\nresearchers automatically label the new dataset and then manually\
    \ correct the labeling.\nLabeling the data is one of the challenges of using the\
    \ DL model. In this way, labeling the\nimages of the trunk becomes less time-consuming.\n\
    4. Discussion\nDeep learning is already being used in various areas of agriculture,\
    \ but it is still far\nfrom being widely applied in agriculture. In this paper,\
    \ we reviewed 46 recent research\npapers to examine the challenges of using deep\
    \ learning in agriculture. Figure 13 shows\nthe pie chart of the researched papers\
    \ based on the application domain.\nDisease Detection\nYield Prediction\nWeed\
    \ Detection\nSpecies Detection\nSoil Management\nWater Management\nAutomation\
    \ \nFigure 13. Pie chart representing the papers by application area.\nThe following\
    \ challenges can be pointed out from the reviewed articles. The most\ncritical\
    \ point concerns the dataset. Training the model with a small dataset can lead\
    \ to\nsigniﬁcant failures [18,72,106] and even with transfer learning and data\
    \ augmentation,\ntraining the model may require a sufﬁcient amount of data [55].\
    \ The presence of the image\nunder ﬁeld conditions in the data set is very important\
    \ [63]. Therefore, collecting authentic\nﬁeld images and datasets under different\
    \ conditions is the ﬁrst and most important step.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n\
    38 of 43\nUsing open-source datasets, sharing the dataset with other researchers,\
    \ data augmentation,\nand transfer learning properly can help to overcome these\
    \ challenges [71,77].\nIn addition, agricultural image datasets are more complex\
    \ due to outdoor conditions,\nthe object of interest usually occupying a very\
    \ small and uncentered part of the image,\nsimilarity between objects and background,\
    \ blocking the object with leaves and branches,\nmultiple objects in one image,\
    \ and many more [31,63,65,68,79,82]. To be applicable in the\nreal world, the\
    \ dataset should fully represent the state of the environment. In some cases,\n\
    such as variable illuminance, data augmentation may also be helpful.\nThe type\
    \ of input affects the performance of the model [55,62,88,92]. Removing\nbackground\
    \ from images [55], using different color spaces and vegetarian indices as in-\n\
    put [62], detecting crop at different growth stages [81], adding vegetarian indices\
    \ to the\ninput [30,86], cropping the input image [91], and data from different\
    \ climate types [99]\nchange the performance of the model. The size of the input\
    \ also affects the runtime and\naccuracy of the model [62,79]. Therefore, it is\
    \ challenging to determine the best input set\nfor the speciﬁc task.\nLabeling\
    \ large amounts of data is expensive and time-consuming [55]. In addition,\nthere\
    \ are some tasks, such as those related to plant diseases, that can only be performed\n\
    by specialists in the ﬁeld. Even when using open-source datasets with already\
    \ annotated\ndata, there is no way to ﬁnd out who actually did the annotation.\
    \ As it was seen in\nseveral papers, data augmentation and transfer learning are\
    \ ways to avoid labeling a\nlarge dataset, but labeling a small dataset is still\
    \ time-consuming [55]. Unsupervised and\nsemi-supervised learning methods can\
    \ be of great help but need further investigation in\nthis area [35,36,61,83].\n\
    When choosing a model for a task, there is a tradeoff between accuracy and inference\n\
    time [26,34,65,67,77,96]. Depending on the application, the model can be chosen.\n\
    Neither environment is similar in the ﬁeld of agriculture, and each environment\
    \ and\nproblem requires its own dataset, and therefore the DL model may not be\
    \ universally\napplicable, i.e., if a model has been trained with a dataset from\
    \ a particular site or a dataset\nfrom an open-source site such as ImageNet, it\
    \ may not be able to be used at another site, or\naccuracy may decrease when applied\
    \ to the dataset collected in the real world [12,69]. The\nchanges in the visual\
    \ appearance of the images in the training and test dataset could lead\nto a decrease\
    \ in model performance [30]. One way to overcome this is to retrain the already\n\
    trained model with a small dataset from the new environment [86].\nThe design\
    \ of deep models is complex and they are referred to as black boxes [7]. One\n\
    of the challenges in training DL models is that a system with very high computational\n\
    power (GPU) is needed [7]. Moreover, the performance of these models depends on\
    \ the\nchoice of hyperparameters, loss functions, and optimization algorithm [60,67].\
    \ Algorithms\nsuch as Bayesian optimization [110] can help to ﬁnd the right hyperparameters\
    \ [102].\nGoogle researchers used neural architecture search (NAS) algorithm [111]\
    \ to ﬁnd state of\nthe art MobilenetV3 [112]. NAS is a method that searches among\
    \ all possible combinations\nof submodules that can be repeatedly assembled to\
    \ obtain the entire model with the best\npossible accuracy.\nThe other challenge\
    \ relates to the real-time applicability of the models. Most deep\nlearning models\
    \ have many parameters that need to be trained, and after training the\nmodel,\
    \ inference of the model is not made in real-time. In some applications, such\
    \ as using\na robot for harvesting, time inference is essential. As we see in\
    \ this work, most of the\nmodels are implemented and tested on the PC, which requires\
    \ power and it is impractical\nin real applications. Moreover, implementation\
    \ on devices such as smartphones still, brings\nvarious challenges that need to\
    \ be considered, such as memory consumption, speed, etc.\nSingle-stage detection\
    \ models such as YOLO and SSD, lightweight classiﬁcation models\nsuch as MobileNet,\
    \ the development of edge devices such as Raspberry Pi and Jetson nano,\nand the\
    \ use of cloud computing have made it possible to deploy Deep Learning models\
    \ in\nreal-world applications and practical ways [34,52,72,86,109]. The quantization\
    \ method can\nbe also used to compress the model size and improve the detection\
    \ speed [82].\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 638\n39 of 43\nOn small farms, the use of\
    \ some methods is sometimes impractical because farmers\nmust have some knowledge\
    \ to interpret the results obtained. For example, the model\nthat predicts soil\
    \ moisture for irrigation scheduling requires a human expert to use this\ninformation\
    \ to determine the best time and amount of water for irrigation. As mentioned\n\
    earlier, Deep Reinforcement Learning is showing great success in several areas\
    \ as a promis-\ning model for building smart farms in several areas [39]. The\
    \ model can be trained to\nmake decisions about when and how much to irrigate\
    \ [38,40]. Information generated by\nIoT devices also helps farmers track agricultural\
    \ operations and make better decisions to\nimprove agricultural productivity [97].\n\
    5. Conclusions\nThis paper discussed some recent work on the application of DL\
    \ to agriculture and\nbiodiversity and highlighted some challenges in this area.\
    \ More sustainable agriculture\nand the promotion of biodiversity in agricultural\
    \ systems can be achieved by reducing the\nuse of agrochemicals, low pesticide\
    \ use and organic farming, appropriate crop rotations,\nsmall-scale ﬁelds, and\
    \ the preservation of natural spaces between agroecosystems [113]. As\nmentioned,\
    \ this can be achieved through the new IoT technology in combination with the\n\
    new biodiversity algorithms and Artiﬁcial Intelligence model. They can be used\
    \ to detect\nand control species and also to improve ecosystem state and thus\
    \ productivity having to\nresort to the use of environmentally damaging practices.\n\
    The novelty of the application of DL models and the challenges identiﬁed in agriculture\n\
    demonstrates the need for further research. CNN is the most widely used DL model\
    \ in\nagriculture. The use of new methods, such as attention mechanisms, new lightweight\n\
    models, single-stage detection models, can improve the performance of the model,\
    \ as a\nslight improvement in accuracy and run time can signiﬁcantly improve the\
    \ ﬁnal results.\nIn the future, we expect to develop or improve models that help\
    \ farmers make crop\nmanagement decisions. These models can be integrated into\
    \ decision support tools, and\nthese tools can guide users through precise steps\
    \ and suggest optimal decision paths. It is\nexpected that the development of\
    \ these models will also enable biodiversity monitoring.\nConsequently, the adoption\
    \ of new sustainable practices supported by DL models and\nbiodiversity monitoring\
    \ will help manage the farm with minimal human intervention and\ngreater effectiveness.\n\

    agriculture more efficient by combining new technologies to improve its procedure.
    Improving irrigation efficiency in agriculture is thus critical for the survival
    of sustainable agricultural production. Smart irrigation methods can enhance irrigation
    efficiency, specially with the introduction of wireless communication systems,
    monitoring devices, and enhanced control techniques for efficient irrigation scheduling.
    The study compared on a wide range of study subjects to investigate scientific
    approaches for smart irrigation. As a result, this project included a wide range
    of topics related to irrigation methods, decision-making, and technology used.
    Information was gathered from a variety of scientific papers. So, our research
    relied on several published documents, the majority of which were published during
    the last four years, and authors from all over the world. In the meantime, various
    irrigation initiatives were given special attention. Following that, the evaluation
    focuses on the key components of smart irrigation, such as real-time irrigation
    scheduling, IoT, the importance of an internet connection, smart sensing, and
    energy harvesting. Published in: IEEE Access ( Early Access ) Page(s): 1 - 1 Date

    \ is central to the economy of the world, with sixty percent of the \npopulation\
    \ depending on it for survival. Farmers are adopting smart farming technics to\
    \ \nmake agricultural practices more efficient. Smart farming takes advantage\
    \ of Internet of \nThings (IoT) technologies for performing tasks such as moisture\
    \ sensing, weeding, \nkeeping vigilance, spraying, bird and animal scaring, smart\
    \ irrigation controls, the use of \nreal time field data for intelligent decision\
    \ making and smart warehouse management \nwhich includes theft detection and temperature\
    \ and humidity maintenance of the \nwarehouse. Smart devices such as watches,\
    \ computers or cellphones connected to the \ninternet can then be used to control\
    \ the smart farming system. Smart farming being at \nnascent stage, its privacy\
    \ and security needs to be researched and explored as its future \npartially dependent\
    \ on the resolution of the privacy and security issues associated. This \npaper\
    \ comprehensively reviews various security and privacy issues and challenges \n\
    associated with IoT deployments in smart farming. Following a structured approach,\
    \ a \nframework for smart farming security and privacy was developed in an attempt\
    \ to address \nchallenges experienced/expected. This framework can also be used\
    \ for future directions \nfor any IoT related privacy and security initiatives.\
    \ \n1 Introduction \nThe growth in global population is leading to increased food\
    \ requirement needs of the modern-day \ncivilization requires increased food production.\
    \ Unfortunately, traditional farming methods with low \nyields for fruit and crops\
    \ are still predominantly used. But wherever automation has been implemented,\
    \ \nyield improvement has been evident (Gondchawar & Kawitkar, 2016). This highlights\
    \ the need to \nintroduce modern technologies to the agriculture sector to achieve\
    \ better yields.  \n \nThe new technologies and solutions being implemented in\
    \ agriculture increase efficiency in methods \nfor gathering and processing data\
    \ while enhancing net productivity (Ray, 2017). On the other hand, the \nKalpa\
    \ Publications in Computing\nVolume 12, 2019, Pages 95–104\nProceedings of 4th\
    \ International Conference on the\nInternet, Cyber Security and Information Systems\
    \ 2019\nK. Njenga (ed.), ICICIS 2019 (Kalpa Publications in Computing, vol. 12),\
    \ pp. 95–104\nwater crisis and alarming climate change require new and improved\
    \ methods of farming. Automation \nand intelligent decision making technologies\
    \ are therefore also important in accomplishing this mission \n(Fan TongKe, 2013).\
    \ Amongst technologies that are making it possible are; IoT, remote sensing, \n\
    ubiquitous computing, cloud computing, Radio Frequency Identifier and wireless\
    \ and sensor networks \n(Ray, 2017).  \n \nHowever, this study only focuses on\
    \ IoT, which is “a collection of many interconnected objects, \nservices, humans,\
    \ and devices that can communicate, share data, and information to achieve a common\
    \ \ngoal in different areas and applications. IoT is fast tracked by the rapid\
    \ growth in nanotechnology which \nenables production of small and cheap sensors.\
    \ This has brought about great potential towards faster \ndecision making and\
    \ automation in the agriculture industry in the following smart farming techniques:\
    \ \n(automated irrigation scheduling (Reche, Sendra, Díaz, & Lloret, 2015), precision\
    \ agriculture (Barcelo-\nOrdinas, Chanet, Hou, & García-Vidal, 2013; Ray, 2017),\
    \ optimization of plant growth (Hwang, Shin, \n& Yoe, 2010), green-house monitoring\
    \ (Mao, Miao, He, Li, & Liu, 2012), farm land monitoring (Corke \net al., 2010),\
    \ and farming production process management (Dong, Vuran, & Irmak, 2013)). This\
    \ rapid \ndevelopment in the Internet of Things in agriculture has propelled the\
    \ phenomenon that is called Smart \nFarming (Sundmaeker, Verdouw, Wolfert, & Freire,\
    \ 2016).  \n \nAlthough smart farming promotes the increase of yields, reduces\
    \ operating costs, and increases \nagility, its unique architecture raises numerous\
    \ security and privacy concerns. The huge amounts of \ndata that are shared in\
    \ IoT-enabled environments can be harnessed by malicious applications that can\
    \ \nuse to the disadvantage of some aspect of smart farming. Thus, understanding\
    \ and minimization of these \nsecurity and privacy risks by the development of\
    \ efficient and effective cybersecurity solutions is \ncritical for the success\
    \ of smart farming initiatives. Since both IoT and smart farming are relatively\
    \ new \nphenomena, their knowledge concerning security and privacy implications\
    \ is not widespread as \nexpected. Some authors have labeled these technologies\
    \ as “technology hypes that may fail to \nmaterialize.” (Fenn & LeHong, 2011).\
    \  \n \nThis research paper provides insight into smart farming and goes on to\
    \ identify the most important \nsecurity and privacy challenges they expose farmers\
    \ to. Lastly, we introduce a framework to help \nmitigate the smart farming security\
    \ and privacy challenges exposed. We acknowledge both technical \nand human security\
    \ and privacy challenges, however, the paper mainly focuses on the human aspect\
    \ of \nprivacy and security in smart farming because it seems as though not enough\
    \ research has been done. \nIn line with that, this paper seeks to answer the\
    \ following research questions:  \n1. What are the privacy and security issues\
    \ in IoT?  \n2. How do humans affect the privacy and security of IoT initiatives?\
    \  \n3. How can the impact of human weakness in the privacy and security of IoT\
    \ be reduced?  \n \nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows; firstly,\
    \ it will highlight the contribution of this \nstudy, it will then discuss a review\
    \ of related literature after which it will provide the brief methodology \nfor\
    \ the research followed by a description of the proposed framework. The last section\
    \ will conclude \nand provide recommendations for further research and actions.\
    \ \n2  Related Literature \nAgriculture has seen three revolutions already, from\
    \ plants animal domestication a few thousand \nyears ago, systematic crop rotational\
    \ methods of a few hundred years ago and the “green revolution” \nwhich came with\
    \ the use of fertilizers, pesticides, genetic modifications and introduction of\
    \ systematic \nbreeding a few decades ago (Walter, Finger, Huber, & Buchmann,\
    \ 2017). We suggest that agriculture \nIoT Security and Privacy: Turning on the\
    \ Human Firewall in Smart Farming\nGundu and Maronga\n96\nis undergoing a fourth\
    \ revolution triggered by the increasing population that in turn is increasing\
    \ the \ndemand of food. Ray (2017) warns that the growth rate in food production\
    \ is not at par with the food \nrequired by the growing population. The Food and\
    \ Agriculture Organization of the United Nations \n(How to Feed the World in 2050)\
    \ recently published a report showing a prediction of global food \nrequirements\
    \ reaching 3 billion tons by 2050 from 1.5 billion in 2015. This calls for an\
    \ exploration of \nnew and modern technologies that can be used in agricultural\
    \ applications to achieve the target. As a \nresult, this is accelerating the\
    \ incorporation of sensors and IoT into agriculture, giving birth to smart \n\
    farming. \n \n2.1 Internet of Things (IoT) \n \nIoT is rapidly gaining momentum\
    \ in modern wireless telecommunications. The basic IoT concept \nlays around connection\
    \ and use of a variety of technologies (such as Radio-Frequency IDentification\
    \ \n(RFID) tags, sensors, computers, actuators, smart watches, mobile phones,\
    \ etc.). These technologies \ninteract with each other through unique addressing\
    \ schemes to achieve common goals (Pecorella, \nPierucci, & Nizzi, 2018). The\
    \ integration of IoT with humans can take advantage of collaboration and \ntechnical\
    \ analytics to achieve real-time decision making (Angelini, Mugellini, Abou Khaled,\
    \ & \nCouture, 2018; Ray, 2017). IERC (‘IERC-European Research Cluster on the\
    \ Internet of Things’, 2014) \nwhich seems to have the most cited definition,\
    \ defines IoT as follows: “A dynamic global network \ninfrastructure with self-configuring\
    \ capabilities based on standard and interoperable communication \nprotocols where\
    \ physical and virtual ‘things’ have identities, physical attributes, and virtual\
    \ \npersonalities and use intelligent interfaces, and are seamlessly integrated\
    \ into the information network, \noften communicate data associate with users\
    \ and their environments.” \n \n2.2 Smart Farming \nSmart farming is the use of\
    \ modern technology to improve the amount and quality of agricultural \nproducts.\
    \ Walter et al (Walter et al., 2017) advocates that, apart from the use of intelligent\
    \ sensors, \nsmart farming  also encompasses the use of robotic vehicles (e.g.\
    \ for application of fertilizer, weeding \nand fruit harvesting). They also elaborate\
    \ that the drones with autonomous flight control, bundled with \npowerful hyperspectral\
    \ and high-resolution cameras are also being used to calculate biomass \ndevelopment\
    \ and fertilization status of crops, is another form of sophisticated smart farming.\
    \ Another \ncommon form of smart farming innovation is virtual fencing technologies\
    \ which assist cattle herd \nmanagement by the use of Global Positioning System\
    \ Sensors (GPS) sensors attached to the livestock \nand monitored on computer\
    \ or smart phones. This management can also be achieved by the use of real \n\
    time remote-sensing signals. Combined, these technical improvements discussed\
    \ constitute a technical \nrevolution that can generate positive changes in agricultural\
    \ practices. These trends for farming are not \nonly applicable to developed countries\
    \ but also to developing countries, especially where deployments \nin ICT (e.g.,\
    \ use of smart phones, access to the Internet) are being adopted at a rapid pace.\
    \ The rapid \ndecrease in price for IoT based sensors for smart farming solutions\
    \ is also opening a possibility for \nsmart faming initiatives in emerging economies\
    \ as the farmers can also afford them (Ray, 2017). \n \nSmart farming reduces\
    \ the ecological footprint of farming due to efficient site-specific application\
    \ \nof inputs, such as fertilizers and pesticides. This makes agriculture more\
    \ profitable for the farmer as \nresource inputs would have been decreased. It\
    \ also assists with mitigation of leaching problems as well \nas greenhouse gas\
    \ emissions (Mahmoud, Yousuf, Aloul, & Zualkernan, 2015) and increase reliability\
    \ \nof spatially explicit data which will ultimately reduce farming risks. Optimal,\
    \ yield projections, site-\nIoT Security and Privacy: Turning on the Human Firewall\
    \ in Smart Farming\nGundu and Maronga\n97\nspecific weather forecasts, and diseases\
    \ and disasters probability maps based on weather and climate \ndata will help\
    \ plan and optimize cultivation of crops (Walter et al., 2017). With the IoT,\
    \ it is possible \nto create a sensor network allowing for almost continuous monitoring\
    \ of the farm reducing the time \nneeded for surveillance.  \n \nIn principle,\
    \ optimization of farming activities due to smart farming should lead to better\
    \ product \nquality (e.g., watering an orchard when the moisture level has not\
    \ dropped too much, produces better \njuicier fruits or better-quality milk produced\
    \ by individualized feeding of cattle). Better quality products \nare not only\
    \ healthier but also generate more profits as they sell at higher prices.  \n\
    \ \nBecause there are numerous players in smart farming, this introduces a challenge\
    \ of accountability \nfor malpractice or mistakes that may lead to environmental\
    \ and/or economic consequences. For \nexample, it is difficult to establish the\
    \ source of the problem if a consumer gets sick from eating \nharvested fruits\
    \ that still had traces of fertilizer or pesticides because it was applied too\
    \ late. Should the \nblame be on the farmer, or the software vendor, or the network\
    \ provider, or the manufacturer of the \nsensor? As at the time of publishing\
    \ of this paper, there is no straightforward answer to address such an \nincident.\
    \  Another challenge is that smart farming can lead to serious disease outbreaks\
    \ if not monitored \nproperly. Efficient use of fungicide in a smart farming environment\
    \ may delay disease outbreaks which \nthen increases the risk of creating fungicide\
    \ resistant traits which is even more devastating. \n \nContrary to the view that\
    \ the automation in smart farming eliminates the need of human labor \ntherefore\
    \ increases the unemployment rate, this whole process will always require humans\
    \ however at \na much higher intelligent level. Machines will only conduct the\
    \ monotonous and tiring operational \nactivities (Walter et al., 2017). \n \n\
    2.3 Security and Privacy \nWe will discuss the security and privacy challenges\
    \ of smart farming as well as those of IoT in \ngeneral as they also filter into\
    \ smart farming. These challenges can be broadly divided into technological \n\
    challenges and human challenges (Gundu, Flowerday, & Renaud, 2019; Mahmoud et\
    \ al., 2015). The \ntechnological challenges in smart farming mainly arise due\
    \ to its heterogeneous and ubiquitous nature. \nIf magnified closer, these challenges\
    \ have to do with wireless technologies, scalability and energy.  The \nhuman\
    \ challenges are related to the awareness and knowledge of principles and functionalities\
    \ that \nshould be followed to achieve and maintain a secure smart farming environment.\
    \ These human \nchallenges evolve around the ability to ensure security by authentication,\
    \ confidentiality, end-to-end \nsecurity, integrity etc. (Mahmoud et al., 2015).\
    \ \n \nIn the recent years, there has been a lot of effort attempting to address\
    \ security and privacy issues \nsmart paradigms (Alaba, Othman, Hashem, & Alotaibi,\
    \ 2017; Cho, Cho, Shin, Park, & Lee, 2012; Corke \net al., 2010; Fagade & Tryfonas,\
    \ 2016; Granjal, Monteiro, & Sa Silva, 2015; Hwang et al., 2010; \nOleshchuk,\
    \ 2009; Pecorella et al., 2018; Zhou, Cao, Dong, & Vasilakos, 2017). Collectively,\
    \ the authors \ntouch on trust management, authentication, intrusion detection\
    \ systems, privacy issues, data security, \nnetwork security, access control systems,\
    \ fault tolerance and digital forensics. An IoT project requires \nsome form of\
    \ trust, privacy, and security model implementation. This model should address\
    \ data \nintegrity, confidentiality and end-to-end communication issues. To probe\
    \ into data misuse, the model \nshould also address access policies and encrypting\
    \ mechanisms to be used.  \n \nThe classic security goals of Confidentiality,\
    \ Integrity and Availability (CIA) of any cyber system \nalso apply to IoT. However,\
    \ IoT based smart systems have other restrictions and limitations. These are \n\
    IoT Security and Privacy: Turning on the Human Firewall in Smart Farming\nGundu\
    \ and Maronga\n98\nprimarily due to computational power limitations of the devices\
    \ and the heterogonous and ubiquitous \nnature of IoT. To address that, we suggest\
    \ authentication, lightweight solutions, heterogeneity, policies \nand key management\
    \ systems to be added to the traditional CIA triad, which will be discussed below.\
    \ \n \nSecurity and privacy issues that may arise due to weaknesses of the human\
    \ in smart farming are \ninterception, node capture attack, dos attack, man-in-the-middle\
    \ attack and data theft. Technological \nissues include compatibility, wireless\
    \ signal strength, storage capacity, power consumption, and \ncomputation capability.\
    \ In general, when designing IoT applications it is important to take the following\
    \ \ninto account: how will different users interact with the devices, how much\
    \ data will be revealed and \nwho will be managing the applications. Therefore,\
    \ users should have tools that control data to be \ndisclosed, by whom and when\
    \ (Mahmoud et al., 2015). \n \n \n3 Contribution \nThis paper contributes to the\
    \ body of knowledge as follows.  \n \nAnalysis of the advantages of smart farming.\
    \  \n \nAnalysis of privacy and security issues related to IoT and smart farming\
    \ deployments with \nrespect to the human aspect. \n \nDevelopment of a framework\
    \ that can be followed to reduce the effect of the human \nweakness in terms of\
    \ privacy and security of smart farming. \n \n \n4 Methodology \nIn order to address\
    \ the research questions outlined in the Introduction, we reviewed literature\
    \ from \nJanuary 2009 to January 2019. This review period was chosen due to the\
    \ fact that IoT and smart farming \nare recent phenomena, hence as a practical\
    \ consideration we did not expect to access older studies \nwithin articles prior\
    \ to 2009. Apart from inclusion by period of publication, we also used two other\
    \ \ninclusion criteria for the literature search. These encompassed whether it\
    \ was a full article publication \nand its relevance to the research questions.\
    \ Exclusion of previous literature was also based on two \ndifferent criteria:\
    \ either the articles were not published in English or the articles focused solely\
    \ on \ntechnological designs. The literature survey was undertaken using the following\
    \ systematic approach: \na search on two major bibliographical databases was carried\
    \ out, on Science Direct and Scopus. This \nsearch was conducted using a combinations\
    \ of keywords which were separated into two groups, the \nfirst addressing Smart\
    \ Farming (i.e. precision farming, agri-food, sensor-driven innovation, \ntechnologies\
    \ in farming, internet of things, IoT) and the second group focusing on cybersecurity\
    \ (i.e. \nhuman centered security, awareness campaigns, training). The choice\
    \ of the two databases was based \non their wide coverage of relevant literature\
    \ and their capability to suggest related articles or citations. \nA total of\
    \ 359 peer-reviewed articles were retrieved from the two databases. These were\
    \ filtered by \nscanning for relevance. This involved identifying sections of\
    \ the text that address the research questions. \nFollowed by screening, where,\
    \ the search function was used to locate the paragraphs containing the key \n\
    words. We then analyzed the text to identify links to our research questions.\
    \  \n \nIoT Security and Privacy: Turning on the Human Firewall in Smart Farming\n\
    Gundu and Maronga\n99\nWe used Zotero reference management software to manage\
    \ the articles and eventually, 21 articles \nwere considered as very relevant\
    \ and 93 as relatively relevant. The remainder of the articles were \nirrelevant\
    \ and excluded from this analysis because they did not speak to smart farming\
    \ or cybersecurity. \nThe number of relevant peer reviewed literature was very\
    \ low; however, this was not surprising as IoT \nand Smart Farming are relatively\
    \ new concepts. Their applications are rapidly evolvingpeer reviewed \narticles\
    \ are lagging behind as usually the case with most technologies. This led to the\
    \ decision to also \ninclude grey literature into the review. This comprised using\
    \ Google Scholar and LexisNexis search \nengine. Thus, we managed to obtain magazines,\
    \ reports, blogs, and other web-items. This resulted in \n213 magazine articles,\
    \ 4 reports, 119 blogs and 19 items on twitter. Each of the 119 blogs had their\
    \ title \nand sentences scanned for relevance and duplicated blogs were removed.\
    \ As a result, 21 blogs were \nselected for additional evaluation through further\
    \ reading. Eventually, 7 blogs were considered as \ncontaining relevant information\
    \ for our study. Each of the 213 magazine articles was similarly evaluated \n\
    and 9 articles were considered as containing relevant information. The analysis\
    \ and synthesis of the \nliterature led to the development of the framework presented\
    \ in the next section. \n5 Proposed Framework \nThis paper argues that for the\
    \ technological security measures put in place to be effective, the user \nof\
    \ the system should be aware of the security risks associated and how to behave\
    \ securely. Technology \nshould complement and supplement the human element not\
    \ the other way around. The \ntechnological/physical firewall can be deemed useless\
    \ if the ‘human firewall’ is not turned on, as it is \nthe human who controls\
    \ the technology. In summary, we suggest that the human element is at the Centre\
    \ \nof any security and privacy initiative. \n \nThe proposed privacy and security\
    \ framework for smart farming in figure 1 has constructs guided \nby how literature\
    \ seems to address the human and technological aspects of privacy and security\
    \ attempts \nto highlight that enhanced security and privacy can only be achieved\
    \ by considering both technological \nand human aspects. \n \n5.1 Technology Aspect\
    \ \nAppropriate technological infrastructure is essential in making smart farming\
    \ systems function. \nAlthough literature does not have much information on infrastructures\
    \ being used, the few mentioned \nare supplied by large venture capital vendors\
    \ such as AGCO, John Deere, KAA IoT, ThingsWorkx, \nBlue River Technologies, Thingsboard.io\
    \ and Monsanto. However, the demands of the fourth industrial \nEnhanced Smart\
    \ Farming Security & Privacy \nFigure 1: A privacy and security framework for\
    \ smart farming \nAwareness & Training \nHuman \nAspect \nTechnology \nAspect\
    \ \nVendor \nIoT Security and Privacy: Turning on the Human Firewall in Smart\
    \ Farming\nGundu and Maronga\n100\nrevolution particularly smart farming are now\
    \ attracting organizations that were previously not active \nin traditional agriculture.\
    \ For example, a Japanese technology firm (Fujitsu) now hosts cloud-based \nfarming\
    \ systems. In North America, there are several initiatives for example the facilitation\
    \ of data \nacquisition via an open-source hardware platform and software libraries\
    \ known as the ISOBlue project \nand the Open Ag Toolkit (OpenATK) (Ray, 2017)\
    \ In Europe, FIWARE was developed. It is for cloud \nhosting, data management,\
    \ provision of IoT services, cybersecurity and analysis of Big Data (Wolfert,\
    \ \nGe, Verdouw, & Bogaardt, 2017).  \n \nSince, devices (sensors, computers,\
    \ cellphones, routers, etc.) in smart farming are manufactured and \ndistributed\
    \ by different vendors, trust should be established between them and the farmers.\
    \ For this to \nhappen the devices they supply should be technically secure. This\
    \ leaves the aspect of the technological \naspect of privacy and security primarily\
    \ on the vendors. However, these vendors should train the \nfarmers on the use\
    \ of their devices and advise them on possible risks and how to use the devices\
    \ \nsecurely.  \n \n5.2 Human Aspect \nThe challenge for smart farming is to ensure\
    \ awareness of security and privacy to the farmers and \ntheir employees and also\
    \ to ensure that they are trained on how to implement safety in their daily \n\
    routines in a consistent manner. Technical security controls may only assist in\
    \ reducing the threat of \nmalicious people such as hackers, competitors or disgruntled\
    \ employees. However, the defense against \nnaïvetés and lacking understanding\
    \ necessary to safeguard the smart farming system may be achieved \nby vigorous\
    \ security awareness and training programs.  \n \nThe trusted human (employee)\
    \ typically has unregulated access to some part or else parts of the \nsmart farming\
    \ system. This makes it possible for a naive farmer or employee to breach security\
    \ and \nprivacy measures put in place from within the system’s perimeter defenses\
    \ without triggering the \nperimeter defenses alarm (Gundu, 2012). On the other\
    \ hand, outside attackers attempt to gain access \ninside a network either by\
    \ attacking the system directly or by exploiting the weaknesses of an employee.\
    \ \nThis research study focused on insiders only. The reason for this segregation\
    \ was that the insider threat \nis usually taken for granted and smart farming\
    \ often has limited measures in place to minimize the risk \nto which insiders\
    \ expose the farm as compared to that posed by outsiders with firewalls and physical\
    \ \nsecurity being used to guard against intruders. The hour it takes an employee\
    \ to view an awareness \npresentation may be the difference between a secure organization\
    \ and a multimillion Dollar breach of \nsecurity. \n \nWhat should be given great\
    \ attention is that most farmers and farm workers are not Information and \nCommunication\
    \ Technology (ICT) specialists. Hence, they might not be aware of the risks involved\
    \ in \na smart farming environment, and how those risks can be reduced. Farmers\
    \ and farm employees with \n‘little-to-no’ prior cyber security training or experience\
    \ may suddenly be responsible for hundreds of \nnetworked IoT devices generating\
    \ large amounts of data some which might be sensitive as part of their \njob The\
    \ weaknesses humans present can never be completely avoided, however, a properly\
    \ structured \ncybersecurity awareness campaign can lower the risk to tolerable\
    \ levels (Flowerday & Von Solms, \n2005; Gundu, 2017).   \n \nIn a smart farming\
    \ environment, everyone requires cybersecurity awareness training just as in the\
    \ \narmed forces, every soldier, regardless of their role, have to complete elementary\
    \ training. Hence, \ncybersecurity awareness among human users (farmers and farm\
    \ workers) is an important security \nmeasure for the success and growth of smart\
    \ farming. If humans lack awareness, they can make \nIoT Security and Privacy:\
    \ Turning on the Human Firewall in Smart Farming\nGundu and Maronga\n101\nmistakes\
    \ such as using default passwords that come with devices making it easy for hackers\
    \ to conduct \nattacks against the whole network (Mahmoud et al., 2015). \n6 Conclusions\
    \ and recommendations \nWith the global population prediction of 9.6 billion by\
    \ 2050, extreme weather condition challenges, \nclimate change, and resulting\
    \ environmental impact, there is great need to embrace IoT. Effective \nfarming\
    \ practices can address these issues. Currently, literature reports smart farming\
    \ applications are \ntaking place primarily in Europe and North America. However,\
    \ it reveals keen interest from Africa and \nAsia whose economies are primarily\
    \ based on agriculture.   \n \nEnsuring security and privacy is one of the biggest\
    \ challenges of smart farming governance to date. \nThis challenge might end up\
    \ inhibiting developments because farmers may be reluctant to share data as \n\
    they begin to fear that their data may end up in their competitors’ hands. Hence,\
    \ strong access controls \nmight be a starting point for vendors to build trust\
    \ with farmers. \n \nIn this paper a literature review on security and privacy\
    \ in smart farming was conducted. It was \nconcluded that IoT in smart farming\
    \ applications is still premature based on the limited peer reviewed \npublications.\
    \ However, it is evident that humans remain the weak link in smart farming security\
    \ and \nprivacy initiatives. Some farmers are lulled into a false sense of security\
    \ by IoT device vendors who \nvogue that technology is the total barrier to breaches.\
    \  Hence, this paper develops a framework to try to \nreduce the risk the human\
    \ exposes smart farming initiatives to. As we believe, it will be the most \n\
    effective way of switching on the human firewall that is making the human part\
    \ of the solution and not \nthe problem. The next step for this study is conduct\
    \ action research to test the effectiveness of the \nproposed model. Our main\
    \ recommendation for future research lies within analyzing whether Africa is \n\
    ready for smart farming in terms of security and privacy. \n \nReferences \n \n\

    As the world population is expected to touch 9.73 billion by 2050, according

    to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the demand for agricultural

    needs is increasing proportionately. Smart Agriculture is replacing conventional

    farming systems, employing advanced technologies such as the Internet

    of Things (IoT), Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML) to

    ensure higher productivity and precise agriculture management to overcome

    food demand. In recent years, there has been an increased interest in

    researchers within Smart Agriculture. Previous literature reviews have also

    conducted similar bibliometric analyses; however, there is a lack of research
    in

    Operations Research (OR) insights into Smart Agriculture. This paper conducts

    a Bibliometric Analysis of past research work in OR knowledge which has

    been done over the last two decades in Agriculture 4.0, to understand the

    trends and the gaps. Biblioshiny, an advanced data mining tool, was used in

    conducting bibliometric analysis on a total number of 1,305 articles collected

    from the Scopus database between the years 2000–2022. Researchers and

    decision makers will be able to visualize how newer advanced OR theories

    are being applied and how they can contribute toward some research gaps

    highlighted in this review paper. While governments and policymakers will

    beneﬁt through understanding how Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and

    robotic units are being used in farms to optimize resource allocation. Nations

    that have arid climate conditions would be informed how satellite imagery

    and mapping can assist them in detecting newer irrigation lands to assist their

    scarce agriculture resources.

    1. Introduction

    The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United

    Nations (FOA) has estimated that the world population will

    touch 9.73 billion by 2050 and will continue to rise until it

    reaches 11.2 billion by 2,100 (FAO, 2018). There is a direct

    correlation between population expansion and an increase in

    the need for food production. Both increases in population

    and increase in urbanization increase the risk of food shortage

    due to increased consumption, and the demand for nutritious

    agriculture, as farmlands are replaced with infrastructure and

    buildings (Yuan et al., 2018). There are many obstacles to

    agricultural output, resulting in lower crop yield, such as soil

    salinity in arid climates (Mohamed et al., 2019). Further, climate

    and soil sensitivity have an impact on crop quantity and

    quality (Abdel-Fattah et al., 2021). Consequently, it is critical to

    concentrate on surveying land resources for use in agricultural

    growth in dry regions (Saleh et al., 2015). The agriculture

    industry is one of the key sources of national income in

    developing countries. Hence, using new technology to improve

    the agriculture sector is critical to these countries’ national

    economies. In addition to providing the raw materials required

    for the industrial process, agricultural production includes the

    production of food for humans and cattle. Smart Agriculture

    aims to address these concerns through increasing productivity,

    better allocation of resources, adapting to climate change and

    overcoming food wastage.

    Fundamentally, both Smart Agriculture and Precision

    Agriculture utilize the Internet of Things (IoT) or information

    technology to improve spatial management procedures to

    maximize crop yield while avoiding the overuse of fertilizers

    and pesticides (Auernhammer, 2001; Bacco et al., 2019; Chiu

    et al., 2022). Unlike Precision Agriculture, Smart Agriculture,

    also known as Agriculture 4.0, further employs advanced

    technologies such as Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and Machine

    Learning (ML) to tackle a variety of crop-related diﬃculties by

    enabling the examination of changes in atmospheric conditions,

    soil properties, moisture, etc. The AI and IoT technology enable

    the connection of a variety of distant sensors, including ground

    sensors, robots, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), since it

    allows items to be linked and operated automatically through

    the internet (Almetwally et al., 2020; Chiu et al., 2022; Javaid

    et al., 2022). Despite Smart Agriculture technology evolving fast,

    academics feel that the technology is still at a nascent stage.

    Agricultural IoT application is currently fragmentary, and its

    usefulness for integration in agricultural development has not

    been fully investigated. This necessitates further research in

    combining Smart Agriculture with Operation Research (OR)

    theories (Hu et al., 2020).

    Bibliometric analyses on Smart Agriculture have also been

    conducted in the past. Abdollahi et al. (2021) conducted

    a bibliometric analysis between the years 2002 to 2021 to

    investigate the application of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)

    in agriculture. Rejeb et al. (2022a) conducted a bibliometric

    analysis between the years 2000–2021 to understand the

    comprehensive application of drones in agriculture. Rejeb et al.

    (2022b) looked at the applications of Artiﬁcial Intelligence

    (AI) in agriculture between the years 1992–2021 by conducting

    a bibliometric analysis. Rejeb et al. (2022c) analyzed the

    applications of the Internet of Things (IoT) in Agriculture

    between the year 2012–2020 by conducting bibliometric

    analysis. However, past bibliometric analyses tried to understand

    how the technologies such as WSN, AI, and IoT were being

    integrated into agriculture practices over the years, but there

    are few, if not any, bibliometric analyses on the application

    of Operations Research (OR) theories in Smart Agriculture or

    Agriculture 4.0 at a comprehensive level to understand how such

    theories have been applied in farms that have already integrated

    technologies such as AI and IoT systems. A complete evaluation

    of the studies on Operation Research (OR) in IoT-based

    intelligent agriculture is expected, considering this context. The

    research questions are (1) How have OR theories are being

    evolved over the last two decades to a more advanced and

    complex level? (2) Which OR theories are being applied to Smart

    Agriculture, and in what context? (3) How are Decision Support

    Systems (DSS) being applied to optimize Smart Agriculture, and

    for which objectives? (4) How are OR theories being applied to

    aid in achieving Smart Agriculture objectives? (5) What are the

    trends, gaps, and future research prospects in the application of

    OR in Smart Agriculture?

    The

    rest

    of

    the

    manuscript

    is

    outlined

    as

    follows:

    The methodology used to conduct bibliometric analysis is

    discussed in methodology section. The results and discussions,

    compromising of descriptive, keyword, and historical analysis,

    applications of DSS, as well as thematic analysis, are conducted

    in results and discussion section. The gaps, extracted insights,

    and future directions are discussed in gaps, future work, and

    insights section. Finally, an extensive conclusion comprising

    theoretical and practical implications, as well as limitations, are

    presented in conclusion section.

    2. Methodology

    In order to convey a holistic overview of the past literature

    on Smart Agriculture at a broad level over many the years,

    it would be ideal to conduct a bibliometric analysis over

    a traditional and systematic literature review. Traditional

    literature review lacks a transparent and systematic approach,

    and as a result, it is more likely to be biased (Kraus et al., 2020).

    While systematic literature review is more methodological

    to allow researchers to collect relevant research papers to

    conduct analysis in a systematic way to identify research gaps

    (Chakraborty et al., 2021). Whereas, bibliometric analysis can

    10.3389/fsufs.2022.1053921

    be applied to large data collection to allow us to visualize

    and reveal the advancement of a discipline in a statistical and

    mathematical method Rejeb et al. (2022b). It supports all the

    main areas of the classical bibliometric approach and provides

    various analyses using a graphical or visualization method

    (della Corte et al., 2019). A structured content analysis using

    bibliometric analysis allows researchers to identify themes and

    is a powerful and reliable approach for conducting a literature

    review (Chakraborty et al., 2021). This research is focused on

    gaining a rounded overview of the OR applications in Smart

    Agriculture, and in order to do so, it would be more feasible

    to conduct a bibliometric analysis for better visualization of

    how research has been gaining popularity and what are the

    research gaps. Moreover, the articles collected would require to

    be analyzed from diﬀerent angles in an unbiased manner, which

    both traditional and systematic literature reviews do not provide.

    Hence, the bibliometric analysis would be an optimum choice.

    FIGURE 1

    Radial venn diagram.

    Bibliometric analysis has been conducted to present a

    state of intellectual structure and to highlight the key trends

    of OR in smart agriculture. The analysis is performed using

    R-package bibliometrix (Harzing and Alakangas, 2016), an

    application designed for quantitative research in Bibliometrics

    or Scientometrics. It supports all the main areas of the classical

    bibliometric approach and provides various analyses using a

    graphical or visualization method (della Corte et al., 2019).

    As mentioned, to conduct a comprehensive overview of

    past literature on Smart Agriculture at a broad level, a wide

    variety of keywords is used to capture the maximum number

    of papers within a deﬁned framework. Bibliometric analysis of

    the collected material in this article is conducted in six phases:

    (1) Descriptive analysis, (2) Keyword analysis, (3) Historical

    analysis, (4) Application of DSS in Smart Agriculture, (5)

    Thematic analysis, and (6) Research gaps and future directions,

    and (7) Conclusions.

    During the ﬁrst phase, a set of keywords was outlined in a

    selected database to capture the past research work in the area

    of smart agriculture. Figure 1 depicts a Radial Venn diagram

    merging four diﬀerent areas with speciﬁc keywords, highlighted

    in Table 1, to collect material of interest to us (Resulting Area

    of Interest). Boolean operators “OR” and “AND” were used to

    achieve the desired merged area of research.

    As shown in Table 2 and Figure 2, Scopus was used as an

    online database to search for material. Two rounds of the search

    were made, wherein the search term was conﬁned to Keywords

    in the ﬁrst and the Article Title in the other. Since publications

    within the ﬁeld of OR in Smart Agriculture were near negligible

    before the year 2000, as shown in Table 4, and to highlight the

    interconnection between the literature paper, the search was

    limited to ﬁnal article papers published in English, and the time

    range was set between 2000 and 2022. To further reﬁne the

    the literature selection process.

    3. Results and discussion

    This paper uses an approach similar to that of some scholars

    (Aria and Cuccurullo, 2017) to draw a structure for a literature

    review in OR in Smart Agriculture. The approach is based

    on (1) data collection, (2) data analysis and visualization (3)

    Interpretation. The following section outlines the outcomes of

    the methodology phase described earlier.

    3.1. Descriptive analysis

    Table 4 shows statistics of publications through the past two

    decades. It includes the number of published articles (yearly

    and cumulative) from 2000 to 2022 and the total number of

    articles that have cited the chosen articles. The data illustrate

    that the number of articles in the scope of OR in Smart

    Agriculture gradually increased from 2000 to 2017, whereafter

    it dramatically increased, along with the number of citations per

    year. We should point out that the reason that we started with

    the year 2000 is because of the limited number of articles (max.

    2000) that could be downloaded from the saved library in Scopus

    in one ﬁle to be imported into the Biblioshiny application;

    however, most of the studies have been done in the recent two

    decades, as well.

    Some of the highly cited articles relating to operations

    research in smart agriculture focused on crop identiﬁcation

    using machine learning (ML) techniques (van Niel and

    McVicar, 2004; Peña-Barragán et al., 2011; Ghosal et al., 2018),

    precise irrigation using remote sensing and machine learning

    (Thenkabail et al., 2009; Goap et al., 2018), smart farming using

    the IoT (Mendas and Delali, 2012; Muangprathub et al., 2019),

    crop prediction using simulation modeling (Ines et al., 2013; V.

    Rodriguez-Galiano et al., 2014), and using Unmanned Aerial

    Vehicles (UAV) for crop identiﬁcation (Torres-Sánchez et al.,

    2015; de Castro et al., 2018). The wide variety of topics of high

    citation demonstrates the diversity of the research streams in

    Smart Agriculture.

    Likewise, some of the major categories of operations

    research in smart agriculture were identiﬁed through the

    Scopus database, which included agricultural and biological

    sciences (about 40% of the articles published), Environmental

    Science (38%), Computer Science (28%), Engineering (16%)

    and decision sciences (2%). The most cited countries in the

    Scopus database included the USA (4,825 citations), Italy

    (3,826 citations), China (3,767 citations), and Spain (1,841

    citations), indicating the regions around the world contributing

    signiﬁcantly to the ﬁeld of operations research in smart

    agriculture. Further, Figure 3 is a combination of annual

    scientiﬁc production and annual trending topics generated

    using bibliometrix. The graph indicates the increasing interest

    of researchers in the ﬁeld of operations research in smart

    agriculture and, further, the increased complexity of the

    knowledge applied in smart agriculture.

    Topics were less sophisticated in terms of smart agriculture

    and operations research between the years 2000 and 2017

    since AI and ML methods were not well researched to be

    better applied in agriculture. The topics commonly discussed

    were decision support systems and management of information

    technology for the optimization of agriculture (such as crops,

    waste management, soil erosion, and water use). From 2017,

    the trending topics indicate more complexity and precise

    management of agriculture as research within AI and ML grows

    further, in turn improving agricultural production and practices.

    The topics trending since 2017 are focused on algorithms,

    climate change, precision agriculture, decision trees, remote

    sensing, and predictive analytics error in smart agriculture.

    The crease in complexity and development of sophisticated

    applications of Operations Research is an indication of the

    increased need of the agriculturists to overcome challenges faced

    to optimize their farming practices. Furthermore, the sudden

    increase in the number of articles and total citations from the

    year 2017 is also an indication toward the increasing interest of

    researchers in the application OR in Smart Agriculture.

    smart agriculture.

    The highest keyword occurrences are for agriculture (7%),

    remote sensing (4%), crops (4%), and artiﬁcial intelligence

    (4%), as listed in Figure 4, which indicates that major research

    areas in operations research in smart agriculture are focused

    on agricultural crops through the use of IoT and AI. In terms

    to obtain an even percentage of articles that focused on

    agricultural systems (such as soil, land use, irrigation, etc.)

    using diﬀerent smart approaches, which included AI, remote

    sensing and machine learning. Within the agriculture group,

    some of the highest cited articles discussed object-based crop

    classiﬁcation (Peña-Barragán et al., 2011), remote sensing

    for agricultural applications (Weiss et al., 2020), predictive

    modeling of agricultural pollution (V. F. Rodriguez-Galiano

    et al., 2018), and managing farms through the use of information

    systems (Espejo-Garcia et al., 2020).

    Top-cited articles on remote sensing discussed various

    aspects, such as Thenkabail et al. (2009) using remote sensing

    to simulate a Global Irrigated Area Map (GIAM) to assist

    precision agriculture (Weiss et al., 2020) and discussing the

    applications of remote sensing in agriculture, (Ines et al.,

    2013) combining remote sensing and simulation to increase

    maize crop production, and (Torres-Sánchez et al., 2015) using

    Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) in remote sensing methods

    for better crop identiﬁcation. It can be deduced that remote

    sensing techniques are commonly employed in agriculture to

    achieve better mapping, improve crop yields and classiﬁcation to

    enhance productivity, and achieve automated smart agriculture.

    Articles on AI looked at the integration of multicriteria

    decision analysis with GIS for agricultural land suitability

    detection (Mendas and Delali, 2012), GIS-based photovoltaic

    farm site detection (Sánchez-Lozano et al., 2014), selecting

    patterns and features for crop weed row mapping using UAV

    (Pérez-Ortiz et al., 2016), and predicting crop yield using fuzzy

    cognitive mapping (Papageorgiou et al., 2009). Articles in ML

    keyword criteria focused on designing a deep machine vision

    model for plant detection (Ghosal et al., 2018), managing

    irrigation systems in agriculture using decision support systems

    (Navarro-Hellín et al., 2016), value creation through big data

    analytics (Saggi and Jain, 2018), etc., Other articles considered

    deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNN) to detect

    water pollution in agricultural irrigation (Chen et al., 2020),

    precise automated leaf detection using image feature analysis

    (Pantazi et al., 2019), and predicting soil moisture content using

    hybrid machine learning (Prasad et al., 2018).

    The wide variety of highly cited articles in AI and ML,

    the heart of smart agriculture, indicates a great potential

    for

    future

    research

    in

    diﬀerent

    agricultural

    segments

    and using big data analytics, farms are adopting more

    precise management.

    3.3. Historical analysis

    Historical network analysis allows us to cluster a number

    of research streams that have evolved over the years. It uses

    the collection of bibliography from the articles collected and

    generates a map of the most relevant citations (Borgman

    and Furner, 2002; Garﬁeld, 2016). The direct historical

    network is discussed in this section, which was generated

    through Biblioshiny.

    The number of nodes was set to 40 to show a complete

    overview of the diﬀerent research paths. The following section

    will discuss the six areas of research relating to Operations

    research in smart agriculture; (1) Remote sensing and statistics,

    (2) ML approach for precise agricultural mapping, (3) Precise

    agricultural management using the IoT, (4) Cloud-based satellite

    for precise irrigation mapping (5) Decision Support Systems

    (DSS) to mitigate fertilizer-based loss and (6) Sustainable

    agriculture using ML techniques.

    3.3.1. Remote sensing and statistics

    Locating and extending irrigation land is important for

    better water management. Using remote sensing techniques

    to gather large amounts of data enables decision-makers to

    make better and more sustainable agricultural decisions. Two

    authors- (Zhu et al., 2014) and (Meier et al., 2018), as

    named in Table 6, both discussed using statistical approaches

    involving diﬀerent vegetation indexes (NDVI) for precise

    irrigation to assist croplands. Both authors considered using

    remote sensing and IoT to generate large statistical data to

    achieve accurate measurements of irrigated areas for improving

    agricultural practices.

    Zhu et al. (2014) employed remote sensing and time-series

    NDVI for mapping irrigated lands in China. Large statistical

    data were collected on diﬀerent precipitation patterns, which

    were downscaled using a spatial allocation model to locate new

    irrigation areas. Meier et al. (2018) looked at using remote

    sensing and multi-temporary NDVI to test existing maps and

    used decision trees to extend irrigated areas. Such methods

    of detecting newer irrigation land or extending the current

    irrigation land support Smart Agriculture requirements by

    increasing productivity since water is an essential source needed

    by agriculture and farms to produce crops.

    3.3.2. Machine learning for precise agricultural

    mapping

    Sustainable agricultural management of water resources

    demands a better understanding of spatial irrigation patterns.

    Both articles focused on the handling of large data to achieve

    better and more precise irrigation in the context of a single

    country using the ML approach. Deines et al. (2017) looked

    at Northern U.S. and analyzed the high-resolution irrigation

    maps produced by Landsat satellite imagery over the past 2

    decades using Google Earth Engine to understand the irrigation

    patterns to better manage the agricultural water resources.

    Statistical modeling involving a random forest classiﬁer was used

    to understand how precipitation inﬂuenced irrigation over time.

    Ketchum et al. (2020) used an ML approach to achieve

    better mapping of irrigated agricultural lands in the Western

    U.S. Similar to the ﬁrst group, Google Earth Engine was used

    to collect past data of four diﬀerent classes: irrigated agriculture,

    wetlands, uncultivated land, and dryland agriculture over 3

    decades to cover a variety of spectra to better map the irrigated

    agricultural lands to improve precise agricultural practices.

    The higher resolution of irrigated lands and better

    classiﬁcation assists in enhancing precise irrigation management

    for farms, and such methods support Smart Agriculture goals by

    improving resource allocation. Table 7 shows research stream:

    ML for precise agriculture mapping.

    3.3.3. Precise agricultural management using

    the Internet of Things (IoT)

    The research stream illustrated that IoT practices could be

    more sustainable and proﬁtable in terms of precise agriculture

    through better water management and fertilizer allocation than

    conventional models. Krishnan et al. (2020) employed smart

    irrigation systems based on fuzzy logic using IoT to reduce

    the amount of power for the watering of ﬁelds. A fuzzy logic

    controller was used to determine the input parameters, such as

    soil humidity, temperature, and moisture, to compute the output

    of the motor status. Farmers were assisted with smart irrigation

    systems through Global Systems for Mobile Communication

    (GSMC) to better manage the watering of agricultural ﬁelds by

    knowing the job status, including the soil moisture, humidity,

    and temperature, along with the status of motor power.

    Kocian et al. (2020) used IoT-based agricultural decision

    support methods for crop growth prediction. A dynamic

    Bayesian network (DBN) was used to correlate the parameters of

    crop growth with the environmental control parameters through

    the unknown Markov Chain. The crop growth parameters

    included lead-area index, dry weight, and evapotranspiration

    on a daily basis, while the environmental control parameters

    included solar exposure, vapor pressure, and temperature of the

    controlled environment. Large expectation-maximization (EM)

    algorithms were used to track states and better understand the

    parameters of DBN.

    Lin et al. (2020) focused on fertigation management

    based on IoT for sustainable precision agriculture. The paper

    addressed the irrigation and fertilizer allocation problems

    through a framework using IoT to manage not only at the

    short-term level but also in the long term. The integer linear

    programming model was developed to allocate limited resources

    among diﬀerent crops to maximize the total proﬁt (both

    economic and environmental).

    The use of IoT in smart agriculture supports the agriculture

    4.0 requirements by adapting to climate change as water

    resources are further decreasing due to increased demand, and

    this requires the use of smart irrigation. IoT is also being applied

    in Smart Agriculture, using probability to predict crop growth

    to increase productivity; such methods support Agriculture 4.0.

    Table 8 shows research stream: precise agriculture management

    using IoT.

    3.3.4. Cloud-based satellite for precise

    irrigation mapping

    All the articles in this stream utilized satellite imaging at

    a cloud-based level for better mapping of diﬀerent sectors

    of agriculture, such as irrigation and soil moisture, to

    improve precise agricultural practices. Such precise and accurate

    agricultural practices assist farmers in adapting to climate

    change and increase the productivity of their crops.

    Bazzi et al. (2021) focused on precise irrigation through

    mapping at plot scale using S1 and S2 data over 4 years

    (2017–2020). Two irrigation metrics were adopted for selection

    criteria, the ﬁrst one based on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)

    using S1 and the other optical-based using S2; both were time

    series. Random forest (RF) was used to build an irrigation

    classiﬁcation model to validate the results. The proposed method

    demonstrated a higher accuracy of irrigation maps compared

    to empirical methods. Higher accuracy of irrigation mapping

    assists Smart Agriculture goals by better resource allocation.

    Likewise, Wellington and Renzullo (2021) considered

    enhancing irrigated crop mapping using S2 images. Accurate

    mapping for irrigated areas can be challenging to generate

    at a small level, requiring complex models attached to image

    stacks. Supervised random forest was applied to the collected

    data for smallholder irrigation schemes, enhancing the mapping

    of irrigation land. Pageot et al. (2020) also looked at better

    detection of irrigated lands jointly using S1 and S2 along

    with meteorological time series to improve crop irrigation

    management. The study was conducted over 2 years in a

    temperate area to detect rainfed plots. Monthly data was

    cumulated, provided by satellite imaging to be readily used

    in Random Forest Classiﬁer. Through the combined use of

    S1 (radar), S2 (optical), and meteorological (weather) time-

    series data, the study showed signiﬁcant improvement in both

    classiﬁcations of irrigated crops and mapping of irrigated areas.

    Detecting newer irrigated lands, in turn, leads to agricultural

    production increasing, since there is a protentional for more

    availability of water.

    Gao et al. (2018) formulated a synergetic technique using S1

    and S2 for mapping soil moisture and irrigated areas. The paper

    developed an algorithm using the Water Cloud Model (WCM)

    to spatialize the soil water content between 2015 and 2017. Along

    with WCM, a decision tree approach using statistical indices

    of soil humidity and Normalized Diﬀerence Vegetation Index

    (NDVI) was used to classify irrigation maps at individual ﬁelds.

    By analyzing the moisture content of the soil to classify irrigation

    lands, the resources are better allocated for farms.

    The research of Bousbih et al. (2018) was based on high-

    dimensional automated algorithm satellite imaging for better

    mapping to achieve precise management of diﬀerent agricultural

    sectors. Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used to identify

    irrigated areas based on parameters of soil moisture such as

    mean and variance. The model was tested in Tunisia, and the

    research concluded that classiﬁcation based on soil moisture

    mitigate fertilizer-based loss

    The nodes Meza-Palacios et al. (2020) and Zhang et al.

    (2021), as named in Table 10, have LCS and GCS of (0,

    3) and (1, 2), respectively, both having a low score due to

    the publications being recent. Zhang et al. (2021) utilized a

    new structure consisting of analytical hierarchy (AHP) and

    modiﬁed analytical hierarchy methods (MAHP) along with

    metaheuristic optimization techniques to ascertain the optimum

    rate of nitrogen while considering the capacity and requirement

    constraints. Such DSS was designated to satisfy both farmers

    by generating high proﬁts and the environmental experts by

    keeping pollution low.

    Meza-Palacios et al. (2020) focused on increasing the yield

    of sugarcane by increasing the eﬃciency of fertilizer rates. The

    research proposed a (DSS) based on two fuzzy models, the

    edaphic condition model and NPK fertilization model, for a

    better NPK (nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium) fertilization

    rate. Such DSS models enable farmers to ensure that they meet

    the safety standards of minimizing the impact on climate and

    human health.

    3.3.6. Sustainable agriculture using machine

    learning (ML) techniques

    The nodes Hamrani et al. (2020) and Abbasi et al. (2021),

    as named in Table 11, have LCS and GCS of (0,0) and (1,10),

    respectively. All three papers looked at the application of

    the ML approach to overcome environmental problems, to

    achieve sustainable agriculture. Abbasi et al. (2021) used ML

    algorithms to model carbon dioxide emissions from inorganic

    fertilizers. The paper looked at six diﬀerent models, viz., random

    forest (RF), Feed Forward Neural Network (FNN), Radial

    Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN), Extreme Learning

    Machine (ELM), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection

    Operator (LASSO), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The

    paper retained the same input parameters, compared the output

    of the diﬀerent models, and found that RF was the best model for

    predicting carbon dioxide emission from IF. Likewise, Hamrani

    et al. (2020) also compared three additional ML models,

    the LSTM method.

    The research papers in this research stream looked at

    diﬀerent ML models to analyze which are useful in predicting

    greenhouse gas emissions from the soil. The outcome of the

    research stream supports the agriculture 4.0 goals of adapting

    to climate change.

    3.4. Application of DSS in smart

    agriculture

    The four areas that agriculture 4.0 looks to address are

    directly related to accurate decision-making, and researchers

    are designing and implementing Decision Support Systems

    (DSS) to optimize crop productivity while addressing them.

    Articles with the following keywords were ﬁltered: Decision

    Support System (DSS), optimization, and simulation. From the

    resultant 238 articles, those which addressed the four areas of

    Agriculture 4.0 were ﬁltered to highlight the models they applied

    in smart agriculture. Table 12 discusses the application of DSS in

    smart agriculture.

    Researchers have used a wide variety of methods to

    design DSS to support farmers for better decision-making.

    Recio et al. (2003) utilized the application of the advanced

    decision-making tool AgriSupport II system to enhance the

    agriculture production processes. The AgriSupport II system

    provided farmers with decision-making solutions to improve

    operations like operating cost, proﬁtability analysis, scheduling,

    and resource allocation. CPLEX optimizer was used to design

    a model algorithm that would ensure optimum decision-

    making suggestions by computing all feasible modes and then

    performing a comparative analysis of all modes to suggest the

    mode that is the least costly for agricultural task allocations.

    By adopting the AgriSupport II system, farmers are assisted

    in achieving higher eﬃciency at the least investment cost,

    consequently enhancing agricultural production, which is one

    of the requirements of Agriculture 4.0.

    Conesa-Muñoz et al. (2016) and Nabaei et al. (2018)

    both looked at using multi-robot sensing systems to allocate

    agricultural work to appropriate robotic units. The multi-

    sensing system was tested multiple times on a Spanish farm,

    using both aerial and ground units, to assist farmers in the

    optimal distribution of tasks. Both used the metaheuristic

    optimization method for ground planning through Harmony

    Search Algorithm. The multi-robot system collected agricultural

    data using aerial vehicles controlled by a Mission Manager,

    which was connected to a Base Station Computer. The system

    assigned agricultural tasks to the most appropriate robotic unit,

    allowing farmers to supervise and manage the entire process

    through a multi-robot sensing system, a decision-making tool

    for task allocation. Accurate imaging data collected can also

    inform farmers about how much herbicides or pesticides are

    needed for the crops. Such systems can act as essential supports

    for Agriculture 4.0.

    With the increase in the deployment of Aerial Unmanned

    Vehicle (UAV) in various applications, including agriculture,

    Alsalam et al. (2017) designed an onboard DSS system to detect

    the precise location of crops with disease and then delegate

    appropriate action to UAV, such as precise herbicide spray.

    Through the assistance of the Object-Based Image Analysis

    (OBIA) algorithm, the use of UAV can increase eﬃciency in

    work with precise crop detection and management of toxic

    damage on farms.

    Within the scope of route planning, Keller et al. (2007) and

    Bochtis et al. (2012) constructed Agriculture Decision Support

    System (DSS) to optimize the deployment and utilization of

    agricultural vehicles in ﬁelds with sensitive soil. The B-pattern

    optimization algorithm was used as a tool to provide an optimal

    route. Route planning and optimization enable vehicles to

    consume less energy and cause less damage to sensitive soil. This

    will enhance crop productivity, which supports the agriculture

    4.0 requirement. Most current research for the application

    of Agriculture Decision Support Systems (ADDS) for water

    resource management is related more to irrigation management.

    For example, Navarro-Hellín et al. (2016) designed a smart

    irrigation decision support system (SIDSS) for better irrigation

    planning through better, eﬃcient, and accurate use of water

    resources. The research looked at predicting the water needs

    of the crops for better irrigation planning. Partial Least

    Squares (PLSR) and Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Interference Systems

    (ANFIS) were used to provide reasoning results to generate the

    decision support system requirement.

    Other authors, such as Giusti and Marsili-Libelli (2015),

    used fuzzy DSS (FDSS) using the IRRINET model to improve

    irrigation practices on farms. Similar to the ﬁnding of Navarro-

    Hellin, such fuzzy DSS assist farmers by using a predictive model

    and inference system of soil properties for better allocation

    through daily water scheduling. Fuzzy C-Mean algorithms were

    used to generate a decision support system for farmers by

    suggesting the amount of water the crops require to remain

    irrigated. Through better and smart management of irrigation

    of crops, the research supported Agriculture 4.0.

    Current researchers are also addressing climate change

    through better farming adaptability using ADSS (El-Sharkawy,

    2014; Weller et al., 2016). Schütze and Schmitz (2010) proposed

    a methodology, Stochastic Crop-Water Production Function

    (SCWPF), to quantify the eﬀect of climate change on irrigation

    in agriculture. The proposed DSS was tested on farms in

    France, and it was concluded that the OCCASION model

    formulated enabled farmers with adequate data on weather and

    soil properties to evaluate the potential eﬀect of climate change

    on farms, and OCCASION can be used to adjust decisions

    for irrigation scheduling and planning. Wenkel et al. (2013)

    presented an interactive DSS named LandCaRe, which was

    tested in Germany, and experimental ﬁndings showed that this

    system could be used to predict weather conditions and the

    extent of periods of vegetation. LandCaRe DSS can provide

    farmers with optimal decisions for improved farming practices

    under climate change.

    3.5. Thematic map

    The structure of the thematic map is generated by

    bibliometrix based on the clustering of the frequency of the

    repeated occurrences of keywords, and these clusters are known

    to be themes. Bibliometrix utilizes a thematic map to outline the

    Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems

    12

    frontiersin.org

    Yousaf et al.

    10.3389/fsufs.2022.1053921

    conceptual framework of the research topics. A thematic map

    enables four diﬀerent typologies of topics to be identiﬁed based

    on which quadrant they are in. The motor themes are the motifs

    in the upper-right quadrant. They are distinguished by a high

    degree of centralization and density, indicating that they have

    been developed and are important in the ﬁeld of research.

    The highly developed and isolated motifs, also known

    as niche themes, are found in the upper-left quadrant.

    They have matured internal links with high density but

    insigniﬁcant outward links and hence are of little signiﬁcance

    in the ﬁeld (low centrality). Emerging or declining motifs

    appear in the lower-left quadrant. They have a low density

    and centrality, indicating that they are underdeveloped and

    peripheral. Basic and transversal themes are found in the lower-

    right quadrant and have a high degree of centralization and

    low density.

    These themes are signiﬁcant for a study ﬁeld and cover

    general topics relevant to all research areas of the ﬁeld (della

    Corte et al., 2019). As shown in Figure 5, thematic mapping

    allows the mapping of four diﬀerent themes of research.

    Keyword Plus was used as it allows the capture of an article’s

    features with greater depth. The thematic map is based on two

    axes, one indicating the centrality or relevance of the keyword,

    and the other, the density or the degree of development.

    Cluster #1 (C1) and Cluster #2 (C2) are both within

    the motor themes, where C2 is more central and less dense

    compared to C2. The higher central aspect of C1 indicates that

    the articles published within the scope of agriculture, article, and

    classiﬁcation are concerned more with crop classiﬁcation.

    Some of the recent publications within C1 focus on digital

    soil mapping (Lagacherie et al., 2022), an intelligence-based

    approach for agricultural soil prediction (Nguyen et al., 2022),

    AI-based apple leaf disease classiﬁcation (Al-Wesabi et al.,

    2022), and simulating various water-deﬁcit regimes for irrigation

    scheduling optimization (Martínez-Valderrama et al., 2020).

    Recent publications indicate that C1 is more inclined toward

    procedures and classiﬁcation of multiple aspects of agriculture

    segments. C2, which is also within the motor theme quadrant, is

    of higher density, indicating more research development in the

    ﬁeld of crops, AI, and decision support systems compared to C1.

    About 37% of the total articles collected are within the scope of

    C2, and the recent publications merge closely with C1.

    Cluster #3 (C3) and Cluster #4 (C4) are within the emerging

    or declining themes. Some of the recent articles in C3 discuss

    mapping land suitability (Carlier et al., 2021), soil prediction

    using AI (Nguyen et al., 2022), and modeling spatial dynamics

    (Sodango et al., 2021). While some articles in C4 are of emerging

    nature, including the combined use of machine learning

    algorithms and UAV (Ndlovu et al., 2021; Onishi and Ise, 2021;

    Qiu et al., 2021), machine vision yield monitoring (Dolata et al.,

    2021), artiﬁcial neural networks for crop evapotranspiration

    estimation (Gao et al., 2021), and usage of machine learning for

    crop prediction (Almeida et al., 2021).

    While there was no cluster within the niche or isolated

    theme, all four clusters are shown to be interlinked through

    the cross-collaboration of work between diﬀerent subject

    areas. The overall thematic map demonstrates that newer areas

    of study within agriculture are turning toward precision

    agriculture

    through

    precise

    modeling

    and

    estimating

    of maps, soil, evapotranspiration, etc., using newer and

    advanced technologies.

    4. Gaps, future work, and insights

    The comprehensive bibliometric analysis of OR in smart

    agriculture revealed some gaps and future directions, which are

    listed below:

    1. Precision Agriculture focuses on the application of IoT to

    achieve precise farming practices. IoT has mainly been used

    to achieve optimization of conventional farming systems,

    and such optimization models are included within the DSS

    to assist farmers in making better decisions. The Decision

    Sciences database covers 2% of the total material collected

    from the Scopus database. Research within this scope was

    inclined toward better task allocation or vehicle route

    planning to assist farmers in better utilizing robotic units

    in agriculture. Most such research used complex algorithms

    such as metaheuristic algorithm, B-pattern algorithm, and

    OBIA algorithm. The DSS was initially focused toward

    applying OR theories to achieve better resource allocations

    through route planning (Keller et al., 2007; Bochtis et al.,

    2012), and recent papers have also focused on resource

    allocation but through the application of robotic units for

    better task allocations (Conesa-Muñoz et al., 2016; Nabaei

    et al., 2018) and water management for irrigation planning

    (Giusti and Marsili-Libelli, 2015; Navarro-Hellín et al., 2016).

    The application of DSS allows farmers to make better

    decisions for better farming; however, these methods are

    mostly limited to resource allocation, and there is a lack of

    research to address climate change, increase the productivity

    of the farms, or reduce agriculture waste. Moreover, there

    was a lack of research that utilized mathematical optimization

    programming, such as linear programming (LP), mixed

    integer programming (MIP), dynamic programming (DP),

    and Stochastic Programming (SP). Future research needs to

    incorporate such techniques to allow farmers to not only

    practice smart agriculture but also make decisions from the

    business perspective of enhancing proﬁtability by reducing

    food waste.

    2. Machine Learning (ML) and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI)

    application in agriculture were heavily inclined toward

    probability and statistics. As the world is facing water issues,

    an essential component of farming, much of satellite imaging

    methods were applied toward mapping and detecting

    irrigation lands (Deines et al., 2017; Ketchum et al., 2020;

    Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems

    Pageot et al., 2020; Bazzi et al., 2021), mostly using the

    Random Forest (RF) classiﬁers and at times Water Cloud

    Model (WCM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). While

    one of the recent papers (Abbasi et al., 2021) compared

    multiple AI and ML methods, such as FNN, RBFNN, and

    SVM, to draw the conclusion that the RF modeling method

    was optimum to be the application of prediction of carbon

    dioxide emission. Such development within the ﬁeld of ML

    and AI in agriculture demonstrates that future research is

    more focused on statistics and probability aspects of OR

    theories. One primary reason could be that climate change

    is causing unforeseen disruptions in agriculture productivity,

    and in order to bring resilience to farming practices, such

    theories are needed to predict the unforeseen circumstances

    to better overcome the risks. However, such methods can

    be capital intensive as the application of ML and AI on

    large data sets require a powerful machine to conduct

    computation, and also the computation times are lengthy.

    Researchers are employing advanced knowledge of AI and

    ML to enable farmers to mostly for better resource allocation

    and sometimes for adapting to climate change or increasing

    productivity. There is less focus on overcoming agriculture

    wastage, which is one of the main pillars of Smart Agriculture.

    This hints at the need for further research in terms of

    optimization of agriculture wastages in order to overcome

    this large research gap. Moreover, according to thematic

    analysis, the articles within C4 highlighted that future streams

    are expected to involve more complex OR theories, AI and

    ML streams, with the combination of ML algorithms and

    UAV (Ndlovu et al., 2021; Onishi and Ise, 2021; Qiu et al.,

    2021) to optimize the productivity, and continue to apply ML

    for prediction and estimation in crop management (Almeida

    et al., 2021; Q. Gao et al., 2018). Such complex application

    of OR is hinting toward future involving the analysis of large

    data sets to meet Agriculture 4.0 goals.

    3. The major research gap lies in most of the OR theories

    being applied to conventional farming systems to make them

    smarter and more automated. For example, some research

    papers looked at providing optimal decision parameters for

    farmers for better resource allocation using robots (Conesa-

    Muñoz et al., 2016; Nabaei et al., 2018), while others

    looked at the use of sensors with fuzzy models (Krishnan

    et al., 2020; Meza-Palacios et al., 2020), RF (Abbasi et al.,

    2021), and LSTM (Hamrani et al., 2020) to optimize crop

    yields and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, some

    papers designed DSS for improved irrigation management

    (papers), while others used satellite imagery to detect or

    extend irrigation lands (papers). While such papers utilize

    10.3389/fsufs.2022.1053921

    the application of IoT and ML, however, they are mainly

    being addressed toward optimizing traditional farming

    systems. About 1.5 and 1% of the total material collected

    addressed the application of OR in vertical farming and

    plant factories, respectively. With the introduction of newer

    farming methods such as vertical farms and plant factories to

    accommodate countries that do not have conditions suitable

    for agriculture, there is the prospect for future research in

    the application of newer OR theories in these newer farming

    methods to achieve agriculture 4.0 goals.

    5. Conclusion

    5.1. Discussions of ﬁndings

    Research on Operations Research (OR) application in

    smart agriculture is increasing. The literature review aids in

    understanding the links and advancement of a research ﬁeld

    and provides insights into the activities of scholars. However,

    the inherent subjectivity of narrative and systematic reviews is

    reduced by bibliometric analyses.

    Our study explored the operations research knowledge

    applied to smart agriculture. In this context, we conducted a

    descriptive analysis to describe how research is increasing. It has

    been clear that since 2017, research has dramatically increased,

    as newer knowledge in the Internet of Things (IoT), artiﬁcial

    intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) approaches is

    being enhanced for better application in smart agriculture. This

    has been further validated by conducting a keyword analysis.

    Then, historical analysis was also conducted by generating

    historiography to check how some of the research streams

    had evolved and what the current research publications are

    focused on. It was noted that the major focus was on statistics

    and prediction to achieve precise agriculture. This was further

    supported through thematic mapping, where it was noticed

    that emerging research was focusing on agricultural land use

    mapping through satellite imaging, along with agricultural

    robotics and remote sensing.

    Further, articles within the scope of decision support system

    (DSS) in smart agriculture were perused within the scope of

    Agriculture 4.0 requirements. It was apparent that DSS models

    were more inclined toward better allocation of resources using

    smart technology; however, recent articles seem to be adopting

    the climate change agenda (Hamrani et al., 2020; Abbasi et al.,

    2021; Zhang et al., 2021).

    Future research, according to thematic mapping, has

    shown that ML and AI applications are moving toward more

    complexity as complex OR theories are being combined. While

    most current research and the future streams within ML

    and AI scope are inclined toward probability and statistics

    to predict and estimate for reasons such as prediction of

    crops or evapotranspiration, and other reasons include adapting

    to climate change. However, there was lesser focus toward

    optimizing agriculture farms through reducing or reusing

    wastage. Moreover, RF applications of OR were more readily

    adopted for agriculture or irrigation mapping using satellite

    imaging. With the increase in the sophisticated nature of ML and

    AI, the future of OR is moving toward data sciences.

    It was noted that most applications of ML and AI, with OR

    theories, were being applied to conventional farming systems.

    As food security and climate change are starting to become

    more important, and countries that have arid climate conditions,

    there is a prospect and need to apply OR theories within newer

    farming methods. And since such newer farming methods, such

    as vertical farms or plant factories, usually involve sensors to

    control the environment, there is a scope to apply the current

    and past OR theories within conventional farming systems that

    involve sensors, robotic units and UAV.

    Finally,

    as

    the

    population

    is

    expected

    to

    increase

    drastically over the coming years, the agri-food demand

    is

    correspondingly

    expected

    to

    increase,

    and

    order

    to

    and

    techniques

    to

    waste, ensure better food security, and optimize agricultural

    resources to increase productivity within both precision

    and smart agriculture, and to meet agriculture 4.0 goals

    more holistically.

    5.2. Theoretical implications

    Our comprehensive bibliometric analysis within the scope

    of OR applications in Smart Agriculture oﬀers valuable

    information to multiple stakeholders, including researchers,

    decision makers, and consultants, who can understand and

    visualize how OR theories are being applied in diﬀerent areas

    of Smart Agriculture to optimize and design DSS. Moreover,

    as sustainability and climate change are taking center stage in

    research, researchers will be able to understand how AI, IoT

    and ML methods within Smart Agriculture are being applied to

    overcome and mitigate climate change concerns. Moreover, our

    research has demonstrated improving productivity and reducing

    agricultural waste to meet Smart Agriculture goals are areas

    of less focus, and this will motivate researchers to increase

    their area of study to overcome this gap. While researchers

    have been highly concentric toward irrigation planning between

    the years 2014 and 2015, newer research is focusing toward

    agriculture mapping and classiﬁcation, and such future direction

    will also allow the researcher to apply their current knowledge

    in this ﬁeld. Last but not least, the holistic overview of literature

    between the years 2000–2022 will certainly give researchers and

    multiple stakeholders the visual map of how research within the

    scope of OR in Smart Agriculture is evolving and what are the

    trending topics and the research gaps.

    5.3. Practical implications

    Nations that do not have suitable conditions for agricultural

    farming would have their governments trying to understand

    how they can make their current farming practices eﬃcient

    and responsive in order to meet the increasing agri-food

    demand. Our bibliometric analysis, speciﬁcally the application

    of DSS in Smart Agriculture, would give some examples of how

    governments can optimize and regulate their limited resources,

    such as water, through irrigation mapping. Furthermore, as our

    bibliometric analysis is demonstrating a drastic increase in the

    publication within the ﬁeld of OR in Smart Agriculture and

    the application of UAV and robotic units, governments will see

    the need to introduce policies to regulate the farms to ensure

    the safety of people and the environment is being maintained.

    Stakeholders who are not aware of the application of UAV

    and robotic units through the use of IoT and AI for better

    resource allocation will feel inclined toward adopting these

    methods to their farms. One of the major practical implications

    lies in understanding that most literature papers focus on OR

    theories in traditional farming methods. To the best of our

    knowledge, there are few or negligible literature papers that

    apply OR theories toward newer agricultural methods such

    as hydroponics, a part of vertical farming, plant factories or

    urban agriculture. Such lack of literature focus would indicate

    that governments and researchers would feel the need to adopt

    AI and IoT to make newer agricultural methods to Smart

    Agriculture and then apply OR theories to optimize them in

    order to meet Smart Agriculture or Agriculture 4.0 goals.

    5.4. Limitations of bibliometric analysis

    Even though our attempt to understand a holistic overview

    of OR theories in Smart Agriculture through bibliometric

    analysis has given signiﬁcant contributions, this review has

    some limitations that needs to be addressed when reading

    the results. One of the major shortcomings is that we only

    considered the Scopus database, and our articles of selection

    were limited to keywords and titles only. Future research should

    consider other databases, such as the Web of Science and

    integrate the ﬁndings with our results to provide a further

    overview of the OR theories being applied in Smart Agriculture.

    Moreover, if possible, future research should try to include

    Abstracts within the Scopus database search to capture more

    literature for a deeper bibliometric analysis. Our research mainly

    attempted to understand what are the current OR applications

    in Smart Agriculture during historical analysis, and future

    research should increase the span of historical analysis through

    increasing the node above 40 on Bibliometrix to generate

    more research streams and trends. While Smart Agriculture

    is a wide ﬁeld, future research may also incorporate how OR

    theories are being applied speciﬁcally in livestock, soil and

    water management through changing the keyword algorithms

    to incline the literature search to be more subject matter. Finally,

    as newer farming methods will be coming to light, future

    researchers should conduct a bibliometric analysis on how OR

    theories are being used within hydroponic, urban agriculture, or

    plant factories.

    \ \nin agriculture\nPhoto: E. Erazo-Mesa\nABSTRACT\nUnder tropical conditions,\
    \ Hass avocado irrigation is a controversial issue due to insufficient scientific\
    \ evi-\ndence. The rapid progression of technological advances and its incorporation\
    \ in agriculture have expanded \noptions to improve the irrigation scheduling\
    \ (IS) of Hass avocado. The concept featuring those technological \nadvances in\
    \ agriculture is digital agriculture (DA). Here, we present a mixture of well-known\
    \ studies in the \nHass avocado irrigation focused on proximal sensing (PS) technologies\
    \ and recent studies emphasizing the \npotential of remote sensing (RS), and application\
    \ technologies to schedule the irrigation. PS takes advantage \nof the soil or\
    \ trees’ proximity to output reliable measurements with a high temporal resolution,\
    \ while RS \nprovides a broad set of spectral data in continuous and large areas\
    \ that can be transformed into crop-rela-\nted biophysical variables. Applications\
    \ – a term grouping mobile (smartphone) apps, desktop programs, and \nweb-based\
    \ platforms – offers portability, high precision, and graphic visualization of\
    \ variables obtained or \nestimated by sensors. Integrating RS and PS technologies\
    \ through user-friendly applications can represent a \nsuitable option to improve\
    \ Hass avocado irrigation in developing countries. Our review is presented in\
    \ the \nfollowing sections: general introduction, DA approach definition, use\
    \ of proximal sensing, use of remote \nsensing, and scheduling irrigation applications.\n\

    \ one of the \nmost profitable fruits traded in international mar-\nkets (FAO,\
    \ 2021; International Trade Centre, 2021). \nThis fruit is produced in countries\
    \ with tropical and \nsubtropical climates (Schaffer et al., 2013), many of \n\
    them with emergent economies, such as Colombia. \nThis country is the tenth largest\
    \ global exporter of \nHass avocados (FAO, 2021), and its production has \nincreased\
    \ exponentially in recent years (Ramírez-Gil \net al., 2018a). Unfortunately,\
    \ such production has \nbeen conducted without technology, which has ex-\ntended\
    \ the agronomic knowledge gap (Ramírez-Gil et \nal., 2018a; Builes and Duque,\
    \ 2020). Hass avocado in \nColombia can be considered a rainfed crop because \n\
    most farmers irrigate empirically once a week only \nwhen trees manifest water\
    \ deficit signs or do not ir-\nrigate, but recently studies demonstrated that\
    \ under \ntropical condition irrigation can be necessary in a few \nmonths a year\
    \ (Erazo-Mesa et al., 2021). Therefore, \nColombian Hass avocado farmers who adopt\
    \ incipi-\nent or state of the art irrigation techniques can save \nwater and\
    \ mitigate the negative consequences of wa-\nter scarcity and climate change on\
    \ their agriculture \nproduction system in the future.\nWater scarcity and climate\
    \ change will modify the wa-\nter use in agriculture in the forthcoming years\
    \ (FAO, \n2020), including some avocado-producing areas, \nwhere changes in temperature\
    \ and precipitation are \nprojected with impacts on water balances (Ramírez-\n\
    Gil et al., 2019). In addition, climatic variability under \ntropical conditions\

    \ These demand a vast amount of historical \nor near real-time data and specialized\
    \ knowledge to \nperform the irrigation scheduling (Fernández et al., \n2020).\
    \ The factors that contribute to the reduction \nof the IS accuracy include the\
    \ high variability of the \nsoil, terrain, and microclimates; the changing trees’\
    \ \nphysiology and reseeding requirements; the differen-\ntial gene expression;\
    \ the rootstock variability in the \nnursery stage; and heterogeneous agronomic\
    \ tasks \nwithin plots (Ali, 2010).\nCurrently, the concept of digital agriculture\
    \ (DA), \npart of the revolution 4.0 concept, is being explored \nemphasizing\
    \ the use of different technologies in \nagriculture (Ramírez-Gil et al., 2021)\
    \ such as infor-\nmation and communication systems, remote and \nproximal sensing,\
    \ modeling, programming, robotics, \ncloud computing, the internet of things (IoT),\
    \ big \ndata analysis, among others (Kamilaris et al., 2017; \nEl-Gayar and Ofori,\
    \ 2020). The main objective of this \nnew approach in agriculture is the management\
    \ of \ninformation for a correct, fast, and accurate decision \nmaking. From the\
    \ DA approach, technologies that \nsuit the Hass avocado IS (Ćulibrk et al., 2014)\
    \ can be \nclassified into three categories: proximal sensing (PS), \nremote sensing\
    \ (RS), and mobile or web applications. \nStudies have reported the benefits of\
    \ using IS in avo-\ncado orchards (Holzapfel et al., 2017; Moreno-Ortega \net\
    \ al., 2019; Silber et al., 2019), highlighting a reduc-\ntion in crop water consumption\
    \ and yield, and fruit \nquality improvement.\nIn the following chapters, an exhaustive\
    \ review will \nbe made when aspects associated with the definition \nof DA, the\
    \ use of remote and proximity sensors, new \nanalysis technologies, and smart\
    \ devices and web \npages were used for the determination, program-\nming, and\
    \ management of irrigation on agricultural \nsystems with an emphasis on the Hass\
    \ avocado crop.\nDIGITAL AGRICULTURE APPROACH: \nGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS\nIn recent\
    \ years, the need for new technologies in \nagricultural systems has been characterized\
    \ by a con-\ntinuous search for sustainable solutions to face global \nchallenges,\
    \ highlighting the technological tools that \nimprove the analysis of information\
    \ and the under-\nstanding of biological phenomena. New technolo-\ngies have allowed\
    \ a better understanding of plant \ninteractions with biotic and abiotic actors,\
    \ generat-\ning criteria for the optimization of processes, conser-\nvation of\
    \ biodiversity, efficient use of resources, mass \nyields, and management of phytosanitary\
    \ problems \n(Fig. 1).\nThis new trend in agriculture has been named digi-\ntal\
    \ agriculture (DA), smart agriculture, or agriculture \n4.0, all these related\
    \ to the same concept (Rose and \nChilvers, 2018; Sharma et al., 2020). The main\
    \ objec-\ntive of this new era in agriculture is the management \nof information\
    \ for correct decision-making and the \nsearch to massify the yields with a lower\
    \ economic \nand environmental cost. This revolution implies the \nuse of technologies\
    \ such as information and commu-\nnication systems, remote and proximity sensors,\
    \ bio-\nmodeling, programming, robotics, the cloud, IoT, big \ndata analysis,\
    \ artificial intelligence, machine learn-\ning, blockchain, mobile applications,\
    \ and electronic \ndevices (Karmas et al., 2016; Kamilaris et al., 2017; \nKamilaris\
    \ and Prenafeta-Boldú, 2018; Ramírez-Gil \net al., 2018b; Smith, 2018; El-Gayar\
    \ and Ofori, 2020; \nSharma et al., 2020).\nThe DA approach presents multiple\
    \ challenges to \nachieve a high impact on a diversity of producers, \nfarm sizes,\
    \ production systems, cultures, and social \naspects. These challenges are associated\
    \ with: (i) the \nneed for reliable, fast, and accurate information as \npossible;\
    \ (ii) design of flexible tools; low-cost solu-\ntions; (iii) easy-to-implement\
    \ and friendly-interface \nalternatives to users, (iv) open-source technologies;\
    \ \nand (v) responsible innovation (Ramírez-Gil et al., \n2018; Rose and Chilvers,\
    \ 2018; Rijswijk et al., 2019).\nThe practical application of the DA approach\
    \ in dif-\nferent parts of the value chain of agricultural systems \nhas multiple\
    \ cooperative advantages (Smith, 2018; \nSharma et al., 2020). In this work, we\
    \ suggest that \nthe design and practical applications of technological \ndevelopments\
    \ associated with DA have the following \naspects: (i) objective and problem to\
    \ be solved; (ii) \ncorrect use of the principles and theoretical concep-\ntualization\
    \ of algorithms, processes, and tools used; \n(iii) resources necessary for its\
    \ implementation under \nfield conditions; (iv) products generated, correct in-\n\
    terpretation, and their limitations; and (v) economic \nviability.\nIn figure\
    \ 1, we present the main objective, some tools, \nand the potential products of\
    \ the DA approach. The \nimplementation of DA tools has contributed to a bet-\n\
    ter land use; more sustainable agronomic practices; \nVol. 16 - No. 1 - 2022\n\

    \ greater conservation of \nspecies; indirect detection of pests; harvest forecasts\
    \ \nand planning; irrigation management, fertilization \nand sanitary problems\
    \ stand out; and climate predic-\ntion (Chevalier et al., 2012; Kamilaris et al.,\
    \ 2017; Ka-\nmilaris and Prenafeta-Boldú, 2018; Ramírez-Gil et al., \n2018b; Rijswijk\
    \ et al., 2019; Sharma et al., 2020).\nOur results suggest that the practical\
    \ application of \nAD tools in avocado production systems is not wide-\nspread\
    \ worldwide. This situation indicates the great \npotential that this type of\
    \ technology can generate \nthroughout the value chain. It also indicates the\
    \ great \nchallenge that it means for the sector to be able to \nincorporate the\
    \ new developments associated with \nAD and its application as a basis for evidence-based\
    \ \ndecision-making.\nTHE USE OF PROXIMAL SENSING\nSoil-based Sensors\nA broad\
    \ set of soil-based sensor technologies to \nschedule avocado irrigation have\
    \ been reported \n(Crowley and Escalera, 2013). These imply monitor-\ning the\
    \ soil water content (SWC) with time-domain \nreflectometry (TDR) probes, capacitance\
    \ sensors, \nor reflectometry probes, or the soil matric potential \n(SMP) with\
    \ tensiometers or granular matrix sensors \n(Scanlon et al., 2002). However, most\
    \ irrigation stud-\nies in the Hass and other avocado cultivars have used \nSMP\
    \ devices to schedule irrigation (Tab. 1). SMP is \nthe amount of energy exerted\
    \ by the soil particles \nto retain water (Miyazaki, 2005), which does not \n\
    depend on the texture and other soil-related factors. \nTherefore, SMP measurements\
    \ take advantage of \nSWC readings because SMP permits standardizing \nthresholds\
    \ to initiate and stop the irrigation (Da-\nbach et al., 2016). Some reporters\
    \ considered the used \nof tensiometers as essential in avocado orchards to \n\
    avoid over and subirrigation (Goodall, 1986; du Ples-\nsis, 1991).\nEarly experiences\
    \ in the use of tensiometers to irri-\ngate avocados were reported in several\
    \ studies. Incipi-\nent knowledge about SMP thresholds to irrigate the \ncrop\
    \ led to select −1000 KPa (a value close to perma-\nnent wilting point) as one\
    \ of the irrigation-triggering \ntreatments. Due to tensiometer readings not falling\
    \ \nbelow −80 KPa, the authors used resistance blocks to \nreach this value and\
    \ consequently activate the irriga-\ntion. After this treatment was applied, the\
    \ tree trunk \ndiameter growth significantly reduced (Richards et \nal., 1962).\
    \ Other authors reported an operational ba-\nsis to schedule the avocado irrigation\
    \ using tensiome-\nters in drip irrigation systems in the United States \nFigure\

    establishing rationale thresholds to irrigate avocados \nwas reported using water\
    \ potential dynamic of the \nsoil-plant-atmosphere continuum (Bower, 1979). He\
    \ \nstated the total stomatal closure occurred at approxi-\nmately −55 kPa and\
    \ recommended maintaining the \nSMP between −25 KPa and −60 KPa and starting the\
    \ \nirrigation when the soil reaches −50 KPa.\nIn a long-term irrigation experiment\
    \ carried out be-\ntween 1968-1974 and 1974-1980 (Tab. 1), assessed \nthe effect\
    \ of 7, 14, 21, and 28-d irrigation intervals \n(thresholds to start the irrigation\
    \ ranged from −20 \nto < −80 KPa) on tree parameters of Ettinger, and \nFuerte\
    \ avocado cultivars. The application of the 21-d \nirrigation interval (corresponding\
    \ to the irrigation \ntrigger of −40 KPa) saved 24.9% of water (compared \nwith\
    \ the 7-d irrigation interval) while evidencing no \nsignificant reduction in\
    \ trunk diameter, tree canopy \nvolume, and yield. However, this produced a cumula-\n\
    tive water deficit in deep soil layers throughout the \nirrigation season (Kalmar\
    \ and Lahav, 1977; Lahav and \nKalmar, 1977, 1983).\nSMP devices must be buried\
    \ permanently in the soil \naccording to the highest avocado tree’s root density\
    \ \ndepth (Lahav and Kalmar, 1983), which is usually \nno deeper than 0.60 m (du\
    \ Plessis, 1991). The most \nappropriate SMP devices installation location cor-\n\
    responds to the permanently moist soil area, where \nthe active or feeder roots\
    \ are found (Fig. 2) (Good-\nall, 1986). In addition, it is recommended installing\
    \ \nseveral in-depth (Fig. 2) and spatially distributed ten-\nsiometers in the\
    \ field to counteract the high soil spa-\ntial variability (Crowley and Escalera,\
    \ 2013), which \nis one of the critical limitations of soil-based sensors \n(Van\
    \ Pelt and Wierenga, 2001). Once installed, ten-\nsiometer and granular matrix\
    \ sensor measurements \nmust be read manually and stored in data loggers or \n\
    on the cloud, respectively. Although manufacturers’ \ntechnical sheets state that\
    \ current tensiometers and \ngranular matrix sensors can read SMP in the ranges\
    \ of \n0, −100 KPa, and from 0, −200 KPa, respectively, in \npractice, these ranges\
    \ can oscillate in either direction.\nIrrigation scheduling using these devices\
    \ consists \nof identifying the appropriate moment to start and \nstop the irrigation\
    \ event and establishing the lowest \nand the highest SMP limits, respectively.\
    \ An irriga-\ntion event is triggered when the SMP falls below the \nlowest limit,\
    \ and this event ends when the water re-\nplenishing within the root zone rises\
    \ the SMP back \nto its highest limit. After a comprehensive review of \nthose\
    \ SMP thresholds as presented in table 1, it can \nbe affirmed that although the\
    \ most used lowest SMP \nlimit is −50 KPa, an accurate selection of this limit\

    \ \ndepends on the irrigation system and the soil texture. \nAccording to Goodall’s\
    \ recommendation (Goodall, \n1986) (Tab. 1), high-frequent systems require the\
    \ \nlowest threshold close to field capacity (FC), while \nlow-frequent systems\
    \ require an SMP threshold far \nfrom FC. Due to water in sandy soils moving faster\
    \ \nthan in those clayey soils, the lowest SMP threshold \nin sandy soils must\
    \ be close to FC, as this must be \nfar from FC in clayey soils (see du Plessis’\
    \ recommen-\ndation in Tab. 1). Although this was not detailed in \nmost of the\
    \ studies of table 1, it can be inferred that \nthe highest SMP limit used to\
    \ stop the irrigation was \n−10 KPa (FC). When two SMP devices are installed \n\
    in the field, it is recommended to use the shallowest \nreadings as the lowest\
    \ SMP threshold, and the deep-\nest readings as the highest SMP threshold (Goodall,\
    \ \n1986).\nPlant-based sensors\nPlants are living systems that take a small amount\
    \ of \nwater transported by energy gradients through the \ncontinuum soil-plant-atmosphere\
    \ (Kramer, 1983). An \nimbalance among the soil water availability, water \nused\
    \ by plant-water-related processes, and the evapo-\nrative demand causes plants\
    \ to endure water deficit \n6\n ERAZO-MESA / ECHEVERRI-SÁNCHEZ / RAMÍREZ-GIL\n\
    Rev. Colomb. Cienc. Hortic.\nstress (Taiz and Zeiger, 2002). It is noted that\
    \ plants \nreveal water stress through the water and energy \nstatus, electrical\
    \ potential, flux of related fluids, pres-\nsure, or size variation of the trunk,\
    \ stems, leaves, tis-\nsues, and other vegetative organs (Fernández, 2017). \n\
    The consequences of water stress in some plants \ncan be temporary (i.e., reversible)\
    \ due to their stress \nadaptation mechanisms or permanent, modifying \ntheir\
    \ life cycle (Silber et al., 2013). In this sense, the \nplant-based irrigation\
    \ approach takes advantage of \ndetectable water-deficit-stress plant signals\
    \ to estab-\nlish reasonable limits to trigger the irrigation (Jones, \n2004).\n\
    The most common plant-based variables tested as \npotential triggering-irrigation\
    \ parameters in Hass \navocado crop are the maximum daily trunk-diame-\nter variation\
    \ (MTDV), trunk diameter growth rate \n(TGR), trunk diameter shrinkage (TDS),\
    \ stem and \nleaf water potential (SWP and LWP), leaf stomatal \nconductance (gs),\
    \ fruit diameter variation, leaf volt-\nage differences, and photosynthesis rate\
    \ (Turner et \nal., 2001; Winer and Zachs, 2007; Gil et al., 2011; Sil-\nber et\
    \ al., 2013, 2019). A detailed list of water stress \nindicators in tree orchards\
    \ is provided (Fernández, \n2017). Furthermore, some authors had been classi-\n\
    fied in non-automated and automated the methods \nto measure plant-based variables\
    \ (Fernández, 2017). \nPorometers, infrared gas analyzers, portable photo-\nsynthesis\
    \ systems, and Scholander chambers are part \nof the first group. In the second\
    \ group sap flow sen-\nsors, magnetic leaf patch-clamp pressure probes and \n\
    TDR probes are included.\nDespite their potential benefits as described in detail\
    \ \n(Jones, 2004), the following limitations restrict in-\nfield usage of plant-based\
    \ methods to the wise irriga-\ntion management of avocado orchards (Jones, 2004;\
    \ \nSilber et al., 2013; Fernández, 2017):\n• The variability of in-field LWP\
    \ measurements is \nequal to or greater than the lowest threshold (−2 \nMPa),\
    \ making it challenging to recognize the ri-\nght time when the plant has reached\
    \ the LWP \nthreshold. \n• Specific processes of avocado tree flushes could in-\n\
    duce physiological parameters and water demand \nchanges, resulting in a lack\
    \ of precise indicators of \nplant-based thresholds. \n• The tree growth rate\
    \ of some woody crops such as \nthe avocado, depends on alternate bearing years,\
    \ \nand this involves relative trunk diameter measure-\nments in on-crop and off-crop\
    \ years. \n• Most plant-based water stress indicators exhibit a \nrecurring-diurnal\
    \ behavior, which means they de-\ncrease at midday and increase at night, reaching\
    \ a \npeak in the early mornings. \n• Plant-based sensors can be calibrated to\
    \ identify \nthe plant’s water-stress condition and, consequent-\nly, trigger\
    \ the irrigation. However, these sensors ne-\nglect how much water needs to be\
    \ applied and the \nright moment to stop irrigation. \nA few studies have attempted\
    \ to establish rationale \nirrigation indices for the Hass avocado crop. In an\
    \ ex-\nperiment the authors tested triggering the irrigation \nwhen gs fell below\
    \ 25% (by arbitrary criterium), ob-\ntaining a reduction of 33% in the water applied\
    \ and \nof 30 fruits per tree, as compared to the 120% pan \nevaporation triggering\
    \ irrigation treatment (Turner et \nal., 2001). In addition, Winer and Zachs (2007)\
    \ pro-\nposed a method to remove the water-stress cumula-\ntive effect when the\
    \ soil water was depleting from \nthe MTDV, joining successive MTDV peaks through\
    \ \na reference line. The authors affirmed this could im-\nprove water irrigation\
    \ management decisions for \navocado orchards. On the other hand (Oyarce and \n\
    Gurovich, 2010), measured in laboratory conditions \na significant electrical\
    \ potential falling of 7.10 ± 1.56 \nmV in the trunk (recorded at 25 cm above\
    \ the ground) \nof 2-year trees when the irrigation was applied.\nSilber et al.\
    \ (2012) and Silber et al. (2013) delved into \nthe response of irrigation treatments\
    \ to IS plant-\nbased parameters of Hass avocado trees, consider-\ning the effect\
    \ of environmental variables on these \nparameters. Additionally, has been reported\
    \ a poor \nhourly correlation between the tree’s water uptake, \nthe applied water\
    \ volume, and the trunk diameter \ngrowth. As the hourly water uptake rate peak\
    \ oc-\ncurred around midday (12 L h−1 / tree), the trunk \ndiameter growth decreased\
    \ (the 0.1-mm peak was \nidentified in the early morning, around 6 AM) (Silber\
    \ \net al., 2012). The daily course of the trunk diameter \ngrowth responds to\
    \ a circadian-cycle behavior. In this \nsame study, the authors determined that\
    \ TGR was \ninversely correlated to the hourly vapor pressure defi-\ncit. TGR\
    \ reached negative values (i.e., a shrinkage) in \nthe early afternoon but returned\
    \ to zero or positive \nvalues at night. Therefore, it can be affirmed that \n\
    differential irrigation strategies significantly influ-\nence plant-based parameters\
    \ of avocado trees at the \nend of the season. However, no apparent effects were\

    found on the daily dynamics, which is an indispens-\nable condition required for\
    \ effective IS. Furthermore, \nany plant based IS strategy must be calibrated\
    \ using \nthe actual crop water requirement (Gu et al., 2020).\nTHE USE OF REMOTE\
    \ SENSING\nRS fundamentals\nRemote sensing is a term that gathers a broad set\
    \ of \nnon-contact platformed-based sensors, techniques, \nmodels, communication\
    \ protocols, and applications \nproviding electromagnetic spectrum, geometrical\
    \ and \nbiophysical data from the earth’s surface and atmo-\nsphere (Tempfli et\
    \ al., 2009). Based on the acquisition-\ndata distance above the earth’s surface,\
    \ sensors can be \nclassified into the following categories: ground-based, \n\
    (i.e., systems articulated to terrestrial vehicles and \nhand-held sensors); aerials,\
    \ which include platforms \non airplanes and unmanned aerial systems (UAVs); \n\
    and space-based, as integrated by satellite constella-\ntions (Sishodia et al.,\
    \ 2020). From reduced spectral \ndatasets in the 1970s (Madry, 2017), the RS concept\
    \ \nbecame an integrated related products’ collection \nboosted through the internet\
    \ of things (IoT) and ar-\ntificial intelligence (AI) (Jung et al., 2021). Stored\
    \ in \na proper location and warranting their accessibility \nand ease to interpreting,\
    \ RS data could be regarded \nas a common heritage of humankind that provides\
    \ \nfactual evidence of historical and current changes of \nthe earth (Pelton\
    \ et al., 2017).\nPlatform-based remote sensors measure the amount, \nquality\
    \ or surface-sensor traveling time of the ener-\ngy emitted or reflected by the\
    \ objects’ surface on the \nearth or the atmosphere’s particles. Active sensors\
    \ \nemit their energy over the target’s surface and mea-\nsure the resulting reflected\
    \ energy, and passive sen-\nsors measure the reflected energy primarily sourced\
    \ \nby the sun (Reddy, 2018). Target’s surface properties \nsuch as scattering,\
    \ absorbance, and the signal’s angle, \ndirection, and polarization are measured\
    \ by remote \nsensors (Tempfli et al., 2009). Sensors capture the \nenergy in\
    \ some wavelength ranges of interest. The \nmost common to agricultural applications\
    \ are the \nso-called visible (0.38-0.75 μm), infrared (0.7-1 μm), \nshort-wavelength\
    \ infrared (1.5-3 μm), thermal in-\nfrared (3-15 μm), and microwaves (1 mm-1 m).\
    \ The \nnumber of pixels with which the surface is rebuilt, \nrevisiting days,\
    \ and wavelengths captured by these \nsensors correspond to the spatial, time,\
    \ and spectral \nresolution (Sishodia et al., 2020). RS measurements \nbecome\
    \ biophysical variables through empirical and \ntheoretical models, which must\
    \ be calibrated with \nfield readings (Tab. 2) (Huang et al., 2018). Ponder-\n\
    ing the shortage of RS concepts presented above, an \nextended background is thoroughly\
    \ described by dif-\nferent studies (Schowengerdt, 2007; Tempfli et al., \n2009;\
    \ Pelton et al., 2017).\nSince Google Earth Engine’s (GEE) arrival in 2010, the\
    \ \nuse and application development of the satellite RS \nhave massified enormously\
    \ (Tamiminia et al., 2020). \nGEE is a cloud-based petabyte platform that provides\
    \ \na refined way of acceding, visualizing, downloading, \nand processing publicly\
    \ accessible, near-real-time, \nand historical satellite RS datasets (Gorelick\
    \ et al., \n2017). In its robust platform, GEE hosts earth’s ob-\nservations from\
    \ Landsat, Sentinel, and MODIS proj-\nects; high-resolution imagery from Planet\
    \ SkySat and \nThe National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP); \nbiophysical\
    \ (DEMs, landforms, lithology, and vegeta-\ntion coverages); environmental (ecoregions,\
    \ defores-\ntation, emissions, and forest); and climate-weather \n(surface temperature,\
    \ LAI, rainfall, water vapor, and \ndroughts indices) datasets (Google Inc., 2021).\
    \ Sig-\nnificant disparities are presented in the coverage, \nprocessing level\
    \ temporal, and spatial resolution, and \nquality of these datasets by which users\
    \ are aimed to \nunderstand the specific features of the dataset of in-\nterest.\
    \ Functionalities such as ready-to-use datasets, \nparallel processing, machine\
    \ learning, image and spe-\ncialized packages, and object-oriented programming\
    \ \n(Tamiminia et al., 2020), allow users to convert RS \ndatasets into excellent\
    \ end products.\nRS applications in agriculture: Irrigation traits\nEven though\
    \ there is a broad range of approaches \nto classify RS applications in agriculture\
    \ (Weiss et \nal., 2020), the most integral, suitable-for-farmers, \nand challenging\
    \ must be based on agricultural tasks \n(Sishodia et al., 2020). Taking advantage\
    \ of recent \nIoT and AI advances in agriculture (Singh et al., \n2021), an ideal\
    \ task-based approach could consist of: \nacceding RS data stored on the cloud\
    \ or download-\ning data from in-field RS platforms; processing data \nusing theoretical,\
    \ empirical or AI models by agrono-\nmists and RS experts (Huang et al., 2018);\
    \ uploading \nthe modeling results on the cloud to the end-user; \naccessing those\
    \ modeling results through a smart-\nphone app; and deciding how to improve the\
    \ task \nof interest comparing the modeling results with \n8\n ERAZO-MESA / ECHEVERRI-SÁNCHEZ\

    \ usage of RS in new \nscouting areas, soil survey, land designing and pre-\n\
    paring, seeding, irrigation (Tab. 2), drainage, fertil-\nization, weed and pest\
    \ management, and harvesting \nhas been appropriately documented (Sishodia et\
    \ al., \n2020; Weiss et al., 2020).\nDelving into the irrigation studies using\
    \ RS products, \nit can be inferred that most of them computed in-\nstantaneous\
    \ evapotranspiration (ET) and the basal \ncrop coefficient (Kcb) from optical\
    \ satellite imagery \nto manage the irrigation. In such studies (Tab. 2), ET \n\
    was estimated through surface energy balance mod-\nels (ALEXI, Dis-ALEXI, SEBAL,\
    \ TSEB, and METRIC) \nand Kcb was estimated by correlating vegetation in-\ndices\
    \ (NDVI) with theoretical or field Kcb measure-\nments. Furthermore, table 2 helps\
    \ to identify, as a \nfirst step, the suitable RS platform for several irriga-\n\
    tion traits. A study described a web-GIS-based deci-\nsion support systems required\
    \ to schedule irrigation \nbased on ET and Kcb (Calera et al., 2017). One of these\
    \ \nis IrriSAT (Hornbuckle et al., 2016), a web platform \nthat uses Landsat and\
    \ Sentinel optical satellite imag-\nery to estimate Kcb from NDVI values.\nDespite\
    \ the resolution-related advances described \npreviously, most notably in the\
    \ tropics, the following \nfactors hinder practical applications of RS-based IS\
    \ \nin crops: the high-resolution RS datasets required to \nschedule irrigation\
    \ at a plot scale (Calera et al., 2017) \ndo not have a high-frequent revisiting\
    \ time needed to \ndaily track the soil water depletion (Li and Roy, 2017); \n\
    the high-cloud coverage in the tropical hillslope areas \nevidenced for most of\
    \ the year (Prudente et al., 2020), \ndoes not provide cloud-free time series\
    \ pixels to com-\npute the irrigation parameters; although most stud-\nies in\
    \ table 3 did not include precipitation in water \nbalance, it has a critical\
    \ influence on the soil water \nbalance (SWB) throughout the year (Richter, 2016);\
    \ \nand some RS models required to compute ET such as \nMETRIC (Olmedo and de\
    \ la Fuente-Saiz, 2018), must \nbe calibrated with hourly climate data corresponding\
    \ \nto the area of interest.\nSoil moisture retrieval from SAR images\nThe soil\

    \ et al., 2014). Plants \ncan fulfill their growth cycle thanks to the water \n\
    regulation capacity exerted by soils. Measuring SMC \nto schedule irrigation allows\
    \ for the direct detection \nof cumulative and instantaneous water changes in\
    \ \nthe soil (Gu et al., 2020), and no other variable or IS \napproach offers\
    \ such flexibility. The lack of a wide \nspatial influence of proximal sensors’\
    \ punctual SMC \nreadings (Rodríguez et al., 2018) is outperformed by \nthe global\
    \ coverage offered by remote sensors (Gore-\nlick et al., 2017). Moreover, the\
    \ soil moisture can be \nretrieved through optical and radar satellite images\
    \ \n(Calera et al., 2017). As the optical images acquisition \nprocess is hampered\
    \ by the high cloud coverage in the \ntropics (Prudente et al., 2020) and highly\
    \ conditioned \nby target-surface-reflectance properties (Dorigo et \nal., 2015),\
    \ radar sensors can work 24 h a day while \nnot being affected by the atmospheric\
    \ scattering and \nwhile controlling the energy emitted to the target \nsurface\
    \ (Tempfli et al., 2009).\nSpaceborne radar platforms can be passive or active.\
    \ \nPassive platforms receive naturally emitted energy by \nobjects on the earth’s\

    \ (according to the electromagnetic theory) are \ndecomposed into horizontal (H)\
    \ and vertical (V) vec-\ntors, producing a set of co-polarized (VV or HH) and\
    \ \ncross-polarized (VH or HV) microwave bands (Parikh \net al., 2020). Multi-polarization\
    \ sensors (e.g., Radar-\nsat-2) can retrieve several polarized bands (Sinha et\
    \ \nal., 2018), and others do this in single bands.\nBy advancing the sensed surface\
    \ exposition time, syn-\nthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology has enhanced \n\
    the spatial resolution of images (Tempfli et al., 2009). \nSinghroy (2017) described\
    \ current and future radar \nsatellite platforms’ characteristics and affirmed\
    \ that \nsome publicly available SAR satellite projects like \nSentinel-1 by ESA,\
    \ AMSR-E, SMAP, and SMOS by \nNASA, among others, have been used for SMC esti-\n\
    mation (Sishodia et al., 2020). According to Peng et al. \n(2021), Sentinel-1\
    \ is currently the most sophisticated \nSAR platform to estimate SMC. In orbit\
    \ since April \n2014 and aimed to map the planet, this mission pro-\nvides radiometric\
    \ data in C-band. Its revisiting time \nin the tropics is 12 d with a spatial\
    \ resolution of 20 \nm (ESA, 2021). The Ground Range Detected (GRD) \nLevel 1\
    \ Sentinel-1 dataset is available on GEE and can \nbe fully accessed with name\
    \ collection ‘COPERNI-\nCUS/S1_GRD’ (Google Inc., 2021).\nThe energy intensity\
    \ captured by radar platforms de-\npends on sensor-related factors (e.g., polarization\
    \ and \nwavelength), the platform pathway (e.g., incidence \nangle and the trajectory\
    \ direction), and the large-and-\nshort-scale surface properties (Tempfli et al.,\
    \ 2009). \nSurface properties at large scales lead to terrain dis-\ntortions in\
    \ the capturing process, which must be cor-\nrected to effectively interpret on-ground\
    \ observations \n(Vollrath et al., 2020). On a short scale, the roughness \nand\
    \ dielectric properties and the surface coverage \ntype (bare soil or vegetation)\
    \ define the noise of the \nsignal (Reddy, 2018). To retrieve SMC, this noise\
    \ is \ntheoretically or empirically analyzed through back-\nscattering models\
    \ (BM) (Hoeben et al., 1997). More-\nover, machine learning (ML) and AI approaches\
    \ are \nfaster and simpler alternatives to conventional mod-\nels (Datta et al.,\
    \ 2020). Notably, the radar estimated \nSMC represents the amount of water in\
    \ the first 10 \ncm of the soil profile, which is perhaps its main limi-\ntation\
    \ (Peng et al., 2021). On bare soils, the integral \nequation method (IEM), advanced\
    \ integral equation \nmodel (AIEM), Dubois, and Oh are the most used BM \n(Choker\
    \ et al., 2017). The semi-empirical water cloud \nmodel is the most reported in\
    \ vegetation-covered \nsoils (Kweon and Oh, 2015). A comprehensive review \nof\
    \ BM for retrieving SMC is found in Karthikeyan et \nal. (Karthikeyan et al.,\
    \ 2017).\nLow spatial and temporal resolutions hinder practi-\ncal applications\
    \ of SAR images in agriculture (Peng \net al., 2021). Considering irrigators who\
    \ require near-\nreal-time data availability to trigger, for instance, \nirrigation\
    \ events and finer spatial resolution (com-\npared to the unit management) to\
    \ differentiate the \nwater amount and timing by plot, radar images must \nbe\
    \ carefully used. However, studies in irrigation de-\ntection and water volume\
    \ estimation have been \nreported. Brocca et al. (2018) used SMAP, SMOS, \nASCAT,\
    \ and AMSR2 radar mission data (~12.5 km \nfor the finer spatial resolution and\
    \ a daily revisiting \nfrequency being the most common) to estimate the \nirrigation\
    \ water amount through the SM2RAIN al-\ngorithm. They validated their results\
    \ in nine areas of \nthe United States, Europe, Australia, and Africa and \nfound\
    \ a good correlation between the monthly irriga-\ntion amount radar estimates\
    \ and field measurements. \nIn this regard, Jalilvand et al. (2019) retrieved\
    \ SMC \nfrom AMSR2 data (daily revisiting time and ~25 km \nof spatial resolution)\
    \ by using the SM2RAIN algo-\nrithm in the Miandoab Plain (Iran). The radar SMC\
    \ \nestimates performed by authors followed the tempo-\nral soil water dynamics,\
    \ overestimating the amount \nof water needed for irrigation.\nOn the other hand,\
    \ Le Page et al. (2020) successfully \ndetected irrigation timing in six maize\
    \ plots (south-\nwest France), analyzing direction changes of the SMC \ntime series\
    \ retrieved through Sentinel-1 observations. \nThey recommended using SAR images\
    \ with revisit-\ning times of 2 to 4 days (d) to manage the irrigation. \nConsistent\
    \ with the study above, Bazzi et al. (2020) \nretrieved SMC from Sentinel-1 data\
    \ using the irriga-\ntion detection BM (IDM) to detect near-real-time ir-\nrigation\
    \ events in 46 intensively irrigated grassland \nplots in Crau Plain (France).\
    \ The novel IDM operates \nat grid (10 x 10 km) and plot scales to discriminate\

    Applications comparison\nAlthough it is demonstrated that using precision irri-\n\
    gation technologies significantly improves irrigation \nmanagement (Abioye et\
    \ al., 2020), most irrigators, \ninstead of scheduling irrigation using these\
    \ technolo-\ngies (Khabba et al., 2013; Vellidis et al., 2016), irrigat-\ning\
    \ empirically based on external variables such as \nwater and personnel and infrastructure\
    \ availability, \ncrop water deficit signs, and commercial trends. Mul-\ntiple\
    \ causes explain why irrigators do not implement \nnew irrigation technologies\
    \ (Abdullah and Samah, \n2013; Mottaleb, 2018). Irrigation scheduling deci-\n\
    sion-support applications such as smartphone apps, \nweb-based platforms, and\
    \ desktop programs bridge \nthe existing timing and water-related knowledge gap\
    \ \nin irrigation methods (Migliaccio et al., 2016). Thou-\nsands of valuable\
    \ irrigation-related data can currently \nbe retrieved in a publicly available\
    \ and near-real-time \nmanner through online applications. Unfortunately, \nthe\
    \ poor internet connection in worldwide rural \nzones impedes their use (Chiaraviglio\
    \ et al., 2017).\nAn extended and diverse ecosystem of applications to \nschedule\
    \ irrigation is found on the web, as intended \nfor various crops, farming organizations,\
    \ commercial \nand research interests, output targets, available input \ndata,\
    \ and development levels. A small sample is char-\nacterized in table 3, taken\
    \ from studies (in journal \nindexes) that reported their use and irrigation com-\n\
    panies’ catalogs on the web. According to the listed \nIS applications developers,\
    \ primary motivations to \nbuild these are set out to provide farmers with an\
    \ \neasy-to-use tool to support irrigation management \ndecisions, saving water\
    \ irrigation, and optimizing \nthe water productivity of selected crops. IS applica-\n\
    tions are structured into the core engine, where the \nIS model is allocated;\
    \ the database, where input, an-\ncillary, and output data are hosted; and the\
    \ graphical \ninterface, where users interact with the application.\nApps boast\
    \ user-friendly, geo-location, graphical, \nintuitive, free-access, and tactile\
    \ front ends, but \nlack robust-IS-model back-ends. Many of them are \ndeveloped\
    \ for both iPhone (iOS) and Android oper-\nating systems. Web-based platforms,\
    \ as depicted in \ntable 3, are designed to store and accede to available \n(e.g.,\
    \ remote sensing RS) data on the cloud (as sym-\nbolized in the available data\
    \ and IS approach columns \nin table 3 with ), which can be processed, retrieved,\
    \ \nand interpreted easily by farmers. These platforms \nrun on web browsers where\
    \ users must always log \nin to access their services thus avoiding inter-opera-\n\
    tive system obstacles. Desktop programs are boosted \nby the robustness, stability,\
    \ and offline advantages \nof desktop computers to implement SWB complex \nmodels.\
    \ However, the high and specialized knowl-\nedge required to operate them commonly\
    \ exceeds \nfarmers’ abilities, and thus these programs must be \nmanaged by agronomists,\
    \ who as a result occasion-\nally assist farmers in the field. As a result, desktop\
    \ \nprograms lack enough portability to support farmers’ \nin-field decisions.\n\
    The main strength of multi-platform applications is \ntheir responsive web design,\
    \ which easily overcomes \nthe agronomist-farmer problem described previously.\
    \ \nMoreover, users with administrator, agronomist, or \nfarmer roles can monitor\
    \ real-time PS devices and feed \nthese applications with data. A flaw associated\
    \ with \napps, web-based, and multi-platforms is their online \ndependency since\
    \ rural zones lack a stable internet \nconnection. Being state-of-art and portable\
    \ and offer-\ning client support, commercial applications are more \nbeneficial\
    \ than free access applications (symbolized \nin table 3 with ). Farmers who\
    \ need to choose the \nright IS application undertake a complex task because \n\
    of the enormous number of variables to consider.\nApps\nFirst attempts to deal\
    \ with irrigation traits through \nmobile appliances were made through PDA and\
    \ PC \npockets (Hornbuckle et al., 2006; Molina-Martínez \nand Ruiz-Canales, 2009),\
    \ equipped with a GPS sen-\nsor, a tactile screen, a camera, and an operating\
    \ sys-\ntem. The irrigation software was then externally \nprogrammed in LabView,\
    \ Visual Basic, Java or C, and \ninstalled on these devices. Early efforts to\
    \ remotely \ncontrol the irrigation through smartphones were \naccomplished by\
    \ wiring PS devices in the field to a \ncentral unit, processing PS readings,\
    \ and triggering ir-\nrigation event once the SMP threshold was reached \n(Fernández\

    mobile applications were trending in the agriculture \nfield in this same period.\
    \ Regarding the studies men-\ntioned above, the most limiting factors to achieving\
    \ \na whole operative irrigation system via the available \nsmartphone apps were\
    \ the lack of operational wire-\nless PS infield networks, which made it challeng-\n\
    ing to monitor broad areas; the limited battery life, \nmemory, and storage resources;\
    \ and the expensive \nimplementation.\nBetween 2010 and 2019, various studies\
    \ demonstrat-\ned how apps were used and evaluated in-field prac-\ntices, highlighting\
    \ their valuable support to farmers \n(Hamad et al., 2018). Authors as Dehnen-Schmutz\
    \ \net al. (2016) reported that although most farmers \nowned a smartphone, more\
    \ than one-third of those \ninterviewed did not use any agriculture app. In ad-\n\
    dition, Pongnumkul et al. (2015) described the use \nof apps in agriculture in\
    \ 2010-2014, underlining GPS \nand cameras as the most-used smartphone sensors\
    \ \nfor various agricultural tasks. Meanwhile, Kaewmard \nand Saiyod (Kaewmard\
    \ and Saiyod, 2014) designed \nan automatic irrigation system and tested its start-\n\
    stop irrigation signal transmission’s accuracy, finding \nan accuracy greater\
    \ than 95%. Taking advantage of \navailable real-time data from weather networks\
    \ in \nGeorgia and Florida, the United States, Migliaccio et \nal. (2016) developed\
    \ irrigation scheduling smartphone \napps for avocado, citrus, cotton (called\

    \ SCHEDULING\n13\nthe name Smartirrigation Apps (Tab. 3). When com-\npared to\
    \ other IS methods, Vellidis and others (Velli-\ndis et al., 2016) found that\
    \ after using Cotton App to \nschedule irrigation, the cotton yield was significantly\
    \ \nhigher in the 2013 and 2014 seasons and higher in the \n2015 season, and the\
    \ water use efficiency (WUE) was \nhigher in the 2013 and 2014 seasons.\nThe IS\
    \ smartphone app used by the avocado growers \ndetailed above goes by the name\
    \ Smartirrigation Avo-\ncado and can be found in the Google Play and Apple \n\
    App Stores (Migliaccio et al., 2016). This app requires \ninput parameters such\
    \ as the irrigation system, the \ncrop, the soil type, and IS characteristics\
    \ to output \nthe accumulated precipitation for the seven previous \ndays, the\
    \ applied irrigation events timing, and the \nreached moisture depth. Each day,\
    \ Smartirrigation \nAvocado shows the irrigation events required for the \nnext\
    \ 15 d, based on the five-previous-day crop evapo-\ntranspiration, as computed\
    \ using nearby-station \nweather data from the Florida Automated Weather \nNetwork.\
    \ Irrigation doses change throughout the \ncrop seasons according to Kc of 0.6,\
    \ 0.8, 0.7, 1.0, and \n0.7 to dormancy, flower bud development, flowering \nand\
    \ fruit set, fruit growth, and after harvest. Mba-\nbazi et al. (2017) compared\
    \ the IS provided by this \napp with SWB field observations and found that the\
    \ \ndrainage, irrigation depth, and wetted area simulated \nerrors were not significant.\
    \ Mbabazi et al. (2017) de-\ntermined that using Smartirrigation Avocado could\
    \ \nreduce the irrigation water used for the crop between \n62 to 67% moistening\
    \ the first 12.7 mm of the soil \ndepth by any given event, compared with irrigating\
    \ \nthree times per week.\nRecently, other IS apps have been developed for toma-\n\
    to (Miller et al., 2018) and grains crops (Freebairn et \nal., 2018), exploiting\
    \ artificial intelligence techniques \n(Ferreira et al., 2020), reading soil matric\
    \ potential \ndevices (UNL, 2019), and integrating IS data to IoT \nenvironments\
    \ (Sales et al., 2020). After validating in \nfield conditions, authors of the\
    \ three first apps men-\ntioned above concluded IS apps do reliably estimate \n\
    the soil water dynamic and positively impact WUE. \nMoreover, other authors compared\
    \ IS apps features \nand found the most common were Map View, farm \ndivisions\
    \ (plots), and irrigation planning (Sales et al., \n2020). In line with the agriculture\
    \ 4.0 concept, IoT \nand smartphones will lead the progressive transfor-\nmation\
    \ of irrigation technology toward irrigation 4.0 \nas the direct connection between\
    \ farmers and irriga-\ntion systems (Nawandar and Satpute, 2019; da Silva \net\
    \ al., 2020; Li et al., 2020). Therefore, there is enough \nsustained evidence\
    \ to affirmatively respond the ques-\ntion put forward of whether crops can be\
    \ watered by \nour phones (Puértolas et al., 2019).\nCONCLUSIONS\nTraditional\
    \ irrigation scheduling methods have been \ninvariantly reported in Hass avocado\
    \ irrigation dedi-\ncated studies for decades. Soil water balance and \nsoil-based\
    \ sensors such as tensiometers and granular \nmatrix sensors are the most mature\
    \ methods. Fortu-\nnately, new digital agriculture technologies are chang-\ning\
    \ how such methods and their data are controlled \nin the field and handled, respectively,\
    \ boosting the \ndecision-making process toward increasing water use \nefficiency\
    \ and the fruit quality parameters and reduc-\ning the amount of water used for\
    \ Hass avocado crop. \nAlthough remote sensing technologies are no being \nwidely\
    \ used in the Hass avocado crop irrigation, radar \nimages stand out above optical\
    \ images because the \nsurface soil moisture, their specific product to sched-\n\
    ule irrigation, can be retrieved in acceptable periods, \navoiding the high cloud\
    \ coverage problem presented \nby optical images in tropics. Avocado dedicated\
    \ ap-\nplications represent a trustful tool for Hass avocado \ngrowers to irrigate\
    \ their orchards technically.  Inte-\ngrating remote and proximal sensing technologies\
    \ \nthrough user-friendly applications can represent a \nsuitable option to improve\
    \ Hass avocado irrigation in \ndeveloping countries.\nConflict of interests: The\
    \ manuscript was prepared \nand reviewed with the participation of all authors,\

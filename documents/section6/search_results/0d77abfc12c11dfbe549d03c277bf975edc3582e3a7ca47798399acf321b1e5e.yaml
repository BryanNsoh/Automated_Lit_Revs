    73 SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract Dwindling water supplies, increasing drought
    frequency and uncertainties associated with a changing climate mean Europe''s
    irrigated agriculture sector needs to improve water efficiency and produce more
    ''crop per drop''. This paper summarizes the drivers for change, and the constraints
    and opportunities for improving agricultural water management through uptake of
    precision irrigation technologies. A multi-disciplinary and integrated approach
    involving irrigation engineers, soil scientists, agronomists and plant physiologists
    will be needed if the potential for precision irrigation within the field crop
    sector is to be realized. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry Introduction In
    many European river basins where irrigated agriculture is concentrated, there
    is increasing competition for water.1 Climate change threatens to exacerbate the
    situation with a reduction in resource availability,2 a wider spectrum of crop
    production risks3 and an increase in agricultural water demand.4 Despite its economic
    importance, the sustainability of irrigated production is under threat due to
    increasing water scarcity5 and concerns regarding the impact of over-abstraction
    on the environment.6 The total irrigated area in Europe is 12 × 106 ha, which
    represents 5% of the global irrigated area.7 Irrigation water demand varies depending
    on temporal and spatial variations in soils and agroclimate, crop requirement
    and access to water resources of appropriate quality. For Europe as a whole, irrigation
    accounts for 24% of abstractions,6 but in central and northern Europe are typically
    small (<5% of total abstractions), although they can still can have significant
    environmental impacts, particularly in drier catchments in the driest months and
    driest years when resources are most constrained. Here supplemental irrigation
    is used, most notably on high-value field-scale (outdoor) horticulture, where
    it serves to maximize yield and quality of fruit and vegetables for retailers
    (supermarkets) and processors.8 In contrast, in parts of Mediterranean Europe,
    irrigation accounts for over 80% of total abstractions6 and is used in intensive
    and extensive cropping, including field and protected horticulture. Clearly, securing
    adequate water for agriculture will be essential to meet future food demands for
    a growing population. Any changes in water allocation should account for the multifunctional
    nature and diversity of benefits that agriculture provides in addition to food
    production.3 Agriculture in Europe, like other parts of the world, faces a major
    challenge: supplying more food to meet increasing demands while simultaneously
    reducing its environmental impact.9 Under a scenario of reduced water availability,
    increasing drought frequency and uncertainties associated with a changing climate,
    Europe''s irrigated agriculture sector needs to do more with less. This implies
    a need to increase water productivity (t−1 ha−1). Although irrigation has been
    practised for centuries, only recently has the sector had to respond to societal
    demands for reductions in water allocation and improvements in efficiency. A major
    gap still exists between research and on-farm irrigation practice, which is reflected
    in large differences between actual and potential yield: the ''yield gap''.5 In
    most cases, such gaps can be attributed to suboptimal management, inappropriate
    technology and/or lack of training. In this context, precision irrigation, defined
    as site-specific irrigation management that relies on the variable application
    of water (adapted from Cassman10), emerges as a potential solution to increase
    the productivity, and reduce the environmental impact, of irrigated agriculture.
    A committed international effort will be needed to implement technologies that
    are appropriate for different farming systems to reduce both water and energy
    use, while improving crop yield and quality. This paper discusses the drivers
    for change and highlights the constraints and opportunities for improving agricultural
    water management through precision irrigation. Drivers For Change Agricultural
    intensification has required growers to become more specialized and for many growers
    an investment in irrigation has provided the basis for increasing profitability.
    Rising labour and energy costs, coupled with consumer demands for premium quality,
    mean farmers now have to consider the impacts of non-uniformity of irrigation
    application on crop yield and, particularly, quality. For some crops, such as
    potatoes, the size, colour, shape and skin finish of the harvested product all
    impact on price and marketability. Quality criteria are increasingly specified
    as a condition of contract and sale, and failure to meet quality standards can
    lead to large price discounting, and possibly to rejection and loss of contract.
    In high-value sectors such as salads the premia are high and it can be difficult
    to secure contracts without guaranteed access to irrigation. Crop assurance schemes
    are also playing a key role in promoting precision irrigation since these require
    growers to manage and audit irrigation practices and links these to traceability
    and accountability in support of public health and environmental protection regulation.
    European irrigated agriculture also needs to respond to environmental regulation
    challenges – most notably through the Water Framework Directive (WFD 2000/60/E).
    The WFD provides the major driver for achieving sustainable water management across
    all EU member states.11 It applies to all fresh waters and includes aims to tackle
    diffuse pollution ranging from fertilizer and pesticide applications in irrigated
    agriculture to urban run-off. owing to their dependence on fertilizers, irrigated
    farms need to ensure that diffuse pollution does not contribute to water pollution
    at the catchment scale. Here precision irrigation could play an important role
    in mitigating such risks by matching irrigation to soil type, its inherent permeability
    and nutrient retention capacity and by using liquid fertilizer matched with variable
    irrigation applications. The rising cost of fertilizer will also act as an industry
    incentive to match inputs to plant growth and requirement. Reduced water availability
    and reliability for irrigation abstraction are also likely to be important drivers
    for change, as member states implement new abstraction control measures. In some
    countries, abstraction regimes are already in place, but in others new frameworks
    for abstraction regulation need to be implemented.12 In future, farmers will need
    to demonstrate more efficient and sustainable use of water to secure rights (permits)
    for irrigation abstraction1 and to comply with industry protocols regarding food
    safety and crop assurance.13 Developing innovative approaches to combine better
    spatial and temporal knowledge of soil properties, crop requirements and improved
    equipment practices are prerequisites for improving water productivity through
    precision irrigation – whether driven by market, regulatory or public demands
    for greater environmental sustainability. Constraints And Opportunities On most
    farms, making best use of stored soil moisture and rainfall, knowing precisely
    where and when irrigation has to be applied, and then applying it accurately and
    uniformly, are fundamental steps in the pathway to water efficiency.1 Although
    irrigation is usually justified by increased production, there is growing evidence
    that optimized irrigation regimes under temperate and humid conditions can also
    lead to improved post-harvest quality, resulting in reduced crop waste through
    the food supply chain. Presently, farmers are restricted in their ability to match
    the timing and frequency of irrigation applications to inherent spatial and temporal
    variations in soil moisture and crop growth. They generally have only limited
    information on plant water status, rely on limited in situ point measurements
    of soil as a proxy for field-scale soil moisture availability, and use outdated
    irrigation application systems that lack the necessary flexibility and control
    for variable water application. A combination of improved application technology,
    monitoring systems and understanding of crop responses will be needed to enable
    growers to utilize precision irrigation in field crops for commercial and environmental
    benefit. A brief perspective of the innovations in relevant technologies is given
    below. The paper focuses specifically on outdoor field-scale production where
    most water in agriculture is abstracted and used; precision irrigation for indoor
    (protected) production systems is also important, but is not specifically considered
    here. Developing variable-rate irrigation technology Most of the land irrigated
    in Europe relies on overhead irrigation, using sprinklers, high-pressure rain
    guns, centre pivots or booms. These can be inefficient in both energy and water
    use. There is a tendency to view micro (drip or trickle) irrigation as the solution
    to improving water efficiency, which partially explains why micro irrigation has
    been heavily promoted, often by regulators and governments. Compared to traditional
    surface methods, trickle irrigation offers the potential for much greater water
    use efficiency,14 though the benefits against good overhead irrigation are smaller.
    Despite higher costs, trickle is an attractive option in regions where water resources
    are scarce and/or expensive. Globally, micro irrigation accounts for less than
    5% of all irrigated farmland.7 In Europe, the proportion is not dissimilar; the
    dominance of low-value irrigated production having contributed to a relatively
    slow rate of growth but there are notable exceptions, such as in Spain (28%) and
    Italy (14%). Precision irrigation through the subdivision of control zones and
    increasingly sophisticated electronic controllers may provide the way forward
    there. Wider user of micro irrigation is limited beyond arid areas by the cost
    of installing and operating systems around sequential plantings, rotational cropping
    and sporadic uses where irrigation is supplementary. Indeed, many growers in such
    areas are reconsidering sprinkler systems as an alternative to micro (drip) irrigation,
    using semi-permanent (seasonal) solid-set systems rather than conventional portable
    systems. It is likely that the greatest short-term improvements in water efficiency
    there will be achieved through developing precision irrigation for overhead systems.
    Most overhead irrigation technologies used in field-scale agriculture fail to
    apply the same depth of water across a field uniformly. Sprinkler irrigation systems
    are adversely affected by pressure variation along and between laterals and, due
    to ground slopes, inadequate overlap of the application patterns between sprinklers
    and wind distortion.15 Similarly, hose reel systems fitted with guns, which account
    for most agricultural irrigation in northern Europe, are notoriously susceptible
    to wind.16 Hose reel systems using booms, which are increasingly popular for field-scale
    horticultural irrigation, provide more uniform application than guns but are still
    sensitive to pressure variation, inconsistent pull-in speed and wind distortion.
    None of the current systems provides sufficient flexibility to cope with spatially
    varying water application. Combining the technologies for individually valved
    sprinklers and computer control developed within the sports turf (golf) industry
    with semi-permanent solid-set sprinkler systems offers great potential to produce
    a cost-effective and highly controllable method of applying water variably across
    a field with controlled volumes applied to individual cropping zones. Optimization
    of which sprinklers operate simultaneously will also allow smaller pipe sizes
    and operating pressure, thus reducing capital and/or pumping (energy) costs. A
    number of researchers have tested variable applications systems using centre pivot
    systems on field crops.17 To date, centre pivot systems have been the focus of
    much of the variable-rate technology research given their ease and suitability
    for installing spatial crop-monitoring equipment and for modifying sprinkler discharge
    packages. The transfer of such technology into portable overhead systems, including
    sprinklers and hose reels fitted with booms, is technically possible but implementation
    of precision irrigation requires a greater understanding of heterogeneity of irrigation
    need across a field. Understanding heterogeneity of soil water content across
    a field The capability of adding variable volumes of irrigation needs to be matched
    to an understanding of the variability of soil and soil water content across a
    field.5 Yield mapping and/or traditional soil sampling can help identify different
    soil zones, and it is now possible to map spatial soil variability using electromagnetic
    induction (EMI) or near-infrared (NIR) systems on a field scale. Researchers are
    also using satellite imagery and imaging devices mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAV) over larger areas. The greatest efficiency gains from variable-rate irrigation
    will be realized where growers know how little water they can apply without impacting
    on the commercial return from their crop. This requires an understanding of the
    level of water ''stress'' the plant is experiencing and the critical level of
    stress for onset of yield or quality responses. Increasingly, growers are relying
    on soil moisture sensors, utilizing a range of technologies, each with relative
    advantages and disadvantages.18 In general, they only measure soil moisture status
    near to the sensor and, in order to understand the irrigation requirement across
    a field, particularly where soil properties are heterogeneous, multiple readings
    or networks of sensors will be needed. With the increasing availability of cheap
    soil moisture sensors and low-energy data logging/transmission has come the possibility
    of semi-permanent sensor arrays in situ generating real-time soil water data.19
    Knowing where to place the sensors then becomes a critical question (which may
    be solved through identifying areas of a field that have different water-holding
    properties). Using crop sensors to match irrigation to crop needs Monitoring soil
    moisture status is a proxy for measuring plant water status, with the underlying
    assumption that soil moisture content correlates to some extent with plant water
    status.20 However, plants are plastic in their response to reduced water availability,
    changing root and shoot growth, and the relationship between soil water status
    and the threshold for irrigation is not constant through crop development. If
    it were possible to routinely schedule irrigation from plant responses rather
    than direct measurements of soil water status, this may allow greater precision
    in matching irrigation quantity to crop need. Potentially useful plant responses
    to water stress have been well reviewed;21 these include measures of diurnal tissue
    expansion, tissue water content sensors, relative growth rates, sap flow and stomatal
    conductance. To date, physiological responses have been used to supplement knowledge
    for irrigation scheduling predominantly in production in semi-arid environments
    with little or no rainfall, e.g. tree crops,22 vines23 and glasshouse crops.24
    This approach can also be moved from the whole plant to the whole field or crop
    scale with the development of high-resolution and high-frequency remote sensing
    (e.g. MODIS) technology which can monitor spatial changes in crop cover, informing
    growers on variation in crop water use and evapotranspiration.7 Novel irrigation
    management: regulated deficit irrigation and partial root drying Precision irrigation
    also has the potential to be used in new irrigation management techniques that
    manipulate plant growth rather than just prevent the crop from being exposed to
    a level of water stress that leads to economic loss. It is well known that roots
    in drying soil generate abscisic acid (ABA) and this is one of the pathways controlling
    stomatal aperture.25 By manipulating soil water content in the root zone, crop
    transpiration can be manipulated through ABA-mediated stomatal closure following
    transient drought stress imposed at stages in the crop cycle, known as regulated
    deficit irrigation (RDI) or through alternating portions of the root zone that
    dry down, termed partial root zone drying (PRD) . These techniques have been successfully
    implemented in tree fruit26 and vine crops27 with some commercial success in South
    America, southern Europe and Australia, and work through reducing leaf growth,
    redirecting resources to fruit growth and/or increasing radiation interception
    by the fruit.28 However, techniques designed to increase ABA signalling by exposing
    crops to periods of drought stress are more difficult to implement with field
    vegetable crops such as lettuce29 that rely on an increase in leaf biomass for
    yield increases. However, drying soil can stimulate deeper rooting30 and there
    may be benefits in reduced irrigation at the early, less yield-sensitive, stages
    of crops that produce deeper-rooting plants, enabling access to water lower in
    the soil profile and conferring greater resilience to midsummer drought events.
    Another area of plant physiological response to managed water stress is that of
    improved post-harvest quality, for example, water deficit imposed close to head
    maturity improved broccoli head colour and stem turgor and subsequent post-harvest
    quality.31 Benefits are also reported in lettuce, where long-term mild deficit
    treatments produced lettuces less prone to post-harvest enzymatic browning.32
    In contrast, post-harvest quality decreased in stored onions where deficit treatments
    were imposed during bulbing.33 There are also biochemical changes that may improve
    human nutritive value which are associated with water stress, such as increased
    content of bioactive compounds in cabbage,34 broccoli35 and lettuce.36 Nevertheless,
    the physiological and biochemical mechanisms underlying post-harvest benefits
    are not well understood and further work is needed in this area to quantify these
    potential benefits. Summary And Way Forward Water is becoming an increasingly
    scarce resource and a limiting factor in intensive production of irrigated field
    vegetable crops, both in supplementary and continuous irrigation systems. There
    is pressure on growers from governments and the supply chain to maximize the commercial
    utilization of irrigation water by the crop. Precision irrigation may offer a
    solution but there are a number of challenges that need to be addressed before
    the benefits of this approach will be realized practically. Current research demonstrates
    that there is potential for significant improvements for irrigated field crops
    in both water use efficiency and crop quality. This may be achieved through managing
    water use by variable-rate application aligned with a greater understanding of
    heterogeneity of soil water distribution. A multidisciplinary research approach
    involving irrigation engineers, soil scientists, agronomists and plant physiologists
    will be needed to realize the potential of precision irrigation in field crops.

    \ water resources. Advances in irrigation systems and technologies allow site-speciﬁc\
    \ application\nof irrigation water within the ﬁeld to improve water use efﬁciency\
    \ or reduce water usage for\nsustainable crop production, especially in arid and\

    \ scheduling\n1. Introduction\nAgriculture is the largest consumer of the world′s\
    \ available fresh water, as plant growth largely\ndepends on the availability\
    \ of water. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),\ncurrent\
    \ world irrigated area is approximately 300 million ha, and projection to 2050\
    \ suggests growing\nscarcities of water resources for agriculture, although water\
    \ is a renewable resource. This situation has\nampliﬁed the intensity of global\
    \ food insecurity, climate change, and poverty. The greatest challenge\nto agriculture\
    \ is to provide food and ﬁber for almost 8 billion people around the world in\
    \ the advent of\ndepleting freshwater resources [1].\nThe challenge is more prominent\
    \ in the arid and semi-arid regions, where underground water\nsources, especially\
    \ aquifers are used for irrigation, as rainfall provides only a portion of the\
    \ total\nrequirement for crop evapotranspiration (ET) demand [2]. Heavy irrigation\
    \ has caused rapid depletion\nof many aquifers. For instance, comparing the water\
    \ level of the Ogallala aquifer in the 1950s to that\nof 2013, in some wells,\
    \ up to 78 m of water was depleted in the Texas High Plains area [3]. This is\n\
    almost 12 times the average decline of 4.5 m for the whole area of the aquifer.\
    \ Given this depletion rate,\nscientists have predicted that 35% of the Southern\
    \ High Plains will not be able to support irrigation in\n30 years. Many other\
    \ water resources in the world are depleting rapidly in recent years with negligible\n\
    recharge, indicating the need for water conservation solutions in agriculture\
    \ [4,5]. More effective and\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87; doi:10.3390/agronomy9020087\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n2 of 21\nefﬁcient management\
    \ of water is required to better conserve water and improve water use efﬁciency\n\
    for sustainable crop production.\nConventional farming practices manage an agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld uniformly without incorporating\nthe intrinsic variability in topography,\
    \ soil, crop growth conditions, and other agronomic factors.\nThis can result\
    \ in nutrient leaching, environmental contamination, and reduced proﬁtability\
    \ especially\nwhen applying high inputs in low yielding areas and vice versa [6,7].\
    \ Precision agriculture can be\nadopted to divide the ﬁeld into small management\
    \ units for optimized production [8]. There are\nseveral deﬁnitions for precision\
    \ agriculture, and it keeps evolving with emerging technologies and\nunderstanding\
    \ of what is achievable [9]. The idea of precision agriculture or site-speciﬁc\
    \ management\nstarted around the early 1980s with the development of various technologies\
    \ to assess ﬁeld variabilities\nsuch as soil survey, soil testing and mapping,\
    \ and crop yield monitoring [10–13]. Precision agriculture\ndepends on detailed\
    \ spatial information, information technology, greater information processing\n\
    capability, and better decision aids [14]. Precision agriculture is a management\
    \ system that measures\nand responds to the spatial and temporal variability of\
    \ soil and crop growth at the sub-ﬁeld level\nwith the aim to enhance proﬁtability\
    \ and reduce environmental impact [15,16]. Major technologies\ninvolved in precision\
    \ agriculture include geographic information systems (GIS), remote and proximal\n\
    sensing, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), yield monitoring and the variable\
    \ rate technology.\nGeoreferenced information about soil and plant characteristics\
    \ can be obtained efﬁciently using GIS,\nproximal sensors and remote sensors [17].\
    \ Application of yield monitors provides the capability to\nprecisely characterize\
    \ yield variability at large scales in the ﬁeld. Moreover, the variable rate technology\n\
    provides the ability to site-speciﬁcally apply irrigation water in the ﬁeld to\
    \ achieve potential water\nsavings [18]. This enables the timely and accurate\
    \ water application incorporating the spatial and\ntemporal soil properties and\
    \ plant demand at different growth stages [15]. In other words, the variable\n\
    rate irrigation (VRI) technology can help to apply the right amount of water in\
    \ the right area of the\nﬁeld at the right time resulting in water savings.\n\
    Recent research suggests site-speciﬁc management of water or VRI could be a solution\
    \ to conserve\nwater and improve water use efﬁciency (WUE), which is the ratio\
    \ between effective water use and\nactual water withdrawal in the ﬁeld [19]. VRI\
    \ can support water and energy conservation with a\npositive inﬂuence on crop\
    \ water productivity and the environment [20]. This is possible by applying\n\
    irrigation at rates that vary to appropriately match ﬁeld variability based on\
    \ speciﬁc water needs\nof individual management zones rather than applying a uniform\
    \ rate throughout the ﬁeld [21].\nThe magnitude of soil water content (SWC) varies\
    \ with time and location, but the pattern of spatial\nvariability usually remains\
    \ similar. This temporal stability of SWC is associated with properties of the\n\
    ﬁeld such as topography, soil texture, apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa)\
    \ and drainage patterns\nthat insigniﬁcantly change over time [22,23]. The feasibility\
    \ and effectiveness of VRI depend on the\nsize of the ﬁeld, crop species under\
    \ consideration, weather, and the underlying ﬁeld properties such as\nelevation,\
    \ slope, soil texture, and ECa that inﬂuence soil moisture content and irrigation\
    \ requirements\nfor the crop [24,25]. Hence, understanding the inﬂuence of agronomic\
    \ factors such as topography and\nsoil properties on soil water and ultimately\
    \ yield can provide a basis for application of VRI in the ﬁeld\nto achieve potential\
    \ water savings together with yield optimization.\nToday, site-speciﬁc water management\
    \ has been made easier with several precision agriculture\ntools, such as GNSS,\
    \ GIS, yield mapping, soil survey and remote sensing [26]. Several decision support\n\
    tools and strategies to reduce groundwater withdrawal without reductions in irrigated\
    \ land area or\ncrop productivity have been developed [4]. The measures to optimize\
    \ the use of irrigation water in\nthe ﬁelds include increasing weather-based irrigation\
    \ scheduling, converting gravity-based irrigation\nto center pivot irrigation,\
    \ subsurface drip irrigation, replacing high water to low water demand\ncrops,\
    \ and deﬁcit irrigation based on evapotranspiration replacement using various\
    \ water-balance\nmodels [27]. Several studies have been done to understand the\
    \ possible water savings with VRI.\nA review on VRI across different crop and\
    \ weather regimes of the world concluded that VRI could save\n10%–15% of water\
    \ [28]. Although the use of VRI seems to be a reasonable measure to improve water\n\

    \ it because limited research is done at the ﬁeld scale\nto understand its reliability\
    \ and economic potential [25]. A better understanding of ﬁeld variability and\n\
    how it affects crop yield is needed for effective implementation of the new technologies.\
    \ A review for\nsite-speciﬁc sprinkler irrigation [29] focused on the technology\
    \ and challenges for adoption. Another\nreview of 20 years’ research on increasing\
    \ crop productivity with sprinkler and micro-irrigation\ndiscussed the importance\
    \ of understanding the crop response to VRI [30]. The study emphasized the\nneed\
    \ for continuous effort towards management zone delineation based on ﬁeld properties\
    \ integrated\nwith dynamic information from real-time monitoring of climatological\
    \ and crop data. However,\nthis study focused more on the technological aspect\
    \ of irrigation management than the agronomic\naspect of water conservation with\
    \ VRI. The agricultural science behind VRI is equally crucial for\nthe successful\
    \ implementation of this technology. Hence, the objective of this paper is to\
    \ review the\nscientiﬁc background and technologies in precision water management,\
    \ with the focus on agronomic\nfactors and strategies for site-speciﬁc water management.\n\
    2. Variable-Rate Irrigation Technologies\nThe irrigation system changed from gravity-based\
    \ furrow irrigation in the 1950s to sprinkler\nirrigation in late 1990s. Initially,\
    \ the high-pressure sprinkler irrigation system was available in the\n1980s which\
    \ later developed to low-pressure sprinklers and low-energy precision application\
    \ (LEPA)\nin 1990s [31–33]. About 49% of total irrigated land in the United States\
    \ is irrigated with center pivot\nsystems, out of which 44% is irrigated at low\
    \ pressure under 30 psi [34]. The basic requirements for the\nVRI technology are\
    \ sensors and spatial information, prescription maps and a system to incorporate\
    \ VRI\nprescription (e.g., LEPA, lateral irrigation, etc.) to apply in the ﬁeld\
    \ [35]. At present, there are several\nirrigation technologies for conservation\
    \ irrigation, such as sprinkler, drip, and other micro-irrigation\nsystems but\
    \ limited site-speciﬁc studies have been done [30,36–38]. For example, a study\
    \ of the\nvariable-rate drip irrigation system on vineyard found up to 17% increase\
    \ in yield and a 20% decrease\nin water consumption compared to uniform irrigation\
    \ [39]. Researchers in the UK assessed the potential\nof hose-reel boom irrigators\
    \ for precision irrigation in vegetables [40]. Automatic gravity-fed irrigation\n\
    systems in Europe decreased manual labor and supported adoption by innovative\
    \ farmers [41].\nVariable-rate irrigation using center pivot in rice showed better\
    \ performance compared to uniform\nﬂooding irrigation [42]. In this review, we\
    \ will focus more on those irrigation technologies that have\nbeen used for site-speciﬁc\
    \ water management more frequently around the world, such as variable-rate\nlateral\
    \ irrigation systems and center pivot irrigation systems.\nThe components of a\
    \ variable-rate lateral irrigation system commonly consist of a GPS or GNSS\n\
    receiver, custom software-controlled relays and valves, which can apply variable\
    \ water utilizing the\nnozzle-pulsing technique and a variable speed control system.\
    \ This system can control the irrigation\nrate and forward speed with high accuracy\
    \ [43]. Similarly, the components of a center pivot VRI system\ninclude a pivot\
    \ control panel, a VRI control panel, solenoid valves, control nodes, a GNSS system,\n\
    a variable frequency drive and a remote-control system [21]. The pivot control\
    \ regulates the operation\nand speed of the pivot, while the VRI control panel\
    \ regulates the irrigation application rate in response\nto the prescription map\
    \ and the pivot location. Solenoid valves regulate the ﬂow of sprinkler heads.\n\
    The GNSS system at the end of the center pivot provides the pivot position. The\
    \ control nodes along\nthe length of the pivot determine when the valves are open\
    \ or close. The variable frequency drive\n(VFD) helps to regulate the pressure\
    \ while instantaneously changing the rate of irrigation at different\npositions\
    \ of the ﬁeld. The VFD controls the rotation speed of the pump impeller by receiving\
    \ the input\nfrom a pressure switch installed on the pump outlet pipe. This keeps\
    \ water pressure stable within\npreset maximum and minimum thresholds and thus\
    \ saving water and energy. The remote control\nsystem allows to view and control\
    \ the center pivot and the pump from a distance via a smartphone or\na computer\
    \ using the internet [21]. Further, research and development are striving to control\
    \ irrigation\namount with VRI controllers using real-time information from plant\
    \ and soil sensors in the ﬁeld [44].\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n4 of 21\nCurrently,\
    \ several companies work on the manufacture and application of this technology.\n\
    The commercially available VRI control resolution varies with the manufacturers.\
    \ VRI systems\ncan apply zero water to speciﬁc nozzles and as much as 200% of\
    \ the standard application rate\nto other nozzles by opening or closing individual\
    \ nozzles and by changing the speed of the\npivot [45]. Some companies provide\
    \ the ability to control zones of sprinklers, while others can\ncontrol each sprinkler\
    \ independently [46]. For example, Valley (Valley, Valmont Irrigation, Valley,\
    \ NE,\nUSA) provides variable speed control and variable zone control technologies\
    \ for site-speciﬁc water\napplication. The variable speed control system uses\
    \ an advanced control panel that can slow down or\nspeed up the pivot to vary\
    \ water input in different areas (sectors) of the ﬁeld, but the overall pivot\
    \ ﬂow\nrate remains constant. This system does not need additional hardware on\
    \ the existing pivot irrigation\nsystem. The variable zone control system can\
    \ vary the speed of the center and change the application\nrate along the pivot\
    \ lateral. This system applies different irrigation depths to different areas\
    \ of the ﬁeld\nby turning sprinklers on and off for various amounts of time. Trimble\
    \ (Trimble Navigation, Sunnyvale,\nCA, USA) has developed the Irrigate-IQ Variable-Rate\
    \ Irrigation System. This system incorporates\nthe VFD and variable speed drive\
    \ (VSD) into the recent optimal ﬂow VRI that works with standard\npump equipment\
    \ on wells with limited capacity. This system is capable of individual nozzle\
    \ control,\nwhich can apply the right amount of water in the right place more\
    \ accurately [47]. Currently, it is\npossible to achieve sector control with very\
    \ small resolution, and zone control can add irrigation zones\nfurther to the\
    \ sector at the small scales of lateral spans (Figure 1) [48]. A study conducted\
    \ in Canada to\nevaluate the performance of VRI found that the accuracy of water\
    \ application was up to 90% in the\ncenter pivot system [49]. However, the performance\
    \ of these irrigation systems in ﬁeld applications is\naffected by many factors,\
    \ such as ﬁeld attributes, the spatial resolution of the sensors used in irrigation\n\
    management and temporal resolution of data inputs, as well as unexpected environmental\
    \ conditions.\nHence, adaptive irrigation management strategies and active research\
    \ support are required to enhance\nthe adoption and application of VRI [20,50].\n\

    \ for crop growth. The variability of soil and\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n5 of 21\n\
    topographic properties combined can explain 28% to 85% of yield variability [51].\
    \ Hence, it is critical\nto quantify the variability of terrain attributes and\
    \ soil properties for VRI applications.\n3.1. Topography\nTopographic variation\
    \ is a common characteristic of large agricultural ﬁelds that result in spatial\n\
    variability of soil water and ultimately crop yield [52]. Topography or terrain\
    \ has two types of attributes,\nprimary and secondary attributes [53]. Primary\
    \ attributes include elevation, slope, aspect, curvature,\nﬂow length, and upslope\
    \ contributing area. Secondary attributes are derived empirically from several\n\
    primary attributes to characterize speciﬁc processes manifesting in the landscape,\
    \ mainly including\nsediment transport index (STI), stream power index (SPI),\
    \ ﬂow direction, ﬂow accumulation, distance\nto ﬂow accumulation lines (DFL),\
    \ and wetness index [53,54]. Topographic properties affect soil physical\nand\
    \ chemical properties such as texture (sand, silt, and clay content), pH, CaCO3,\
    \ extractable Ca and\nMg, available K, base saturation, organic matter, and cation\
    \ exchange capacity (CEC). Topography also\ninﬂuences hydrologic properties and\
    \ processes and can account for up to 50% of water availability\ndifferences in\
    \ the same ﬁeld [52]. Elevation, slope and surface curvatures directly affect\
    \ inﬁltration and\nrunoff as they inﬂuence the surface and subsurface ﬂow of water\
    \ in the ﬁeld [55,56]. This can have a\nsigniﬁcant effect on crop growth and yield,\
    \ resulting in differences in crop production of up to 69% at\ndifferent positions\
    \ in the ﬁeld [57–59].\nA study conducted in central Illinois and eastern Indiana\
    \ showed that topography alone could\nexplain about 20% of yield variability [60].\
    \ Corn yield variability was consistently correlated with\nelevation and slope\
    \ in a three-year study in Southern Portugal [53]. This study showed that topographic\n\
    indices, such as distance to ﬂow accumulation lines (DFL), were negatively correlated\
    \ with yield,\nhence could be used to evaluate spatial yield variability. A research\
    \ conducted on a 7.4-ha ﬁeld in the\nSouthern High Plains of Texas showed cotton\
    \ lint yield was negatively correlated with site elevation.\nThe lint yield and\
    \ nitrogen (N) uptake was higher in bottom slope positions than in upslope, possibly\n\
    due to the accumulation of run-off water and NO3-N eroded from the upper slope\
    \ areas. However,\nthis trend depended on weather conditions. For a wet year when\
    \ there was over accumulation of water\nin bottom slopes, lower yield in bottom\
    \ slopes and higher yield in upper slopes were observed [61].\nRelative elevation\
    \ explained up to 49% of water content variation in the soil and 32% of lint yield\n\
    variation in the ﬁeld. The negative correlation between crop yield and elevation\
    \ could be in part due\nto the effect of erosion and topographical attributes\
    \ on soil properties that inﬂuence inﬁltration and\nstorage of water. Slope length\
    \ also affects crop yield by inﬂuencing N denitriﬁcation, soil N, P, K,\nCa and\
    \ Mg distributions, soil carbon storage, and nitrate distribution, as well as\
    \ the inﬁltration rate of\nwater in the ﬁeld [62].\nThe curvature of the ﬁeld\
    \ surface determines the concentration or dispersion of surface water\nin the\
    \ ﬁeld [55]. Concave surface with negative curvatures concentrates water ﬂow,\
    \ while convex\nsurface with positive curvature disperses water ﬂow [63]. For\
    \ example, SWC was found strongly\ncorrelated with soil surface curvature (r =\
    \ 0.9) [64]. Soil surface curvature can explain up to 15% of\nvariations in the\
    \ crop yield [65]. Corn yield was negatively correlated with surface curvature\
    \ in another\nresearch [53]. In this study, corn yield was 14% higher in concave\
    \ curvatures than convex areas. In a\nsix-year study [55], corn yields were negatively\
    \ correlated with elevation, slope, planar curvature and\nproﬁle curvature for\
    \ the wet years. The impact of surface curvature on crop yield also depends on\n\
    weather conditions and the location to some extent. Weather factors have the largest\
    \ effect on grain\nyield at locations with large curvature values. In some cases,\
    \ surface curvature is positively related to\ncrop yield at locations or years\
    \ with higher precipitation [60]. The magnitude of curvature also has\nan impact\
    \ on crop yield. The effect of curvature on crop yield between wet and dry years\
    \ are highly\ndifferent at locations with small curvature [66]. Hence, understanding\
    \ and incorporating topographic\nattributes of the ﬁeld, such as elevation, slope\
    \ length and aspect, surface curvature and their inﬂuence\non water dynamics can\
    \ be an important input for site-speciﬁc water management to achieve potential\n\
    water savings and optimized production.\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n6 of 21\n3.2. Soil\
    \ Properties\nSoil functions as a medium for plant growth, a regulator of water\
    \ ﬂow and nutrient cycling.\nIt is a dynamic entity where complex interactions\
    \ occur among its physical, chemical and biological\nproperties to enable these\
    \ functions [67]. Soil forming factors such as parent material, biota, topography,\n\
    climate, and time are variable in time and space and explain most of the soil\
    \ variability besides the\nmanagement induced variability [11]. Spatial variability\
    \ of chemical properties including nutrients,\norganic matter, and pH can result\
    \ in within-ﬁeld variation in available water content and crop\nproductivity [68].\
    \ Complex spatial patterns of soil physical properties also affect soil water\
    \ availability\nand rooting of a plant, resulting in variability in crop growth\
    \ and yield [69]. Soil texture, organic matter\ncontent, apparent electrical conductivity,\
    \ and biological properties are relatively stable properties of\nthe ﬁeld that\
    \ are usually considered for site-speciﬁc management of the ﬁeld.\n3.2.1. Soil\
    \ Texture\nSoil texture, the relative content of sand, silt, and clay particles,\
    \ is an important soil physical\nproperty that affects crop growth and yield.\
    \ Soil texture determines the rate at which water drains\nthrough saturated soil\
    \ and inﬂuences available water-holding capacity. Therefore, it affects the\n\
    distribution of available water for plant growth and irrigation requirements in\
    \ the ﬁeld. Fine sandy\nloams and silts tend to have the highest water-holding\
    \ capacity, while an increase in either clay\nor sand content in the soil proﬁle\
    \ decreases the water-holding capacity [70]. The matric potential\nof soil, which\
    \ depends on soil particle size, inﬂuences the availability of soil water. For\
    \ example,\nclay particles have higher matric potential and lower soil available\
    \ water compared to sand and silt\nparticles [71]. Soil texture also affects the\
    \ spatial variability of residual NO3-N and the leaching of N.\nMore residual\
    \ was found in sandy loam soils compared to loamy sand, and leaching was higher\
    \ in\nloamy sand compared to sandy loam [72]. Soil texture also affects the pore\
    \ sizes and porosity of the soil,\nwhich ultimately affects crop root growth and\
    \ yield by limiting the water available to the plant and the\ngrowth space for\
    \ the roots [73]. In general, soils with high clay content are more difﬁcult to\
    \ manage\ndue to lack of porosity and water available for plant growth. On the\
    \ other hand, well-drained soils\nhave good soil aeration for healthy root and\
    \ crop growth [74]. The clay content can also inﬂuence soil\nwater and nutrient\
    \ content and result in crop yield variability across the ﬁeld [61,75]. A study\
    \ showed\nthat clay content in the soil could explain up to 17% variability in\
    \ winter wheat yield by affecting\nthe water available in the soil for crop growth\
    \ [76]. A study conducted in the Southern High Plains\nshowed that a very sandy\
    \ soil (the Brownﬁeld soil series) with high slope consistently had low yield\n\
    when given the same amount of irrigation water, fertilizer, seed population, and\
    \ other management\npractices [56]. A cross-correlation study conducted between\
    \ cotton lint yield, soil water, clay, sand and\nelevation in a 45-ha ﬁeld in\
    \ Texas High Plains also showed that correlation among these factors varied\n\
    between 0.72 and 0.63 and cotton crop and soil physical properties could be correlated\
    \ within 60 to\n80 m across the ﬁeld [77]. In summary, soil texture inﬂuences\
    \ variability in water availability and crop\nyield, and hence should be considered\
    \ in VRI planning and implementation [78].\n3.2.2. Soil Organic Matter (SOM)\n\
    The role of SOM in VRI lies in its inﬂuence on water-holding capacity because\
    \ the afﬁnity SOM has\nfor water [74]. SOM has a positive inﬂuence on yield, and\
    \ the inﬂuence is more prominent in soils with\nlow organic matter content [60].\
    \ SOM distribution in the ﬁeld is variable depending upon topography\nand other\
    \ soil properties. Accumulation of SOM often occurs at the bottom of slopes, possibly\
    \ due to\nthe run-off of organic matter from higher areas and increased plant\
    \ growth at low-lying wet areas of the\nﬁeld [60,61]. SOM generally increases\
    \ with increasing clay content. The organic matter in ﬁne-textured\nsoils such\
    \ as clay can be two to four times that of coarse-textured sandy soils under similar\
    \ climatic\nconditions, which in turn, can inﬂuence soil water holding capacity\
    \ [79]. Therefore, understanding the\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n7 of 21\norganic matter\
    \ distribution in the ﬁeld can help in estimation of irrigation requirements for\
    \ the ﬁeld\nand hence should be incorporated in developing site-speciﬁc water\
    \ management.\n3.2.3. Soil Biological Properties\nMost site-speciﬁc studies did\
    \ not consider spatial variability of soil organisms, but recent studies\nhave\
    \ shown that the spatial distribution of soil organisms inﬂuence plant growth\
    \ and possibly yield [80].\nSpatial and temporal distribution of microorganisms\
    \ at the landscape scale is complicated by the\ninteractions among topography,\
    \ soil type and distribution of water in the ﬁeld [81]. The management\nactivity\
    \ in the ﬁeld can inﬂuence the distribution of soil biological components and\
    \ this, in turn,\naffects the efﬁciency of agricultural management [82]. The soil\
    \ has the greatest microbial diversity\namong all ecosystems that support soil\
    \ conditioning and plant growth [83]. A study conducted in\nFrance [84] showed\
    \ that microbial indicators expressed a high spatial heterogeneity at the ﬁeld\
    \ level,\nwhich masked the effects of several soil and crop management treatments.\
    \ The results also showed\nthat the spatial variability due to biological variables\
    \ was similar in magnitude as compared to that\nexhibited by physicochemical parameters,\
    \ which indicated the feasibility of site-speciﬁc management\nof biological variability\
    \ in the ﬁeld using management zones. Such site-speciﬁc management can be\neffective\
    \ since organisms such as earthworms, protozoa, nematodes, bacteria, fungi, and\
    \ different\narthropods play a vital role in soil fertility and productivity [71].\n\
    3.2.4. Apparent Soil Electrical Conductivity (ECa)\nObtaining accurate information\
    \ about the spatial and temporal variability of SWC and irrigation\nrequirements\
    \ is one of the important challenges in site-speciﬁc water management.\nECa is\
    \ a\nmeasurement of ﬁeld variability that can be applied to precise water management\
    \ because it is\neasy to measure and facilitates the spatial understanding of\
    \ the soil-water-plant relationship [85].\nECa is a function of several soil properties,\
    \ such as soil salinity, texture, bulk density, ion concentration,\ntype and amount\
    \ of clay, topsoil thickness, and water content [86]. The effect of ECa on crop\
    \ yield is\nthrough its relation to soil properties, which depends on climate,\
    \ crop type and other speciﬁc ﬁeld\nconditions [87]. In general, high ECa is associated\
    \ with high clay content in the soil [88]. For example,\na study conducted near\
    \ Lamesa, Texas, showed that in four of the six sites, shallow ECa measured\n\
    with a Veris mapping system was positively correlated with clay content. Clay\
    \ content was negatively\nrelated to shallow ECa at one site due to the low bulk\
    \ density of the calcic horizon [89]. Most of the\nresearch conducted did not\
    \ consider the spatial correlation of soil characteristics when evaluating\ntheir\
    \ distributions. However, spatial autocorrelation of soil properties can be more\
    \ important than\nsoil properties themselves in explaining ECa. Therefore, future\
    \ studies need to incorporate the\nspatial correlation of soil characteristics\
    \ in evaluating the impact of ECa on crop yield [90]. ECa has\nthe potential to\
    \ differentiate between soils when the soils have enough water content and can\n\
    be used as an indicator of SWC. In general, areas with high ECa are associated\
    \ with high water\ncontent [91]. Several studies have shown a higher correlation\
    \ of crop growth characteristics and yield\nwith ECa [92,93]. A study showed that\
    \ ECa in combination with topographic attributes and bare soil\nbrightness could\
    \ explain up to 70.1% of the variability in cotton yield [56]. Hence, understanding\
    \ the\nspatial and temporal variability of ECa provides information for site-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation management\nfor optimized yield.\nThe association between crop yield\
    \ and soil physical and chemical properties and landscape\nprocesses provide opportunities\
    \ to improve water management at the landscape scale [61].\nSoil properties and\
    \ topography inﬂuence crop yield from microscales to watershed scales and the\n\
    magnitude of complexity increases with the scale due to an increase in soil and\
    \ topographical variability,\nas well as variability in rainfall, temperature\
    \ and other climatic factors [60]. A study showed lower\ncorn grain and stover\
    \ yield in depositional and ﬂat areas which retained water for longer periods,\n\
    and high yield at well-drained summit positions [94]. In the same research for\
    \ alfalfa and poplar,\nthe results showed higher productivity at a site with a\
    \ relatively steep slope and potentially erosive\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n8 of 21\n\
    soils. This relationship was attributed to the above-normal rainfall in both years\
    \ of study. In a six-year\nstudy to understand corn yield in relation to terrain\
    \ attributes, two years with more than normal\nprecipitation showed a positive\
    \ correlation between yield and slope. For the other four years, yield was\nnegatively\
    \ correlated with slope [55]. Crop yield in relation to soil properties and topography\
    \ depends\non different soil management and climate conditions. The correlation\
    \ was found to be stronger for\ndry years in degraded soils and attributed to\
    \ differences in water availability. This suggests that\nvariable-rate irrigation\
    \ strategies might require adjustments in different crop seasons with different\n\
    climatic and management conditions and hence more researches on VRI are needed\
    \ [95].\n4. Crop and Soil Monitoring for Precision Water Management\nWater requirement\
    \ varies with the crop and crop growth and development status, soil water status,\n\
    as well as environmental conditions. Closely monitoring soil water status, crop\
    \ growth conditions and\ntheir spatial and temporal patterns can aid in irrigation\
    \ scheduling and precise water management.\nAmong many tools, remote sensing can\
    \ serve an effective basis by providing images with spatial\nand temporal variability\
    \ of crop growth parameters and soil moisture status for input in precision\n\
    water management.\n4.1. Crop Coefﬁcient and ET\nVRI aims at increasing WUE and\
    \ stabilizing yield, which can be improved by scheduling\nthe irrigation of crops\
    \ using physical and agronomic principles in irrigation management strategy.\n\
    WUE (kg/m3) can be expressed as the ratio of the amount of target product of the\
    \ crop to the amount\nof water applied to produce that output. The amount of water\
    \ used for crop production is the amount\nrequired to overcome the water lost\
    \ by ET from plant and soil surface, and it varies spatiotemporally\naccording\
    \ to weather and vegetation cover conditions [96,97]. Climatological parameters\
    \ such as\nsolar radiation, air temperature, air humidity, wind speed, and crop\
    \ and soil water characteristics,\nincluding management and environmental aspects,\
    \ are important parameters inﬂuencing ET in\nagricultural ﬁelds. Since ET is difﬁcult\
    \ to measure, reference ET from a hypothetical grass reference\nsurface is commonly\
    \ calculated using the FAO Penman-Monteith equation based on meteorological\n\
    parameters [98]. The equation is expressed as follows,\nET0 = [0.408 ∆ (Rn − G)\
    \ + γ {900/(T + 273)} u2 (es − ea)]/[∆ + γ (1 + 0.34 u2)]\nwhere, ET0—Reference\
    \ evapotranspiration [mm day−1], Rn—Net radiation at the crop surface [MJ\nm−2\
    \ day−1], G—Soil heat ﬂux density [MJ m−2 day−1], T—Air temperature at 2 m height\
    \ [◦C],\nu2—Wind speed at 2 m height [m s−1], es—Saturation vapor pressure [kPa],\
    \ ea—Actual vapor pressure\n[kPa], es—ea saturation vapor pressure deﬁcit [kPa],\
    \ D—Slope vapor pressure curve [kPa ◦C−1],\nγ—Psychrometric constant [kPa ◦C−1].\n\
    Crop-speciﬁc evapotranspiration needs are calculated based on crop coefﬁcients\
    \ (Kc). By using\nthe FAO Penman-Monteith deﬁnition for ET0, crop coefﬁcients\
    \ at research sites could be calculated by\nrelating the measured crop evapotranspiration\
    \ (ET) with the calculated ET0, i.e., Kc = ET/ET0. The crop\ncoefﬁcient differs\
    \ widely between crops and among growth stages for the same crop. This Kc factor\n\
    serves as an aggregation of the physical and physiological differences among crops\
    \ and averaged\neffects of evaporation from the soil [98]. Several spatial models\
    \ have been developed for ET estimation,\nwhich showed that accurate spatial ET\
    \ and water-balance models could be of great importance in VRI\napplication [61,99,100].\n\
    4.2. Remote and Proximal Sensing\nBesides crop coefﬁcient and ET, mapping soil\
    \ properties in a ﬁeld, such as ﬁeld capacity and\nroot zone water availability,\
    \ is also important for site-speciﬁc water management [101]. Information\nregarding\
    \ variability of plant conditions such as water stress, growth parameters, ground\
    \ cover can also\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n9 of 21\nprovide a basis for VRI. Remote\
    \ sensing using various sensors and platforms is often used to estimate\nseveral\
    \ soil and crop characteristics during the growing season that can provide important\
    \ information\nin decision support. The near-real-time information from several\
    \ sensors, such as spectral reﬂectance\nsensors and infrared thermometers have\
    \ been used to develop ﬁeld maps for water, vegetation,\nand nutrient status [50,102].\
    \ Remotely sensed images can be useful in determining leaf area index and\nground\
    \ cover for a ﬁeld and thus help in yield forecasting [103]. Remote sensing can\
    \ also help estimate\nET more reliably from individual ﬁelds [104]. A study in\
    \ Nebraska evaluated remote-sensing-based\nET and a water-balance model for irrigation\
    \ management [105]. In this study, four irrigation treatment\ncombinations were\
    \ tested: VRI based on water-balance model using remote sensing, VRI based on\n\
    water-balance model using neutron probe, uniform irrigation based on neutron-probe\
    \ measurement\nand rainfed. Landsat 7 and 8 imageries were used for model input\
    \ in a remote sensing-based\nmodel, which included reﬂectance-based crop coefﬁcients\
    \ for ET estimation. The result showed\nthat remote sensing-based treatment had\
    \ the greatest mean prescribed irrigation, which was attributed\nto water-balance\
    \ drift. The study concluded that the remote-sensing-based model might perform\n\
    better when coupled with SWC measurement. This can be helpful in site-speciﬁc\
    \ management of\nirrigation water, as well as weedicide, pesticide and other chemicals\
    \ [106–108]. Various indices\nderived from thermal and multispectral images, such\
    \ as crop water stress index (CWSI), perpendicular\nvegetation index (PVI), normalized\
    \ difference vegetation index (NDVI) and photochemical reﬂectance\nindex (PRI),\
    \ can predict soil or plant water status and drought stress as a basis for site-speciﬁc\
    \ water\nmanagement [109,110]. Use of digital infrared thermography to measure\
    \ canopy temperature can\nhelp producers to detect early crop water stress and\
    \ avoid yield declines as well as saving water\nwith site-speciﬁc irrigation management\
    \ and irrigation scheduling [111,112]. Recent improvements in\nremote and proximal\
    \ sensing technologies such as wireless soil moisture sensors and unmanned aerial\n\
    systems (UAS) have increased the efﬁciency for farmers to exercise site-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation management.\nIndices derived from high-resolution UAS imagery have\
    \ shown the potential to predict crop water\nstress indicators such as water potential\
    \ and stomatal conductance [113]. Such information can aid in\nimproving irrigation\
    \ efﬁciency, reducing pumping costs, and retaining groundwater. Although soil\n\
    moisture sensors are found to be more proﬁtable in the present context, with the\
    \ increasing number\nof manufacturers and clear regulations, UAS-based sensor\
    \ technology for soil moisture estimation\nis gaining momentum [114]. This explains\
    \ the importance of remote sensing as a low-cost tool to\nimprove water management\
    \ in crops.\n5. Precision Water Management Strategies\nSeveral precision irrigation\
    \ technologies have been developed to improve crop productivity under\nwater-limited\
    \ conditions. However, appropriate precision irrigation strategies are equally\
    \ important for\nincreased efﬁciency and proﬁtability for site-speciﬁc technologies.\
    \ The development and application\nof management zones using spatial and temporal\
    \ information of various agronomic factors have\nbeen practiced for site-speciﬁc\
    \ management for several decades. In recent years, the use of artiﬁcial\nintelligence\
    \ in prescription map development for site-speciﬁc water management is also increasing.\n\
    5.1. Management Zones\nVRI is often implemented in the ﬁeld by dividing it into\
    \ a number of sections, or management\nzones with the aim to save water and other\
    \ inputs together with yield optimization [25]. A management\nzone is a subﬁeld\
    \ area that is relatively homogeneous in soil and topographic attributes. The\
    \ use of\nmanagement zones can be a convenient means to capture the spatial distribution\
    \ of yield-inﬂuencing\nfactors within the season. The information on spatial and\
    \ temporal development of abiotic and\nbiotic stresses can be linked with site-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation systems via dynamic prescription maps\nto help producers improve\
    \ irrigation WUE, agricultural sustainability and the environment [102].\nVarious\
    \ factors such as soil properties, landscape attributes, crop properties, sensor-based\
    \ information,\nmanagement practice, weed, and pest management as well as crop\
    \ modeling have been considered\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n10 of 21\nin delineating\
    \ management zones for VRI application since several years [115]. Soil properties\
    \ such\nas soil organic matter, texture, nutrient content, pH, color, soil moisture\
    \ content and water-holding\ncapacities, ECa, etc. have been used effectively\
    \ in management zone delineation [116–119]. Landscape\nattributes such as elevation,\
    \ slope, aspect, curvature, and others have also been an important part\nof management\
    \ zone delineation in several studies [118,120–122]. Numerous studies have used\
    \ crop\nproperties such as yield maps and ground-based leaf area index to delineate\
    \ management zones\nfor VRI application [116,117,123,124]. The management zones\
    \ delineated based on yield data from\nmultiple years can effectively capture\
    \ nutrient variability in the ﬁeld [125]. However, the application of\nyield maps\
    \ for site-speciﬁc management can be challenging because spatial and temporal\
    \ variation in\nyield is affected by the interactions among several biotic and\
    \ abiotic factors [126,127]. Information from\nproximal and remote sensing such\
    \ as satellite and airborne imagery, normalized difference vegetation\nindex,\
    \ digital photography, etc. can be a powerful approach for delineation of relative\
    \ productive\nareas [128–131]. The zone information together with early season\
    \ environmental indicators and\ncrop response models can also be used to determine\
    \ the action decisions throughout the season [132].\nSimilarly, the selection\
    \ of factors for management zone delineation is equally important in management\n\
    zone delineation. A study was conducted to compare the site-speciﬁc irrigation\
    \ with conventional\nuniform irrigation management for potatoes in Idaho [25].\
    \ The available water-holding capacity of soil\nwas used to delineate a 2.9-ha\
    \ ﬁeld into nine management zones. The results showed that six out of\nnine management\
    \ zones produced a higher yield with site-speciﬁc management. However, the study\n\
    suggested that management zones were only based on available SWC and in some management\
    \ cases,\nother non-measured factors unrelated to soil texture or available water\
    \ content could have an impact\non the yield of crops. The study pointed out the\
    \ importance to take into consideration all the known\nfactors affecting yield\
    \ and include them in delineating irrigation management zones for site-speciﬁc\n\
    irrigation management. The optimum number of zones for a ﬁeld depends on the scale\
    \ of the ﬁeld,\neconomical and logistical practicality, and agronomic response\
    \ to irrigation amounts. For example,\nthe quantity and placement of soil moisture\
    \ sensors for determining irrigation amounts may vary\nwith ﬁeld size, cost of\
    \ the sensors and manageability, which, in turn, can inﬂuence the number of\n\
    management zones in the ﬁeld [133].\nThere are several methods to delineate management\
    \ zones, including unsupervised clustering,\nsupervised clustering, user-deﬁned\
    \ thresholds, etc. The clustering technique groups similar data\npoints into different\
    \ classes using algorithms such as k-means, fuzzy k-means, fuzzy c-means [127,134],\n\
    Ward′s method, and Jenk’s optimization procedure [125]. The appropriate factors\
    \ to be considered for\nmanagement zone delineation could be prioritized using\
    \ several methods such as principal component\nanalysis (PCA) [118]. It is equally\
    \ important to determine the number of optimum management\nzones for the ﬁeld\
    \ and their production and economic justiﬁcation [20]. A software program (MZA\n\
    software [135]) was developed for creating management zones using the fuzzy k-means\
    \ method.\nThis program determines the appropriate number of zones for a ﬁeld\
    \ by evaluating the clustering\nresults. Many studies have used management zones\
    \ for VRI and other site-speciﬁc crop management.\nFor example, a study conducted\
    \ in a 4.8-ha ﬁeld in Colorado assessed the effectiveness of ECa in\ncharacterizing\
    \ the spatial distribution of soil water [136]. This study found that SWC was\
    \ signiﬁcantly\ndifferent among different ECa derived management zones using MZA\
    \ software. This justiﬁes the\nimportance of characterizing management zones for\
    \ site-speciﬁc water management.\n5.2. Development of Site-Speciﬁc Water Management\
    \ Strategies\nTo enable the VRI technology in practice, the irrigation management\
    \ strategy is equally important.\nThe use of technology in the ﬁeld may not always\
    \ be effective in terms of ﬁnal yield or proﬁtability.\nFor example, research\
    \ has shown that the use of VRI technology may not be cost effective where\nthere\
    \ is high rainfall throughout the growing season [29]. Several strategies could\
    \ be applied to\nsave water and energy in the ﬁeld to gain yield beneﬁts in the\
    \ ﬁeld. Some of the strategies include\nskipping irritation in non-cropped areas,\
    \ planting different crops in the same ﬁeld, rainfall harvesting\nAgronomy 2019,\
    \ 9, 87\n11 of 21\nin areas with high water-holding capacity, and lowering irrigation\
    \ to areas with low water use (ET) [46].\nNew irrigation strategies such as modifying\
    \ the current irrigation system for site-speciﬁc water and\nchemical applications\
    \ are required to sustain modern irrigated agricultural cropping systems [102].\n\
    Management strategies including placement and timing are crucial in optimizing\
    \ irrigation\nthroughout the growing season. About 9%−19% of irrigation water\
    \ savings were achieved with VRI\ncompared to the uniform application in a research\
    \ conducted in variable soil, which was possible\nwith several strategies such\
    \ as withholding irrigation during speciﬁc growth stages and in particular,\n\
    non-cropped areas of the ﬁeld [137]. Further, the study suggests that areas where\
    \ the optimized or\nincreased irrigation does not produce an increase in yield,\
    \ less water can be applied while the areas\nwith high yield potential can be\
    \ applied optimum irrigation and gain higher returns. A study showed\nthat restricting\
    \ irrigation during the peak water-demand time of cotton (80−100 days after planting)\n\
    from 100% to 60% of potential ET conserves 2.6 inches of water [138]. The VRI\
    \ trial was conducted\nin three farms in New Zealand to compare the VRI to uniform\
    \ rate irrigation (URI) [139]. The URI\ntreatments were provided with the same\
    \ level of irrigation at the same time as the most drought-prone\nsoil zone, but\
    \ VRI treatment was achieved by either delaying the irrigation or reducing the\
    \ amount\nand intensity of irrigation comparing to that with a drought-prone area.\
    \ The results showed that there\nwas a two to three-fold difference in total available\
    \ water-holding capacity at each site, which justiﬁed\nthe decision to use VRI\
    \ systems. Although the study found no signiﬁcant impact of VRI on crop yield,\n\
    water savings of 8 to 36% were achieved in three sites with less drainage. Hence,\
    \ critical management\nstrategies adopted in a decision support system that uses\
    \ real-time monitoring and feedback to\nirrigation control make water conversation\
    \ possible [28]. Deﬁcit irrigation (DI) is a complementary\nmethod that uses irrigation\
    \ scheduling at strategic times of less critical growth for irrigation water\n\
    conservation. In this method, irrigation is applied during the drought-sensitive\
    \ growth stages of a\ncrop. During less drought-sensitive stages, irrigation is\
    \ applied based on rainfall and availability of\nwater for maintenance [140].\n\
    The use of technology and strategies can also affect the level of proﬁt achieved\
    \ from the VRI\ntechnology itself. A study was conducted in a 20-ha wheat ﬁeld\
    \ in Southern Alberta, Canada on\nmodeling economic returns at different levels\
    \ of control [141]. A total of 62 management scenarios\nwere studied, including\
    \ (1) no irrigation, (2) uniform irrigation management, (3) speed control with\n\
    two angular increments of 2 and 10 degrees, and (4) zone control with a combination\
    \ of two angular\nincrements and a different number of independent irrigation\
    \ zones, ranging from 2 to 30. The study\nconcluded that the highest proﬁt was\
    \ obtained with 30 control zones. However, considering the cost\nof the technology,\
    \ the case of ten control zones along the central pivot system was found to be\
    \ the\nmost proﬁtable. Hence, it is essential to set forth effective site-speciﬁc\
    \ water management strategies for\nincreased agricultural sustainability and proﬁtability.\n\
    5.3. Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Deep Learning\nExisting site-speciﬁc management\
    \ utilizes several control strategies such mathematical modeling\nof crop yield\
    \ or the plant-soil-atmosphere environment, optimizing irrigation application\
    \ timing,\nlearning sensor feedback to control the site-speciﬁc ﬂow of water as\
    \ well as using predictive model\ncontrol that executes a model repeatedly to\
    \ determine optimum input. The use of artiﬁcial intelligence\nor neuro-dynamic\
    \ programming that integrates machine learning to determine the water application\n\
    parameter for optimized irrigation is also increasing [50,142–145]. Hyperspectral\
    \ remote sensing\nimaging along with machine learning has been in use in agricultural\
    \ industry, and it is estimated that\nmachine learning/deep learning-based classiﬁcation\
    \ has a signiﬁcant potential for high-dimensional\nbig data produced in agriculture\
    \ [146].\n6. Impact of Variable-Rate Irrigation\nVRI can be highly effective in\
    \ reducing water use and increasing water use efﬁciency (WUE) of\ncrops [147].\
    \ A review on VRI across different crop and weather regimes of the world concluded\
    \ that\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n12 of 21\nVRI could save 10%−15% of water [28].\
    \ A study in a 7-ha sugar beet ﬁeld in Germany reported that\n13% of water was\
    \ saved compared to the uniform application [15]. This was achieved by utilizing\n\
    stored soil moisture and in-season precipitation. In a study in New Zealand comparing\
    \ VRI with\nconventional irrigation system, 9%−19% irrigation water was saved\
    \ with VRI in pasture and corn\nﬁelds, which in turn reduced nitrogen leaching\
    \ [137]. Similarly, the application of VRI by manipulating\nits several components\
    \ can reduce water runoff by avoiding excess water application in the ﬁeld [28].\n\
    At a large scale, water pumpage and use can be reduced by adopting VRI. A geospatial\
    \ method has\nbeen provided for potential VRI technology adopters to achieve potential\
    \ water savings in the ﬁeld\nusing freely available datasets such as soil survey\
    \ data from the Natural Resources Conservation\nService (NRCS) [48]. In this study,\
    \ the difference in application depth between conventional irrigation\nand VRI\
    \ was estimated based on root zone available water capacity. The undepleted soil\
    \ water from\neach management zone was mined using prescription maps allowing\
    \ 50% depletion. VRI in this\nstudy resulted in a reduction in irrigation depth\
    \ of up to 18 mm, pumping reductions, and improved\nwater distribution throughout\
    \ the ﬁeld. In addition, higher VRI control resolution increased energy\nsavings.\
    \ VRI was found to reduce pumpage in more than 13% of center pivot irrigated ﬁelds\
    \ by 25 mm\nper year compared to the conventional irrigation system in Nebraska\
    \ [99]. Another study for VRI\nmanagement based on soil water spatial variation\
    \ was conducted in a 1.64-ha ﬁeld with center pivot to\nunderstand the yield and\
    \ water-saving effects of VRI [148]. In this study, the ﬁeld was divided into\
    \ four\nmanagement zones based on available water-holding capacity and each management\
    \ zone was further\ndivided into two sections for VRI and URI management. The\
    \ results from this study indicated that the\nimpact of VRI on water savings within\
    \ zones depended on weather conditions. Water savings with\nVRI management was\
    \ higher for summer maize when the rainfall was high compared to winter wheat\n\
    grown in no-rainfall weather. The study suggests that although VRI management\
    \ had no signiﬁcant\ninﬂuence on crop growth parameters and yield within a management\
    \ zone, managing the zones with\ndifferent available water-holding capacity might\
    \ improve the uniformity of crop growth, maximize\ncrop yield and gain potential\
    \ water savings.\nCompared to the uniform application, VRI increases crop productivity.\
    \ The results comparing\nthe water productivity of sorghum and corn showed that\
    \ there was more than 20% increase in water\nproductivity for both crops using\
    \ VRI [35]. Another study conducted in a 4-ha ﬁeld, VRI resulted in\na signiﬁcant\
    \ difference in corn yield in a dry year. However, the results were not signiﬁcant\
    \ for the\nyear when the rain was sufﬁcient [100]. Another study was conducted\
    \ in New Zealand to understand\nthe impact of variable-rate irrigation based on\
    \ soil moisture status [139]. This study showed that\nalthough the yield was not\
    \ signiﬁcantly different among different irrigation treatments, water savings\n\
    of 27–55 mm was achieved by limiting irrigation in soil with adequate plant available\
    \ water and\nnon-irrigating poorly drained, wet soil zones. VRI has been found\
    \ effective to reduce water and\nenergy use even in humid areas of the world with\
    \ uncertain and unpredictable rainfall [40]. This study\nshowed that potential\
    \ water savings of 20mm/year could be achieved using VRI in these regions.\nHowever,\
    \ the feasibility and effectiveness of VRI depend on the magnitude of the ﬁeld,\
    \ crop under\nconsideration, weather and the underlying ﬁeld properties [24,25,40].\
    \ The accurate determination of\nwater requirement and its management is crucial\
    \ for crop yield stabilization and improved average\nyield [53]. Several VRI research\
    \ projects attempt to enhance the control scenarios as well as model and\nproduction\
    \ function to improve water savings and reduce pumpage [40,99,141,149,150]. Further,\
    \ it is\nnecessary to understand the impact of soil water availability on crop\
    \ growth to manage irrigation in\nspatial and temporal scales using variable-rate\
    \ irrigation technologies and appropriate strategies.\n7. Challenges and Research\
    \ Requirements\nData collection and management tools, such as yield monitors,\
    \ sensors and sensing systems,\nGIS, GNSS, and decision support systems are available\
    \ today to enable site-speciﬁc management of\nirrigation water for optimized crop\
    \ production. Steady development in irrigation control systems\nprovides the user\
    \ with various options to implement VRI. Many studies have investigated and\n\
    Agronomy 2019, 9, 87\n13 of 21\ndeveloped irrigation strategies, prescription\
    \ methodologies, and proﬁtability optimization involved in\nVRI. However, there\
    \ are some challenges in the implementation and application of this technology.\n\
    Further research and development are required to improve the understanding, implementation,\n\
    and adoption of precision water management strategies and technologies.\n(1)\n\
    Research is required on the integration of technology, agronomy, and proﬁtability\
    \ with VRI\nAlthough several studies have reported the potential of adopting VRI\
    \ system to optimize crop\nproduction and proﬁtability [29,70], some studies conducted\
    \ in experimental ﬁelds have concluded\nthat the VRI technology may not be economically\
    \ viable for all crops under all growing conditions\nand environments [24]. This\
    \ is not because of the yield-related beneﬁt, but due to the cost of the\ntechnology\
    \ itself. For example, research conducted in a 12.6-ha ﬁeld in southwest Georgia\
    \ showed that\nVRI generated $16/ha more return than URI. Although this return\
    \ is not signiﬁcant for this small ﬁeld,\nthe study suggested that proﬁts could\
    \ be ampliﬁed for large ﬁelds and beneﬁt farmers [151]. From the\nagronomic perspective,\
    \ a better understanding of the extremities of ﬁeld variability and how it affects\n\
    crop yield is needed for the effective implementation of new technologies [152].\
    \ In an experiment\nconducted in Tennessee, the same level of irrigation did not\
    \ result in the same cotton lint yield in all\nparts of the ﬁeld due to differences\
    \ in texture and available water-holding capacity [153]. In some cases,\nthe incorporation\
    \ of other crops in a rotation in VRI can make this technology economically viable\
    \ [25].\nAdditionally, most of the VRI studies are concentrated on the control\
    \ scenarios of VRI [149,150].\nAlthough a few studies [40,99,141] determined water\
    \ and energy savings using VRI due to managerial\nlimitations, they were either\
    \ based on some model and production functions or arbitrary in irrigation\nrate\
    \ determination. Hence, there is a need for a comprehensive study on VRI integrating\
    \ the agronomic,\ntechnical and managerial aspects of VRI to determine its proﬁtability,\
    \ sustainability, and adoptability\nfor various conditions.\n(2)\nOn-farm and\
    \ whole-ﬁeld research\nProducers are more likely to adopt VRI if the beneﬁts are\
    \ shown on a “real farm.” Most of the\nprevious studies on VRI were conducted\
    \ in experimental ﬁelds or in small ﬁelds that cannot represent\nthe commercial\
    \ farming practice [28]. Experimental design and implementation in large ﬁelds\
    \ are\nchallenging. This type of research requires close communication and collaborative\
    \ management\nbetween the researcher and the farm owner to ensure the alignment\
    \ of management practices and study\ngoals. Acquiring data and information from\
    \ large ﬁelds is costly and time-consuming. In addition,\nthe statistical analysis\
    \ of on-farm data is challenging due to the lack of adequate tools that integrates\n\
    classical statistical methods and spatial analysis. This creates challenges in\
    \ the understanding of the\nrelationship between crop growth and its environment\
    \ in site-speciﬁc irrigation. More on-farm studies\nare needed to provide information\
    \ for practical VRI applications. In addition, insufﬁcient recognition\nof temporal\
    \ variation and environmental impact are several other factors that hinder the\
    \ adoption of\nprecision agriculture technology [9].\n(3)\nPrescription map development\n\
    The majority of previous studies for prescription maps (management zone delineation)\
    \ are for\nvariable-rate application of fertilizers and seeds and are static [20,133].\
    \ Limited research has addressed\nthe need for dynamic prescription map development\
    \ that could incorporate seasonal changes in\ncrop growth and conditions [133].\
    \ More research is required to evaluate VRI prescription maps or\nmanagement zone\
    \ development integrating different soil and crop characteristics under different\n\
    environments. Use of remote and proximal sensing such as infrared sensors, near-infrared\
    \ and thermal\nimages, along with weather data can provide information on crop,\
    \ soil, and environmental conditions\nin irrigation scheduling and developing\
    \ dynamic prescription maps [97]. Further research needs to\ninvestigate how to\
    \ integrate such data and information to evaluate the effectiveness of such prescription\n\
    maps during the growing season.\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n14 of 21\n(4)\nOptimal\
    \ spatial and temporal scale\nFew studies have evaluated the appropriate spatial\
    \ and temporal scales for VRI application.\nMany studies have explored the use\
    \ of sensors in acquiring information for modeling crop\nevapotranspiration, SWC,\
    \ irrigation needs including the nutrient requirements [97,105,152,154,155].\n\
    Most of these studies indicated the high potential of remote and proximal sensing\
    \ technologies in\nunderstanding spatial and temporal variations in crop growth\
    \ conditions in the ﬁeld. Temporal\nvariability in soil water status and crop\
    \ growing conditions require dynamic adjustment of irrigation\namount and spatial\
    \ distribution. Therefore, simulation models or on-farm studies might be considered\n\
    to assess the effectiveness of VRI at different spatial and temporal scales.\n\
    (5)\nComprehensive decision support tools\nPrecision irrigation management requires\
    \ data and information from crop growth conditions,\nsoil physical and chemical\
    \ properties, weather factors, and the interaction among these factors.\nEffective\
    \ implementation of precision irrigation requires a comprehensive decision support\
    \ system to\nprocess and integrate different layers of data and information [48].\
    \ The challenge for the application\nof VRI still exists in the lack of user-friendly\
    \ decision support tools such as for developing dynamic\nprescription maps [105].\
    \ Several decision support systems such as AgriDSS are available [16,156],\nbut\
    \ producers are reluctant to use them to their full potential due to their complexity.\
    \ Also, these tools\nare based on what scientists and developers consider as necessary\
    \ knowledge that should be\nimplemented in the decision support system. However,\
    \ in a real-world situation, they fail to utilize\nthe implicit knowledge of farmers\
    \ and address their needs. The complexity, lack of observability and\nconﬁdence,\
    \ poor user interface design, lack of incentive to learn are some of the other\
    \ reasons behind\nthe hindrance of adoption of different decision support tools\
    \ [16]. The system or tool should help the\nuser decide where to apply how much\
    \ irrigation water at various crop growth stages to achieve the\nhighest proﬁt\
    \ based on the regional climate conditions and cropping systems.\n(6)\nIntegrating\
    \ VRI with other inputs\nFew studies have integrated variable-rate application\
    \ of nutrients with water. Crop yield response\nto water and N are not the same\
    \ at different parts of the ﬁeld [157], indicating the need for studying\nthe\
    \ interaction of water and fertilizer in variable-rate irrigation. Site-speciﬁc\
    \ application of N together\nwith irrigation using remote sensing can help reduce\
    \ N inputs by 50% and leaching by 85% without\nreducing yields [155]. Further\
    \ studies are needed to investigate the interaction between VRI fertilizers\n\
    and other inputs to improve the efﬁciencies of water and fertilizers while reducing\
    \ the environmental\nimpact of fertilizer application and enhancing production\
    \ sustainability.\nAuthor Contributions: The authors contributed equally to the\

    \ Irrigated row-crop agriculture is contributing to declining groundwater in areas\
    \ such\nas the Mississippi Delta region of eastern Arkansas. There is a need to\
    \ move toward sustainable\nlevels of groundwater withdrawal. Recent improvements\
    \ in remote monitoring technologies such\nas wireless soil moisture sensors and\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles offer the potential for farmers to\neffectively practice\
    \ site-speciﬁc variable-rate irrigation management for the purpose of applying\n\
    water more efﬁciently, reducing pumping costs, and retaining groundwater. Soil\
    \ moisture sensors\nand unmanned aerial vehicles are compared here in terms of\
    \ their net returns per acre-foot and\ncost-effectiveness of aquifer retention.\
    \ Soil moisture sensors ($9.09 per acre-foot) offer slightly\nmore net returns\
    \ to producers than unmanned aerial vehicles ($7.69 per acre-foot), though costs\n\
    associated with unmanned aerial vehicles continue to drop as more manufacturers\
    \ enter the market\nand regulations become clear.\nKeywords: precision agriculture;\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles; UAV; soil moisture sensors; variable-rate\nirrigation;\
    \ cost-effectiveness; technology adoption\n1. Introduction\nMore than 80 percent\
    \ of the consumptive water use in the United States, which is the water lost to\n\
    the environment, goes to irrigated agriculture [1]. The Mississippi River Valley\
    \ alluvial aquifer of the\nDelta is used by agriculture in Arkansas, Missouri,\
    \ Mississippi, and Louisiana, and irrigated acreage\nhas more than doubled from\
    \ 1982 to 2007 [1]. Critical groundwater areas in the Delta region of eastern\n\
    Arkansas continue to experience decline as groundwater demand outpaces recharge.\
    \ Demand for\ngroundwater constitutes 81% of the total water demand in the East\
    \ Arkansas Region (Figure 1), and\na groundwater gap of over seven million acre-feet\
    \ is projected for 2050 [2]. A declining aquifer\nraises the cost of pumping groundwater\
    \ and risks the future proﬁtability of agriculture, the dominant\nindustry in\
    \ the region. These risks are ampliﬁed by prospects of long-term drought and climate\n\
    uncertainty. Additional beneﬁts to society of a greater aquifer volume include\
    \ the avoidance of\nsubsidence, less seepage of surface water from riparian areas\
    \ vital to wildlife, and less pumping of\nunderlying aquifers used for drinking\
    \ water in towns. There is a need to move toward sustainable\nlevels of groundwater\
    \ withdrawal.\nPrecision agriculture provides the potential to enhance irrigation\
    \ efficiency through site-specific\nvariable-rate irrigation management of crops.\
    \ Irrigation efficiency is defined as the ratio of applied water\nthat is beneficially\
    \ used for crop growth to the total amount of applied water [3]. The irrecoverable\
    \ fraction\nof applied water includes runoff from a geographic area, evaporation,\
    \ and plant evapotranspiration [3,4].\nWater 2017, 9, 28; doi:10.3390/w9010028\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/water\nWater 2017, 9, 28\n2 of 17\nSome fraction of applied\
    \ irrigation water is recoverable, re-entering the aquifer in the future as deep\n\
    percolation [3,4]. Field-level spatial variability in soil characteristics results\
    \ in spatial variability of\nirrigation efﬁciency and can lead to over- or under-\
    \ application of water under uniform application\nconditions. In most cases, a\
    \ farmer will tend to over-apply to account for uneven distribution of water\n\
    in the ﬁeld and maximize yield [5]. Mapping the variability of appropriate ﬁeld\
    \ conditions using\nremote monitoring methods can allow a farmer to apply variable-rate\
    \ irrigation management and\nmaintain yields while decreasing water use and groundwater\
    \ pumping [6–9].\nPrecision agriculture adoption is one means by which farmers\
    \ can limit the over-application of\ncrop production inputs such as irrigation\
    \ water and nutrients by using technology to inform site-specific\nmanagement\
    \ according to spatially localized conditions [8,10,11]. The spatial information\
    \ technologies\nthat have enabled precision agriculture include global positioning\
    \ systems, geographic information\nsystems, remote sensing, and variable-rate\
    \ application technologies [12]. Precision agriculture involves\ncombining the\
    \ functions of these technologies to help with decision-making about crop and\
    \ soil\nmanagement in speciﬁc ﬁeld locations [13].\nFor the purposes of managing\
    \ variable irrigation rates, two different paradigms of monitoring\nfield-level\
    \ spatial variability have emerged and proved effective: one based on monitoring\
    \ soil properties\nand the other on monitoring plant conditions [6,14,15]. Hedley\
    \ and Yule [6] demonstrated the potential to\nreduce irrigation water use by using\
    \ soil–water balance to inform variable-rate irrigation of pre-mapped\nmanagement\
    \ zones at two sites in New Zealand. Stone et al. [16] demonstrated the potential\
    \ of similar\nmethods in the humid Eastern U.S. Soil-based methods are thought\
    \ to be superior because they more\ndirectly measure water-related stress as a\
    \ function of plant available water content, whereas it can be more\ndifficult\
    \ with plant-based methods to separate the effect of the soil moisture property\
    \ from that of other\npossible stresses such as nutrient deficiency [17,18]. Soil\
    \ water measurements using soil moisture sensors,\nhowever, are only accurate\
    \ for a small area, and soil water content is highly variable spatially and\n\
    temporally [19]. There is evidence that relative spatial variability of soil water\
    \ content is persistent over\ntime, further indicating the feasibility of variable-rate\
    \ irrigation based on management zones [20,21].\nNetworks of remote soil moisture\
    \ sensors have shown the ability to effectively inform variable-rate\nirrigation\
    \ and contribute to improvements in irrigation efﬁciency [6,8,11,15,18]. Though\
    \ the soil\nmoisture sensors themselves perform in-situ measurement of soil properties,\
    \ these networks of sensors\nare monitored wirelessly by either an automated system\
    \ or a user physically removed from the\nmeasurement site. In the past, installation\
    \ of enough soil moisture sensors to capture soil variability has\nproven costly\
    \ for farmers and has limited technology adoption [22,23]. This technology is\
    \ getting better\nand more affordable at the same time that unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ are also becoming more economical\nfor the purposes of plant-based remote sensing.\
    \ Unmanned aircraft can deliver a variety of sensing\ndevices including visual,\
    \ multispectral, and thermal to monitor different aspects of plant health. There\
    \ is\neven potential in the future for these vehicles to serve as the medium by\
    \ which important production\ninputs such as seed, fertilizer, and chemical are\
    \ applied [24]. Though unmanned aerial vehicles have\nnot been commonly used in\
    \ agriculture to this point, the Department of Transit and Federal Aviation\n\
    Administration have recently enacted a clear regulatory framework for small unmanned\
    \ aerial aircraft,\nand many expect this to spur more widespread adoption in commercial\
    \ uses such as agriculture [25,26].\nWe compare the two remote monitoring methods,\
    \ soil moisture sensors and unmanned aerial\nvehicles, for cost-effectiveness\
    \ and net return per acre-foot of aquifer retention by modeling crop\nproduction\
    \ and groundwater use across a spatially-explicit farm landscape in the Delta\
    \ region of\neastern Arkansas. The model evaluates the optimal crop mix and irrigation\
    \ practices to maximize farm\nreturns across the gridded farm landscape. Spatial\
    \ variation in crop yields, aquifer thickness, and the\ncosts of groundwater pumping\
    \ all inﬂuence the spatial-dynamic path of optimal management [27].\nThe effectiveness\
    \ of the remote monitoring methods for enhancing proﬁtability and decreased pumping\n\
    depends on these spatial variations.\nThe area for the application of our model\
    \ encompasses three eight-digit hydrologic unit code\n(HUC) watersheds overlying\
    \ the Mississippi River Valley alluvial aquifer where groundwater levels\nWater\
    \ 2017, 9, 28\n3 of 17\nare critical (Figure 1). Eight-digit HUCs deﬁne the drainage\
    \ area of a sub-basin of a river [28].\nIn addition to remote monitoring and variable-rate\
    \ irrigation, we allow for the construction of on-farm\nreservoirs and tail-water\
    \ recovery systems to help reduce pumping costs and promote recharge of\nthe underlying\
    \ aquifer. The impacts of remote monitoring and variable-rate irrigation are evaluated\n\
    with and without the presence of reservoirs on the landscape. There are also ranges\
    \ of potential costs\nand irrigation efﬁciencies associated with these remote\
    \ monitoring methods, and the implications\nof these for investment in the technologies\
    \ is considered. In addition, the effectiveness of policies\nthat encourage the\
    \ adoption of the remote monitoring for improved water management and aquifer\n\
    retention is compared to typical fee and quantity policies for conservation. We\
    \ describe the model\nfor the dynamics of land cover, water use, and proﬁt maximization\

    on the landscape over time. The model is then used to evaluate which approach\
    \ to precision irrigation\nis more cost-effective for reducing groundwater pumping\
    \ or delivers higher net return per acre-foot of\naquifer retention.\n2.1.1. Land\
    \ Cover\nThe land cover of the farm landscape includes crops, reservoirs, and\
    \ conserved land set aside\nthrough a rental program of the government. The chosen\
    \ crops generate economic returns, and\nirrigation depletes groundwater. The landscape\
    \ is spatially heterogeneous due to differences in\nWater 2017, 9, 28\n4 of 17\n\
    long-term investment in farm practices, soil types, and access to water resources\
    \ [29–31]. A time\nhorizon T is chosen for a single generation of farmers to observe\
    \ how depletion of the aquifer inﬂuences\nproduction decision, and a grid of m\
    \ cells (sites) represents spatial differences.\nMajor crops on the landscape\
    \ include rice, irrigated soybean, corn, and cotton, non-irrigated\nsorghum and\
    \ soybean, and double-cropped irrigated soybean with winter wheat. The model tracks\n\
    acreage across n number of land cover types j, including each of the crops, reservoirs\
    \ that have\ntail-water recovery, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Conservation\
    \ Reserve Program (CRP).\nLijt denotes the amount of land (acres) at site i in\
    \ land cover type j at the end of period t. At the end\nof each period t, which\
    \ is a 10-year interval, we assume any other land cover j can become on-farm\n\
    reservoirs and tail-water recovery or CRP. A 10-year interval is appropriate because\
    \ we expect crop\nrotations to emphasize more proﬁtable crops over a decade, and\
    \ this is a typical contract period for\nCRP land. A proﬁt-maximizing farmer may\
    \ switch land out of irrigated crops into non-irrigated crops\nwith declining\
    \ groundwater availability at the end of each period.\nThe initial land availability\
    \ equals the sum of the land covers chosen for site i at any time t\n(Equation\
    \ (1)).\n∑\nn\nj Lijt = ∑\nn\nj Lij0,\nfor j = crops, CRP, on-farm reservoirs\n\
    (1)\n2.1.2. Irrigation\nThe average annual irrigation that crop j receives to\
    \ supplement precipitation, wdj, is the demand\nfor irrigation in acre-feet. The\
    \ groundwater stored in the aquifer beneath site i at the end of the period\n\
    t is AQit. The water that comes from the on-farm reservoirs is RWit, and the water\
    \ from well pumping\nis GWit. There is recharge of the groundwater, nri, that\
    \ occurs naturally from precipitation, streams,\nand underlying aquifers each\
    \ period.\nEquation (2) shows the acre-feet of water stored in an acre reservoir\
    \ as\n(ωmax + ωmin) − ωmax\n∑n\nj Lij0\nLiRt,\n(2)\nwhich includes LiRt as the\
    \ acres in reservoirs at time t, and the total acreage at site i, ∑n\nj Lij0.\
    \ If the\nreservoir occupies the entire site i and only the rainfall ﬁlls the\
    \ reservoir, then the low-end acre-feet of\nwater that ﬁlls each acre of reservoir\
    \ is ωmin. If the reservoir is small compared to the entire site, then\nωmax\n\
    ∑n\nj Lij0 LiRt is close to zero, and the recovery of the runoff and rainfall\
    \ ﬁlls the reservoir to near capacity\nin acre-feet per reservoir acre of (ωmax\
    \ + ωmin). This does not account for temporal variability in the\nevaporation,\
    \ leakage, and the timing of rainfall within each period, which could inﬂuence\
    \ the values\nof ωmax and ωmin for the reservoir.\nThe intensity of well pumping\
    \ across the landscape inﬂuences aquifer depletion variability over\nspace. The\
    \ proportion of the underground ﬂow into the aquifer at site k and out of site\
    \ i when\nan acre-foot is pumped from a well at site k is pik, which depends on\
    \ the distance and the lateral speed\nof underground water movement based on the\
    \ soil proﬁles observed between sites [27]. This means\nthe groundwater that leaves\
    \ site i is ∑m\nk pikGWkt. We assume pumps have the same efﬁciency and\npower\
    \ units to deliver a ﬁxed amount of water per minute.\nThe water used for irrigation\
    \ must be less than the water available from reservoirs and wells\n(Equation (3)),\
    \ and Equation (4) indicates the water stored in the reservoirs must be greater\
    \ than the\nwater used from the reservoirs. The aquifer volume in the previous\
    \ period less the spatially weighted\nproportion of water pumped from the surrounding\
    \ sites plus natural recharge equals the current\naquifer volume (Equation (5)).\
    \ The cost of pumping groundwater at a site, GCit, depends on the cost to\nlift\
    \ an acre-foot of water by one foot, cp, and the initial depth to the groundwater,\
    \ dpi. The depletion\nof the aquifer volume, (AQi0 − AQit), divided by the area\
    \ of the site, ∑n\nj Lij0, shows how much the\ndepth to the aquifer increases.\
    \ Capital costs per acre-foot for the well, which accounts for new well\ndrilling\
    \ in response to aquifer decline, is cc (Equation (6)).\nWater 2017, 9, 28\n5\

    The cost to produce an acre of the crop, excluding the irrigation costs caj and\
    \ the price per\nconventional unit of the crop, is prj and constant in real terms.\
    \ We assume no productivity growth\ntrend for the constant yield of crop j per\
    \ acre at site i, yij. Excluding the costs of irrigation, the net value\nfor crop\
    \ j is then prjyij − caj per acre. The CRP payment per acre to the landowner,\
    \ prcrpyicrp, with yield\nnormalized to one and price is the payment per acre,\
    \ less the cost to establish and maintain an acre\nof CRP (cacrp) is the net value\
    \ per acre of CRP. The reservoir pumping cost per acre-foot is crw, and\nthe per\
    \ acre capital and maintenance cost of a reservoir each period is cr. We make\
    \ values over time\ncomparable in monetary terms using the real discount factor,\
    \ δt.\nEquation (7) indicates the economic objective to maximize the present value\
    \ of farm proﬁts over\nthe ﬁxed horizon T by changing the amount of land in each\
    \ crop or CRP, the reservoir water use, and\ngroundwater use, namely Lijt, RWit,\
    \ and GWit. The ﬁxed horizon T is a 30 years in length, and each\nperiod is ten\
    \ years in length. The non-negativity constraints on land, water use, and the\

    \ in the\nGeneralized Algebraic Modeling System [32].\n2.1.4. Cost-Effectiveness\
    \ and Net Returns per Acre-Foot of Aquifer Retention with Precision Irrigation\n\
    The cost-effectiveness of aquifer retention using precision irrigation is calculated\
    \ by ﬁrst ﬁnding\nthe difference in the present value of costs and the difference\
    \ in the ﬁnal aquifer volume between\nthe baseline and a model with only the soil\
    \ moisture sensors or only the unmanned aerial vehicles.\nThe baseline model supposes\
    \ no adoption of soil moisture sensors or unmanned aerial vehicles,\nand this\
    \ is compared to models with only soil moisture sensors or only unmanned aerial\
    \ vehicles.\nThe division of the difference in the present value of costs by the\
    \ difference in the ﬁnal aquifer volume\nindicates the cost effectiveness of a\
    \ particular precision irrigation technique. The net returns per\nacre-foot of\
    \ aquifer retention come from the division of the difference in the present value\
    \ of net returns\nby the difference in the ﬁnal aquifer volume.\n2.1.5. Sensitivity\
    \ Analyses and Conservation Policies\nThe baseline, soil moisture sensors only,\
    \ and unmanned aerial vehicle only models are then run again\nwith on-farm reservoirs\
    \ on the landscape to see how this changes crop choice, cost-effectiveness, and\n\
    net-benefit assessments. Another sensitivity analysis considers low- and high-range\
    \ costs and water-use\nefficiencies for each of the crops using either the soil\
    \ moisture sensors or the unmanned aerial vehicles.\nWater 2017, 9, 28\n6 of 17\n\
    Policy options for groundwater conservation include cost-share for the precision\
    \ irrigation techniques\nof soil moisture sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ by modifying cajk.\nScenarios regulating\ngroundwater pumping levels and taxing\
    \ groundwater pumping cost GC are also compared. The cost\nshare is 60% for soil\
    \ moisture sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles based on the rates from\nsimilar\
    \ improvements under the Natural Resource Conservation Service’s (NRCS) Agricultural\
    \ Water\nEnhancement Program [33]. We chose a regulation on groundwater pumping\
    \ to 220% of initial levels\nand a fee on groundwater pumping costs of 4% to achieve\
    \ groundwater conservation similar to the\ncost share on reservoir construction.\
    \ Farm net returns in policy scenarios include the payments to or\nreceipts from\
    \ the government because of the policy. Groundwater conservation cost is calculated\
    \ as\nthe policy cost (baseline farm net returns less the farm net returns plus\
    \ government revenue) divided\nby the change in aquifer level between the policy\
    \ option and the baseline. All policy scenarios allow\nfor construction of on-farm\
    \ reservoirs.\n2.2. Data\nThe outer boundary of the study area consists of three\
    \ eight-digit HUC watersheds in the Arkansas\nDelta region with critical groundwater\
    \ areas and non-point source pollution priorities (Figure 1).\nThese watersheds\
    \ overlap eleven Arkansas counties, and the average for the past 5 years of crop\
    \ yields\nby county is a proxy for the yield of the crops [29]. We evaluate crop\
    \ mix and irrigation methods on\na landscape with spatial heterogeneity by dividing\
    \ the study area into 2724 sites of approximately\n600 acres each. At this size,\
    \ sites approximate farm scale and realistically capture the dynamics of\nthe\
    \ aquifer in response to pumping across the landscape. Sites having entirely non-cropland\
    \ uses\nin the 2013 Cropland Data Layer (CDL), e.g., public lands, water, and\
    \ urban areas, are removed [34].\nThe initial acreage of rice, corn, cotton, soybeans,\
    \ and sorghum comes from the 2013 CDL, and on the\nbasis of harvested acreage\
    \ for 2010–2011 the soybean acreage is split into non-irrigated soybean, irrigated\n\
    soybean, and double crop soybeans (Table 1) [35]. In addition, to account for\
    \ the time-value of money\nin the optimization of returns over the 30-year period,\
    \ the yield of the 30-year Treasury Bond over the\nlast decade suggests and we\
    \ employ a real discount rate of 5% [36]. Over the last 5 to 10 years the real\n\
    discount rate is close to 2%, but looking back over 30 years a 5% discount rate\
    \ is a better approximation.\nTable 1. Descriptive statistics of the model data\

    \ the water table and volume of the Alluvial aquifer from the\nArkansas Natural\
    \ Resources Commission [31]. The acreage of the site times the saturated thickness\
    \ of\nthe aquifer is the volume of the aquifer at site i. The natural recharge,\
    \ nri, of the Alluvial aquifer is based\non a calibrated model of recharge for\
    \ the period 1994 to 1998 associated with precipitation, ﬂow to or\nfrom streams,\
    \ and other groundwater ﬂuxes [37]. It is important to note that improvements\
    \ in irrigation\nefﬁciency resulting from the use of precision irrigation impact\
    \ both recoverable and irrecoverable\nfractions of applied irrigation water. Some\
    \ improvement comes in the form of decreased amounts\nof direct evaporation and\
    \ runoff which directly contributes to groundwater conservation [4,38,39].\nThis\
    \ is accompanied, however, by decreased amounts of the recoverable fraction of\
    \ deep percolation.\nThe proportions of improved irrigation efﬁciency attributable\
    \ to recoverable and irrecoverable fractions\nare not precisely known. Furthermore,\
    \ decision makers in many aquifer systems consider losses to deep\npercolation\
    \ to be irrecoverable fractions due to the amount of time it takes for water to\
    \ reach a reusable\nstate [3,40,41]. With these facts in mind, we do not consider\
    \ differences in the rate of recoverable deep\npercolation resulting from precision\
    \ irrigation in our modeled calculations of aquifer levels.\nThe spatial weight\
    \ (pik) is the expected proportion of groundwater that ﬂows underground\nout of\
    \ site i into site k when an acre-foot of groundwater is pumped from site k, where\
    \ pik is based\non the distance between sites i and k, the saturated thickness,\
    \ and hydraulic conductivity of the\naquifer [27]. These dynamics dictate how\
    \ well pumping reduces the aquifer beneath the surrounding\ncells. The aquifer\
    \ below the well and the aquifer of the surrounding sites declines in response\
    \ to well\npumping. Water ﬂows from the aquifer of surrounding sites into the\
    \ site with the cone of depression\ncreated by the pumped well. The distance from\
    \ the pumped site and the hydraulic conductivity of the\naquifer, as described\
    \ above, inﬂuence the volume of the underground ﬂow from the surrounding sites.\n\
    Clark, Westerman and Fugitt [30] use spatially coarse pilot points to digitize\
    \ the hydraulic conductivity\nof the aquifer measured by feet per day. The spatial\
    \ weight depends on the volume of underground\nﬂow, and this determines how much\
    \ an acre-foot of water pumped from a well reduces the aquifer\nbeneath the surrounding\
    \ sites.\n2.2.2. Farm Production and the On-Farm Reservoir and Tail-Water Recovery\
    \ System\nThe costs of production by crop from the 2014 Crop Cost of Production\
    \ estimates, excluding\nirrigation, are shown in Table 2 [42]. The crop speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation water use comes from the Division of\nAgriculture [29]. The 5-year\
    \ average of December futures prices for harvest time contracts for all crops\n\
    are used for the crop prices [43]. The sign-ups in Arkansas as of March 2015 indicate\
    \ the CRP payment\nper acre [44].\nVariable irrigation costs from wells or reservoirs\
    \ include fuel, lube and oil, irrigation labor, and\npoly pipe for furrow irrigation\
    \ plus the levee gates for the ﬂood irrigation of rice [45]. The fuel cost per\n\
    acre-foot of groundwater depends on the fuel needed to raise water from the aquifer,\
    \ which depends\non the depth to the aquifer and the efﬁciency of the pump, gear-head,\
    \ and motor. The groundwater\npump is assumed to deliver 1800 gallons per minute\
    \ and the stationary re-lift pump for the reservoir\nand tail-water recovery system\
    \ to deliver 2000 gallons per minute [45]. The range in diesel use for\na well\
    \ is 13 gallons of diesel per acre foot for a 100 foot well to 26 gallons of diesel\
    \ per acre foot for\na 200 foot well, and 6 gallons of diesel is needed per acre-foot\
    \ for pumping water to and from the\nreservoir [29]. To account for the oil and\
    \ lube for irrigation equipment, we add 10% to the fuel cost of\n$3.77 per gallon\
    \ of diesel fuel [46]. To calculate a capital cost per acre-foot pumped, the capital\
    \ cost of\nthe irrigation equipment is amortized, and this is divided by the acre-feet\
    \ pumped from the well [45].\nThese technologies and costs characterize the conventional\
    \ irrigation methods of our baseline scenario.\nOn-farm reservoir/tail-water recovery\
    \ construction and maintenance costs for various reservoir\nsizes were estimated\
    \ using Modiﬁed Arkansas Off-Stream Reservoir Analysis (MARORA) to obtain\ncapital\
    \ cost estimates [47]. Since a majority of the construction cost for a reservoir\
    \ rests on the cost to\nmove one cubic yard of soil, this cost was updated from\
    \ $1 per cubic yard to $1.2 per cubic yard to reﬂect\nWater 2017, 9, 28\n8 of\
    \ 17\nchanges in fuel cost. The remainder of the investment and maintenance cost\
    \ comes from MARORA\nestimates and includes re-lift pumps for moving water from\
    \ the tail-water pit to the reservoir and\nfrom the reservoir to the ﬁeld. The\
    \ reservoir and tail-water recovery system capital cost is amortized\nto annual\
    \ per acre payments. The minimum volume of water (ωmin) an acre reservoir will\
    \ hold\ncomes from the tail-water recovery system collecting rainfall alone to\
    \ ﬁll a reservoir by 1.4 acre-feet\nof water [48]. The maximum capacity accounting\
    \ for evaporation of 11 acre-feet per acre is based on\nirrigation runoff supplementing\
    \ the rainfall runoff [47].\nTable 2. Value of economic and irrigation model parameters.\n\

    2.2.3. Production Cost and Water Use Factors for Remote Monitoring Technologies\n\
    Model scenarios involving precision irrigation technologies require adjustment\
    \ factors for\nproduction cost and water use. Table 3 reports these factors by\
    \ crop type. In addition to a baseline\nscenario, adjustment factors are provided\
    \ for sensitivity analyses involving low and high cost and water\nuse scenarios.\
    \ Water use improvements resulting from soil moisture sensor-informed variable-rate\n\
    irrigation were taken from LaRue [15], who conducted ﬁeld experiments to determine\
    \ the beneﬁts of\nvariable-rate irrigation relative to applying uniform irrigation\
    \ amounts. Hedley et al. [7] and Hedley,\nYule, and Bradbury [9] also observed\
    \ comparable water savings over several years using similar\nmethods. The adjustment\
    \ factor for water use in the baseline scenario draws from these experimental\n\
    results, while the high and low adjustment factors used for sensitivity analysis\
    \ come from discussion\nin Hedley et al. [49]. The soil moisture sensor network\
    \ and variable-rate system used in the ﬁeld\nexperiments were similar to Vories\
    \ et al. [50], and costs associated with these methods were gathered\nfrom several\
    \ sources and used to calculate additional per-acre production costs associated\
    \ with the\nsoil moisture sensors. Production cost adjustment factors were calculated\
    \ separately for each of the\ncrop types. Soil mapping is necessary for delineating\
    \ management zones, and services are available\nfor approximately $4.00 per acre\
    \ [51–54]. An interval of ﬁve years is used for the re-delineation of\nmanagement\
    \ zones. The network of soil moisture sensors costs approximately $8400 for a\
    \ farm similar\nWater 2017, 9, 28\n9 of 17\nin size to a single grid cell (600\
    \ acres) in our modeled study area, while a digital data logger costs\napproximately\
    \ $1300, and both may need replacing approximately every ﬁve years [55]. Costs\
    \ for\na retroﬁtted variable-rate irrigation system approximate $50,000 for a\
    \ farm of grid cell size, and it is\nassumed to last the entire thirty years of\
    \ the study period [56]. Capital costs were amortized and all\nadditional production\
    \ costs calculated on an annual per-acre basis in present value terms, allowing\
    \ for\neasy calculation of adjustment factors for production costs.\nThe same\
    \ retroﬁtted variable-rate system is used with the scenario of precision irrigation\
    \ informed\nby unmanned aerial vehicles monitoring plant conditions. The application\
    \ of unmanned aerial\nvehicles for precision management through mapping crop water\
    \ stress has been demonstrated [57–61].\nBecause unmanned aerial vehicles can\
    \ monitor plant conditions with a high degree of spatial\nresolution—as opposed\
    \ to the limited point measurements of soil moisture sensors—soil mapping\nis\
    \ not a necessary cost associated with this practice. The use of unmanned vehicles\
    \ for mapping\nwater stress depends on unmanned ﬁxed-wing aircraft equipped with\
    \ GPS, autopilot, and appropriate\nsensing devices. The platform used in modeling\
    \ this scenario is described in Ireland-Otto et al. [62].\nIt is a X-8 ﬁxed-wing\
    \ craft with a ground control station and launcher ($12,000). A thermal infrared\n\
    sensor ($3500) mounted under the aircraft is necessary to monitor water stress.\
    \ Aircraft and sensor\nreplacement are assumed at ten years.\nSome data processing\
    \ is required to apply monitoring\ndata to variable-rate irrigation, at an annual\
    \ cost of $0.20 per acre.\nAutomated closed-loop\nprograms that include data processing\
    \ are likely to emerge in the near future, so costs are likely\nto change. Peters\
    \ and Evett [14] demonstrated the automation of variable-rate irrigation using\n\
    the Temperature-Time-Threshold (TTT) method of plant monitoring to determine water\
    \ stress and\ncompared results with those of soil moisture sensor monitoring methods.\
    \ The TTT method was not\nquite as water efﬁcient as the soil moisture sensing\
    \ method. Based on the relative water-use efﬁciencies\nfor increasing yield observed\
    \ by Peters and Evett [14] (TTT = 0.909 kg dry biomass/m3 irrigation water,\n\
    SMS = 0.961 kg dry biomass/m3 irrigation water), a water-use adjustment factor\
    \ for each crop was\ncalculated for the precision irrigation scenario informed\
    \ by unmanned aerial vehicle monitoring.\nTable 3. Value of production cost and\

    \ different irrigation and cropping systems than we observe and model in the\n\
    Arkansas Delta, sensitivity analyses considering low- and high-range costs and\
    \ water-use efﬁciencies\nare particularly helpful to the cost-effectiveness comparison\
    \ (Table 3).\nWater 2017, 9, 28\n10 of 17\n3. Results\nTable 4 indicates the results\
    \ of the baseline model without precision irrigation or reservoirs.\nThe relative\
    \ prices over the last 5 years make rice and corn the predominant crops on the\
    \ landscape at\nthe end of the study period (Figure 2a), and both are irrigation\
    \ intensive crops. This makes the aquifer\ndecline from 76 million acre-feet to\
    \ 48.2 million acre-feet in 2045, and the 30-year farm net returns are\n$5.22\
    \ billion. We compare these results with a landscape where farms adopt soil moisture\
    \ sensors or\nunmanned aerial vehicles to reduce the costly application of irrigation\
    \ water. The use of soil moisture\nsensors increases the amount of land in rice\
    \ from 305 thousand acres to 343 thousand acres, and most\nof the rice acreage\
    \ adopts soil moisture sensors to mitigate irrigation costs (Figure 2b). The increase\
    \ in\nrice acreage is accompanied by a decline in corn, cotton, soybean, and non-irrigated\
    \ sorghum acres.\nAlthough rice acreage expands, the soil moisture sensors mean\
    \ less well pumping, and the aquifer in\nthe ﬁnal period is close to 48.7 million\
    \ acre-feet. Figure 2d,e depicts the extent of precision irrigation\nadoption\

    \ percentage of precision\nirrigated cropland is higher in the northern and western\
    \ sections of the landscape where the aquifer is\nmore depleted.\nThe use of unmanned\
    \ aerial vehicles increases rice acreage to only 316 thousand acres because\n\
    of the lower irrigation efficiency compared to soil moisture sensors, and much\
    \ of the rice remains in\nconventional irrigation. There is a slight decline in\
    \ the acres of corn, cotton, double crop soybean, and\nnon-irrigated sorghum compared\
    \ to the baseline (Figure 2c). The final aquifer volume is 48.6 million\nacre-feet,\
    \ slightly lower than the 48.7 million acre-feet with the soil moisture sensors,\
    \ but higher than the\n48.2 million acre-feet baseline. The soil moisture sensors\
    \ have greater net returns per acre-foot conserved\nthan the unmanned aerial vehicles,\
    \ $9.09 per acre-foot versus $7.69 per acre-foot, because high-value rice\nacreage\
    \ increases more with the soil sensors. The soil moisture sensor technology is\
    \ more expensive per\nacre, though, and this makes it a less cost-effective solution\
    \ for aquifer retention than the unmanned\naerial vehicles. The positive net returns\
    \ indicate that both farmers and conservationists gain from\nthe technologies.\
    \ Though the utility of unmanned aerial vehicles for precision management through\n\
    Water 2017, 9, 28\n11 of 17\nmapping crop water stress has been demonstrated [57–61],\
    \ and plant-based monitoring of water\nstress to automate variable-rate irrigation\
    \ has shown the ability to improve irrigation water use [14],\nsystematic and\
    \ multidisciplinary research is still necessary to verify and quantify improvements\
    \ from\nmanaging crop inputs based on images from unmanned aerial vehicles [61,65].\n\
    The presence of on-farm reservoirs and tail-water recovery increases the land\
    \ in rice and corn\ncompared to the baseline, and the non-irrigated sorghum is\
    \ nearly gone. When the soil moisture\nsensors are adopted on the landscape rice\
    \ increases to 390 thousand acres, corn falls to 672 thousand\nacres, and the\
    \ acres in both non-irrigated crop and in reservoirs falls. The aquifer level\
    \ in the ﬁnal\nperiod rises to 50.4 million acre-feet from 50.2 million acre-feet\
    \ without the soil moisture sensors.\nIf unmanned aerial vehicles are adopted\
    \ on the landscape with reservoirs, then the rice acres rise\nslightly to 357\
    \ thousand acres, and the corn acres fall to 678 thousand acres. The acres in\
    \ reservoirs and\nnon-irrigated sorghum are virtually unchanged from the landscape\
    \ with reservoirs but without the\nunmanned aerial vehicles. The aquifer volume\

    \ the landscape is using irrigation than before. The net returns per acre are\n\
    $62 per acre-foot for the soil moisture sensors and $31 per acre-foot for the\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles.\nLooking only at cost-effectiveness for an acre-foot\
    \ of aquifer retention, though, the unmanned aerial\nvehicles are preferred since\
    \ the technology is somewhat less expensive.\nThe cost and irrigation efﬁciency\
    \ of the soil moisture sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles is\nnot known with\
    \ certainty. We use a low and high-end range for the cost and irrigation efﬁciency\
    \ of\nthe precision irrigation technologies to see how crop choice, well pumping,\
    \ and the farm net returns\nare affected in Table 5. For the soil moisture sensors,\
    \ rice expands to 452 thousand acres for the low\ncost/high irrigation efﬁciency\
    \ scenario while the high cost/low irrigation efﬁciency scenario has rice\nWater\
    \ 2017, 9, 28\n12 of 17\nexpand to just 331 thousand acres. The large expansion\
    \ of rice in the low cost/high irrigation efﬁciency\nscenario makes corn and other\
    \ crop acreage fall compared to the baseline, and even though more\nirrigation\
    \ intensive rice is grown, the well pumping falls to 1422 thousand acre-feet in\
    \ the ﬁnal period\nbecause the soil moisture sensors increase irrigation efﬁciency.\
    \ The crop mix in the high cost/low\nirrigation efﬁciency scenario for the soil\
    \ moisture sensors is largely the same as the landscape without\nthe soil moisture\
    \ sensors. The well pumping, though, does fall from the baseline to 1433 thousand\n\
    acre-feet in the ﬁnal period because of soil moisture sensor adoption.\nTable\

    These crop and water use changes on the landscape from the soil moisture sensor\
    \ use make the\n30-year farm net returns edge up slightly with the high cost/low\
    \ irrigation efﬁciency scenario and\ngo up substantially to $5.40 billion in the\
    \ low cost/high irrigation efﬁciency scenario. The aquifer\nrises to 50.2 million\
    \ acre-feet in the low cost/high irrigation efﬁciency scenario and to just 48.6\
    \ million\nacre-feet in the high cost/low irrigation efﬁciency scenario. The net-beneﬁt\
    \ assessment indicates\n$90 per acre-foot if the soil moisture sensors are low\
    \ cost and high efﬁciency, and a modest $8.57 per\nacre-foot for high cost and\
    \ low efﬁciency sensors. This means there is a wide range of potential net\nreturns\
    \ to an optimized landscape allowing the use of soil moisture sensors, but implementation\
    \ that\nmore closely approximates the low cost/high irrigation efﬁciency scenario\
    \ can generate substantial\ngains to both farmers and the aquifer. The use of\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles makes the rice acreage\nexpand to 430 thousand acres\
    \ in the low cost/high irrigation efﬁciency scenario but fall slightly to\n304\
    \ thousand acres in the high cost/low irrigation efﬁciency scenario. The low cost/high\
    \ irrigation\nefﬁciency scenario for unmanned aerial vehicles has 1338 thousand\
    \ acre-feet of well pumping in the\nﬁnal period because the unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ allow for a reduction in water use even as rice acres\nexpand. There are 1437\
    \ thousand acre-feet of well pumping in the ﬁnal period for the high cost/low\n\
    efﬁciency scenario, only slightly below the baseline, because there is limited\
    \ adoption of the unmanned\naerial vehicles when the irrigation efﬁciency is low.\
    \ The aquifer rises to 49.7 million acre-feet and\n30-year farm net returns rise\
    \ to $5.3 billion in the low cost/high efﬁciency scenario; however, the\naquifer\
    \ rises to only 48.4 million acre-feet and $5.2 billion in 30-year farm net returns\
    \ for the high\ncost/low irrigation efﬁciency scenario. The wide range in the\
    \ net returns per acre-foot for the low\nWater 2017, 9, 28\n13 of 17\nand high-end\
    \ scenarios, from $70 to $5.55 per acre-foot, for the unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ indicates, as\nfor the soil sensors, that improving the efﬁciency of the technology\
    \ is valuable for proﬁtability and\naquifer retention.\nThe use of cost-share\
    \ assistance to encourage precision irrigation, shown in Table 6, improves\nfarm\
    \ net returns over 30 years and increases the volume of the aquifer, but the subsidy\
    \ represents a loss\nof government revenue that the taxpayer must bear. The policies\
    \ result in a loss of economic value\nto society because the rise in farm net\
    \ returns is less than the loss in government revenue. However,\nthese polices\
    \ allow more of the aquifer to be retained. The groundwater conservation cost\
    \ per acre-foot\nfor the study period is found by dividing the economic cost to\
    \ society of the policy by the acre-feet\nof the aquifer conserved. The soil moisture\
    \ sensors are more irrigation-efﬁcient and only slightly\nmore expensive than\
    \ the unmanned aerial vehicles, and this makes the $59 groundwater conservation\n\
    cost per acre-foot for the cost-share on the soil moisture sensors less than the\
    \ $67 cost per acre-foot\nfor the unmanned aerial vehicles. The cost-share policies\
    \ are both expensive, however, compared\nto the groundwater conservation cost\
    \ associated with policies such as a cap on groundwater use\n($12/acre-foot) or\
    \ a fee on groundwater use ($1.6 acre-foot). Policies that target groundwater\
    \ use\ndirectly through a cap or tax appear more cost-effective at groundwater\
    \ conservation than the policies\nthat offer a cost-share on irrigation technology\
    \ for crops such as cotton and soybeans that are not\nespecially irrigation intensive.\n\

    \ Program [33]; d We choose a cap on groundwater pumping\n(220% of initial pumping\
    \ levels) and a fee on groundwater pumping costs (4%) to achieve groundwater\n\
    conservation similar to the cost share on soil moisture sensors.\n4. Discussion\n\
    Our results support the conclusion that remote monitoring to inform variable-rate\
    \ irrigation\npractices is an increasingly viable alternative for reducing groundwater\
    \ depletion through precision\nagriculture. We demonstrate that remote monitoring\
    \ to inform variable-rate irrigation can improve\nirrigation efﬁciency modestly\
    \ enough to conserve aquifer volumes, reduce pumping costs, and increase\nnet\
    \ returns by still allowing for more production of proﬁtable but water-intensive\
    \ rice. Furthermore,\nour results indicate the potential of remote monitoring\
    \ and variable-rate irrigation to provide beneﬁts\nin tandem with other complimentary\
    \ practices such as the use of the on-farm reservoirs.\nThe uncertainty around\
    \ the cost and water-use efﬁciency of the remote sensing techniques suggest\n\
    that the net-returns per acre-foot of aquifer retention could be signiﬁcantly\
    \ larger or a little lower than\nthe baseline costs and water use efﬁciencies\
    \ for the precision irrigation techniques suggest. As the\ncosts of the sensors\
    \ fall and the efﬁciencies continue to improve, then the net returns per acre-foot\
    \ of\nconserved aquifer promise to become substantially larger. As an important\
    \ reminder, our model makes\nthe simplifying assumption that all reduction in\
    \ applied water due to improved irrigation efﬁciency\nsaves irrecoverable fractions\
    \ of applied irrigation water. While the overwhelming proportion of annual\nWater\
    \ 2017, 9, 28\n14 of 17\nrecharge to the alluvial aquifer is the result of precipitation\
    \ and surface water ﬂux [37], precision\nirrigation scenarios may overestimate\
    \ the aquifer volume by failing to account for decreased levels of\ndeep percolation\
    \ over the long term.\nA cost-share policy to encourage more adoption of the sensing\
    \ technologies appears to incur\ngreater costs on society than either a regulatory\
    \ cap of groundwater use or tax on groundwater use.\nLeaving aside issues surrounding\
    \ an equitable share of the conservation burden across the agricultural\nproducers\
    \ and the rest of society, the most efﬁcient approach to conservation is through\
    \ directly\ntargeting the overused resource with a cap or a tax.\nThe evaluation\
    \ of beneﬁts and costs here between soil moisture sensors and unmanned aerial\n\
    vehicles only considers increased performance in irrigation efﬁciency with respect\
    \ to soil-based versus\nplant-based monitoring regimes. We do not consider other\
    \ beneﬁts of variable-rate irrigation or\nother applications of remote monitoring\
    \ which might present other beneﬁts. Another implication of\ntargeted spatial\
    \ application of irrigation is that nutrient and sediment runoff is minimized,\
    \ improving\nthe quality of surface waters [66]. In addition, it may be possible\
    \ to monitor a range of other plant\nconditions with unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ at little additional cost that are not able to be measured by\nwireless soil\
    \ moisture sensors [24]. Explicit spatial management of other crop conditions\
    \ might even\nallow farmers to realize more fully the beneﬁts of high spatial\
    \ resolution monitoring. For instance,\nproducers may be able to improve the efﬁciency\
    \ of nutrient application and uptake in a way that both\nlowers costs and increases\
    \ yield. Although many farms may already have spatial soil information, we\ndo\
    \ not know how many have this information or how many use any form of precision\
    \ agriculture.\nTo be conservative in the adoption rates of this technology, we\
    \ attribute all the costs of this spatial\nsoil information to the soil sensors.\
    \ To the extent most farmers already have this information, the soil\nmoisture\
    \ sensors will be more proﬁtable than we have indicated.\nThe soil sensor technologies\
    \ resemble a constant return to scale technology more than other\nirrigation equipment\
    \ like center pivots or on-farm reservoirs. This is because soil sensors only\
    \ have\na particular spatial radius where they are effective. However, the unmanned\
    \ aerial vehicle technologies\ndo exhibit economies of scale, and the unquestionable\
    \ improvement in these technologies is likely to\nfurther increase consolidation\
    \ in the farming sector. The average farm size in the region has risen from\n\
    750 acres in 2002 to 820 acres in 2012 [35]. Improved sensing technologies are\
    \ likely to augment this trend.\nAs costs associated with unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ or their services decrease and monitoring\napplications increase, the aircraft\
    \ are likely to surpass soil moisture sensors in terms of both\ncost-effectiveness\
    \ of aquifer savings and net returns. Given that the most attractive policy alternative\n\
    among the farming community also comes at the greatest cost to society, it may\
    \ be that widespread\nimplementation of one of these practices depends on a continued\
    \ drop in costs. Future work should\ncontinue to explore the role of precision\
    \ technology and high-resolution monitoring in agriculture by\ngiving needed attention\
    \ to adapting best practices to region-speciﬁc constraints. Toward this goal,\n\
    it will be important to continue to characterize the beneﬁts and costs of these\
    \ applications under\ndifferent environmental and economic conditions.\nAcknowledgments:\

    \ precision irrigation aim at reducing irrigation appli-\ncations while optimizing\
    \ crop yield to achieve maximum crop water productivity (CWP). \nThese systems\
    \ incorporate on-site sensor data, remote sensing inputs, and advanced algo-\n\
    rithms with spatial and temporal characteristics to compute precise crop water\
    \ needs. The \navailability of variable rate irrigation (VRI) systems enables\
    \ irrigation applications at a \nsub-field scale. The combination of an appropriate\
    \ VRI system along with a precise deci-\nsion support system would be ideal for\
    \ improved CWP. The objective of this study was to \ncompare and evaluate two\
    \ decision support systems in terms of seasonal applied irriga-\ntion, crop yield,\
    \ and CWP. This study implemented the Spatial EvapoTranspiration Mod-\neling Interface\
    \ (SETMI) model and the Irrigation Scheduling Supervisory Control and \nData Acquisition\
    \ (ISSCADA) system for management of a center pivot irrigation system \nin a 58-ha\
    \ maize-soybean field during the 2020 and 2021 growing seasons. The irriga-\n\
    tion scheduling methods included: ISSCADA plant feedback, ISSCADA hybrid, common\
    \ \npractice, and SETMI. These methods were applied at irrigation levels of 0,\
    \ 50, 100, and \n150% of the full irrigation prescribed by the respective irrigation\
    \ scheduling method. Data \nfrom infrared thermometers (IRTs), soil water sensors,\
    \ weather stations, and satellites were \nused in the irrigation methods. Mean\
    \ seasonal irrigation prescribed was different among \nthe irrigation levels and\
    \ methods for the 2 years. The ISSCADA plant feedback prescribed \nthe least irrigation\
    \ among the methods for majority of the cases. The common practice pre-\nscribed\
    \ the largest seasonal irrigation depth among the methods for three crop-year\
    \ cases. \nThe maize yield in rainfed was found to be significantly lower than\
    \ the irrigated levels in \n2020 since 2020 was a dry year. No significant differences\
    \ were observed in crop yield \namong the different irrigation methods for both\
    \ years. The CWP among the different irriga-\ntion methods ranged between 2.72\
    \ and 3.15 kg  m−3 for 2020 maize, 1.03 and 1.13 kg  m−3 \nfor 2020 soybean, 3.57\
    \ and 4.24 kg  m−3 for 2021 maize, and 1.19 and 1.48 kg  m−3 for 2021 \nsoybean.\
    \ Deficit level (50%) had the largest irrigation water productivity in all crop-year\
    \ \ncases in this study. The ISSCADA and SETMI systems were found to reduce irrigation\
    \ \napplications as compared to the common practice while maintaining crop yield.\
    \ This study \nwas the first to implement the newly developed integrated crop\
    \ water stress index (iCWSI) \nthresholds and the ISSCADA system for site-specific\

    \ irrigation\nIntroduction\nPrecision irrigation aims for improved CWP by managing\
    \ spatiotemporal crop water \nrequirements in a field. Recent advances in sensing\
    \ technologies, data processing systems, \nmodeling approaches, and communication\
    \ protocols facilitate the management of site-\nspecific irrigation at a sub-field\
    \ scale (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2019). Over the past decade, \nnumerous precision\
    \ irrigation technologies and methodologies have been developed and \ntested across\
    \ different cropping systems (Barker et al., 2019; Bhatti et al., 2020; Haghverdi\
    \ \net al., 2016; Lena et al., 2020; Mendes et al., 2019; O’Shaughnessy et al.,\
    \ 2015; Osroosh \net al., 2016; Stone et al., 2020; Sui & Yan, 2017; Taghvaeian\
    \ et al., 2014; Thorp, 2020; \nVories et al., 2020). While there is an abundance\
    \ of precision irrigation tools, it is impor-\ntant to assess the suitability\
    \ of these irrigation scheduling methods in terms of CWP, com-\nplexity, and economic\
    \ viability (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2019). The downsides of precision \nirrigation\
    \ include associated costs and lack of effective algorithms and real-time availabil-\n\
    ity of data for irrigation scheduling (Evett et al., 2020a, 2020b, 2020c). Currently,\
    \ site-\nspecific irrigation systems are primarily utilized by producers to avoid\
    \ application on non-\narable areas of the field (Evans et al., 2013). The potential\
    \ benefits include improved CWP, \nreduced leaching, and energy savings, which\
    \ are yet to be demonstrated (Lo et al., 2016).\nUniform rate irrigation and speed\
    \ control VRI are easier to manage than zone control \nVRI and have the potential\
    \ of incorporating sensor data and precision irrigation techniques \nfor improving\
    \ CWP. The flow rate of individual sprinklers along the lateral pipe does not\
    \ \nvary with location in case of uniform rate or speed control VRI. Integrated\
    \ sensing sys-\ntems, advanced modeling tools, and irrigation scheduling algorithms\
    \ will be beneficial for \nboth site-specific and conventional irrigation methods\
    \ (Thorp et al., 2022). Data streams \nfor precision agriculture require temporal\
    \ and spatial knowledge of soil, plant, and field \ncharacteristics. Precision\
    \ irrigation technologies should be centered on plant water rela-\ntions in the\
    \ soil–plant-atmosphere-continuum for sustainable management of irrigation \n\
    water (Zhang et al., 2021). Precision irrigation tools using sensor data integration,\
    \ remote \nsensing inputs, and modeling approaches, have shown promise as effective\
    \ decision sup-\nport systems for irrigation management.\nCrop water stress can\
    \ be estimated spatially and temporally using systems such as the \nISSCADA system,\
    \ which was developed and patented (Evett et al., 2014) by the USDA \nAgricultural\
    \ Research Service in Bushland, TX. This system uses iCWSI to schedule irri-\n\
    gation and monitor crop water stress in the field. The iCWSI is computed by integrating\
    \ \nthe crop water stress index (Jackson et al., 1981) estimated for every minute\
    \ between the \ndaylight hours. Continuous measurement of canopy temperature is\
    \ needed at different loca-\ntions across the field to compute spatial iCWSI maps\
    \ for the field. The spatial canopy tem-\nperature measurements can be obtained\
    \ by mounting IRTs on moving irrigation systems \n(O’Shaughnessy et al., 2015,\
    \ 2017, 2020; Evett et al., 2020b; Sui et al., 2017). A scal-\ning algorithm was\
    \ developed to estimate diurnal temperatures from data collected by the \npivot-mounted\
    \ IRTs by using stationary IRTs as a reference (Peters & Evett, 2004). The \n\
    diurnal time series data are estimated using a one-time-of-day temperature reading\
    \ taken \nduring daylight hours (moving IRT sensors) and an equation that scales\
    \ the temperature to \na known reference temperature curve (measurements from\
    \ the stationary sensors). In this \n2225\nPrecision Agriculture (2023) 24:2223–2247\
    \ \n1 3\nway, diurnal temperature time series were determined for many footprint\
    \ areas in the field. \nThe diurnal temperature time series data are used to compute\
    \ spatial iCWSI for the field \nand automate irrigation management using the ISSCADA\
    \ system (O’Shaughnessy et al., \n2012). The ISSCADA system was found to adequately\
    \ manage irrigation scheduling at a \nsite-specific level in different climates\
    \ (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2017; Stone et al., 2020; Sui \net al., 2020; Vories\
    \ et al., 2020). This system has built-in algorithms to convert weather, \nsoil\
    \ water sensing, and canopy temperature data into reliable irrigation decisions\
    \ and auto-\nmate the management of moving center pivot irrigation systems.\n\
    The SETMI model (Geli & Neale, 2012; Neale et al., 2012) has the ability to estimate\
    \ \nspatial crop water requirements and manage precision irrigation. Multiyear\
    \ studies on \nsite-specific irrigation were conducted using the SETMI model for\
    \ maize and soybean in \nNebraska (Barker et al., 2018, 2019; Bhatti et al., 2020).\
    \ This model combines a reflec-\ntance-based crop coefficient evapotranspiration\
    \ approach (water balance approach) with a \ntwo-source energy balance approach\
    \ (Norman et al., 1995). The water balance approach \ncomputes the soil adjusted\
    \ vegetation index (SAVI; Huete, 1988) from red and near-infra-\nred bands and\
    \ uses the relationships between basal crop coefficients and SAVI (Campos \net al.,\
    \ 2017). The energy balance approach uses thermal infrared imagery to compute\
    \ the \nlatent heat flux and estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) at a spatial\
    \ scale. Sensor-based \nsoil water measurements from the root zone can also be\
    \ used to update the water balance in \nthe SETMI model (Bhatti et al., 2020).\
    \ The water balance approach can forecast irrigation \nneeds using historic weather\
    \ data, which can prove beneficial to producers. The ISSCADA \nsystem and SETMI\
    \ model have never been implemented on the same field in a research \nexperiment\
    \ for comparing their potential in site-specific irrigation management.\nThe overall\
    \ goal of the study was to implement two decision support systems for site-\n\
    specific irrigation management and compare the crop yield and water productivity\
    \ for \nmaize and soybean in eastern Nebraska. The ISSCADA system used in-situ\
    \ and ground-\nbased proximal thermal sensing data, and the SETMI model used satellite\
    \ imagery with \nneutron probe soil water data to compute crop water requirements.\
    \ These precision irriga-\ntion methods were compared with the common irrigation\
    \ scheduling method practiced by \nfarmers in the area. The specific objectives\
    \ included: (1) the comparison of different irriga-\ntion methods applied at four\
    \ different irrigation levels in terms of crop yield and irrigation \napplied,\
    \ (2) the assessment of CWP and two other water productivities among the different\
    \ \ntreatments, and (3) the investigation of the suitability of newly developed\
    \ iCWSI thresh-\nolds for irrigation management of maize and soybean in eastern\
    \ Nebraska.\nMaterial and methods\nExperimental site and design\nThe study was\
    \ conducted on a 58-ha maize-soybean research field located at the Univer-\nsity\
    \ of Nebraska’s Eastern Nebraska Research and Extension Center, NE, U.S.A. (centered\
    \ \nat 41.172445°N, 96.478248°W) during the 2020 and 2021 growing seasons (Bhatti\
    \ et al., \n2022a). The field was irrigated using a seven-span, speed control\
    \ enabled center pivot irri-\ngation system (lateral length of 400 m), model Valley\
    \ Irrigation 8000 (Valmont, Valley, \nNE), with the X-Tec center drive motors\
    \ (capable of making a revolution in about 4 h). The \nsprinklers on the pivot\
    \ lateral were Nelson spinners (model S3030, Nelson, Walla Walla, \nWA) installed\
    \ on drops at a height of about 2.4 m from the ground and with a sprinkler \n\

    \ 3\nA total of 192 plots were designed for the field using eight radial zones\
    \ (concentric \nzones) and 24 arc-wise plot boundaries (Fig. 1). The area under\
    \ the outer four spans of \nthe pivot was used for the experiment. The north and\
    \ south halves had a total of 96 plots \neach. The plots were approximately rectangular\
    \ with lengths ranging between 43 and 90 m, \nand a constant width of 28 m. The\
    \ area of the plots ranged between 1205  m2 and 2630  m2. \nThere were a total\
    \ of 16 treatment combinations: four irrigation scheduling methods, and \nfour\
    \ irrigation levels. Each combination of an irrigation method-level had six replicates\
    \ \nfor each crop. The treatments were assigned to the experimental plots using\
    \ a strip-block \ndesign with two treatment factors: irrigation scheduling methods\
    \ and irrigation refill lev-\nels. More details on the different scheduling methods\
    \ and refill levels are provided in the \nsection ‘Irrigation management’ below.\
    \ The 24 arc-wise sectors (14° sector angle) were \nassigned to six sector blocks\
    \ with three sector blocks in each crop: west, center, and east \nsector blocks\
    \ (Fig. 1). Each sector block included four arc-wise sectors, which were ran-\n\
    domly assigned with the four irrigation scheduling methods. The eight radial zones\
    \ (con-\ncentric zones shown in different colors in Fig. 1) were assigned to two\
    \ radial blocks, and \neach radial block constituted two pivot spans. The inner\
    \ four radial zones were assigned \nto radial block 1 and outer four radial zones\
    \ were assigned to radial block 2. These radial \nzones were randomly assigned\
    \ with four irrigation levels for each radial block. The irriga-\ntion methods\
    \ were randomized between the four arc-wise sectors within each sector block \n\
    for the second year of the study. In 2021, the irrigation levels were not randomized\
    \ among \nradial blocks due to logistical reasons (needed reconfiguration of sprinkler\
    \ nozzles).\nExperimental data\nThermal sensing\nThe canopy temperature was sensed\

    \ stationary posts and on brackets mounted on the center pivot \nlateral. The\
    \ spectral range of the IRT was 8–14 μm with a 20° field of view. The outer two\
    \ \nspans of the center pivot were used to mount eight IRTs: two IRTs each for\
    \ the four irriga-\ntion levels. Each pair of IRTs were mounted about 6.1 m from\
    \ the edges of the respective \nradial zone borders and pointed towards the center\
    \ of the zone at oblique angles to nadir \n(see more details in Bhatti et al.,\
    \ 2022b). The IRTs were mounted on the pivot at a height \nof about 3.6 m from\
    \ the ground using special mounting arms secured to the truss rods, \nwhich extended\
    \ the field of view of the IRTs by about 3 m ahead of the pivot lateral when \n\
    moving in the forward/clockwise direction.\nStationary IRTs were installed near\
    \ the centroid of one ISSCADA hybrid-full plot for \neach crop. These sensors\
    \ were positioned at a nadir view angle and the height was manually \nadjusted\
    \ to maintain a distance of about 1 m above the canopy. When the maize reached\
    \ \nmaximum crop height, the 1 m spacing between the sensor and maize canopy could\
    \ not be \nmaintained since the sensor height had to remain below the truss level\
    \ to prevent damage. \nAfter this timeframe, the sensor height was between 0.3\
    \ and 0.5 m higher than the tassel \nof maize. The maximum height of the stationary\
    \ IRT from the soil surface was about 3 m \nfor maize and about 2.2 m for soybean.\
    \ The data from the IRTs were recorded every five \nseconds and were averaged\
    \ over 1 min. The 1 min data were transmitted using the wire-\nless Zigbee communication\
    \ protocol at a frequency of 2.54 GHz to a coordinator (model \nIRT-COR, Dynamax,\
    \ Inc., Houston, TX, USA). The coordinator routed the data through a \nUSB connection\
    \ to an embedded computer (model MXE-1401, Adlink Technology, Inc., \n 2228\n\
    Precision Agriculture (2023) 24:2223–2247\n1 3\nSan Jose, California USA) at the\
    \ center pivot point. The embedded computer also had a \nserial connection to\
    \ the CAMS (control) panel of the center pivot system and collects time-\nstamped\
    \ data including the GPS location of the end-tower, the center pivot speed, pres-\n\
    sure and voltage. A separate software system (ARSPivot) was installed on the embedded\
    \ \ncomputer to download data from a nearby AgSense weather station and manages\
    \ the data \ncollected from the IRT network, the CAMS panel, distributed wireless\
    \ network of the soil \nwater sensors (discussed below), and the AgSense weather\
    \ station to build a prescription \nmap (Andrade et al., 2020).\nThe center pivot\
    \ system was moved around the field without water (dry scan) to collect data \n\
    using the pivot mounted IRTs. A total of 16 dry scans in 2020 and 19 dry scans\
    \ in 2021 were \nconducted to sense spatial canopy temperature data. The dry scans\
    \ were mainly conducted \nbetween 10:00 AM and 5:30 PM. The scaling algorithm\
    \ (Peters & Evett, 2004), incorporated in \nthe ARSPivot software, was used by\
    \ the ISSCADA system to estimate the diurnal canopy tem-\nperature for each one-time\
    \ of day remote measurement recorded by each pair of IRTs mounted \non the pivot\
    \ lateral. Additionally, the algorithm uses a reference measurement from a station-\n\
    ary IRT to capture diurnal pattern in canopy temperature at one location in the\
    \ field. Further, \nthe algorithm scales the diurnal canopy temperature curve\
    \ from stationary IRT to a predicted \ntemperature curve for a remote location\
    \ using ratio between the reference temperature and the \nremote location measurement,\
    \ referenced to the predawn temperature (Peters & Evett, 2004). \nThere were about\
    \ 180 remote locations or canopy temperature measurements that were moni-\ntored\
    \ by one moving IRT mounted on the pivot in a dry scan conducted at 100% speed.\
    \ Data \nfrom the stationary IRTs were used to develop a reference temperature\
    \ curve in the scaling algo-\nrithm. The integrated crop water stress index (iCWSI;\
    \ O’Shaughnessy et al., 2020) was also \ncomputed by the ISSCADA system at each\
    \ remote location for every minute during daylight \nhours from 9:00 AM to 7:00\
    \ PM. The iCWSI was computed using following equation as men-\ntioned in O’Shaughnessy\
    \ et al. (2017):\nwhere i is the  ith time step, N is total number of 1 min steps\
    \ between 9:00 AM and 7:00 \nPM, T\n′\nc is canopy temperature estimated using\
    \ scaling algorithm, Ta is ambient air tempera-\nture, (Tc − Ta\n)\nll represents\
    \ the lower limit of the canopy and air temperature differential, and \n(Tc −\
    \ Ta\n)\nul represents the upper limit of the canopy and air temperature differential.\
    \ The lower \nand upper limits of the canopy temperature and air temperature difference\
    \ were computed using \nthe theoretical approach (Jackson et al., 1981). The weather\
    \ variables required for computing \nthe upper and lower limits were acquired\
    \ from an onsite AgSense weather station. All computa-\ntions were automatically\
    \ conducted by the ISSCADA system at midnight following a dry scan.\nA separate\
    \ data analysis of the thermal data using iCWSI (Bhatti et al., 2022a) dem-\n\
    onstrated that crop water stress could be detected before incurring crop yield\
    \ loss. This \nwas possible in a narrow range when the photosynthesis rate (and\
    \ carbon assimilation) was \nlimited by solar radiation (energy-limiting water\
    \ stress), yet the leaf had abundant carbon \ndioxide for photosynthesis. In non-irrigated\
    \ plots, the water stress progressed and stomatal \nconductance further decreased\
    \ until photosynthesis was limited by carbon dioxide (carbon-\ndioxide-limiting\
    \ water stress), in which case a yield reduction occurred (Fig. 2). A signifi-\n\
    cant increase in daily carbon gain by a soybean plant was found when stomatal\
    \ conduct-\nance and soil water content was high in the more recently released\
    \ cultivars (Koester et al., \n2016). Hence, the canopy temperature and stomatal\

    \ (TDR) soil water sensors (model TDR315L, \nAcclima, Inc., Meridian, Idaho, USA)\
    \ were installed horizontally at four depths (0.15, \n0.30, 0.46, and 0.76 m)\
    \ in two hybrid plots (one location per crop; Fig. 1). The four depths \nwere\
    \ selected to represent soil water profile of the root zone to a depth of 1 m.\
    \ Three sen-\nsors were installed within 0.5 m of the ground surface to capture\
    \ the dynamic nature of soil \nwater in shallow depths. The soil water stations\
    \ consisting of four TDR sensors were situ-\nated adjacent to the stationary IRTs\
    \ in the same plot. The data was sensed at a frequency \nof 15 min and stored\
    \ using a CR300 datalogger with an embedded RF407 radio (Campbell \nScientific,\
    \ Logan, Utah, USA). The data were transmitted wirelessly using the proprietary\
    \ \nPakBus communication protocol and Yagi antennas (Campbell Scientific) operating\
    \ at \n900 MHz. Data were collected using a RF407 radio serving as a base station\
    \ modem con-\nnected to the embedded computer.\nFig. 2  Schematic of three conditions\
    \ of water stress supported by data for integrated crop water stress \nindex,\

    \ water data from two neutron probes (model 503 Elite Hydroprobe, CPN, Concord,\
    \ \nCA) were also monitored at multiple depths including 0.15, 0.46, 0.76, and\
    \ 1.07 m. Since \nthe representative volume of a soil water measurement from neutron\
    \ probe is larger com-\npared to TDR sensors, the depths of measurement for neutron\
    \ probe were equally spaced to \nrepresent soil water profile to a depth of 1.2 m.\
    \ The data were collected with a frequency of \nabout 3 weeks. For each crop,\
    \ 24 access tubes were installed in the approximate geometric \ncenter of each\
    \ plot with 12 tubes each in the rainfed and full levels (Fig. 1). Field calibra-\n\
    tion from a nearby site (3 km away) with the same soils was used for one of the\
    \ probes \n(Bhatti et al., 2020). The second probe was cross-calibrated using\
    \ the first probe for the \nfield site.\nRemote sensing imagery\nRemote sensing\
    \ data was acquired from the PlanetScope satellite multispectral imager \n(Planet\
    \ Labs, Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA) with a spatial resolution of 3 m and tem-\n\
    poral resolution of ~ 1 day. The imagery was captured over the field between 10:30\
    \ and \n11:30 AM. The data were only selected if the imagery over and around the\
    \ field was free \nof clouds and image stripes. A total of 20 images (taken between\
    \ May 8 and October 10) \nin 2020, and 27 images (taken between April 29 and October\
    \ 18) in 2021 were used in \nSETMI. The model used the red and near-infrared bands\
    \ of the multispectral imagery to \ncompute the SAVI.\nWeather data\nA weather\
    \ station (AgSense, Valmont Industries, Inc., Huron, SD, USA) was installed \n\
    in an open area located to the west of the field. The weather data included air\
    \ tempera-\nture, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, solar radiation,\
    \ and rainfall, which were \ncollected at a frequency of 5 min. The suite of sensors\
    \ included a cup anemometer, wind \ndirection sensor, pyranometer, relative humidity\
    \ sensor, air temperature sensor, and rain \ngauge (model Vantage Pro2 Plus, Davis\
    \ Instruments, Hayward, CA). The cup anemometer \nwas mounted at a height of about\
    \ 3 m. The weather data was automatically retrieved by \nthe ISSCADA system and\
    \ was also accessible manually through the AgSense website. In \naddition, weather\
    \ data was also acquired from Memphis 5N weather station (Automated \nWeather\
    \ Data Network, High Plains Regional Climate Center), which was about 5 km from\
    \ \nthe field. Historic 20-yr weather data (2000–2019) was also accessed from\
    \ this weather sta-\ntion to compute the normal reference ET.\nCrop yield\nCrop\
    \ yield was calculated using yield monitor data from the combine harvesters. The\
    \ yield \ndata was cleaned and processed using the Yield Editor software version\
    \ 2.0 (USDA-Agri-\ncultural Research Service, Columbia, MO). The processed data\
    \ was then checked using the \nmean yield reported from the weighing grain carts.\
    \ The Yield Editor software was used \nto adjust the moisture of grains (measured\
    \ using yield monitor) to 15.5% for maize and \n13% for soybean. The dry yield\
    \ was computed by removing the mass of moisture from \nthe grains (dry yield =\
    \ (100 – percent moisture in grain) * yield). Data points were only \nincluded\
    \ if they were within a 6.1 m buffer from each plot boundary.\n2231\nPrecision\
    \ Agriculture (2023) 24:2223–2247 \n1 3\nIrrigation management\nThe values of\
    \ field capacity and wilting point used were 0.4  m3   m−3 and 0.2  m3   m−3,\
    \ \nrespectively. These values were computed by averaging field capacity and wilting\
    \ point \nmeasurements from multiple locations in a nearby field (within 3 km;\
    \ Bhatti et al., 2020). \nThe irrigation depths prescribed in an irrigation event\
    \ ranged between 5 and 25 mm. The \ndifferent irrigation refill levels included\
    \ rainfed, deficit, full, and over-applied at 0, 50, 100, \nand 150%, respectively\
    \ of the amounts determined by each irrigation scheduling method \nfor the full\
    \ level. Hence, the 50 and 150% levels were computed by scaling the full irriga-\n\
    tion amount by corresponding fractions. Since the center pivot was not capable\
    \ of varying \nthe irrigation rate of individual sprinklers on the pivot lateral,\
    \ the sprinkler nozzles for the \ndeficit and over levels were outfitted with\
    \ the required sized nozzles to achieve variable \nrate application along the\
    \ lateral of the pivot. These custom sized nozzles for the deficit \nand over\
    \ levels were specified by the irrigation dealer for achieving the required application\
    \ \ndepth in the respective irrigation zones. The nozzles for the deficit level\
    \ were switched to \nsmaller sizes (to achieve 50% of the full), and the nozzles\
    \ for the over level were changed \nto larger sizes (to achieve 150% of the full).\
    \ The nozzles for the rainfed zone were set to the \noff position, so these nozzles\
    \ applied no water throughout the season. The sprinkler noz-\nzles automatically\
    \ applied corresponding amounts of irrigation on the respective irrigation \n\
    levels (0, 50, 100, and 150%). With these modifications to the sprinkler package\
    \ from the \ndefault manufacturer’s design, system uniformity analysis was conducted\
    \ using catch-can \ntests to ensure high application efficiency in the different\
    \ management zones. Two catch-\ncan tests were conducted on June 25, 2020, and\
    \ June 10, 2021. The wind speed, air tem-\nperature, and time for the test were\
    \ 4.5 m  s−1, 30 °C, and 12:00 PM–1:00 PM, respectively, \nin 2020 and 2.6 m \
    \ s−1, 31 °C, and 10:00–11:00 AM, respectively, in 2021. Average percent \ndifference\
    \ between measured (in cans) and prescribed irrigation depth was 28% in 2020 \n\
    and 13% in 2021. The test in 2021 was conducted early in the morning with lower\
    \ evapo-\nrative demand and lower wind speeds than 2020. The Christiansen uniformity\
    \ coefficient \n(CU) was also determined for each irrigation level following Eisenhauer\
    \ et al. (2021). The \nCU in the deficit level was 53% for 2020 and 71% for 2021.\
    \ The CU for the over level was \n82% for 2020 and 92% for 2021. The full level\
    \ had a CU of above 90% in both tests. To \naccount for boundary effects from\
    \ neighboring management zones, a buffer of 6.1 m from \neach plot boundary was\
    \ used. The plot area after excluding the buffer zone was used to pre-\nscribe\
    \ irrigation. The input irrigation depth for each sector was determined using\
    \ the four \nirrigation methods discussed below.\nISSCADA plant feedback method\n\
    The iCWSI data were calculated for each treatment plot. Canopy temperature data\
    \ from \ndry scans were only used for iCWSI computations. It was found that the\
    \ canopy tempera-\nture collected during irrigation events had an apparent canopy\
    \ cooling of about 2 °C from \nirrigation water for this sprinkler configuration\
    \ due to the wet canopy (Bhatti et al., 2022b). \nTherefore, the canopy temperature\
    \ data collected during irrigation was not used for com-\nputing iCWSI. The iCWSI\
    \ data for each plot designated as “plant feedback method with \nthe full level”\
    \ computed by the ISSCADA system from the most recent dry scan were \ncompared\
    \ with pre-established iCWSI thresholds that were used to determine the irriga-\n\
    tion amount. The most recent dry scan IRT data was used to schedule irrigation\
    \ in 2021. \nThe replicate plots of this method in different sector blocks were\
    \ managed independent of \n 2232\nPrecision Agriculture (2023) 24:2223–2247\n\
    1 3\neach other and had varying levels of irrigation prescribed in a single irrigation\
    \ event. This \nmethod included three iCWSI thresholds: low (L), medium (M), and\
    \ high (H) threshold. \nThese thresholds are region, climate, and crop specific.\n\
    For irrigation management in 2020, the iCWSI data for a dry scan were compared\
    \ \namong the different irrigation levels to compute the prescribed irrigation\
    \ depth. The mini-\nmum iCWSI values for the rainfed and deficit levels were used\
    \ as the high threshold. The \nminimum iCWSI values from the full level plots\
    \ were used as the low threshold. The aver-\nage value of the high and low thresholds\
    \ was used as the medium threshold. The most \nrecent dry scan data were used\
    \ to compute new thresholds for each irrigation event in \n2020. The low, medium,\
    \ and high thresholds used for 2020 ranged between 100 and 150, \n130 and 170,\
    \ and 150 and 190, respectively, for both crops. These thresholds were used \n\
    to determine the amount of irrigation in 2020. The timing of the irrigation was\
    \ decided \nbased on soil water data from the Acclima TDR sensors similar to the\
    \ hybrid method. The \nthresholds for irrigation management for the 2021 growing\
    \ season were computed using \nthe iCWSI data from the 2020 growing season (refer\
    \ to Bhatti et al., 2022a for details). \nThe low, medium, and high thresholds\
    \ were 120, 150, and 180, respectively for maize and \n110, 130, and 150, respectively\
    \ for soybean. The irrigation was prescribed according to \nthe mean iCWSI calculated\
    \ for the designated treatment plots: no irrigation for iCWSI ≤ L, \n13 mm for\
    \ L < iCWSI ≤ M, 19 mm for M < iCWSI ≤ H, and 25 mm for iCWSI > H. It was \nobserved\
    \ that the mean iCWSI computed for rainfed was always higher as compared with\
    \ \ndeficit or full irrigation levels. Hence, it was more likely that the irrigation\
    \ would be trig-\ngered using iCWSI thresholds for rainfed since the iCWSI values\
    \ for rainfed were higher in \ncomparison with the other levels (Bhatti et al.,\
    \ 2022a).\nISSCADA hybrid method\nThe ISSCADA hybrid method used the soil water\
    \ data from TDR soil water sensors and \niCWSI data collaboratively to prescribe\
    \ irrigation. The depth weighted average of soil \nwater content was used to represent\
    \ root zone soil water content. The soil water deple-\ntion (SWD) was estimated\
    \ from the field capacity, wilting point, and soil water content \n(O’Shaughnessy\
    \ et al., 2020). The ratio of SWD to the maximum value of SWD (differ-\nence between\
    \ field capacity and wilting point) was used to define SWD thresholds. The \n\
    irrigation was managed with SWD and iCWSI thresholds: if SWD ≤ 15% then no irriga-\n\
    tion, if 15% < SWD ≤ 35% then manage using only iCWSI thresholds as in plant feedback\
    \ \nmethod, and if SWD > 35% then apply 25 mm irrigation. The most recent dry\
    \ scan iCWSI \ndata and SWD values computed using TDR sensors from the hybrid-full\
    \ treatment plots \nwere used to manage irrigation for this method. The iCWSI\
    \ data for each hybrid-full treat-\nment plot were independently used to prescribe\
    \ irrigation for the plot. However, one value \nof SWD was used for this method\
    \ at a given time since there was one location of TDR sen-\nsors per crop.\nSETMI\
    \ method using spatial evapotranspiration model\nThe water balance approach of\
    \ the spatial evapotranspiration model was used to prescribe \nirrigation for\
    \ the SETMI method (Neale et al., 2012). This approach maintains a seasonal \n\
    water balance for the crop which is updated with remote sensing imagery on a regular\
    \ \nbasis. The model was input with PlanetScope imagery, and SAVI was computed\
    \ at 3 m \npixel resolution using red and near-infrared bands. The crop ET was\
    \ computed using the \n2233\nPrecision Agriculture (2023) 24:2223–2247 \n1 3\n\
    dual crop coefficient approach (Allen et al., 1998) and reflectance-based crop\
    \ coefficients \n(Campos et al., 2017; Neale et al., 2012). The model estimated\
    \ water balance components \non a daily basis. The water balance was updated with\
    \ inputs of rainfall and irrigation. The \nmodeled root zone was linearly increased\
    \ from 0.1 to 1 m between the respective dates \nof crop emergence, and maximum\
    \ crop coefficient. The SWD computed with the model \nwas updated using soil water\
    \ data from the neutron probe. Neutron probe data from three \ndifferent SETMI-full\
    \ plots for each crop were used to adjust the SWD. Depth weighted \nsoil water\
    \ content was used to compute representative soil water content for the root zone.\
    \ \nThe SWD adjustment was conducted following the methodology described in Bhatti\
    \ et al. \n(2020). The model forecasted crop water requirements using normal reference\
    \ crop ET \ncomputed from the 20-year historic weather data and forecasted crop\
    \ coefficients for the \nentire season. The forecasted crop water requirements\
    \ were used to apply irrigation for \nthe upcoming week. A management allowable\
    \ depletion (MAD) threshold was used for \nscheduling irrigation in order to maintain\
    \ soil water above MAD. The MAD was used as \n50% of the available water capacity\
    \ (difference between soil water content at field capacity \nand wilting point)\
    \ for majority of the season, which was increased to 60% for both crops \nlate\
    \ in the season (around denting stage for maize and appearance of yellow leaves\
    \ in soy-\nbean). The crop water requirements were computed at 3 m resolution,\
    \ and pixels excluding \na 6.1 m inner buffer from each plot boundary were averaged\
    \ to compute the prescribed irri-\ngation depth for the plot. The inner buffer\
    \ for each plot was used to remove any boundary \neffects from adjacent plots.\
    \ Additional model specific details can be found in Bhatti et al., \n2020. The\
    \ two-source energy balance approach of the model was not implemented due to \n\
    time and logistical constraints.\nCommon practice\nThis method represented the\
    \ common practice for irrigation scheduling in eastern \nNebraska. An agronomist\
    \ prescribed irrigation by sampling soil up to 0.6 m using a soil \nprobe in a\
    \ common practice-full treatment plot. The hand feel method was used on a \nweekly\
    \ basis to feel the soil wetness and texture to make conclusions on irrigation\
    \ require-\nments. In cases of hot and dry weather with high evapotranspiration,\
    \ the field was sam-\npled for soil water estimation two times during a week.\
    \ The prescribed irrigation with this \nmethod was always 25 mm in the full irrigation\
    \ level. This method allowed for the com-\nparison of sensor-driven irrigation\
    \ methods with the common practices in the area.\nIrrigation application\nThe\
    \ prescribed irrigation depths for each method were uploaded to the center pivot\
    \ system \nusing the AgSense remote management tool. The angles for each sector\
    \ and corresponding \nirrigation depths were entered in the AgSense software.\
    \ The different depths of irrigation \namong the different sectors were achieved\
    \ by varying the speed of the pivot, given the con-\nstant flow rate and operating\
    \ pressure through the individual sprinklers. A single value of \nirrigation depth\
    \ was entered for each sector in the AgSense software, and varying depths \nof\
    \ irrigation were applied in each sector with the custom-sized nozzles. The ISSCADA\
    \ \nsystem has the ability to upload and run irrigation prescriptions through\
    \ the center pivot. \nHowever, the ISSCADA system was set up as a zone control\
    \ system on a speed control \npivot. The zone control configuration of the ISSCADA\
    \ system enabled data collection and \ncomputation of iCWSI for each treatment\
    \ plot independently. Therefore, the AgSense tool \n 2234\nPrecision Agriculture\
    \ (2023) 24:2223–2247\n1 3\nwas used for irrigation management, and the ISSCADA\
    \ system was used for data collec-\ntion and crop water stress computations. The\
    \ ISSCADA system was successfully deployed \nfor irrigation management on August\
    \ 4, 2020. The irrigation on the ISSCADA treatments \nbefore August 4 were prescribed\
    \ similar to the common treatment. The ISSCADA system \nwas used to prescribe\
    \ four irrigation prescriptions after August 4 for each crop in 2020.\nData analysis\n\
    Seasonal irrigation, crop yield, and water productivity were compared among all\
    \ the treat-\nment plots. The seasonal irrigation and crop yield were statistically\
    \ tested to identify dif-\nferences among the treatments at a 5% significance\
    \ level. Statistical analysis was computed \nusing SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc.,\
    \ Cary, NC) software. PROC GLIMMIX was used to \nrun the univariate analysis of\
    \ variance (ANOVA). The main effects of methods and levels \nalong with the interaction\
    \ between the methods and levels were used in the model state-\nment. The blocking\
    \ was treated as a random effect for these tests. Two blocking effects \nincluding\
    \ radial blocks and sector blocks, were considered in the model. The irrigation\
    \ \nwater productivity (IWP), evapotranspiration water productivity (ETWP), and\
    \ CWP were \nexpressed in kg  m−3 and computed following Evett et al., (2020a,\
    \ 2020b, 2020c):\nwhere Y is dry yield (kg  m−2), I is applied irrigation depth\
    \ (m), and ET is actual crop \nevapotranspiration (m). Subscripts i and d represents\
    \ variables corresponding to irrigation \ntreatment i, and dryland treatment d,\
    \ respectively. Statistical differences in IWP among the \ntreatments were also\
    \ computed at a 5% level. The ET data was only available for a few \nplots in\
    \ the full and rainfed level plots. Hence, there were inadequate replicates to\
    \ compute \nstatistical differences for ETWP and CWP. The ET were computed using\
    \ neutron probe \nmeasurements, water balance components computed from SETMI,\
    \ and seasonal water \ninputs (rainfall or irrigation). More details on ET computations\
    \ can be found in Bhatti et al. \n(2022a).\nThe relationship between irrigation\
    \ applied and crop yield was also computed using plot \nvalues of irrigation and\
    \ yield. These relationships were used to study the increase in yield \nper unit\
    \ increase in water application for different plots. It was hypothesized that\
    \ the over \nlevel plots will not produce significantly larger yield as compared\
    \ with the full level plots.\nEliminated data\nThe yield data for soybean in the\
    \ north half in 2020 indicated significant differences \nbetween the east and\
    \ west quarters. The irrigation prescriptions did not have significant dif-\n\
    ferences in water application between east and west quarters. The average yield\
    \ in the west \nquarter was 4.7 Mg  ha−1 and in the east quarter was 4.1 Mg  ha−1.\
    \ The plot yield in the east \nIWP = Yi − Yd\nIi\nETWP =\nYi − Yd\nETi − ETd\n\
    CWP = Y\nET\n2235\nPrecision Agriculture (2023) 24:2223–2247 \n1 3\nquarter was\
    \ consistently lower than the west quarter for different irrigation treatments.\
    \ The \nreason for this difference in yield is unclear, and no such observation\
    \ was found in yield \nmaps from the past 5 years. As a result of this observed\
    \ difference in yield between the two \nquarters, 36 plots from sector block 2\
    \ (Fig. 1) which were split equally between east and \nwest quarters had to be\
    \ eliminated from yield analysis in 2020. The eliminated plots could \nhave resulted\
    \ in mean yield for two methods (present in the west quarter for sector block\
    \ 2) \nto be significantly larger than the other two methods (present in the east\
    \ quarter for sector \nblock 2). The yield data for maize in 2020 or for both\
    \ crops in 2021 did not demonstrate \nany differences in yield data between the\
    \ east and west quarters.\nResults and discussion\nSeasonal climate\nThe 2020\
    \ and 2021 growing seasons were different from each other in terms of the sea-\n\
    sonal rainfall received. The cumulative rainfall between June and September was\
    \ 178 mm \nfor 2020 and 386 mm for 2021. The depth of rainfall was almost double\
    \ in 2021. Historic \naverage rainfall (1991–2020) from June to September was\
    \ 381 mm for the Mead 6S sta-\ntion (National Centers for Environmental Information),\
    \ which was about 6.5 km southwest \nof the field. Therefore, 2020 was a dry season\
    \ when compared with the normal historic \nrainfall. The average daily air temperature\
    \ between June and September was 12.3 °C for \n2020, and 13.1 °C for 2021. The\
    \ maximum air temperature on average was larger in 2021 \n(29.2 °C) as compared\
    \ to 2020 (28.9 °C). The average relative humidity was 58% for both \nyears. Solar\
    \ radiation was slightly larger in 2020 (549 W/m2) as compared to 2021 (541 \n\
    W/m2). Wind speed was similar for both years on average (3.5 m/s in 2020 and 3.2 m/s\
    \ in \n2021).\nSeasonal soil water depletion and water inputs\nThe rainfall, SWD,\
    \ and irrigation were depicted using a representative plot for all crop-year \n\
    cases (Fig. 3). A plot assigned with the full level and SETMI method was selected\
    \ for each \ncrop-year. The SWD was modeled on a daily basis for the entire season\
    \ using SETMI and \ncorrected using soil water data from the neutron probe. The\
    \ MAD was also plotted as a ref-\nerence to the SWD. The modeled root zone was\
    \ linearly increased from 0.1 to 1 m for this \nmodel run. This resulted in a\
    \ constant increase of the MAD from the early to peak devel-\nopmental stage (identified\
    \ as the date when crop coefficients reached maximum value) for \neach crop. The\
    \ SWD on average indicated an increase with time, but the root zone deple-\ntion\
    \ did not reach the allowable depletion (Fig. 3). It is evident that the frequency\
    \ and mag-\nnitude of rainfall events were much higher in 2021 as compared with\
    \ the 2020 season. The \n2021 season had seven rainfall events larger than 25 mm\
    \ as compared to only one event in \n2020. Several large rainfall events were\
    \ observed after August 6, 2021, and only one irriga-\ntion event was applied\
    \ after this day for each crop.\nSeasonal prescribed irrigation depth\nThe mean\
    \ seasonal prescribed irrigation depth was compared among the different \ntreatment\
    \ plots (Table 1). The mean seasonal irrigation depth reported in Table 1 was\
    \ \n 2236\nPrecision Agriculture (2023) 24:2223–2247\n1 3\ncomputed as the average\
    \ total irrigation depth prescribed during the growing season \n(April–October)\
    \ for all plots under an irrigation treatment. This depth was reported for \n\
    all irrigation levels and methods (Table 1). The mean irrigation depth for a specific\
    \ irri-\ngation level was computed by averaging irrigation applied for the four\
    \ irrigation meth-\nods. Further, the mean irrigation depth for a specific irrigation\
    \ method was computed \nusing the average irrigation depth applied in plots with\
    \ 50, 100, and 150% levels.\nThere were a total of 11 and 10 irrigation events\
    \ applied in maize and soybean, \nrespectively, between July 2 and September 3\
    \ of the 2020 growing season. There were \nfour irrigation events prescribed for\
    \ both crops after the implementation of ISSCADA \nfor irrigation management in\
    \ 2020. In 2021, there were five and four irrigation events \napplied in maize\
    \ and soybean, respectively, between July 10 and August 20. As a con-\nsequence\
    \ of the experimental setup, the irrigation depths among the different irrigation\
    \ \nlevels were always significantly different from each other for both years.\
    \ This observa-\ntion was expected as the irrigation depths were applied at 50,\
    \ 100, and 150% of the \nirrigation depth prescribed by each irrigation method\
    \ for the deficit, full, and over lev-\nels, respectively. In 2020, the range\
    \ of mean seasonal irrigation depth for plots with \nthe four methods applied\
    \ at the full level was 37 and 41 mm for maize and soybean, \nrespectively. The\
    \ seasonal irrigation averaged for the irrigated levels was largest for the \n\
    common method (254 mm) in maize, and for the ISSCADA hybrid and SETMI methods\
    \ \n(203 mm) in soybean. The mean seasonal irrigation depth for SETMI method (219 mm)\
    \ \nwas significantly smaller than those of the other irrigation methods for maize\
    \ (Table 1). \nFor soybean, the ISSCADA plant feedback (172 mm) and common practice\
    \ (178 mm) \nmethods were significantly smaller in seasonal irrigation than the\
    \ other two methods. \nThe full level plots averaged for all methods were prescribed\
    \ with 236 mm for maize, \nand 189 mm for soybean on average.\nFig. 3  Seasonal\

    \ water depletion was modeled using \nSETMI and updated with neutron probe soil\

    \ Agriculture (2023) 24:2223–2247 \n1 3\nIn 2021, the range of seasonal irrigation\
    \ among all plots with the four methods applied \nat the full level was 70 and\
    \ 76 mm for maize and soybean, respectively. The seasonal irri-\ngation was significantly\
    \ larger for the common practice method than other methods for \nboth crops (127 mm\
    \ for maize and 102 mm for soybean). The plant feedback method had \nminimum irrigation\
    \ for maize (59 mm), and the hybrid method had minimum irrigation for \nsoybean\
    \ (25 mm). The range in prescribed irrigation among the full level plots in 2021\
    \ was \nmuch larger than in 2020 for both crops even though the overall irrigation\
    \ applied in 2021 \nwas comparatively smaller. The full level plots were prescribed\
    \ with 92 mm for maize, \nand 56 mm for soybean on average. There was a significant\
    \ interaction between the meth-\nods and levels for prescribed irrigation in 2021.\
    \ For soybean, the common method applied \nat 100% was larger in prescribed irrigation\
    \ than the other methods applied at 150%. For \nmaize, the plant feedback method\
    \ applied at 150% was significantly smaller than the com-\nmon method applied\
    \ at 100%. Prescriptions generated by the ISSCADA and SETMI meth-\nods for the\
    \ full level plots on July 2, 2022 were indicated in Fig. 4. It was observed that\
    \ the \nISSCADA plant feedback method on this day prescribed irrigation depth\
    \ between 13 and \n19 mm as compared to 15 mm prescribed by the SETMI method and\
    \ 25 mm prescribed by \nthe ISSCADA hybrid method.\nCrop yield\nThe mean crop\
    \ yield data for both crops were compared among the irrigation methods and \n\
    levels (Table 1). The irrigation applied and crop yield data for all individual\
    \ treatments \n(four irrigation methods with four irrigation levels) are depicted\
    \ in Fig. 5. In 2020, the \naverage maize yield was only found to be significantly\
    \ lower for rainfed (11.8 Mg  ha−1) \nas compared to the other irrigation levels.\
    \ The full and over levels had a mean yield \nof 13.7 Mg  ha−1, and deficit had\
    \ a mean yield of 13.1 Mg  ha−1. There were no signifi-\ncant differences found\
    \ in maize yield among the irrigation methods. The soybean yield \nwas not found\
    \ to be significantly different among the methods and levels. Rainfed had \na\
    \ mean soybean yield of 4  Mg   ha−1, which was lower than the other irrigation\
    \ levels \n(4.4–4.5 Mg  ha−1). This yield difference between rainfed and other\
    \ irrigation levels was \nfound to be not significant. The elimination of soybean\
    \ yield data from 32 plots reduced \nthe power of the statistical test which could\
    \ be a reason for this yield difference to be non-\nsignificant. The mean soybean\
    \ yield among the methods ranged between 4.3 Mg  ha−1 in \nplant feedback and\
    \ 4.6 Mg  ha−1 in hybrid.\nFig. 4  Irrigation prescriptions generated for full\

    \ mean yield differences were not significant among both the levels and the \n\
    methods for both crops. The rainfed had a similar crop yield as compared to the\
    \ irrigated \ntreatments. Since the rainfall in 2021 was much larger than in 2020,\
    \ the rainfed crop had \noptimal yield similar to irrigated crop in 2021. The\
    \ mean maize yield among the levels \nranged between 14.6 Mg  ha−1 in rainfed\
    \ and 15 Mg  ha−1 in the full level. The mean maize \nyield among the methods\
    \ was between 14.7 Mg  ha−1 in hybrid and 15.0 Mg  ha−1 in com-\nmon. The soybean\
    \ yield ranged between 4.8 and 5 Mg   ha−1 among the different levels \nand methods.\
    \ There were no significant interactions found between the main effects of \n\
    methods and levels. The computed iCWSI thresholds from 2020 season data were used\
    \ \nfor scheduling irrigation in the ISSCADA treatments in 2021. There were three\
    \ irrigation \nevents triggered using the iCWSI thresholds for each crop in 2021.\
    \ The optimal yield and \nreduced irrigation application (compared to the common\
    \ practice) observed in the ISS-\nCADA treatments indicated that the iCWSI thresholds\
    \ worked well for the 2021 growing \nseason for both crops. These thresholds should\
    \ be further tested during a few dry seasons \nin this region to validate their\
    \ credibility for irrigation management of maize and soybean.\nCrop water productivity\n\
    The statistical differences in IWP were computed for both crops in 2020 and 2021\
    \ \n(Table 1). For maize in 2020, the IWP ranged between 0.52 kg  m−3 (over) and\
    \ 1.12 kg  m−3 \n(deficit) among the irrigation levels. The IWP among the levels\
    \ were significantly differ-\nent from each other. The deficit level had the largest\
    \ IWP among the levels. There were \nno significant differences in IWP for maize\
    \ among the methods, which ranged between \n0.72  kg   m−3 in hybrid and 0.91 \
    \ kg   m−3 in plant feedback. The IWP ranged between \n0.16 kg  m−3 in over and\
    \ 0.34 kg  m−3 in deficit for soybean in 2020. The IWP differences \nFig. 5  Mean\

    \ for soybean. Among the methods, the com-\nmon practice had the maximum IWP of\
    \ 0.3 kg  m−3, and plant feedback had the minimum \nIWP of 0.12 kg  m−3. In 2021,\
    \ no significant differences were observed in IWP among the \nlevels and the methods\
    \ for both crops. The IWP among the irrigation levels ranged between \n0.58 kg \
    \ m−3 in deficit and 0.19 kg  m−3 in over for maize. This range was from 0.2 kg \
    \ m−3 \nin hybrid and 0.58 kg  m−3 in plant feedback among the irrigation methods.\
    \ For soybean, \nthe range in IWP was from -0.17 kg  m−3 in deficit to 0.1 kg \
    \ m−3 in over among the lev-\nels. The minimum and maximum IWP among the methods\
    \ were -0.38 kg  m−3 in SETMI \nand 0.15 kg  m−3 in hybrid. The negative values\
    \ of IWP were observed in 2021 due to \nfew irrigation applications and optimal\
    \ yield produced in the rainfed crop. The IWP was \nfound to be largest in deficit\
    \ among the different levels in all cases except soybean in 2021. \nThe plant\
    \ feedback and hybrid methods were found to have the largest IWP for maize and\
    \ \nsoybean, respectively in both years. In contrast, a study in Stoneville, Mississippi\
    \ yielded \nan IWP between 1.33 and 2.49 kg  m−3 for maize during the 2014 and\
    \ 2015 growing sea-\nsons (Sui & Yan, 2017). They also found that the IWP for\
    \ soybean ranged between 0.48 \nand 1.2 kg  m−3 in 2014 and 2015. Another irrigation\
    \ study on corn conducted in Flor-\nence, South Carolina from 2016 to 2019 found\
    \ IWP values between − 1.8 and 3.2 kg  m−3 \n(Stone et al., 2020). In particular,\
    \ they found that the IWP for the plant feedback method \nranged between − 1.8\
    \ and 3.2 kg  m−3, and for the hybrid method ranged between 1.58 and \n2.64 kg \
    \ m−3 during the study period.\nThe CWP and ETWP were also computed from the ET\
    \ and yield data (Table 1). The \nCWP was computed for rainfed and full levels\
    \ only. Evapotranspiration data was not avail-\nable for deficit and over levels.\
    \ The rainfed level had larger CWP as compared to the full \nlevel in all cases.\
    \ The full level had a CWP of 2.98 kg  m−3 in 2020 and 3.88 kg  m−3 in \n2021\
    \ for maize. In an earlier study, the average CWP for maize was found to range\
    \ between \n1.61 kg  m−3 in 2013 and 2.1 kg  m−3 in 2014 for maize in Bushland,\
    \ Texas (O’Shaughnessy \net al., 2017). The maximum CWP for maize was found in\
    \ the SETMI method (3.15 kg  m−3) \nin 2020 and in the plant feedback method (4.24 kg \
    \ m−3) in 2021. The maximum CWP for \nsoybean was observed in hybrid for both\
    \ years (1.13 kg  m−3 in 2020 and 1.48 kg  m−3 in \n2021). The maize ETWP for\
    \ the full level was 1.19 kg  m−3 in 2020 and 0.79 kg  m−3 in \n2021. In 2020,\
    \ the maize ETWP ranged between 0.83 kg  m−3 in common practice and \n1.42  kg \
    \  m−3 in SETMI. The soybean ETWP ranged between 0.21  kg   m−3 (plant feed-\n\
    back and common practice) and 0.61 kg  m−3 (hybrid). In 2021, the maize ETWP ranged\
    \ \nbetween 0.54 kg  m−3 (common practice) and 1.06 kg  m−3 (plant feedback).\
    \ The soybean \nETWP ranged between 0.02 kg  m−3 in SETMI and 1.84 kg  m−3 in\
    \ hybrid. In summary, the \nSETMI and plant feedback methods in 2020 and 2021,\
    \ respectively had the largest ETWP \nfor maize, and the hybrid method had the\
    \ largest ETWP for soybean in both years.\nIrrigation production function\nAn\
    \ irrigation production function was computed using irrigation and crop yield\
    \ data for \neach irrigation treatment (Fig. 5). It was observed that the data\
    \ points for each level were \ndifferentiable from each other in 2020, and data\
    \ labels were placed next to the cluster for \neach level in the figure. An apparent\
    \ increase in maize yield was observed with the rain-\nfed, deficit, and full\
    \ level clusters in 2020 (Fig. 5). There was no increase in maize yield \nbetween\
    \ the full and over levels. The increase in soybean yield between the rainfed\
    \ and \nfull levels was not obvious in 2020. The data from sector block two (32\
    \ plots) were elimi-\nnated for soybean 2020. In 2021, there were no significant\
    \ yield differences among the \n 2242\nPrecision Agriculture (2023) 24:2223–2247\n\
    1 3\ntreatments. It can be seen from Fig. 5 that the irrigation for plant feedback\
    \ at a particular \nlevel was significantly smaller than the irrigation for common\
    \ practice at the corresponding \nirrigation level. For both crops in 2021, the\
    \ seasonal irrigation for the plant feedback with \nover level was smaller than\
    \ the common practice with full level. The rainfed crop in 2021 \nproduced similar\
    \ yield as irrigated crop. The crop yield in 2021 had a small range between \n\
    different method-level plots due to the smaller irrigation applied in 2021 as\
    \ compared with \n2020.\nOverall, the crop yield was similar among majority of\
    \ the treatments implemented in the \nstudy for both years. The rainfed maize\
    \ had a significantly lower yield than the irrigated \ntreatments in 2020. The\
    \ deficit irrigation applied at 50% produced largest IWP for both \ncrops and\
    \ no significant reduction in yield was observed for this level during the two\
    \ grow-\ning seasons. However, the seasonal irrigation prescribed using the different\
    \ methods was \nsubstantially different from each other. The ISSCADA plant feedback\
    \ method prescribed \nthe least irrigation depth among the methods in two crop-year\
    \ cases. The ISSCADA hybrid \nand SETMI methods also prescribed the least irrigation\
    \ in one of the four crop-year sce-\nnarios while maintaining optimal crop yield.\
    \ This demonstrates that the two ISSCADA \nand SETMI methods performed well by\
    \ reducing irrigation applications over the common \npractice method while producing\
    \ adequate yield. Further studies are warranted to test these \nmethods in arid\
    \ and other climates. The iCWSI thresholds developed for this field should \n\
    be further validated for irrigation management in the sub-humid climate of the\
    \ Central \nGreat Plains by continuing irrigation scheduling using these thresholds\
    \ on two or more \ngrowing seasons for maize and soybean.\nComparative usability\
    \ of SETMI and ISSCADA\nBoth decision support systems differ from each other in\
    \ terms of ease of use, cost, labor \nrequirements, transferability, and viability\
    \ for adoption. These systems were used in the \nsub-humid climate of eastern\
    \ Nebraska in this study. The SETMI model has been imple-\nmented for site-specific\
    \ irrigation scheduling in Nebraska for about 8 years (Barker et al., \n2018,\
    \ 2019; Bhatti et al., 2020). The ISSCADA system was also tested in many different\
    \ \nlocations with different climates in the US (Evett et al., 2020b; O’Shaughnessy\
    \ et al., 2015, \n2017; Stone et al., 2020; Vories et al., 2020). Significant\
    \ reductions in prescribed irrigation \ndepth were observed in the previous studies\
    \ using these irrigation scheduling methods as \ncompared with the conventional\
    \ methods. The SETMI model can be implemented for irri-\ngation scheduling using\
    \ freely available satellite data as compared to the ISSCADA system \nwhich has\
    \ a considerable initial investment (~ US$10,000–15,000). The ISSCADA system \n\
    requires extensive instrumentation including network of IRTs, soil water sensors,\
    \ local \nweather station, radio enabled communication devices, embedded computer,\
    \ weatherproof \nenclosures, and data loggers.\nIn terms of usability and time\
    \ requirements, the SETMI model requires an expert user \nand significant time\
    \ to run the model. It is currently not designed to be used by producers \ndirectly,\
    \ but the model can be used by irrigation consultants to provide recommendations\
    \ \nto the producers. Additionally, SETMI can forecast irrigation recommendations\
    \ for a cer-\ntain number of days in the future which allows producers to be better\
    \ prepared for satisfy-\ning crop water needs. On the other hand, the ISSCADA\
    \ system is capable of automation \nand designed to be used directly by producers.\
    \ ISSCADA require farmers to run a dry scan \neach time a new irrigation prescription\
    \ needs to be generated. However, this system can be \nautomated to collect data,\
    \ control the irrigation system, analyze data to design irrigation \n2243\nPrecision\
    \ Agriculture (2023) 24:2223–2247 \n1 3\nrecommendations, and apply water with\
    \ no or minimal user inputs. With a remote desktop \nconnection, the user can\
    \ monitor and control the status of the center pivot through the ISS-\nCADA system.\
    \ The soil water and spatial crop water stress data can be viewed with ease \n\
    using the ARS-Pivot software which provide insights about different parts of the\
    \ field. The \nability to detect energy-limiting water stress (and use it to manage\
    \ irrigation) before the \ncrop canopy transitions to carbon-dioxide-limiting\
    \ water stress and subsequent yield loss \n(Bhatti et al., 2022a) supports the\
    \ idea of using thermal stress detection for a broad array \nof situations, including\
    \ full irrigation as well as deficit irrigation. In terms of transferabil-\nity,\
    \ the SETMI model can be implemented in different locations and climates with\
    \ relative \nease. This is due to the widespread coverage of land cover by satellites\
    \ with high tempo-\nral and spatial resolution. However, the ISSCADA system requires\
    \ development of iCWSI \nthresholds in the new location which requires implementation\
    \ of the system for at least one \nseason for data collection. Both decision support\
    \ systems have immense potential for preci-\nsion irrigation, and their pros and\
    \ cons should be considered before adopting a particular \nsystem for irrigation\
    \ scheduling.\nImplications for sensors on the pivot vs. unmanned aircraft systems\n\
    Although this study did not include unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), there is\
    \ a grow-\ning interest in UAS for irrigation (Chavez et al., 2020); therefore,\
    \ it is helpful to put the \nfindings of this research in the context of irrigation\
    \ management techniques using UAS. \nThis study demonstrated that IRTs mounted\
    \ on a pivot were successful in determining the \nspatial canopy temperature and\
    \ crop water stress accurately. The moving irrigation sys-\ntems can be additionally\
    \ used to mount different sensors including multispectral sensors, \nRGB cameras,\
    \ and thermal cameras. These irrigation systems can be used to collect data \n\
    in windy conditions and has low cost of operation. The cost of electrical energy\
    \ consumed \nduring a dry scan was about $3.60 for the pivot used in this study\
    \ (Bhatti et al., 2022b). \nThe data collection using sensors on these irrigation\
    \ systems has potential for automation \nand does not require any labor for their\
    \ operation. Currently, there are center pivots that \ncan complete a revolution\
    \ of a quarter section field (~ 60 ha) in only 90 min. This is sig-\nnificant\
    \ as the data across the field can be collected from the moving irrigation systems\
    \ \nwith consistent weather conditions and time of day. The sensor data does not\
    \ need to be \ncorrected for atmospheric interference. Relatively low-cost UAS\
    \ are available for capturing \nqualitative spatial patterns in crop canopy. However,\
    \ UAS with a thermal sensor for canopy \ntemperature are both costly and labor\
    \ intensive, especially if accurate canopy temperature \nis needed (i.e., to calculate\
    \ iCWSI). Maguire et al. (2021) highlight some of the challenges \nof accurately\
    \ measuring canopy temperature with UAS (RMSE of 2.24 °C when evaluat-\ning UAS\
    \ canopy temperature against canopy temperature from proximal IRTs). The UAS \n\
    are operated under strict federal regulations and requires expert training on\
    \ their effective \noperation. Additionally, some UAS are not recommended to be\
    \ flown in windy conditions \nand require calm, sunny days for flying. The data\
    \ collected from the UAS may require cor-\nrections on the captured imagery to\
    \ account for atmospheric interference (Maguire et al., \n2022).\nThe sensors\
    \ on a pivot determine crop and field characteristics with considerable spatial\
    \ \ncoverage across the field. While it is possible to mount ample number of sensors\
    \ on an irri-\ngation system, the associated cost increases considerably with\
    \ the addition of instrumenta-\ntion. It is crucial to determine the minimum number\
    \ of sensors needed for monitoring crop \nwater stress and manage a field. The\
    \ ISSCADA system can be used with a minimum of two \n 2244\nPrecision Agriculture\
    \ (2023) 24:2223–2247\n1 3\nIRTs to cancel for sun angles as the pivot moves around\
    \ the field. This would be sufficient \nfor managing the entire field uniformly\
    \ if the sensors were mounted on the outer two spans. \nMounting sensors on the\
    \ outer spans will increase the area sensed and improve confidence \nin irrigation\
    \ decision making. However, it will be beneficial to use two pairs of IRTs in\
    \ \nthe outer two spans of the center pivot for managing variable rate irrigation\
    \ (either speed \nor zone control). Instead of mounting all four sensors on the\
    \ two outer spans, one pair of \nIRTs can also be used in an area with low yielding\
    \ crop. On the contrary, the UAS can be \nmaneuvered to collect data from all\
    \ parts of the field with only one sensor.\nConclusions\nThis experiment implemented\
    \ two scientific decision support systems for irrigation man-\nagement of maize\
    \ and soybean during the growing seasons of 2020 and 2021. The rain-\nfall received\
    \ during 2021 (386  mm) was about two times the amount received in 2020 \n(178 mm).\
    \ The differences in crop yield were mainly observed between rainfed and irri-\n\
    gated methods in 2020 for both crops since 2020 was a dry year. The deficit level\
    \ per-\nformed adequately and had no yield reduction (not significantly different\
    \ with a 5% sig-\nnificance level) as compared to the full irrigation level. The\
    \ irrigation prescribed was \nminimum for the plant feedback method in majority\
    \ of crop-year combinations. With the \nexception of soybean in 2020, the ISSCADA\
    \ hybrid and SETMI methods significantly \nreduced irrigation applications for\
    \ both crops as compared with the common practice \nmethod while maintaining optimal\
    \ yield. In 2021, the common practice method (127 mm \nfor maize and 102 mm for\
    \ soybean) prescribed more than double the irrigation amount as \nwas prescribed\
    \ by the plant feedback method (59 mm for maize and 46 mm for soybean). \nThe\
    \ deficit level had the largest IWP for both crops in 2020 and 2021. The SETMI\
    \ model \nand ISSCADA system performed adequately by producing optimal yield while\
    \ reduc-\ning irrigation applications as compared with the common practice. The\
    \ newly developed \nthresholds for ISSCADA performed well by reducing irrigation\
    \ applications over the com-\nmon practice method in 2021 and producing optimal\
    \ yield. Future research could update \nthese thresholds with additional iCWSI\
    \ data and test these thresholds in additional growing \nseasons with more weather\
    \ variability.\nAcknowledgements The authors acknowledge the Irrigation Innovation\

    \ investigate the performance of the\ngeographic information (GIS) based irrigation\
    \ scheduling supervisory control and\ndata acquisition (ISSCADA) system as a tool\
    \ to manage deﬁcit irrigation scheduling\nfor cotton (Gossypim hirsutum L). Two\
    \ different irrigation scheduling methods\nautomated by the ISSCADA system — (1)\
    \ a plant feedback (designated C) - based\non integrated crop water stress index\
    \ (iCWSI) thresholds, and (2) a hybrid\n(designated H) method, created to combine\
    \ soil water depletion and the iCWSI\nthresholds, were compared with a benchmark\
    \ manual irrigation scheduling (M)\nthat used weekly neutron probe readings. Each\
    \ method applied irrigation at levels\ndesigned to be equivalent to 25%, 50% and\
    \ 75% replenishment of soil water\ndepletion to near ﬁeld capacity (designated\
    \ I25, I50 and I75) using the pre-\nestablished thresholds stored in the ISSCADA\
    \ system or the designated percent\nreplenishment of soil water depletion to ﬁeld\
    \ capacity in the M method. Fully\nirrigated and extremely deﬁcit irrigated plots\
    \ were also established. Relative to the\nfully irrigated plots, deﬁcit irrigated\
    \ plots at the I75 level for all irrigation scheduling\nmethods-maintained seed\
    \ cotton yield, while saving water. In 2021, the irrigation\nsavings was a minimum\
    \ of 20%, while in 2022, the minimum savings was 16%.\nComparing the performance\
    \ of deﬁcit irrigation scheduling between the ISSCADA\nsystem and the manual method\
    \ showed that crop response for all three methods\nwere statistically similar\
    \ at each irrigation level. Because the M method requires\nlabor intensive and\
    \ expensive use of the highly regulated neutron probe, the\nautomated decision\
    \ support provided by the ISSCADA system could simplify deﬁcit\nirrigation management\
    \ of cotton in a semi-arid region.\nKEYWORDS\ncrop water stress index (CWSI),\

    \ March 2023\nDOI 10.3389/fpls.2023.1149424\n1 Introduction\nMore than 508,000\
    \ ha were dedicated to cotton production in\nthe Texas North High Plains region\
    \ in 2019 (Hundl, 2020), where\nagricultural production accounts for greater than\
    \ 90% of total water\nuse. Water for this region is mainly sourced from the Ogallala\n\
    Aquifer, however, saturated thickness in this area is highly depleted,\nleading\
    \ to water allocation restrictions and ﬁelds with limited well\ncapacity (Scanlon\
    \ et al., 2012; Mitchell-McCallister et al., 2021).\nDue to the dwindling supply\
    \ of water, maximizing its value in this\nregion is critical, but not easy to\
    \ achieve due to high evaporative\ndemand, and climate variability. Since 1995,\
    \ acreage planted to\nupland cotton has increased by 21%, while area planted to\
    \ corn\n(maize) has remained stable in Texas (Hundl, 2020). Cotton can be\nan\
    \ appropriate choice of crop to maximize water productivity as it\nrequires less\
    \ water than maize and can be grown at\nevapotranspiration levels less than maximum\
    \ potential (Fereres\nand Soriano, 2007). It’s cultivation on farms with depleted\
    \ well\ncapacities could be a proﬁtable crop for farmers in the Texas High\nPlains\
    \ region (Fan et al., 2022). However, there are inherent risks\nwith cotton production\
    \ in this area and when using DI management\non any crop. The three main risks\
    \ are: 1) limited heat units in the\nspring and autumn seasons, 2) unpredictable\
    \ precipitation events -\nwhereby excessive rainfall late in the season can promote\
    \ extensive\nvegetative growth and slow boll maturation, while intense rainfall\n\
    and hail early in the season can decimate the crop, and 3) high\nevaporative demand\
    \ during the summer months and extended\nperiods of drought, which can signiﬁcantly\
    \ reduce lint yields\n(Tolk and Howell, 2010; Bordovsky, 2020; Lu et al., 2020).\
    \ When\npracticing DI, inadequate irrigation during the vegetative stage of\n\
    some cotton cultivars can reduce plant height, the number of nodes\nand the dry\
    \ weights of leaves and stems (Pace et al., 1999;\nPapastylianou and Argyrokastritis,\
    \ 2014). Deﬁcit irrigation can\nalso negatively impact seed cotton yields during\
    \ the reproductive\nstages by reducing ﬂowering and boll retention (Grimes et\
    \ al., 1969;\nGuinn and Mauney, 1984a; Guinn and Mauney, 1984b). Therefore,\n\
    farmers practicing DI strategies must closely assess evaporative\ndemand and crop\
    \ growth stage, while making timely irrigation\nscheduling decisions to prevent\
    \ signiﬁcant yield loss.\nPrecision irrigation technologies that use sensor feedback\
    \ can\nprovide automated decision support for irrigation scheduling\n(DSSIS) that\
    \ could be used to help farmers implement DI\nstrategies for cotton. Chen et al.\
    \ (2020) developed a DSSIS that\nused forecasted rainfall and a water stress index\
    \ simulated by the\nRoot Zone Quality Model to schedule irrigations. The system\n\
    improved lint yield and water productivity as compared with a\nsoil moisture sensor-based\
    \ irrigation scheduling method. Vellidis\net al. (2008) developed a wireless soil\
    \ water sensing system to\nprovide real-time site-speciﬁc irrigation scheduling\
    \ for cotton.\nAnother sensor-based irrigation scheduling system is the\nIrrigation\
    \ Scheduling Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition\n(ISSCADA) System patented\
    \ by Evett et al. (2014). The early\nISSCADA system triggered an irrigation for\
    \ plant feedback-\ncontrolled management zones (MZs) when the unique thermal\n\
    stress threshold for each of the three designated irrigation\ntreatments, 75%,\
    \ 50% and 25% of full, was exceeded. The\nirrigation depth applied was the same\
    \ for each treatment level.\nResults showed that the ISSCADA system produced lint\
    \ yields that\nwere similar or better than lint yields from manually irrigated\n\
    treatment plots, and irrigation water use efﬁciency was similar\nbetween irrigation\
    \ methods when compared at the same\nirrigation level (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2015).\
    \ In a recent study,\nVories et al. (2021) used a mature ISSCADA system embodied\
    \ in\nARSPivot for irrigation scheduling of cotton in a sub-humid\nclimate, and\
    \ compared the plant feedback method with the\nArkansas Irrigation Scheduler (AIS).\
    \ They reported that irrigation\nwater productivity (economic yield/unit of irrigation\
    \ applied) was\nsigniﬁcantly greater for cotton managed by the ISSCADA system\
    \ as\ncompared with the AIS method.\nIn the Texas High Plains region, most irrigated\
    \ acres are\nmanaged with sprinkler irrigation systems drawing from the\nOgallala\
    \ Aquifer (Colaizzi et al., 2009b). Providing deﬁcit\nirrigation scheduling strategies\
    \ for cotton producers in this region\nis critical to help sustain the regional\
    \ economy (Crouch et al., 2020).\nAlthough an early plant feedback method was\
    \ used to schedule\nirrigations for cotton in Bushland, Texas, the updated ISSCADA\n\
    system using plant feedback and the combination of plant feedback\nand soil water\
    \ sensing have not been tested on cotton in this region.\nThe objectives of this\
    \ study were to: 1) compare cumulative\nirrigation and crop response between deﬁcit\
    \ irrigated treatments,\nusing the ISSCADA and manual irrigation scheduling methods,\n\
    with fully irrigated treatment plots, and 2) compare cumulative\nirrigation amounts\
    \ and crop response of deﬁcit irrigated cotton\nbetween the manual and the ISSCADA-plant\
    \ feedback and\nISSCADA-hybrid irrigation scheduling methods. Performances\nwere\
    \ evaluated by comparing seed cotton yield, seasonal crop\nwater use (ETc), crop\
    \ water productivity (CWP) and irrigation\nwater use efﬁciency (IWUE).\n2 Materials\
    \ and methods\n2.1 Location and experimental design\nThe study was conducted at\
    \ the Conservation and Production\nResearch Laboratory (CPRL) in Bushland, Texas\
    \ (35° 10’2.42” N,\n102°5’32.5” W, elevation 1142 m). The site is in a semi-arid\
    \ region\nwith mean annual rainfall of approximately 400 mm, and variable\nrainfall\
    \ during the cropping season (May – September). The soils\nwere Pullman clay loam\
    \ ﬁne, superactive, mixed, thermic torretic\nPaleustoll, (Unger and Pringle, 1981).\
    \ The soil is slowly permeable\nwith a hard pan layer of calcium carbonate at\
    \ approximately 1.5 m\nand the plant-available water holding capacity to this\
    \ depth is\nroughly 210 mm (Evett et al., 2019). Mean bulk density ranges from\n\
    approximately 1. 4 to 1.7 Mg m-3 (Evett et al., 2022). The source of\nirrigation\
    \ water is the Ogallala Aquifer. Practicing deﬁcit irrigation\nin the surrounding\
    \ region is important as saturated thickness of the\naquifer in this region is\
    \ depleted between 7 to 15 m (Figure 1).\nO’Shaughnessy et al.\n10.3389/fpls.2023.1149424\n\
    Frontiers in Plant Science\nfrontiersin.org\n02\nCotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.),\
    \ variety Phytogen 210 W3FE,\nwas planted on June 4, 2021, day of year (DOY 155)\
    \ and on May 13,\n2022, (DOY 133) under one-half of a center pivot ﬁeld (10.5\
    \ ha) and\nirrigated with a six-span center pivot sprinkler system. The cotton\n\
    variety was an early maturing genotype. Critical growth stages\nfor the two years\
    \ were offset by the difference in planting\ndates (Table 1).\n2.2 Irrigation\
    \ sprinkler and\nsensor hardware\nThe center pivot irrigation system was a six-span\
    \ Valley 8000\nseries with a pivot lateral length of 286 m. The sprinkler was\n\
    equipped with a commercial zone control variable rate irrigation\n(VRI) hardware\
    \ package, a GPS unit at the end tower, and the\nIrrigation Supervisory Control\
    \ and Data Acquisition (ISSCADA)\nsystem, patented by ARS scientists (Evett et\
    \ al., 2014) and described\nin detail in Andrade et al. (2020). The irrigation\
    \ scheduling methods\nused by the ISSCADA system are summarized under “Irrigation\n\
    Scheduling Methods” later in this section.\nFor this study, two sprinkler zones\
    \ were combined to operate as\none control zone. Each control zone contained 12\
    \ drop hoses and\nmeasured a total of 18.3 m wide. Irrigation was applied using\
    \ low\nelevation spray application (LESA) with low-drift nozzles and\nmulti-trajectory\
    \ spray plate assemblies (3030 Series, 3NV, Nelson,\nWalla Walla, WA) elevated\
    \ approximately 0.46 m above the\nground. Irrigation buffers in the shape of pie-slices\
    \ were\nestablished at the beginning and end of each half of the cropped\nﬁeld\
    \ to ensure the VRI system had time to synchronize the\noperation of its zone-controlled\
    \ sprinkler banks at the start of an\nirrigation and to provide a cropped buffer\
    \ area for the\ntreatment plots.\nAn embedded rugged computer (model MXE-1401,\
    \ ADLINK\nTechnology, San Jose, CA) with a cellular modem was located at the\n\
    pivot point and connected to the control panel of the center pivot\nsprinkler\
    \ with an RS-232 cable. Also connected to the computer\nwere two radio modems-\
    \ the SAPIP coordinator (Dynamax, Inc.,\nHouston, TX), and a spread spectrum radio\
    \ (model RF-407, 900\nMHz, Campbell Scientiﬁc, Logan, UT). A total of 10 infrared\n\
    thermometers (IRTs) (model- SAPIP-IRT, Dynamax, Inc.,\nHouston, TX) were mounted\
    \ on the pivot lateral. Two pairs of\nIRTs were mounted on brackets near the borders\
    \ of each control\nzone and pointed towards the center of the zone. In addition,\
    \ one\nIRT was located in each of the M100 treatment plots. These data\nFIGURE\

    \ reference temperature curve to scale\ndata from the moving network of IRTs on\
    \ the pivot lateral. The\nIRTs measured object temperature, sensor body temperature,\
    \ and\nbattery voltage every 6 s. One-minute averaged data packets were\ntransmitted\
    \ to the computer at the pivot point. More details on the\nIRTs and the IRT network\
    \ communication protocol are found in\nO’Shaughnessy et al. (2011).\nA soil water\
    \ sensing station was located in each type of ISSCDA-\nhybrid treatment plot (H75,\
    \ H50 and H25) to provide input of soil\nwater depletion levels. The soil water\
    \ sensing stations were\nestablished as a distributed wireless sensor network,\
    \ where each\nstation contained a datalogger (CR300 with an internal RF-407\n\
    radio, Campbell Scientiﬁc, Logan, UT) and transmitted data hourly\nto the base\
    \ station RF-407 radio connected to the embedded\ncomputer at the pivot point.\
    \ Each datalogger was powered by a\nsealed lead acid battery that was recharged\
    \ with a 10-W solar panel.\nA trench was dug in a furrow and four soil water sensors,\
    \ time\ndomain reﬂectometers (TDRs), (model TDR-315L or 315H,\nAcclima, Meridian,\
    \ ID) were installed horizontally near the\ncotton plants at depths of 10 cm,\
    \ 20 cm, 30 cm, and 50 cm. Data\nfrom the TDRs were acquired every 1-minute, averaged\
    \ every 15-\nminutes. Each soil water sensing station was within 1 m of the\n\
    neutron access tube installed in the treatment plot.\nA standalone weather station\
    \ was located nearby the center\npivot ﬁeld. Air temperature, relative humidity,\
    \ solar irradiation,\nwind speed and wind direction were collected with the base-\n\
    station datalogger (CR1000X, Campbell Scientiﬁc, Logan, UT).\nAll micrometeorological\
    \ data were measured every 5 s, averaged\nevery 1-minute and transmitted hourly\
    \ to the computer at the\npivot point. The embedded computer was accessed in the\
    \ ofﬁce\nthrough the cellular connection using the ‘Remote Desktop’\napplication.\
    \ Accessing the embedded computer allowed for\nmonitoring data collection, reviewing\
    \ and uploading\nprescription maps and starting an irrigation or scan (running\n\
    the sprinkler dry across the ﬁeld). All center pivot operations\nwere conducted\
    \ with the ARSPivot software, which resided on the\nembedded computer.\n2.3 Agronomics\n\
    Fertilizer was applied using a knife rig to meet a yield goal of\n682 kg ha-1\
    \ of cotton based on test results from composite soil\nsamples taken in March\
    \ of 2021 and 2022 from the W-SW and N-\nNE halves of the ﬁeld, respectively (Table\
    \ 1). Test results were from\na commercial soil testing laboratory. Pre-plant\
    \ irrigations were\napplied to help enable germination. Two pre-plant irrigations\n\
    were applied in 2021 in late April, and four pre-plant irrigations\nwere applied\
    \ in 2022 due to a dry winter and spring season. Each\nirrigation event was 25\
    \ mm. In both years, cotton was planted at a\nrate of 21 seeds m-2 and 2.5 cm\
    \ deep in circular rows spaced 0.76 m\napart using a GPS guided planter. The W-SW\
    \ half of the center\npivot ﬁeld was cropped in 2021, while in 2022, the N-NE\
    \ half of the\nﬁeld was cropped; in both years, planting was on ground fallowed\
    \ in\nthe previous season. Post-plant herbicides were applied to control\nweeds,\
    \ mainly pigweed (Amaranthus spp.) and Devil’s Claw\n(Harpagophytum spp.). The\
    \ pesticide, Govern 4E, was applied to\navert extensive damage from thrips (Thysanoptera)\
    \ (Table 1).\nFor each growing season, the ﬁeld was divided into 44 treatment\n\
    plots (MZs), where each treatment- M100, M75, M50, M25, M0, H75,\nH50, H25, C75,\
    \ C50 and C25 was replicated four times and arranged in\na complete randomized\
    \ design (Figure 2). The labels “M”, “H”, and\n“C” designate the irrigation scheduling\
    \ methods- manual (M), the\nISSCADA-hybrid (H), and the ISSCADA-plant feedback\
    \ I system,\nrespectively. The numeric values designate the irrigation treatment\n\
    level, I100, I75, I50, and I25. The length of each plot varied depending\non the\
    \ radial distance of the control zone from the pivot point. The\nwidth of each\
    \ plot was 18.2 m and plot lengths varied from 32.0 m\nto 57.3 m at half width,\
    \ depending on their distance from the pivot\npoint. A neutron access tube was\
    \ installed near the center of each\nplot to a depth of 3.0 m. Plant height and\
    \ width measurements were\nrecorded starting in the second week of July and continued\
    \ biweekly\nthrough the last week in August. All agronomic measurements and\n\
    hand-harvested samples were taken in each treatment plot from a\n10 m2 area (4\
    \ rows x 328 cm) centered around the access tube.\n2.4 Irrigation scheduling methods\n\
    2.4.1 Manual\nFor the treatment plots designated under manual control,\nirrigation\
    \ was applied to replenish a percentage of soil water\ndepletion to near ﬁeld\
    \ capacity (96% of full in the top 1.5 m of\nthe soil proﬁle). The irrigation\
    \ amount was determined by\naveraging weekly neutron probe measurements in the\
    \ fully\nirrigated treatment plots, designated M100. Irrigation was\nreplenished\
    \ at 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of soil water depletion\nto ﬁeld capacity in the top\
    \ 150 cm of the soil proﬁle for treatment\nFIGURE 2\nPlot plan for the two-year\
    \ cotton study- the W-SW half of ﬁeld was\ncropped from 310° to 140° in 2021,\
    \ and the N-NE half of ﬁeld was\ncropped from 130°-316° for the 2022 growing season.\n\

    \ effective\nrooting depth of cotton was assumed to be 150 cm due to the\nexisting\
    \ hard pan layer at this depth. Treatment plots where\nirrigation was withheld\
    \ after the plant stand was established were\ndesignated M0. The neutron probe\
    \ (NP) (model 503DR, InstroTek\nInc., formerly Campbell Paciﬁc Nuclear, Concord,\
    \ Calif., USA)\nreadings were taken weekly in the M100 treatment plots and\naveraged\
    \ to determine the amount to irrigate the treatment plots\nunder manual control.\
    \ The NP was ﬁeld calibrated in 2021 to an\naccuracy better than 0.01 m3 m-3,\
    \ resulting in separate calibrations\nfor the three distinct soil horizons (Ap,\
    \ Bt, and Btk) (Evett et al.,\n2022). Readings were taken from 10 to 230 cm depths\
    \ in 20-cm\nincrements using the method described in Evett (2008). Neutron\nprobe\
    \ measurements were also used to calculate seasonal crop water\nuse (ETc) for\
    \ all treatment plots based on the soil water balance.\nTherefore, NP measurements\
    \ were taken when access tubes were\ninstalled (July1, 2021 and July 13, 2022),\
    \ at harvest for all treatment\nplots, and every 30 days in those treatment plots\
    \ receiving less than\nfull irrigation.\n2.4.2 ISSCADA scheduling methods\n2.4.2.1\
    \ Plant feedback\nThis irrigation scheduling method uses data from the reference\n\
    temperature curve discussed in Peters and Evett (2004) to scale\ncanopy temperature\
    \ data from one-time-of-day measurements\nmade from the moving network of IRTs\
    \ on the center pivot\nlateral. Scaling the one-time-of-day temperature measurements\n\
    provided one-minute estimates of diurnal canopy temperature\ndata. This one-minute\
    \ data (from 0900 hrs to 1900 hrs) was\nmatched by time stamp with the collected\
    \ micrometeorological\ndata from the nearby weather station to calculate a theoretical\
    \ crop\nwater stress index (CWSI), where the meteorological data were used\nto\
    \ estimate the upper and lower limits of the stress index (Jackson\net al., 1981).\
    \ The integration of the daily one-minute CWSI values is\ncharacterized in equation\
    \ 1:\niCWSI =  \n∫\n19 : 00\n09 : 00½ (Ts −   Ta) − (Tll)\n(Tul) − (Tll) \x02\
    \   dt\n(1)\nwhere Ts [°C] was the scaled canopy temperature, Ta [°C] was the\n\
    air temperature, both measured at time t, while Tll represented the\nlower limit\
    \ temperature (temperature of a well-watered plant\ncanopy), and Tul represented\
    \ the upper limit temperature\n(temperature of a completely water-stressed plant\
    \ canopy).\nPre-established iCWSI thresholds were entered into ARSPivot\nsoftware\
    \ at the beginning of the irrigation season and were based on\nhistorical data\
    \ (O’Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010; O’Shaughnessy\net al., 2015). Irrigations were\
    \ triggered when the calculated iCWSI\nfor a speciﬁc MZ (treatment plot designated\
    \ with a “C”) exceeded\none of three tiers (Table 2). The irrigation depth applied\
    \ was\ndependent on the tier that included the calculated iCWSI.\n2.4.2.2 Hybrid\n\
    One soil water sensing station was deployed in each of three\nplots- 5, 8 and\
    \ 19 in 2021 and plots 25, 37, and 19 in 2022, providing\ninput for replications\
    \ designated H75, H50, and H25, respectively.\nIrrigations were triggered for\
    \ each treatment replicate using the\ncombination of soil water depletion (SWD)\
    \ and iCWSI thresholds\nfor the designated treatment level. As an example, in\
    \ 2021,\nirrigation scheduling for all plots designated H75 (plots 5, 14, 25\n\
    and 34) used input from the soil water sensor located in plot 5 and\nan iCWSI\
    \ calculated over all four plots for decision support. Total\nSWD was calculated\
    \ as the summation of soil water depleted from\neach layer of soil sensed by the\
    \ four TDRs, equation 2:\nSWD =  o 4\ni=1lið qFCi −   qvi\nqFCi − qPWPiÞ\n(2)\n\
    li was the thickness of the soil layer i, qFCiwas ﬁeld capacity of\nlayer i, qvwas\
    \ volumetric soil water content of layer i, and qPWPi was\npermanent wilting point\
    \ for layer l. Since most of the water\nextracted by cotton is in the top 40 cm\
    \ (Pabuayon et al., 2019),\nthe TDRs were installed at depths of 10, 20, 30 and\
    \ 50 cm for which\nﬁeld capacity was set to 0.35, 0.34, 0.33 and 0.33 m3 m-3,\n\
    respectively. Permanent wilting point was set to 0.18 m3 m-3 for\neach layer based\
    \ on information from Unger (1996); Schwartz et al.\n(2003); Heng et al. (2009),\
    \ and Tolk and Evett (2012). If SWD ≤\n0.10 then irrigation was withheld; if SWD\
    \ ≥ 0.65, fraction of\ndepletion for cotton (Allen et al., 1998), then the maximum\n\
    irrigation depth for the designated treatment level was applied\n(Table 2). However,\
    \ if the 0.10< SWD< 0.65, then irrigation was\napplied according to the iCWSI\
    \ thresholds for the designated\ntreatment level (Table 2). If no soil water readings\
    \ were available\n(e.g., sensor or communication failure), the ISSCADA system\
    \ relied\non the iCWSI thresholds for irrigation scheduling.\nVariable rate irrigation\
    \ was initiated on Jul 8, 2021, and on Jul\n15, 2022, by running a scan (action\
    \ whereby the sprinkler travels\nacross the ﬁeld without irrigating) using the\
    \ ISSCADA system. The\nfollowing day, the ISSCADA system built a prescription\
    \ map.\nThereafter, a scan was run every 3 to 4 days during a seven-day\nperiod.\
    \ Figure 3 summarizes the irrigation scheduling algorithms\noperated by the ISSCADA\
    \ system and presents an example of an\niCWSI map with qualitative SWD information\
    \ from soil water\nsensing stations located in “H” designated plots- plot 5 (H75),\
    \ plot 8\n(H50), and plot 19 (H25). The yellow-colored square symbols\nindicated\
    \ that the soil water depletion levels were between the\nminimum and maximum SWD\
    \ thresholds. In this example, the\nprescription map was built automatically after\
    \ midnight on Aug 10,\n2021, after a scan was executed on Aug 9, 2021.\n2.5 Calculations\n\
    Heat units (HU, °C) were calculated to characterize the growing\nenvironment for\
    \ cotton using equation 3:\nHU =   (Tmax −   Tmin)\n2\n− Tb\n(3)\nwhere Tmax,\
    \ Tmin are the maximum and minimum daily air\ntemperature, respectively and 15.6°C\
    \ was used as the base\ntemperature (Tb), typical for the study region (Mahan\
    \ et al., 2014;\nMasasi et al., 2020).\nO’Shaughnessy et al.\n10.3389/fpls.2023.1149424\n\
    Frontiers in Plant Science\nfrontiersin.org\n05\nSeasonal evapotranspiration (ETc)\
    \ was calculated for the\ngrowing season using the soil water balance equation\
    \ 4:\nETc = I + P + F −   DS − R\n(4)\nwhere I was cumulative irrigation, P was\
    \ seasonal precipitation, DS was\nthe change in soil water content from the ﬁrst\
    \ to the last NP measurement\nto a depth of 2.3 m, F was ﬂux across the lower\
    \ boundary of the control\nvolume, and R was runoff, all units were in mm. Values\
    \ of F were\nassumed to be zero as NP measurements did not indicate a change in\
    \ ﬂux\nin soil water content below 170 cm (data not shown).\n2.5.1 Irrigation\

    \ irrigation on cotton response was evaluated by\nANOVA using PROC GLM (SAS version\
    \ 9.4, Carry, NC). Signiﬁcant\ndifferences between means of the deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ method by irrigation\nlevel treatments were compared individually with those\
    \ of the fully\nirrigated treatments (M100) using Dunnett’s t Test (Carmer and\
    \ Walker,\n1985; Lee and Lee, 2018). Effects of main treatments (irrigation level\n\
    and irrigation scheduling method) and their interaction on cumulative\nirrigation\
    \ and crop response were analyzed using PROC GLM (SAS\nversion 9.4, Carry, NC)\
    \ with the least squares means method, and\nadjusted for multiple comparisons\
    \ using the Tukey HSD test.\n3 Results\n3.1 Climate and postplant irrigations\n\
    Cumulative precipitation amounts from May through October\nof each year were 305\
    \ mm and 326 mm for the 2021 and 2022\ngrowing seasons, respectively (Table 3).\
    \ However, the pattern of\nrainfall was signiﬁcantly different between the two\
    \ years. Rainfall\nfrom January through May of 2021 totaled 145 mm. The total\n\
    rainfall in May occurred prior to planting, thereafter, measurable\nrainfall occurred\
    \ approximately every 14 days. Monthly cumulative\nprecipitation for August and\
    \ September were smaller than the\naverage values for these months. In 2022, total\
    \ precipitation from\nJanuary through the ﬁrst half of May was less than 32 mm.\
    \ While\nprecipitation in this second growing season was greater than 2021,\n\
    approximately 42% occurred on July 29 and July 30. Outside of\nthese two events,\
    \ 86% of all rainfall events for the season were\nrecorded to be less than 10\
    \ mm. Except for the month of July,\nmonthly cumulative precipitation was smaller\
    \ than the 58-year\naverage precipitation amounts for the study location\n(O’Shaughnessy\
    \ et al., 2014). Preplant precipitation in 2021\nprovided adequate moisture in\
    \ the soil proﬁle, avoiding excessive\npostplant irrigations. However, the relatively\
    \ cool air temperatures\nin June and July slowed crop maturation. Even so, the\
    \ overall\nlimited precipitation during the growing season aided the ISSCADA\n\
    system in detecting different levels of crop water stress. In 2022, the\npaucity\
    \ of precipitation in the winter and spring required postplant\nirrigations to\
    \ germinate and establish a uniform stand.\nPostplant irrigations were applied\
    \ to establish a uniform stand;\nthese irrigations totaled 38 mm and 95 mm in\
    \ 2021 and 2022,\nrespectively (Table 4). The uniform postplant irrigations were\n\
    greater in 2022 for two reasons- drought conditions prevailed in\nthe winter and\
    \ spring months of 2022, and secondly, the VFD for\nthe center pivot pump failed\
    \ in early June (after planting), and two\nuniform irrigations were applied prior\
    \ to replacing the equipment\nto assure adequate soil moisture during the down\
    \ time. Irrigations\nwere terminated in the treatment plots designated M0, when\
    \ VRI\napplications were initiated on July 10, 2021, and July 15, 2022. Soil\n\
    water sensing stations were deployed on July 7, 2021, and July 12,\n2022, in the\
    \ appropriate ISSCADA-hybrid treatment plots.\nPlant height is a good indicator\
    \ for vegetative cotton growth\n(Ritchie et al., 2010; Zhou and Yin, 2014). Throughout\
    \ the growing\nseason, mean plant heights in 2021 were closely clustered among\n\
    irrigation levels for the manual and ISSCADA-hybrid irrigation\nscheduling treatment\
    \ plots until the end of the irrigation season.\nThe increase in plant heights\
    \ at the end of the season could have\nresulted from the last two irrigations\
    \ at the end of the season (Figure\nSM-1). Plant heights in the ISSCADA-plant\
    \ feedback method\nshowed distinct heights among irrigation levels beginning Aug\
    \ 12\nTABLE 2 Tiers of integrated CWSI (iCWSI) thresholds and irrigation depths\

    compared with fully and extreme deﬁcit\ntreatment plots\nThe M100 and M0 treatment\
    \ plots were established as control\ntreatments for determining maximum irrigation\
    \ amounts and\nevaluating IWUE, respectively. Individual comparisons of mean\n\
    cumulative irrigation and mean crop response of seed cotton yield\nand IWUE were\
    \ made between the M100 control treatment\n(Table 4) and means from each type\
    \ of deﬁcit irrigation level X\nirrigation scheduling treatment. Due to differences\
    \ in climatic\nconditions, data were analyzed separately by year. Of interest\n\
    when comparing mean differences were reductions and overages\nin irrigation applied,\
    \ gains and losses in seed cotton yield, and\nimprovements in IWUE. In 2021, the\
    \ comparisons showed that\nmean cumulative irrigations in the deﬁcit irrigated\
    \ treatments were\nsigniﬁcantly less as compared with the M100 treatment, yet\
    \ mean\nseed cotton yields were not signiﬁcantly different at p< 0.05. This\n\
    indicated that no signiﬁcant yield loss had occurred between any of\nthe deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation treatments and the fully irrigated treatment.\nMean IWUE values were\
    \ numerically greater in all the deﬁcit\nirrigated treatments, but not signiﬁcantly\
    \ different from the M100\ntreatment (at p< 0.05). In 2022, mean cumulative irrigations\
    \ for the\ndeﬁcit irrigated treatment plots were again signiﬁcantly less than\
    \ the\nmean for the M100 treatment. Mean seed cotton yields were\nstatistically\
    \ similar as compared with the M100 treatment,\nhowever, mean yields were not\
    \ sustained in the M25, C50, C25,\nH50 and H25 treatments. Mean IWUE values were\
    \ not signiﬁcantly\ndifferent from the M100 treatment, though IWUE means were\n\
    numerically greater in all I75 irrigation level by irrigation\nscheduling treatments.\
    \ The mean seed cotton yield in the M0\ntreatment was only 11% less than that\
    \ in the M100 treatment and\nwas relatively large, due to the seed cotton yield\
    \ measured in plot 1,\nwhich was at the 90th quantile of the distribution of harvested\
    \ values\nwithin the M0 treatment. Removing this value as an outlier,\nincreased\
    \ mean IWUE values for all treatments, although the\nadjusted differences were\
    \ not signiﬁcantly different compared\nwith the M100 treatment. Means in Tables\
    \ 4–6 include all\nmeasured values.\n3.3 Crop response compared between\nirrigation\
    \ level and method\nPairwise means were compared to investigate differences between\n\
    irrigation level, irrigation method and their interaction at the I75, I50\nand\
    \ I25 levels. Data were analyzed separately for each growing season.\nIn 2021,\
    \ when data were grouped by irrigation level, cumulative\nirrigation amounts and\
    \ ETc were signiﬁcantly different across the\nthree irrigation levels (Table 5).\
    \ Overall seed cotton yield was\nsigniﬁcantly less in the I25 treatment level.\
    \ Mean IWUE was not\nsigniﬁcantly different among irrigation levels. Grouping\
    \ the data by\nirrigation scheduling method demonstrated that scheduling methods\n\
    had a signiﬁcant impact on cumulative irrigation amount and ETc in\nthe ISSCADA-plant\
    \ feedback treatment plots, resulting in signiﬁcantly\nless water applied to and\
    \ signiﬁcantly smaller ETc values in these plots\n(Table 5). However, mean seed\
    \ cotton yield, CWP and IWUE were\nstatistically identical among scheduling methods.\n\
    Analyzing all sets of pairwise means for irrigation level by\nirrigation scheduling\
    \ method indicated that mean cumulative\nTABLE 3 Monthly precipitation and mean\

    \ the M75 and H75 treatments. At the I50 and I25\nlevels, mean cumulative irrigations\
    \ were similar among irrigation\nscheduling methods. Mean differences in ETc response\
    \ followed the\nsame statistical trend as differences in cumulative irrigation.\
    \ Mean\nseed cotton yields were only signiﬁcantly greater between the M75\ntreatment\
    \ and all irrigation scheduling methods at the I25 level.\nMean values of CWP\
    \ and IWUE were not statistically different\namong all irrigation level X irrigation\

    \ when data\nwere grouped by irrigation level, overall mean cumulative irrigation\n\
    and ETc values were signiﬁcantly different. However, overall mean\nseed cotton\
    \ yield, CWP and IWUE were not affected by irrigation\nlevel (Table 6). Aggregating\
    \ data by irrigation scheduling method\nshowed that mean cumulative irrigations\
    \ applied to the ISSCADA-\nhybrid treatment plots were less compared with the\

    \ where ETc values for the M25\nand H25 treatments were signiﬁcantly less than\
    \ all irrigation\nscheduling methods at the I75 level (Table 6).\n4 Discussion\n\
    The performance of a GIS-based ISSCADA system was\ninvestigated to determine its\
    \ feasibility as an automated deﬁcit\nirrigation scheduling tool for cotton grown\
    \ in a semi-arid region.\nCrop response- mean seed cotton yield, ETc, CWP and\
    \ IWUE\nresulting from the two ISSCADA irrigation scheduling methods were\ncompared\
    \ with those from fully irrigated (M100) treatment plots.\nPerformance of the\
    \ two different ISSCADA irrigation scheduling\nmethods (the plant feedback and\
    \ hybrid) at irrigation levels of I75,\nI50 and I25 of full were also compared\
    \ with a manual irrigation\nscheduling method using weekly NP readings. The latter\
    \ comparison\nwas made to investigate whether the ISSCADA system could perform\n\
    similar or better than the accurate manual method of irrigation\nscheduling with\
    \ a neutron probe (Gear et al., 1977), and to evaluate\nany advantage in using\
    \ soil water sensing with the ISSCADA system.\nIn 2021, climatic evaporative demand\
    \ in May and June were\nrelatively low due to lower maximum daily air temperatures\n\
    throughout May and rainfall in both months. Although only 4%\nless precipitation\
    \ occurred in the 2021 growing season compared with\nthe 2022 growing season,\
    \ the patterns of rainfall were distinctly\ndifferent. The large postplant irrigations\
    \ and the intensive rainfall\nevent in the 2022 growing season reduced IWUE and\
    \ obscured the\neffects of irrigation treatments as compared with values from\
    \ the 2021\ngrowing season. However, since 67% of variable rate applications\n\
    occurred prior to the intensive rainfall event and because physiological\ndifferences\
    \ in plant growth were measurable just prior to this extreme\nevent, it was valid\
    \ to compare performance of the irrigation scheduling\nmethods in both seasons.\
    \ Moreover, in both years, it should be noted\nthat cumulative irrigations were\
    \ not signiﬁcantly greater for the\nISSCADA scheduling methods as compared with\
    \ the manual\nmethod at any irrigation level. The analysis from the two-year study\n\
    demonstrated that in both years, deﬁcit irrigation at the I75 level by the\nFIGURE\
    \ 4\nMean plant heights and growth stage observations for the 2021 growing season\
    \ (left); and the 2022 growing season (right), for the manual (M),\nISSCADA-plant\
    \ feedback (C), and the ISSCADA-hybrid (H) method.\nO’Shaughnessy et al.\n10.3389/fpls.2023.1149424\n\

    \ irrigation-scheduling methods-\nmaintained seed cotton yields that were similar\
    \ compared with that of\nthe fully irrigated treatment plots, while achieving\
    \ signiﬁcant water\nsavings. Mean cumulative irrigations applied in 2021 were\
    \ 24%, 39%\nand 22% less in the M75, C75 and H75 treatments, respectively,\ncompared\
    \ with the M100 treatment. At the I50 level, mean\ncumulative irrigations were\
    \ 48%, 51% and 47% less compared with\nthe M100 treatment. However, mean seed\
    \ cotton yields for the M and\nC irrigation scheduling methods were less than\
    \ the M100 treatment,\nindicating that at this lesser irrigation level, seed cotton\
    \ yields could be\npenalized. Similarly, in 2022, the reduction in cumulative\
    \ irrigation\ncompared with the M100 treatment was 16%, 18% and 20% for the\n\
    M75, C75, and H75 treatments, respectively. The reduction in seed\ncotton yield\
    \ in the M100 treatment was not unexpected as some studies\nhave shown that full\
    \ irrigation or large amounts of untimely\nprecipitation result in a decline of\
    \ seed cotton yield (Wanjura et al.,\n2002; O’Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010; Sampathkumar\
    \ et al., 2013).\nSeed cotton yields at the fully irrigated and deﬁcit irrigated\
    \ levels\nfrom this study were consistent with yields from those reported by\n\
    Bordovsky and Porter (2008) in Halfway, Texas, and at the CPRL by\nColaizzi et\
    \ al. (2009a) and O’Shaughnessy et al. (2015) after adjusting\nyields for seed\
    \ weight. In this study, results at each deﬁcit irrigation\nlevel for this study\
    \ demonstrated that the ISSCADA irrigation\nmethods performed in a manner similar\
    \ with the manual irrigation\nscheduling method. This result was positive since\
    \ the ISSCADA\nmethods provided automated decision support, while the manual\n\
    method was time consuming, required labor intensive use of an\nexpensive and highly\
    \ regulated neutron probe, and calculations to\nreplenish crop water use to an\
    \ established setpoint. The ISSCADA-\nplant feedback and ISSCADA-hybrid methods\
    \ also performed in a\nsimilar manner to one another. This suggested that the\
    \ ISSCADA-\nplant feedback method alone could be used to manage deﬁcit\nirrigation\
    \ scheduling at mild, moderate, and extreme deﬁcit\nirrigation levels for cotton\
    \ production in a semi-arid environment.\nWhile using the ISSCADA system unaccompanied\
    \ by soil water\nsensors would save the cost and effort of installing soil water\
    \ sensing\ninstrumentation, it is, however, it is beneﬁcial to include a second\n\
    method of sensor feedback for redundancy. Soil water sensors can\nindicate the\
    \ need for irrigation during periods of extended cloud\ncover when the ISSCADA-plant\
    \ feedback method will not provide a\ntrigger. Use of the TDRs with the ISSCADA\
    \ system could replace NP\nreadings for the purpose of practicing deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ management.\nIt is possible that the ISSCADA irrigation scheduling methods\n\
    could be improved to increase CWP or IWUE by managing deﬁcit\nirrigation according\
    \ to crop growth stage (Bordovsky et al., 2015).\nFuture studies could include\
    \ the use of different types of plant\nTABLE 5 Mean and standard deviation values\

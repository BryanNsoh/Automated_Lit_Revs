    \ success in health care, smart city,\nindustrial production and so on. Protected\
    \ agriculture is one of the ﬁelds which has broad application\nprospects of IoT.\
    \ Protected agriculture is a mode of highly eﬃcient development of modern agriculture\n\
    that uses artiﬁcial techniques to change climatic factors such as temperature,\
    \ to create environmental\nconditions suitable for the growth of animals and plants.\
    \ This review aims to gain insight into\nthe state-of-the-art of IoT applications\
    \ in protected agriculture and to identify the system structure\nand key technologies.\
    \ Therefore, we completed a systematic literature review of IoT research\nand\
    \ deployments in protected agriculture over the past 10 years and evaluated the\
    \ contributions\nmade by diﬀerent academicians and organizations. Selected references\
    \ were clustered into three\napplication domains corresponding to plant management,\
    \ animal farming and food/agricultural\nproduct supply traceability. Furthermore,\
    \ we discussed the challenges along with future research\nprospects, to help new\
    \ researchers of this domain understand the current research progress of IoT in\n\
    protected agriculture and to propose more novel and innovative ideas in the future.\n\
    Keywords: Internet of things; protected agriculture; integrated application; state-of-the-art\n\
    1. Introduction\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) was ﬁrst developed in 1999 by the\
    \ network radio frequency\nidentiﬁcation (RFID) system proposed by the Massachusetts\
    \ Institute of Technology (MIT) Auto-ID\nLabs [1]. With the application and development\
    \ of new information technologies, the connotation\nand extension of IoT have\
    \ undergone major changes [2]. IoT can be deﬁned as a huge internet-based\nnetwork\
    \ connecting physical and virtual “things” with standard and interoperable communication\n\
    protocols. To be speciﬁc, everything, such as a sensor and an actuator possessing\
    \ unique identity\nand attribute, exchange messages and communicate with each\
    \ other to realize intelligent positioning,\ntracking, identiﬁcation, perception,\
    \ monitoring and management via kinds of networks anytime and\nanywhere [3]. IoT\
    \ has penetrated pervasively most aspects of human life everywhere such as health\n\
    care, smart home, smart city, industrial control and so on. Agriculture is an\
    \ ideal candidate for the\ndeployment of IoT solutions because it occurs in wide\
    \ areas that need to be continuously monitored\nand controlled [4,5].\nThe concept\
    \ of protected agriculture is relative to open-ﬁeld agriculture. It uses artiﬁcial\
    \ techniques\nto change climatic factors such as natural light, temperature and\
    \ humidity to create environmental\nconditions suitable for the growth of animals\
    \ and plants, enabling them to grow around the clock.\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833;\
    \ doi:10.3390/s19081833\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n\
    2 of 24\nThe environment of protected agriculture is completely or largely artiﬁcially\
    \ controlled andwhich has\nbroken the limits of climate and land conditions for\
    \ the growth of animals and plants to a certain extent.\nSo it is also called\
    \ controllable agriculture. Compared with open-ﬁeld agriculture, protected agriculture\n\
    has more potential to apply IoT technology, because it is less aﬀected by climatic\
    \ and geographical\nfactors. Some mature IoT solutions in other ﬁelds can be transferred\
    \ directly to protected agriculture [6].\nWith the development of agricultural\
    \ sensor, wireless communication, cloud computing,\nmachine learning and Big Data\
    \ technologies, IoT technology has emerged and is gradually being\npromoted and\
    \ applied in the protected agriculture ﬁeld [7–9]. It is playing an important\
    \ role in various\nareas of protected agriculture as it is capable of helping\
    \ farmers monitor soil condition, climate change\nand animal and plant health\
    \ [10]. When the environmental factor change beyond the set threshold,\nIoT will\
    \ automatically send a warning message to the administrator to remove the hidden\
    \ danger.\nIt can also control environmental factors such as temperature, humidity,\
    \ carbon dioxide concentration\nand illumination according to the condition of\
    \ crop growth in real time [11,12]. In addition, cameras in\nthe IoT system are\
    \ able to capture crop diseases and insect pests in the greenhouse in real time,\n\
    helping farmers ﬁnd problems and take targeted preventive measures [13]. Through\
    \ GPS, RFID and\nother location-based sensors, goods such as vegetables can be\
    \ tracked and monitored visually during\ntransportation and storage. Supermarket\
    \ managers use smart phone or PC to monitor and predict\nproduct status and the\
    \ demand for getting product on shelves. At the user or consumer end, people can\n\
    query the variety, origin, processing and other farm product information by means\
    \ of the QR code,\nbarcode, etc. IoT for protected agriculture can help create\
    \ an informed, connected, developed and\nadaptable rural community. Low-cost embedded\
    \ devices can improve the interaction between humans\nand the physical world.\
    \ Cloud computing, edge computing, and Big Data can provide valuable analysis\n\
    and support for decisions. In summary, IoT will become an important tool in the\
    \ next few years to\nengage people in embedded agriculture which includes suppliers,\
    \ farmers, technicians, distributors,\nmerchants, consumers and government representatives\
    \ [14,15].\nOn the basis of the potential of IoT applications in protected agriculture\
    \ described in the previous\nparagraphs, this paper aims to identify the current\
    \ state of solutions in these ﬁelds. The IoT fundamental\nstructure in protected\
    \ agriculture is introduced in detail based on agricultural sensors, wireless\
    \ sensor\nnetworks, cloud computing, edge clouding and machine learning technologies.\
    \ The application of IoT\nin protected agriculture and how it makes contributions\
    \ is displayed. Furthermore, the open issues,\nchallenges, future opportunities\
    \ and development trends are discussed.\nIn this article, a comprehensive and\
    \ profound review of IoT in protected agriculture has been\nexecuted based on\
    \ a survey of real-world deployments and published papers over the past 10 years.\n\
    Firstly, a keyword-based search for conference papers and articles was performed\
    \ mainly from the\nscientiﬁc databases IEEE Xplore, Science Direct and ACM Digital\
    \ as well as from Google Scholar.\nFor search keywords, we used the following\
    \ query: “Internet of Things” and either “greenhouse”\nor “livestock” or “aquaculture“\
    \ or “agriculture“. Then, we ﬁltered out papers referring to IoT but\nnot applied\
    \ to the protected agricultural domain. Finally, we checked these papers selected\
    \ from the\nprevious step and picked out the ﬁnal papers according to the problem\
    \ they addressed, the solution\nproposed, impact achieved (if measurable), tools,\
    \ systems and algorithms used.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows.\
    \ Section 2 presents the structure of IoT in protected\nagriculture. The key technologies\
    \ of IoT in protected agriculture are introduced in Section 3. The three\nimportant\
    \ applications in protected agriculture are summed up in Section 4. We further\
    \ discussed\nthe challenges to be faced and the problems that need to be solved\
    \ for IoT in protected agriculture as\nwell as a few future development directions\
    \ in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 outlines the conclusions of\nthis paper.\n\

    2.1. Simple Review of Previous IoT Structure\nAt present, there is no uniﬁed opinion\
    \ on the structure of IoT. The composition of IoT can be\ndivided into three parts:\
    \ object end, cloud end and network end. Smart items, smart devices and\nlocal\
    \ intelligent systems interact directly with the physical world to form the “object\
    \ end” of IoT\n(also known as “front end”). The cloud computing platform that\
    \ provides computing, storage and\nother resources performs fusion processing\
    \ and intelligent analysis of the sensing data from the object\nend and performs\
    \ execution control to constitute the “cloud end” (also referred to as “back end”)\
    \ of\nIoT. The communication infrastructure of the connection object end and the\
    \ cloud end constitutes the\n“network end” of IoT. According to the diﬀerent functions\
    \ implemented by physical entity services\nin the IoT, IoT architecture established\
    \ by the current service-oriented approach can be divided into\nthe following\
    \ two categories: cloud-centric IoT architecture and object-centric IoT architecture.\
    \ In the\ncloud-centric IoT application system, the physical entity service implements\
    \ basic physical information\ncollection, local information processing and transmission\
    \ of information to the cloud, but does not\nprovide a directly accessible service\
    \ interface. Mass storage, relational processing and knowledge\nmining of physical\
    \ information are all implemented in the cloud. One of their typical representatives\n\
    is uID IoT architecture, which is an IoT architecture developed by the uID center\
    \ of the nonproﬁt\nstandardization organization initiated by the university of\
    \ Tokyo, Japan. As shown in Figure 1,\nits architecture consisted of ucode tags\
    \ such as RFID, bar codes, RF and IR beacons, user terminals,\na ucode resolution\
    \ server and application information servers [16]. For software developers, the\
    \ main\nchallenge in building such systems is how to build a back-end cloud service\
    \ platform that supports\nmassive item information management and data processing.\
    \ The cloud platforms that have been\nestablished so far mainly include Xively\
    \ and Aneka [17].\nSensors 2018, 18, x FOR PEER REVIEW  \n3 of 25 \n \n2. The\

    \ \n2.2. Structure of IoT in Protected Agriculture \nBased on the actual situation\
    \ of protected agriculture and the experience of other scholars, we \nproposed\
    \ a five-layer IoT architecture [22]. As shown in Figure 5, these layers are briefly\
    \ described \nbelow: \n(1). Perception layer: This layer consists of various sensors,\
    \ terminal devices, agricultural \nmachinery, wireless sensor network (WSN), RFID\
    \ tags andreaders, etc. The common sensors \nare environmental sensors, animal\
    \ and plant life information sensors and other sensors related \nto agriculture.\
    \ Through these sensors, information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed,\
    \ \nplant diseases, insect pests and animal vital signs can be obtained. The collected\
    \ information is \nsimply processed by the embedded device and uploaded to a higher\
    \ layer through the \nnetwork layer for further processing and analysis. \n(2).\
    \ Network layer: The network layer is the infrastructure of IoT, which includes\
    \ a converged \nnetwork formed by various communication networks and the internet.\
    \ The transmission \nmedium can be wired technology such as CAN bus and RS485\
    \ bus or wireless technology like \nZigbee, Bluetooth, LoRa and NB-IoT. The network\
    \ layer not only transmits various kinds of \nagricultural related information\
    \ collected by the perception layer to the higher layer, but also \nsends the\
    \ control commands of the application layer to the perception layer, so that the\
    \ related \ndevices of the sensing layer take corresponding actions.  \n(3). Middleware\
    \ layer: IoT can provide different types of services for different devices. The\
    \ technical \nspecifications (processor, power supply, communication module) and\
    \ system of each device \nare different and different devices cannot be connected\
    \ and communicated with each other, \nwhich leads to heterogeneity problems. The\
    \ middleware layer aggregates, filters and processes \nreceived data from IoT\
    \ devices, which greatly reduces the processing time and cost of the \nabove issues\
    \ and provides developers with a more versatile tool to build their applications.\
    \ It \nalso simplifies the steps of new service development and new device deployment\
    \ which \nFigure 4. IoT-A IoT framework [21].\n2.2. Structure of IoT in Protected\

    \ layer to the perception layer, so that the related devices of the\nsensing layer\
    \ take corresponding actions.\n(3).\nMiddleware layer: IoT can provide diﬀerent\

    \ and diﬀerent devices cannot be connected and communicated with each other,\n\
    which leads to heterogeneity problems. The middleware layer aggregates, ﬁlters\
    \ and processes\nreceived data from IoT devices, which greatly reduces the processing\

    \ tool to build their applications. It also\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n6 of 24\n\
    simpliﬁes the steps of new service development and new device deployment which\

    \ Crucial Technologies of IoT in Protected Agriculture\n3.1. Sensor Technology\n\
    Sensor plays an indispensable role in obtaining environment, plant and animal\
    \ information and it\nis also one of the technical bottlenecks in the development\
    \ of IoT. In recent years, sensor technology\nhas rapidly developed with the emergence\
    \ of new materials and methods [23]. The conventional\nenvironment sensors such\
    \ as temperature, humidity, light intensity, heat and gas sensors have been\n\
    relatively mature and widely deployed in protected agriculture. Nowaday, about\
    \ 6000 research and\nproduction organizations engage in sensor research from more\
    \ than 40 countries, including famous\nmanufacturers such as Honeywell, Foxboro,\
    \ ENDEVCO, Bell & Howell and Solartron companies.\nThere are three main types\
    \ of widely used and researched agricultural sensors: physical property type\n\
    sensors, biosensors and micro electro mechanical system sensors (MEMS). The physical\
    \ property type\nsensor realizes the signal conversion through the physical change\
    \ of the sensitivity of the material\nof the sensor itself, which is mainly temperature,\
    \ humidity and gas sensor. The biosensor [24] uses\nthe organism itself as a sensitive\
    \ component to transmit information according to the reaction of the\norganism\
    \ to the outside world and includes enzyme sensor [25], microbial sensor, adaptive\
    \ sensor [26],\netc., which is mainly used to detect pesticide residue, heavy\
    \ metal ion, antibiotic residue and toxic\ngas [27,28]. The MEMS sensor is the\
    \ embodiment of the new generation of research and development\ntechnology in\
    \ the ﬁeld of sensors with small size, low power consumption, low cost and reliability\
    \ [29].\nAlthough sensor technology has made great strides in both principles\
    \ and manufacturing\nprocesses, there are still some open issues. A typical example\
    \ among those open issue is the research\nand development of soil sensors and\
    \ vital sign information sensors of animal and plant, which is an\nurgent conundrum\
    \ to overcome in long time. The complex composition as well as diﬀerent physical\n\
    and chemical properties of soil turn the rapid and situ measurement of soil nitrogen\
    \ and other elements\ninto an international diﬃculty. Since the life process of\
    \ animals and plants is very complicated, in order\nto realize the accurate detection\
    \ of information about their life, it is necessary to make breakthroughs in\n\
    the physical mechanism and measurement model of the life process. Related research\
    \ has been carried\nout using physicochemical properties, spectroscopy, multispectral,\
    \ hyper-spectral, nuclear magnetic\nresonance as well as other detection methods\
    \ [30–33].\nAnother problem is the promotion and application of these sensors.\
    \ For one thing there is still\na lack of uniform technical standards in the collection,\
    \ transmission and the interface with the platform\nand human-computer interaction\
    \ interface; for another, the cost has limited the large scale application\nof\
    \ fresh sensors in intelligent agriculture. Currently, the cost of sensing equipment\
    \ for the collection and\ntransmission of animal and plant status is prohibitively\
    \ expensive for ordinary peasants. The number\nof nodes in a sensor network can\
    \ often reach tens of thousands. To make the sensor network practical,\nthe cost\
    \ of each node must be controlled within $1, but now the price is as high as $80\
    \ [34].\n3.2. Data Transmission Technology\nIn this section, the details of data\
    \ transmission technology are discussed, which is one of the vital\ntechnologies\
    \ for real-time dynamic acquisition of agricultural information. Diﬀerent from\
    \ industrial\napplication, agricultural information acquisition is not demanding\
    \ in timelines and a slight delay in\nthe transmission process has little eﬀect\
    \ on agricultural production.\nCompared with wired transmission technology such\
    \ as ﬁeldbus, wireless communication\ntechnology has advantages of low construction\
    \ and maintenance cost, low power consumption\nand excellent extensibility. Recently,\
    \ most researchers, organizations and manufacturers choose it\nto build up their\
    \ WSN in environment monitoring [35,36], automatic irrigation [37] and remote\n\
    control [38]. As shown in Table 1, the summary of popular wireless technologies\
    \ and basic parameters\nwas presented. Diﬀerent vendors and research institutes\
    \ have developed their own wireless devices\nbased on these wireless protocols,\
    \ which has somewhat increased the heterogeneity of IoT. In addition,\nwireless\
    \ signals of diﬀerent protocols located in the same band can cause mutual interference\
    \ such as\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n8 of 24\nZigBee, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth [39].\
    \ Wi-Fi has high communication speed but high power consumption,\nwhich is suitable\
    \ for sensor network deployment at ﬁxed points. Although Bluetooth has high security,\n\
    its communication distance is too short and power consumption is high, which is\
    \ suitable for short-time\nclose-range networking. ZigBee has the advantages of\
    \ low consumption, low cost and self-organization\nand each node can be used as\
    \ a relay station for transmitting data of adjacent nodes. So it easily expands\n\
    the coverage of the sensor network and is an ideal long-distance, large-range\
    \ sensor networking.\nTable 1. Summary of popular wireless technologies and basic\

    \ mW\nIn recent years, the Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) is one of IoT hotspots\
    \ and\nthought as a novel technology with great development potential, which is\
    \ attributed to its huge\nadvantages such as ultra-long distance communication\
    \ and it can be used as an important complement\nof the traditional wireless local\
    \ area network (WLAN) and mobile cellular mobile communication\ntechnologies (such\
    \ as GSM and GPRS). At this stage, LPWAN has many technical standards, which can\n\
    be classiﬁed into two categories. The ﬁrst is a proprietary patented technology\
    \ that works under\nan unlicensed spectrum, such as LoRa, Sigfox and RPMA. The\
    \ second is a cellular communication\ntechnology that works under a licensed spectrum,\
    \ such as EC-GSM, eMTC and NB-IoT. Due to the use\nof dedicated frequency bands\
    \ and uniﬁed deployment by operators, licensed spectrum technology\nhas carrier-class\
    \ security and low interference characteristics, which forms full network coverage\n\
    and operation [40,41]. The unlicensed spectrum uses the common spectrum without\
    \ paying high\nspectrum costs but requires special handling of co-channel interference.\
    \ There are many beneﬁts of IoT\ndeployments based on LPWAN in the agricultural\
    \ environment. Firstly, the maximum connection\ndistance of the LPWAN terminal\
    \ device to the base station varies from several kilometers to several tens\n\
    of kilometers, which saves the trouble of setting up and maintaining routing devices.\
    \ Compared with\nthe 2.4 GHz band, LPWAN adopts the sub-1GHz band to acquire less\
    \ attenuation and multipath\nfading caused by obstacles and dense surfaces like\
    \ concrete walls [42,43]. Moverover, the sensitivity\nof state of the art LPWAN\
    \ receivers reaches as low as –130 dBm due to modulation techniques such\nas narrowband\
    \ and spread spectrum. Secondly, ultra low power operation is another advantage\
    \ of\nLPWAN which is achieved by duty cycling mechanism, lightweight medium access\
    \ control protocols\nand oﬄoading complex tasks [44]. Thirdly, most LPWAN technologies\
    \ support a large number of\ndevice connections by diversity techniques, adaptive\
    \ channel selection and data rate technologies,\netc. [45]. Finally, the LPWAN\
    \ connects a large number of end devices, while keeping the cost of\nhardware\
    \ below ﬁve dollars [46]. LPWAN technologies target a diverse set of applications\
    \ with varying\nrequirements in protected agriculture and therefore it should\
    \ provide some sort of quality of service\n(QoS) over the same underlying LPWAN\
    \ technology. However, current LPWAN technologies provide\nno or limited QoS.\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 1833\n9 of 24\nMeanwhile, mobile cellular communication technology\
    \ has undergone four generations of\ntechnology updates and the ﬁfth-generation\
    \ mobile communication technology (5G) was announced in\n2016, which will make\
    \ large ﬁle transfer such as agricultural images and audio a reality and bring\
    \ new\nimpetus to the agricultural IoT. From the perspective of future research,\
    \ the research of wireless sensor\nnetworks focuses mainly on communication, energy\
    \ conservation, network control and its application\nin agricultural monitoring.\n\
    3.3. WSN\nThe WSN consists of a lot of sensor nodes that are usually powered by\
    \ battery and it is a multi-hop\nself-organizing network system formed by wireless\
    \ communication to collaboratively sense, collect and\nprocess various information\
    \ of the perceived object in the network coverage area [47,48]. It can be\ndivided\
    \ into terrestrial WSN and wireless underground sensor networks (WUSN). The agricultural\n\
    sensors are usually planted into soil and lower frequency wireless technologies\
    \ are more selected\ndue to low attenuation in WUSN. Besides, antenna size and\
    \ energy consumption in WUSN is higher\nthan terrestrial WSN [49]. With development\
    \ of LPWAN, IoT may not need a mesh-style WSN with\npower-based routing, where\
    \ one node forwards packets of other nodes.\n3.4. Cloud Computing\nCloud computing\
    \ grew out of distributed computing, parallel processing and grid computing.\n\
    It is an Internet-based computing system that provides hardware services, infrastructure\
    \ services,\nplatform services, software services and storage services to various\
    \ IoT applications. Its essence is\na system for dynamically deploying and allocating/redistributing\
    \ as well as dynamic monitoring\nof virtualized computing and storage resource\
    \ pools, thereby providing users with computing,\ndata storage and platform services\
    \ that meet QoS requirements [50,51]. It played a strong role in\npromoting the\
    \ development of agricultural IoT. Firstly, cloud computing can provide farmers\
    \ with cheap\ndata storage services for text, image, video and other agricultural\
    \ information, which greatly reduces\nthe storage costs of agricultural enterprises\
    \ [52]. Secondly, it is diﬃcult to make direct use of these raw\ndata for making\
    \ decisions based on the technical level of farmers. Agricultural experts can\
    \ only make\naccurate judgments and give suggestions based on quantitative analysis.\
    \ Only cloud computing can\nsupport intelligent large-scale computing systems\
    \ [53,54]. Thirdly, cloud computing could provide\na secure platform for the development\
    \ of various IoT applications such as crop monitoring [55].\n3.5. Edge Computing\n\
    Edge computing refers to a new computing model that performs calculations at the\
    \ edge of the\nnetwork [56]. In the edge computing, the downlink data of the edge\
    \ represents the cloud service,\nthe uplink data represents IoT service and the\
    \ edge of edge computing refers to any computing\nand network resources between\
    \ the data source and the cloud computing center path. Because the\ncomputing\
    \ task is partially migrated to the network edge device, edge hormone can improve\
    \ data\ntransmission performance, ensure real-time processing and reduce the computational\
    \ load of the cloud\ncomputing center. Moreover, edge computing better protects\
    \ data because processing occurs closer to\nthe source than in cloud computing\
    \ [57,58].\n3.6. Machine Learning\nMachine learning (ML) is a smart way for computers\
    \ to simulate people’s learning activities, acquire\nnew knowledge, continuously\
    \ improve performance and implement their own perfection. In recent\nyears, machine\
    \ learning has achieved great success in algorithm, theory and application [59]\
    \ and have\nbeen combined with other agricultural technologies to maximized crop\
    \ yield while minimizing the input\ncosts [60]. The main machine learning algorithms\
    \ are naïve bayes, discriminant analysis, K-nearest\nneighbor, support vector\
    \ machine (SVM) [61], K-means clusterin, fuzzy clustering, gaussian mixture\n\
    models, artiﬁcial neural network (ANN), deep learning [62], decision tree algorithm\
    \ and so on [63].\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n10 of 24\nML can discover the internal\
    \ connection between messy, modelless and complex agricultural\ndata, make accurate\
    \ predictions and provide a theoretical basis for agricultural decision-making.\n\
    Machinelearning technology is playing an important role in crop breeding, disease\
    \ identiﬁcation,\npest and disease prediction, intelligent irrigation planning\
    \ and agricultural expert systems [64–67].\nFor example, ML technology can analyze\
    \ past farmland data, including the performance of crops under\ndiﬀerent climatic\
    \ conditions and the inheritance of a particular phenotype. As well, ML technology\n\
    can explore the association rules and then build a probability model to predict\
    \ which genes are\nmost likely to participate in the expression of a certain good\
    \ trait of the plant, which can help the\nbreeding expert conduct a reasonable\
    \ breeding experiment [68–70]. Kyosuke et al. came up with\na method for detecting\
    \ the maturity of a single intact tomato-based ML, which consisted of three\n\
    steps: pixel-based segmentation, blob-based segmentation and individual fruit\
    \ detection. In the ﬁrst\ntwo steps, decision trees were generated based on features\
    \ such as color, shape, texture and size and\nimage segmentations were conducted\
    \ using the generated trees. Finally, the automatical detection of\nindividual\
    \ fruit in multiple tomatoes was achieved by X-means clustering method. The results\
    \ of the\ntomato detection image test showed that their method achieved a recall\
    \ of 0.80, while the precision\nwas 0.88 [71]. Rahnemoonfar et al. proposed deep\
    \ learning architecture for counting fruits based\non convolutional neural networks.\
    \ They used synthetic images to train the neural network to save\ntime-consuming\
    \ collect and annotate. The network was trained for three epochs on 24,000 synthetic\n\
    images using an Adam optimizer and 100 randomly chosen images were tested. The\
    \ experimental\nresults demonstrated that their method had higher average accuracy\
    \ as comparing with others [72].\n3.7. Big Data\nThe protected agriculture produces\
    \ billions of dynamic, complex and spatial data including soil\ndatabases, greenhouse\
    \ environment data, livestock vaccination records and government investment\n\
    data. Compared with relational data structures that are logically expressed using\
    \ two-dimensional\ntables, agricultural data is more unstructured and has a large\
    \ number of hypermedia elements\nsuch as expert experience, knowledge and agricultural\
    \ models in the form of text, charts, pictures,\nanimations and voice/video [73].\
    \ The “big” of these data can be reﬂected in four dimensions: volume,\nvelocity,\
    \ variety and veracity [74]. Big Data technology is able to ﬁnd out the internal\
    \ links of collected\ndata through information mining and other means, discover\
    \ new information and provide data support\nfor the next operation. The most commonly\
    \ used techniques to deal with Big Data technology are\nimage processing, modeling\
    \ and simulation, machine learning, statistical analysis and geographical\ninformation\
    \ systems (GIS) [75].\n4. IoT Applications in Protected Agriculture\n4.1. Plant\
    \ Management\nCompared with open-ﬁeld agriculture, protected agriculture provides\
    \ a relatively suitable and\ncontrollable environment for crop growth by greenhouse\
    \ technology, which to some extent is free\nfrom the constraints of the natural\
    \ environment and promoted the intensive and eﬃcient use of\nagricultural resources.\
    \ However, spatial and temporal variability of crops’ growth environmental\nparameters\
    \ in the protected agriculture are strong and aﬀect each other [76,77], which\
    \ made it diﬃcult\nto adapt to the growth of diﬀerent types of plants in diﬀerent\
    \ growth stages by traditional cultivation\nand environmental regulation. Therefore,\
    \ it needs higher accuracy in the aspect of monitoring and\ncontrol. Many works\
    \ have attempted to design and test types of monitoring and control systems to\n\
    adjust greenhouse environmental parameters such as air temperature and humidity,\
    \ light intensity\nand CO2 concentration based on IoT and their results have proven\
    \ it is technically and economically\nfeasible [78]. At the low level of IoT development,\
    \ the environmental data were simply processed and\nusually presented in sheet\
    \ and plot form [79,80]. Later, some studies collected huge amounts of data\n\
    to set up various models based on plant growth or greenhouse climate [81–83],\
    \ which contributed\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n11 of 24\nto predicting the crop\
    \ yield and environment parameter changes to help farmers better manage\ngreenhouse.\
    \ CAI et al. developed a low-cost smart greenhouse remote monitor system based\
    \ on IoT.\nThe system used STM32F103 single chip machine and sensors to collect\
    \ environmental information\nand transferred the data to cloud by LPWAN. Security\
    \ link was established with TLS, which reduced\nsystem costs while ensuring the\
    \ security of data transmission. At the same time, they adopted a time\nseries\
    \ database to store data so that tremendous storage space can be saved [84]. He\
    \ et al. have reported\na greenhouse temperature intelligent control system based\
    \ on NB-IoT. The relative error of greenhouse\nenvironmental information collection\
    \ was below 1%, the average control accuracy was 3.57% (±1.0 ◦C),\nthe transmission\
    \ distance was not limited and the automatic regulation of crop growth temperature\n\
    was realized [85].\nNowaday, with the development of cloud computing, ML, etc.,\
    \ IoT solution can easily achieve\nsmart data processing and analyzing at low\
    \ cost and in a convenient way [86,87]. At the same time,\ngreenhouse technology\
    \ has also undergone several generations of upgrades and has now evolved into\n\
    highly mechanized and automated plant factories. Deng et al. have implemented\
    \ a closed-loop control\nsystem in a salad-cultivating plant factory based on\
    \ the kinetic model. Both digital simulation and\nreal-time results demonstrated\
    \ the system can work stably under the internal variations and external\ndisturbances\
    \ [88]. Zamora-Izquierdo et al. developed a smart farming IoT platform based on\
    \ edge and\ncloud computing, which was designed for soilless culture greenhouses\
    \ at low cost. The platform was\ncomposed of local, edge and cloud parts: the\
    \ local part dealt with data gathering and automatic control\nthough Cyber-Physical\
    \ Systems, the edge part took main management tasks and could improve the\nstability\
    \ of this systems, the cloud part was in charge of data analytics. Compared with\
    \ a regular\nopen control, the platform saved more than 30% water [89]. Katsoulas\
    \ et al. have designed an\nonline irrigation system for hydroponic greenhouse\
    \ crops and their results indicated it increased\nwater and fertilizer use eﬃciency\
    \ by 100% [90]. Liao et al. implemented a IoT-based system in\nan orchid greenhouse\
    \ to monitor the environmental factors and the growth status of phalaenopsis.\n\
    They developed an image processing algorithm to estimate the leaf area of phalaenopsisthe\
    \ and\nidentiﬁed the relationship between growth of plant leaves and environmental\
    \ factors. The proposed\nsystem could provide quantitative information with high\
    \ spatiotemporal resolution for ﬂoral farmers\nand contribute to updating farming\
    \ strategies for phalaenopsis in the future [91].\nDiseases and insect pests bring\
    \ a great threat to the growth of crops as and traditional technology\nand chemical\
    \ prevention and control has a certain lag and negative impact [92,93]. The rise\
    \ of IoT\nhas brought more eﬃcient and smarter solutions to crop disease and pest\
    \ control. Many types of\nIoT sensors can collect information about location,\
    \ greenhouse environment status, crop growth and\npest situation anywhere in real-time,\
    \ which helps farmers keep track of crop pests and diseases.\nThen, all raw image\
    \ and data are sent to cloud centers and later processed and analyzed by various\n\
    models and algorithms based on diﬀerent diseases and pests [94,95]. Finally, these\
    \ cloud centers\ngenerally provide farmers with the following services: disease\
    \ or pest identiﬁcation, disaster prediction\nand warning and recommended governance\
    \ measures from expert systems. Tirelli et al. proposed\na pest insect trap automatic\
    \ monitoring system using ZigBee technology, which can estimate the\ninsect density\
    \ by collected data from diﬀerent sites and send a warning message to farmers\
    \ when it\nexceeded the set value [96]. Ahouandjinou et al. proposed a pest monitoring\
    \ system which detected\nthe presence of pests by the acquisition of ultrasound\
    \ and assisted others in building up protocols\nfor early exterminate of the pests\
    \ [97]. Foughali et al. presented a potato late blight prevention and\ndecision\
    \ support system using cloud IoT and helped the agriculturists take eﬀective action\
    \ to treat\nthis disease [98]. Both Semios and Spensa Company launched their own\
    \ integrated pest management\nsystem, which was able to count the number of pests\
    \ by images, as well as characterize and capture\nthe insects. At present, pest\
    \ and disease warning research mainly provides medium and long-term\nwarning based\
    \ on historical data, which can provide macro guidance for crop production but\
    \ low\ntimeliness. Therefore, future research should focus on online monitoring\
    \ as well as diagnosis and early\nwarning of agricultural diseases.\nSensors 2019,\
    \ 19, 1833\n12 of 24\n4.2. Animal Farming\nLivestock and aquatic product farming\
    \ is an important part of protected agriculture and an area\nwhere IoT applications\
    \ have achieved good results. To achieve good control eﬀects in animal breeding,\n\
    IoT should not only overcome harsh environmental factors, but also pay attention\
    \ to the eﬀects of animal\nbehaviors [99,100]. IoT have been applied in monitoring\
    \ and management of environment, animal,\nfeed and farming process [101,102].\
    \ The livestock monitoring items include information such as body\ntemperature,\
    \ weight, behavior, exercise volume, food intake, disease information and environmental\n\
    factors, which can help people understand animal’s own physiological and nutritional\
    \ status and\nadaptability to external environmental conditions. In aquaculture,\
    \ management projects focus on water\nquality such as dissolved oxygen content,\
    \ water temperature and pH value [103,104] because water\nquality greatly aﬀects\
    \ the growth of aquatic animals. With animal growth and nutrient optimization\n\
    model and intelligent IoT equipment, it is possible to realiaze automatic feeding\
    \ and optimal control of\nfeeding time and intake according to their growth cycle,\
    \ individual quality, feeding cycle and eating\nsituation [105,106]. The Osborne\
    \ Industrial Company has produced TEAM automated electronic sow\nfeeding (ESF)\
    \ stations including pregnancy stations and estrus detection stations. The ESF\
    \ stations\nidentify the sow through the RFID tags worn by each sow and deliver\
    \ the corresponding quantity\nand type of feed based on information such as parity,\
    \ lyrical condition and gestational age. The estrus\ndetection stations can detect\
    \ rutting sows in the sow population and their detection accuracy is 7%\nhigher\
    \ than the manual ones. Encinas et al. presented a distributed monitoring IoT\
    \ system for\nwater quality monitoring. Their model was able to help ﬁsheries\
    \ acquire water quality parameters\nsuch as pH and temperature data in real time\
    \ to optimize pond resources and prevent unwanted\nconditions [107]. Soto-Zarazu´a\
    \ et al. proposed an automated recirculation tilapia farming system\nbased on\
    \ the fuzzy algorithm. The results of this work showed that it saved water by\
    \ 97.42% and\nthe water quality environmental parameters were controlled within\
    \ the acceptable range of tilapia\nculture [108]. Many researches have focused\
    \ on analysis of animal behavior, health care and diagnosis\nand warning of diseases\
    \ based on IoT [109–111]. Yazdanbakhsh et al. proposed an intelligent livestock\n\
    surveillance system. They attempted many machine learning algorithms to process\
    \ raw data of\nhealthy and ill cows and ﬁnally obtained good results used a wavelet-domain\
    \ ensemble classiﬁer with\n80.8% sensitivity and 80% speciﬁcity [112]. Wens Group,\
    \ the largest livestock breeding enterprise\nin China, took the lead in carrying\
    \ out research on the animal husbandry based on IoT and built\nthe corresponding\
    \ system for monitoring livestock vital signs, behavior and breeding environment\n\
    information [113]. Liu et al. collected a variety of penaeus vannamei information\
    \ such as real-time data\non the culture environment, disease image data and expert\
    \ disease diagnosis and treatment and ﬁnally,\nconstructed a remote intelligent\
    \ diagnosis model based on IoT [114]. Liu et al. proposed a web-based\ncombined\
    \ nutritional model for precisely predicting the growth, feed amount and nitrogen\
    \ phosphorus\noutput of gibel carp [115]. The current online diagnostics and early\
    \ warning of animal diseases is at an\nearly stage due to the lack of corresponding\
    \ sensors and models. With upgrading of hardware and\nartiﬁcial intelligence algorithms,\
    \ future research should focus on the improvement of Big Data depth\nalgorithm\
    \ and the establishment of comprehensive models of animal behavior and disease.\n\
    A few studies have made in-depth research in monitoring animal odor and hazardous\
    \ gas\nproduced during the breeding process such as ammonia gas and sulfur dioxide\
    \ [116]. Pan developed\nan electronic nose network system for monitoring and real-time\
    \ analysis of odors from livestock\nfarms. They placed e-noses in and around the\
    \ farm to build up a wireless network to measure odor\ncompounds as well as environmental\
    \ parameters [117].\n4.3. Agri-food Supply Chain Traceability\nNowday, agricultural\

    \ in many\ncountries and regions have promulgated laws and regulations to promote\
    \ the establishment of food\ntraceability system and strengthen the supervision\
    \ of agricultural products/food safety. The Agri-food\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n\

    \ quality at each link of the\nproduction, from the cropland to the consumer (Figure\
    \ 6), which could help consumers establish\nconﬁdence in food safety and contribute\
    \ to sustainable development of the whole food industry [118].\n \n4.3. Agri-food\

    \ confidence in food safety and contribute to sustainable development of the whole\
    \ food \nindustry [118].  \n \nFigure 6. Schematic representation of the Agri-food\
    \ supply chain from the grower to consumer. \nIn past years, a lot of countries\
    \ have established the traceability platform for meat,milk, fish and \nagri-food\
    \ products based on IoT [119–121]. However, the fresh food cold chain logistics\
    \ traceability \nhas also drawn widespread attention [122,123]. RFID technology\
    \ still played an important role in \nAgri-food supply chain traceability due\
    \ to its small size and low cost [124]. As a novel technology, \nnear field communication\
    \ (NFC) has been progressively developed and used because of its safe and \nsimple\
    \ operation [125,126]. A common problem in the development of IoT is its asynchronous\
    \ \nheterogeneous data flow and distributed features. This requires the traceability\
    \ system to establish \nuniform and accurate identification naming rules to facilitate\
    \ quick and unique retrieval of \ninformation on a farm product [127]. As the\
    \ deployment of IoT infrastructure is completed, the \nsupply chain will move\
    \ towards virtualization which is no longer required physical contact. The \n\
    virtualization of an agri-food supply chain helps administrators better monitor,\
    \ control, plan and \noptimize food supply chain processes [128]. Wang et al.\
    \ proposed a food safety pre-warning system \nbased on association rules mining\
    \ and IoT. It included four modules: information source, warning \nFigure 6. Schematic\

    \ contact. The virtualization of an\nagri-food supply chain helps administrators\
    \ better monitor, control, plan and optimize food supply\nchain processes [128].\
    \ Wang et al. proposed a food safety pre-warning system based on association\n\
    rules mining and IoT. It included four modules: information source, warning analysis,\
    \ reaction and\nemergency feedback. First, they accessed food critical information\
    \ through data processing and\nanalysis of food traceability data for safety assessment.\
    \ On this basis of this data, the system used the\nassociated data mining method\
    \ to discover the connection between them and then obtained the food\nsafety risk\
    \ analysis results. Subsequently, the system made a corresponding early warning\
    \ response\nbased on this result [129].\nRecently, the increasing incidents of\
    \ food falsiﬁcation have not only brought about great economic\nlosses, but also\
    \ undermined consumers’ conﬁdence in food safety. The blockchain technology with\n\
    decentralization, non-tamperability, development transparency and machine autonomy\
    \ features\nbrings new solutions to the above problems [130,131]. Tian et al.\
    \ reported a new decentralized\ntraceability system based on IoT and blockchain\
    \ technology, which can provid an open, transparent,\nneutral, safe and reliable\
    \ information platform for producers, governments, consumers and other\nstakeholders\
    \ [132]. Kaijun et al. combined the supply chain and blockchain technology to\
    \ propose\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n14 of 24\na double chain architecture agricultural\
    \ traceability system by studying the dual chain structure and\nits storage mode,\
    \ resource rent-seeking and matching mechanism and consensus algorithm [133].\n\
    Now, with the innovation and maturity of related technologies, it is not diﬃcult\
    \ for researchers to\ndevelop a complete set of traceability systems. The rise\
    \ of artiﬁcial intelligence technology enables\nexisting traceability systems\
    \ to provide automation, intelligence and human services to businesses\nand consumers.\
    \ Chen et al. adopted fuzzy cognitive maps and fuzzy rule method to come up with\n\
    an autonomous tracing system for backward design in food supply chain based on\
    \ IoT, which better\ntraced food product problems [134]. However, there are still\
    \ some problems in food safety traceability.\nIt is worth noting that the current\
    \ agricultural product safety traceability system only focuses on\na certain level\
    \ of supply chain or a certain type of goods. With the participation of multiple\
    \ projects\nor multiple sessions, we believe that the focus of future research\
    \ should be on more complex and\nsystematic supply chains.\n5. Disscussion\n5.1.\
    \ Hardware and Software Challenges\nWhen IoT technology is applying in protected\
    \ agriculture, it is inevitable to encounter challenges\nfrom all aspects. In\
    \ the perception layer, various devices must face the harsh and complex greenhouse\n\
    environment. Strong solar radiation, high temperatures, high humidity, strong\
    \ vibrations and other\nhazards can easily damage or destroy sensors or end devices.\
    \ Moreover, the daily activities of livestock\ncan interfere with the work of\
    \ the sensor or execution nodes, resulting in poor detection and control.\nIn\
    \ a general way, the information collection nodes rely on the battery with limited\
    \ power to maintain\nits work because the behavior of frequent battery replacement\
    \ consume a lot of energies and money.\nTherefore, it is an urgent need to make\
    \ great progress in developing low-power acquisition equipment,\nenergy-saving\
    \ sink node routing protocols and energy-balanced communication algorithms [135].\n\
    The devices places in various places generate incalculable data and the storage\
    \ of such data\nis also a huge challenge for some small servers.\nThose agricultural\
    \ IoT data have real-time,\ndynamic, granular and fragmented characteristics,\
    \ which brings great challenges to intermediate\ndesign, data large-scale screening,\
    \ screening, mining, processing and decision analysis techniques.\nMoreover, existing\
    \ databases cannot store unstructured data such as audio, video and images. As\
    \ a result,\nquite a lot real-time sensing data are not fully exploited. Besides,\
    \ some models and algorithms are not\nenough to to reﬂect objective reality, so\
    \ that they cannot eﬀectively guide agricultural production.\n5.2. Network Challenge\n\
    In protected agriculture, the sensor and device need to continuously operate under\
    \ the harsh\nand varied environment and their arrangement is sparse and irregular.\
    \ Compared with the wired\nnetwork with high wiring costs, the wireless network\
    \ has the advantages of low cost, good networking\nﬂexibility and high scalability\
    \ and therefore becomes the main application mode of the current\nmonitoring system.\
    \ Many actual deployments have displayed that common wireless communication\n\
    technologies are aﬀected by temperature, humidity andbuildings or other spatial\
    \ barriers [136–138].\nThe growth of animals and plants changes also result in\
    \ background noise [139] because of the\nmulti-path propagation eﬀects, which\
    \ lows reliability of data transmission. It is easy to isolate a node in\nthe\
    \ original communication network due to low node deployment density and the above\
    \ obstacles in\nprotected agriculture. If this node is responsible for communication\
    \ routing tasks of many devices and\nthis node is damaged and isolated from the\
    \ network, this will cause partial or even paralysis of most of\nthe network.\
    \ Most relevant theories and research needes on the eﬀects of the crop growth,\
    \ the thickness\nand material of wall, and the radio signal transmission loss\
    \ and electromagnetic wave transmission\nbetween soil and air interface, etc.\
    \ To determine the optimal position, height and network topology\nof sensor nodes\
    \ under diﬀerent environmental conditions. On the other hand, ad hoc intelligent\n\
    wireless network technology is needed to reduce or avoid paralysis of large-area\
    \ networks. The rise of\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n15 of 24\nLPWAN may solve e above\
    \ paralysis problems of WLAN due to its long communication distance,\nwhich obviates\
    \ the need for the dense and expensive deployments of relays and gateways altogether.\n\
    However, the cost of erecting LPWAN base stations is high.\nThe process of recording\
    \ various agricultural products’ status from the ﬁeld to the table\ngenerates\
    \ a large amount of data, which brings great challenges to wireless communication\
    \ with\na low transmission rate. At same times, it also brought network nodes\
    \ many problems in energy\ndistribution, data calculation, storage and communication.\
    \ Therefore, there is an urgent need to\ndevelop high-capacity data and real-time\
    \ broadband communication standards for technologies in\ncomplex agricultural\
    \ application environments.\n5.3. Security Challenge\nThe problems of security\
    \ and privacy are thought as crucial challenges in applications of protected\n\
    agriculture due to real-world examples of losses due to vulnerabilities, network\
    \ attacks or privacy issues.\nAs a multi-network heterogeneous converged network,\
    \ it not only has the same security problems as\nsensor networks, mobile communication\
    \ networks and the Interne, but also has its particular issues\nsuch as privacy\
    \ protection issues, authentication and access control issues for heterogeneous\
    \ networks,\nstorage and management of information issues, etc.\nIn the perception\
    \ layer, security threats are mainly against the WSN and RFID. In agricultural\n\
    applications, many of the sensor nodes are deployed in the long-term unsupervised\
    \ farmland\nenvironment and the wireless network itself is open, so the wireless\
    \ transmission is vulnerable to\nexternal interference and illegal users. Coupled\
    \ with the fact that these devices are respectively\nplaced elsewhere, a single\
    \ security measure is not enough [140]. The main threats to WSN include\neavesdropping\
    \ attack, node capture, replay attack and information wiretapping. So multiple\
    \ security\nmechanisms such as anonymity mechanism, data encryption and identity\
    \ authentication mechanisms\nare necessary [141,142].\nThe security threat of\
    \ RFID refers mainly to the attacks that are encountered when the RFID\nreader\
    \ and the tag communicate and such attacks usually lead to user privacy. In addition,\
    \ because the\nRFID tag is rewritable, the security and validity of the RFID tag\
    \ data will not be guaranteed.\nThere are lots of ways to enhance RFID tag security\
    \ such as modifying tag frequency, enciphered data.\nSensor nodes are diﬀerent\
    \ from RFID tag because they are active and relate to the dynamic properties of\n\
    things. Therefore, when applying encryption algorithms, key distribution policies,\
    \ intrusion detection\nmechanisms and security routing policies in speciﬁc devices,\
    \ we need to consider the limitations of\ntheir own hardware.\nSince networks\
    \ of diﬀerent architectures need to be connected to each other, there are even\n\
    greater challenges in terms of security authentication across network architectures.\
    \ The transport\nlayer will encounter the following security challenges: proxy\
    \ attacks, DoS (Denial-of-Service) attacks,\nmalicious code injection, man-in-the-middle\
    \ attacks, attacks across heterogeneous networks, etc.\nThe common measures dealt\
    \ with these network layer threats and attacks are: authorization,\nauthentication,\
    \ encryption, anti-virus protection, etc. IoT terminal devices in protected agriculture\n\
    have the characteristics of weak computing power and small storage space. Due\
    \ to limited resources,\nIoT encryption technology must be an easy to implement,\
    \ lightweight security technology that is\nsuitable for use in sensitive information\
    \ environments [143,144].\nWhen massive agricultural data is transmitted to the\
    \ application layer, in addition to the intelligent\nprocessing of data, data\
    \ security and privacy should also be considered. At this level, a large amount\n\
    of private data about users is collected, such as the consumption of agricultural\
    \ materials, the purchase\ninformation of fruits and vegetables and the location\
    \ of agricultural machinery. Therefore, the database\naccess control strategy\
    \ should be strengthened on the basis of intelligent data processing. When diﬀerent\n\
    users access the same data, they should limit their permissions and operations\
    \ according to their security\nlevel or identity, eﬀectively ensuring data security\
    \ and privacy. On the other hand, application layer\nservice providers should\
    \ accelerate the development and upgrade of authentication mechanisms\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 1833\n16 of 24\nand encryption mechanisms for application scenarios\
    \ such as agricultural production, processing,\ntransportation and consumption.\n\
    5.4. Other Challenges\nThere are other challenges that need to be addressed, which\
    \ are related to the further application of\nIoT technology in protected agriculture.\
    \ Thousands of devices which have huge diﬀerences in processor,\nmemory, communication\
    \ protocol and programming language are deployed in protected agriculture,\nwhich\
    \ inevitably results in heterogeneity issues. Besides, most of devices in protected\
    \ agriculture are\nconnected to the cloud or others by the non-standard heterogeneous\
    \ interfaces [14,22]. This has led\nto problems of both device heterogeneity and\
    \ data heterogeneity. The device heterogeneity problem\naﬀects the scalability\
    \ of IoT in protected agriculture and the data heterogeneity problem hinders the\n\
    use of fusion information by models [145]. Although many research institutes,\
    \ hardware and software\nmanufacturers and related organizations have made a lot\
    \ of contributions to the standardization and\ndeployment of IoT in agriculture,\
    \ it still needs to establish a complete and clear structure, protocols and\n\
    standards to connect various heterogeneous devices and services [146,147].\nThe\
    \ cost has always been a barrier to the large-scale application of IoT to ordinary\
    \ farmers,\nespecially in developing countries like China and India. Despite a\
    \ large number of embedded devices\nand platforms have emerged and the cost of\
    \ hardware and software is rapidly decreasing, but here is\nanother situation\
    \ in high-quality and high-precision sensors and devices. Moreover, some funds\
    \ are\nneeded to train farmers to become proﬁcient in the use of IoT equipment.\
    \ In order to be able toplay\na better role in the future, the cost of sensing,\
    \ transmission, analysis and application components and\nequipment on the IoT\
    \ need to further reduce in order to lower the price and make it more aﬀordable\n\
    in the next decade [148]. Government departments should recognize the signiﬁcant\
    \ potential for the\ndevelopment of IoT in protected agriculture and increase\
    \ investment and support through policies and\nfunds to attract more capital and\
    \ achieve rapid development and application.\nIn addition, the usability of the\
    \ terminal device needs to be further improved, for example, the user\ninterface\
    \ needs to be friendlier andthe device needs to be more convenient in size and\
    \ easy to carry.\nIoT brings many beneﬁts to ecological environment and brings\
    \ some problems.. More and\nmore equipment is being placed in agriculture andso\
    \ the issues of environmental friendliness should\nreceive some attention in the\
    \ future. As the e-waste generated by IoT devices and the consumption of\nenergy\
    \ are gradually increasing, the sustainable development of the ecological environment\
    \ is also one\ncommon concern. Examples of interesting research topics include\
    \ the use of degradable materials and\nrenewable energy sources, the reduction\
    \ of equipment size and the use of energy-saving algorithms\nand new green ICT\
    \ technology [149,150].\nThe application of the Internet of Things in facility\
    \ agriculture needs to consider the socio-economic\nconsequences. On the one hand,\
    \ it increases the level of intelligence in agricultural monitoring,\ncontrol\
    \ and decision-making, thereby increasing the eﬃciency and quality of agricultural\
    \ production.\nAt the same time, it will also change the demand for the existing\
    \ agricultural workforce, causing some\npeople who are engaged in simple repetitive\
    \ tasks to lose their jobs, which will cause a series of\nsocial problems.\n5.5.\
    \ Future Prospects\nIoT technology is being applied to many ﬁelds of society,\
    \ economy and life at an unprecedented\nspeed, making human society step into\
    \ a new era of high intelligence. IoT technology is evolving\nand mature, and\
    \ many novel deployments and applications are constantly being built in protected\n\
    agriculture. Based on the above analysis and discussion of the key technologies\
    \ and applications of IoT\nin the protection of agriculture, we will present its\
    \ future development prospects and key research and\ndevelopment directions in\
    \ the following aspects. In the perception layer, the development of sensors\n\
    should focus on new sensitive materials, mechanisms, processes and methodologies\
    \ as well as low\npower consumption and low cost. Besides, we must accelerate\
    \ the development of sensors and rapid\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n17 of 24\ndetection\
    \ devices soil, animal and plant life. At the network layer, we should focus on\
    \ high-capacity data\nreal-time broadband communication standards and technologies\
    \ for complex agricultural application\nenvironments, high-reliability, adaptive,\
    \ low-power network deployment and management strategies\nand algorithms. With\
    \ wide coverage, high capacity, low power consumption and low cost, LPWAN is\n\
    ideal for some agricultural scenarios where text-based, video and voice service\
    \ support is not required\nand coverage, power consumption and cost are critical.\
    \ Future research and deployment should\nfocus on IoT solutions based on LPWAN.\
    \ In the application layer, governments and organizations\nshould develop uniﬁed\
    \ standards for the sensors and identiﬁcation interface devices, data transmission\n\
    communication protocols, multi-source data fusion analysis processing and application\
    \ services in\nprotected agriculture through international cooperation or negotiation.\
    \ Software developers should\ndevelop large open source databases and signal processing\
    \ algorithm libraries for diﬀerent areas\nof facility agriculture. For universities\
    \ and research institutes, cloud-based agricultural intelligent\ndecision-making\
    \ models, multi-source data-based information fusion algorithms, agricultural\
    \ Big Data\nmining technologies, distributed intelligent processing systems and\
    \ lightweight IoT authentication,\nencryption and authorization mechanisms will\
    \ be the key research directions for the future. With an\nincreased presence of\
    \ IoT technology in protected agriculture, its potential for the reﬁned management\n\
    of crop, livestock and aquatic animals will be recognized. Besides, as a technical\
    \ means to monitor\nthe production, processing, circulation and consumption of\
    \ agricultural products, IoTwill play an\nincreasingly important role in food\
    \ safety.\n6. Conclusions\nIn this survey, we present a comprehensive review of\
    \ the state-of-the-art in IoT deployment\nfor protected agriculture applications.\
    \ First, a simple review of previous IoT structure was given.\nSecondly, the basic\
    \ IoT architectures in protected agriculture were introduced. Next, discussions\
    \ of\nsensor, data communication, cloud computing, edge computing, ML and other\
    \ vital IoT technologies\nin protected agriculture are elaborated.\nThen, we highlight\
    \ various IoT applications and their\npotential to solve various farming problems\
    \ in protected agriculture. By classifying the research and\ndeployment literature\
    \ on IoT in protected agriculture, three important application ﬁelds were given:\n\
    plant management, animal farming and agri-food supply chain traceability. Finally,\
    \ a detailed analyses\nof IoT research challenges and future prospects were outlined.\n\
    The survey of the existing works directs us concluding remarks. The future prospects\
    \ of IoT in\nprotected agriculture are expectant, but the challenges mentioned\
    \ above must handle. In order to\ncope with its complex and changing agricultural\
    \ environment, the hardware devices must be fully\nupgraded to further enhance\
    \ their universality, reliability, expansibility, endurance and intelligence\n\
    level, while reducing costs and operative diﬃculty. Secondly, the local network\
    \ must be protected from\ninterference from other networks. In addition, the interoperability,\
    \ ﬁltering and semantic annotation of\ndata generated by the various devices of\
    \ IoT must be realized to a certain extent. Only in this way\ncan we optimize\
    \ the Big Data decision support model by using a large amount of heterogeneous\
    \ data.\nSecurity, anonymity and control over the access rights on the information\
    \ is vital for such a system to\nbe adopted. Finally, the impact of IoT on the\
    \ agroecological environment and social economy should\nbe considered in the application\
    \ of protected agriculture, to realize the sustainable development of\nagricultural\
    \ environment as quick as possible.\nAuthor Contributions: The collection, classiﬁcation\

    \ market \nof this century, successfully running a business \nmeans to be able\
    \ to take advantage of the most \nadvanced techniques and technologies available,\
    \ \nachieving, by their appropriate integration \nwith more classical approaches,\
    \ a maximum of \nefficiency. Information Technologies (IT), control \nand communication\
    \ tools may offer extremely \nimportant opportunities, but they usually are \n\
    not very open for non-professionals, as business \ndecision-makers are.\nCyber-Physical\
    \ Systems, that represent the \nnext generation paradigm for engineering \nsystems,\
    \ are more and more effectively being \nadopted in industry, being expected to\
    \ offer the \nmeans for modelling, managing and connecting \nheterogeneous systems\
    \ [7, 15]. \nIn this context, there is a need for a generic \nframework allowing\
    \ the design of enterprise \narchitectures that can tightly couple business and\
    \ \nproduction models, as well as the capability to \nextend towards complex business\
    \ systems – which \nrepresents the main objective of this paper.\nThe paper is\
    \ structured in 6 sections. Section two \naddresses the paradigm of Cyber-Physical\
    \ Systems \nboth from a multidisciplinary point of view, as \nwell as a review\
    \ of existing CPS architectures. \nSection three addresses the main problems in\
    \ \nmodelling Cyber-Physical Systems. In section \nfour the authors propose a\
    \ Conceptual Framework \nfor Cyber-Physical Systems. The focus of the \nframework\
    \ is related to systems modelling and \nA Conceptual Framework for Modeling and\

    \ tightly integrate physical with virtual components have represented a priority\
    \ of research and \ndevelopment in the area of ICT. An intensive work has been\
    \ concentrated in different domains, such as: Internet of Things, \nInternet of\
    \ Services and lately in the domain of Cyber Physical Systems whose important\
    \ driver is represented by the large-\nscale integration of the physical and cyber\
    \ worlds. Authors propose a Generic System Architecture, taking into account the\
    \ \nparadigm of Cyber-Physical Systems with a main emphasis on the future agricultural\
    \ enterprise (intelligent/smart farm) as a \ncomplex system, addressing sustainability\
    \ and adaptability towards environmental and market changes.\nKeywords: Cyber\
    \ Physical Systems, Internet of Things, Intelligent Integrated System, Intelligent\
    \ Farm.\ninformation routing. The framework provides \na unified view, integrating\
    \ modelling and \nmanagement from business level to production \nlevel with the\
    \ aid of Cyber Physical Systems \nprinciples. Section five addresses a case study\
    \ \nrelated to the implementation of the proposed \nframework in the field of\
    \ agricultural enterprises [9].\n2. Cyber-Physical Systems – A \nMultidisciplinary\
    \ Vision\n2.1 Cyber-Physical Systems Principles and \nParadigms\nCyber-Physical\
    \ Systems represent an integration \nof computation and physical systems. The\
    \ focus \nof such systems is to bring together the actual \nphysical objects and\
    \ the omnipresent computing \nand networking systems. CPS are concerned with \n\
    the actual interaction between the physical and \ncomputer systems, thus completing\
    \ the up to \ndate research for understanding of the systems \nseparately [5].\n\
    An important paradigm in close relation to CPS \nis the Internet of Things (IoT)\
    \ which emphasizes \nthe use of existing technologies and architectures \nfor\
    \ large-scale systems in order to identify and \nvirtualize physical devices.\
    \ Internet of Things \ncomponents include: IoT Device Management, \nIoT Analytics,\
    \ IoT Security, Event Stream \nProcessing, IoT Platforms, IoT Standards and \n\
    Ecosystems to create a real intelligent integrated \nsystem [6].\nStudies in Informatics\
    \ and Control 26 (3) 325-334, September 2017\nhttps://doi.org/10.24846/v26i3y201708\n\
    http://www.sic.ici.ro\n326\nAnother important emerging paradigm is Industrie \n\
    4.0, which [1, 22] specifically takes into account: \nsensor and actuator networks,\
    \ intelligent network \ncontrol systems and human in the loop principles; \nIntelligent\
    \ Robots and Machines, including \nhuman-robot interaction, adaptive control,\
    \ \ncontext awareness; Big Data; Network Quality of \nService; Energy Efficiency\
    \ And Decentralization; \nVirtual Industrialization in regard to the concept \n\
    of “virtual plants and products”; Value Networks \naiming at achieving digital\
    \ integration along the \nsupply chain and along different manufacturing \nprocesses\
    \ and engineering models and  \nmethods [7, 18].\nIn this context, embedded systems\
    \ that control \nphysical processes can be viewed as a sub-set of \nthe wider\
    \ CPS definition.\nAn enterprise can be characterized as a complex \nsystem in\
    \ a state of relatively stable equilibrium \namong many interdependent component\
    \ systems \nin a shared human endeavour. In this context, the \nIntelligent Cyber\
    \ Enterprise may represent the \nnext generation of enterprises [7,8].\nIntelligent\
    \ Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS) \nrepresent the next generation of advanced \n\
    networked systems, presenting distributed \nintelligence. Internet of Things and\
    \ Internet \nof Services, integrated by multiple feedback \nloops, allow to develop\
    \ complex cyber-physical  \nsystems [8]. \nAs presented in Figure 1, CPS evolve\
    \ from \ncomplex interactions of embedded systems \n(controls on board vehicles,\
    \ smart intersections, \ncommunication networks, etc.), based on the \nnetworking\
    \ and integration of them and involving \nhuman-technology interaction in application\
    \ \nprocesses [15, 23].\nFigure 1. CPS as a multidisciplinary view\nCommunication\
    \ between the system components \nis another important issue that needs to be\
    \ taken \ninto consideration. Cyber-Physical Systems need a \nreal-time communication\
    \ network that can provide \nguarantees on both the throughputs and delays of\
    \ \nthe system flow. \nThe communication network allows the formation \nof multiple\
    \ control loops within its structure/\ntopology, so that multiple control objectives\
    \ can \nbe achieved at the same time. The location of the \nsystems and the time\
    \ difference between entities \ninvolved in the control loop are two essential\
    \ \nissues caused by the distributed nature in CPS. \nIn this context, when modelling\
    \ a Cyber-Physical \nSystem, one must take into consideration all the \nmechanisms\
    \ that support semantic addressing \nfor portability and reusability of applications,\
    \ as \nwell as system management. Also, a middleware \nframework is required to\
    \ provide the right \nmechanisms which support the timelines \nbehaviour on the\
    \ control system and to tolerate \nfaults. The middleware framework is useful\
    \ \nto develop and control all the systems which \ninvolve the features of both\
    \ heterogeneity and  \ndistributed operation. \nFrom a networking viewpoint, some\
    \ widely-\nrecognized characteristics of CPS can be  \noutlined as: \n- \nNetwork\
    \ Complexity – the network of a \ntypical CPS is often large in scale due to the\
    \ \nnumber of existing distributed nodes;\n- \nResource Constraints – the embedded\
    \ devices \nare limited in energy efficiency, bandwidth, \nrate through, throughput,\
    \ etc.;\n- \nHybrid Traffic and Massive Data – due to the \nnumber of sensor and\
    \ nodes, a large volume \nof data is created;\n- \nUncertainty – In CPS there\
    \ are many \nfactors that can cause uncertainty – sensor \nmeasurements error,\
    \ computational model \nerror, software errors, and unreliability of \nwireless\
    \ communications or changes in \nnetwork topology;\n- \nStructural and behavioural\
    \ complexities \nare more challenging for modeling, analy-\nsis, design, verification\
    \ and implementation  \nof CPS.\nFuture systems must be based on composition \n\
    frameworks and more systematic or automated \nmethods for proving connectivity.\

    \ 2. Main components of a  \nCyber-Physical System\n2.2 Models and Architectures\
    \ in Cyber \nPhysical Systems\nA series of CPS models, frameworks and generic\
    \ \narchitectures have been identified in literature.\nThe CPS 5C level architecture\
    \ [16], proposes a 5 \nlayer approach consisting of: Connection; Data \nConversion;\
    \ Cyber; Cognition and Configuration. \nThe architecture allows for the development\
    \ \nof complex systems starting from Monitoring \nComponents towards Decision\
    \ Support Systems \nand Resilient Control Systems. The 5C approach \noffers guidelines\
    \ for the implementation of CPS \nin manufacturing industry.  \nThe NIST - CPS\
    \ Public Working Group proposes \na CPS Framework oriented towards unifying \n\
    the existing concepts as well as extending \nwith specific topics. The framework\
    \ addresses \ndomains, concerns, properties, facets and aspects. \nA conceptualization\
    \ facet, a realization facet and \nan assurance facet are proposed. The analysis\
    \ \nprocess proposed encompasses the following \nsteps: identify domains, identify\
    \ cross-cutting \nconcerns, analyse and address concerns [2].\nA related concept\
    \ refers to the liquid enterprise and \nthe osmose concept developed in the OSMOSE\
    \ \nproject [10] The osmose concept envisions a \nsemi-permeable membrane separating\
    \ the real, \ndigital and virtual environments. The OSMOSE \narchitecture proposes\
    \ a middleware system that \nenables intelligent communication supported by \n\
    osmosis and context management. To enable the \ncommunication an inter-world router\
    \ is proposed.\nReference Architectural Model Industrie 4.0 - \nRAMI 4.0 [11]\
    \ is an architectural model related \nto the Industrie 4.0 paradigm. In a structured\
    \ \nmanner RAMI 4.0 adopts a cube based layered \nrepresentation including 7 Hierarchy\
    \ Levels, a \nLife Cycle Value Stream addressed with the help \nof 6 Layers: Business,\
    \ Functional, Information, \nCommunication, Integration and Asset. The \narchitecture\
    \ aims at integrating Industrie 4.0 \nrelated concepts such as:  Flexible production\
    \ \nsystems, networked systems, hierarchy based \ninteraction, network integrated\
    \ product [11].\nThe Reference Architecture for CPS-Platforms - \nCYPROS - envisions\
    \ an increase in productivity \nalong with the implementation of intelligent \n\
    systems. The reference architecture is composed \nof an information model a methodology\
    \ for \nthe description of architectural elements and \na procedural model. The\
    \ information model \nprovides a framework for the developer to model \nCPS components.\n\
    3. Main Problems in Modelling \nCyber-Physical Systems\nThe main challenges in\
    \ order to develop the \nnext generation of intelligent Cyber-Physical  \nSystems\
    \ are:\n- \nHigh complexity of systems created by \ninteraction of different heterogeneous\
    \ objects \nwith discrete and continuous behaviors;\n- \nNeed to integrate computing\
    \ systems with \nphysical processes and networks into \ncomplex systems;\n- \n\
    The \ninteraction \nbetween \nphysical \nprocesses, \ncomputing, \nhardware \n\
    and \nsoftware and communication networks \nrequires the compositionality of the\
    \ \ncomponents and systems.\nHaving in mind the main characteristics and \ncomponents\
    \ of the CPSs, some technologies \nthat facilitate abstract specification, conceptual\
    \ \nmodelling \nand \nvirtual \ndevelopment, \nimplementation and simulation could\
    \ be \nconsidered: Abstractions and conceptual models; \nLogical frameworks and\
    \ architecture; Functional \nand control models; Protocols, languages  \nand standards.\n\
    A Conceptual Framework for Modeling and Design of Cyber-Physical Systems\nhttp://www.sic.ici.ro\n\
    328\nThe dynamics of CPSs is complex, involving the \nstochastic nature of communication\
    \ systems, the \ndiscrete event-driven dynamics of computing \nsystems and the\
    \ continuous one of control \nsystems. Formal mathematical and information \n\
    model of CPSs must be based on multi-level \nabstraction to consider overall structural\
    \ and \nbehavioural dynamics. The mathematical \nmodelling of complex and heterogeneous\
    \ \nsystems must solve the semantic dichotomy \nbetween the continuous and the\
    \ discrete event \ndriven operation.\nOne possibility to model complex dynamics\
    \ of \nCPSs is to use hybrid automata that can capture \nboth the transition between\
    \ discrete states and \nthe evolution of continuous states over time. \nBy using\
    \ the Model of Computation (MoC) to \ndefine the rules of interaction between\
    \ actors it \nis possible to create a simple hierarchical model. \nConsidering\
    \ different MoCs including Discrete \nEvents (DE), Continuous Time (CT), Finite\
    \ State \nMachine (FSM), Synchronous Reactive (SR), \nProcess Networks (PN) and\
    \ several varieties of \ndataflow could be developed the hierarchical \ncomposition\
    \ that combine CT models with \nDE and FSM to model hybrid systems. The \nfunctional\
    \ and structural models of different \ncomponents must be completed with the \n\
    implementation details such as the underlying \nplatform and the communication\
    \ networks [3].\nThe Model- Based Design (MBD) must take into \nconsideration\
    \ three main requirements:\n- \nCompositionality:  the property of a system \n\
    to compute from local properties; \n- \nComposability:  the component properties\
    \ \nare not changing as a result of interactions \nbetween components;\n- \nHeterogeneity,\
    \ in terms of the properties that are \ncomposed and their semantic domain represent\
    \ \nthe common future of all computational \ndesign frameworks. CPSs are inherently\
    \ \nheterogeneous \nin \nstructure, \ncomponent \nbehavior and types of interactions;\
    \ they have \nthree different design layers: physical, software \nand network/platform\
    \ respectively. \nThe controllers and the desired dynamics \nof the physical processes\
    \ are modelled first \nwith physical layer abstractions, but the \ncontroller\
    \ implemented is modelled using \nsoftware layer abstractions. The software \n\
    system is deployed on a computation \nplatform modelled with network/platform\
    \  \nlayer abstraction. \nThe different abstraction layers use fundamentally \n\
    different semantics and composition concepts into \nmulti resolution hierarchical\
    \ architectures. \nThe physical layer embodies physical objects \nand the interactions\
    \ of them. On this level the \nmathematics of composition is based on linear \n\
    algebra, topology and analysis and behaviour of \nphysical object is determined\
    \ by physical laws. \nThe software layer comprises the software \ncomponents with\
    \ behaviours expressed in logical \ntime and whose interactions are modelled by\
    \ \nvarious models of computations (MoCs). \nThe network/platform layer comprises\
    \ the \nhardware side of CPS architectures (network \narchitecture and computation\
    \ platform that \ninteract with the physical components by sensors \nand actuators).\n\
    Uncertainty in wireless communication must \nbe mitigated by using the complex\
    \ protocols to \nimprove fault tolerance but the time varying delays \nintroduced\
    \ in transmission could destabilize the \ncontrol loops [17, 21]. Trust, security\
    \ and privacy \n(TSP) of Wireless Sensor Networks needs sensor \nnode security,\
    \ cryptography algorithms, key \nmanagement approaches, secure routing strategies\
    \ \nand data aggregation [14].\nFigure 3. Main problems of CPS modelling\n4. A\
    \ Conceptual Framework for \nCyber-Physical Systems\nA starting point for the\
    \ design of the conceptual \nframework is represented by the adoption of \nprinciples\
    \ from proven enterprise architectures. \nIoan Dumitrache, Ioan Stefan Sacala,\
    \ Mihnea Alexandru Moisescu, Simona Iuliana Caramihai\n \n329\nICI Bucharest ©\

    \ generic smart \nintegrative platform, based on IoT concept and \nproviding the\
    \ user with a virtual, re-configurable \necosystem of services representing devices,\
    \ \nembedded systems, networked control systems \nand smart objects, thus overcoming\
    \ inherent \nfragmentation and heterogeneity, allowing an \ninnovative approach\
    \ in supporting multiple \napplications [25].\nIn order to fulfil its goals, the\
    \ platform should \nconsider the main aspects of heterogeneity, \ncomposability\
    \ and compositionality at different \nlevels of abstraction – systems, software\
    \ \narchitecture and controller level.\nTo allow modelling and analysing cross-domain\
    \ \ninteractions among physical and computational/ \nnetworking domains and to\
    \ ensure predictability \nof the system behaviour, the platform will \nbe designed\
    \ at two main levels: abstract  \nand functional.\nThe abstract level should integrate\
    \ multi-domain \nmodels analysed in multiple levels topology and \nabstractions,\
    \ multi-scale controls integrated in \nnetworked control systems [4].  \nAt the\
    \ functional level smart objects and \nplatforms will be integrated in order to\
    \ perform \nfunctionalities required by the business model \nconceived at the\
    \ abstract level (Figure 4).\nFigure 4. Integration of the main levels  \nof the\
    \ platform\nThe most difficult aspect will be the integration \nof these levels\
    \ by mechanisms, languages and \nmethodologies that will allow the platform to\
    \ support \ndeveloping applications, analysing and validating  \nthe performances.\
    \ \nAs it will have to consider heterogeneity-different \nmathematical models,\
    \ hardware and software, \nanalogue and digital, cyber and physical, integrating\
    \ \ndifferent smart objects, the platform will have \nan Architectural Space and\
    \ a Platform resources \nlibrary defining components, composition rules, \nabstraction\
    \ rules, refinement rules and interfaces that \nidentify legal connections. From\
    \ this point of view, \ninterconnections and communication protocols will \nprove\
    \ to be very important resources.\nThe complexity and diversity of heterogeneous\
    \ \ncomponents of the platform will be managed \nby generalized operators as Grouping,\
    \ Focusing \nAttention and Combinatorial Search into \nintelligent manner. They\
    \ will act especially at the \nabstract level and define a number of refinement\
    \ \nsteps that start from the initial description to the  \nfinal implementation.\n\
    In this way it will be allowed the modelling of \ninteractions, functionalities\
    \ and implementation \nrequirements, keeping model components consistent, \npreventing\
    \ misconnection of Model Components. \nThe platform will manage the system requirements\
    \ \nand have the capacity to improve scalability \nand accuracy of model analysis\
    \ including time  \nand concurrency.\nOther aspects that must be solved are related\
    \ to \nthe co-design of physical systems and controllers, \norchestrating networked\
    \ computational resources \nwith physical systems considering time, concurrency\
    \ \nin networked, distributed computational with physical \nsystems. For such\
    \ a goal, it will be necessary to \ndefine some general metrics to asses’ verification\
    \ and  \nvalidation solutions.\nThe main characteristic of the proposed CPS \n\
    architecture is represented by the need to define \nand model a CPS layer and\
    \ to define and model \nthe relation between the Business System and the \nEnterprise\
    \ Environment in the context of CPS.\nThe proposed CPS architecture is composed\
    \ based \non a generic representation that can be extended by \na set of associated\
    \ views.\nThe first layer addresses the enterprise  \nexisting infrastructure.\n\
    The second layer addresses the enterprise as a Cyber-\nPhysical System.\nThe third\
    \ layer addresses process management, \nDecision Support Systems and Data Analytics\
    \ related \nto information associated to processes, products  \nand by-products.\n\

    330\nThe forth layer is addresses the business system, \nincluding: business intelligence\
    \ and supply  \nchain management.\nFigure 5.  Generic Architecture\nThe infrastructure\
    \ layer includes components such \nas equipment, machines, and resources.\nThe\
    \ infrastructure system organized using \ninfrastructure as a service principle\
    \ facilitates the \ndescription and access to equipment, machines as \nwell as\
    \ sensing and actuating devices [20]. \nThe Cyber-Physical System layer includes\
    \ \nthe following components: modeling, data \nacquisition, control, actuation,\
    \ management and \ncommunication. This representation allows for \nthe development\
    \ of specific system architectures, \ndata architectures as well as the connection\
    \ with \ninfrastructure architecture.\nThe main considerations related to the\
    \ modelling \ncomponent include:\n- \nModels with solve - dependent, non-\ndeterminate,\
    \ or Zeno-behaviour (CPS can be \nseen as a hybrid systems using continuous-\n\
    time models for physical processes and state \nmachines, dataflow models, synchronous/\
    \ \nreactive models and/or discrete event models \nfor computation);\n- \nKeeping\
    \ \nmodel \ncomponents \nconsistent \n(Multiple models with multiple variants\
    \ of \ncomponents must be integrated into complex \nsystems) [18];\n- \nPreventing\
    \ \nmisconnection \nof \nmodel \ncomponents \n(Errors \nthat \nappear \nwithin\
    \ \ninterconnected components must be taken into \nconsideration, as well as unit\
    \ errors, semantic \nerrors, transposition errors) [11];\n- \nModelling of interactions\
    \ of functionality and \nimplementation (The dynamics of software and \nnetworks\
    \ should be modelled accordingly);\n- \nModelling \nof \ndistributed \nand  \n\
    emergent behaviors.\nThe main considerations related to the data \ncomponent include:\
    \ data modelling, data \ninteroperability, data storage [13].\nThe data architecture\
    \ allows for the acquisition \nof sensor data, the integration of business related\
    \ \ndata and the semantic enhancement of data with \nthe aid of metadata.\nThe\
    \ main considerations related to the control \ncomponent include:\n- \nNetworked\
    \ Control Systems encompassing \ncommunication \nbetween \ncontroller \nand \n\
    physical \nsystems \nas \nwell \nas  \nbetween controllers;\n- \nThe integration\
    \ of Hybrid Systems;\n- \nReal Time Computing.\nThe main considerations related\
    \ to the \nmanagement component include: Management \nof distributed systems;\
    \ Management of Hybrid \nSystems; Real Time Scheduling; Cyber Physical \nSystems\
    \ Security.\nThe management component extends:\n- \nSensing capability: data related\
    \ to the physical \nor virtual environment [24];\n- \nIdentity: \nability \nto\
    \ \ndifferentiate \nfrom  \nother entities;\n- \nNetwork: \nability \ncommunicate\
    \ \nthe  \nacquired data;\n- \nAction capability: shaping the environment.\nThe\
    \ CPS layer is directly connected to the \nInfrastructure layer and describes\
    \ and manages \nall the entities that collect data from the physical \nenvironment\
    \ (sensors), interact with the \nenvironment (actuators) and relay the data and\
    \ \ncommands to the upper level.\nThe following requirements need to be addressed\
    \ \nin order to design the CPS layer: Agility, \nadaptability in production systems;\
    \ autonomy \nand flexibility in production systems; Self-\nconfiguring capabilities\
    \ adding or removing new \nresources or creating new task; Self-optimizing \n\
    capabilities to improve its performances, by  \ngoal-directed control.\nAn open\

    \ as a Complex Cyber – \nPhysical System\nCurrent Industrial Revolution driven\
    \ by CPS and \nIoT is expected to have a major impact on the \nfuture of agriculture\
    \ as well, as there is a natural \nrelation between industry and agriculture [1].\
    \ As \na extension of Industry 4.0 a new concept can \nbe introduced: Agriculture\
    \ 4.0.  Integration of \nmachines and equipment, increased automation, \nefficient\
    \ decisional process represents objectives \nof an agricultural enterprise facilitating\
    \ the \nadaptability to climate and market dynamics \nand perturbations and allowing\
    \ for sustainable, \necological and socially beneficial development.\nWhen addressing\
    \ the agricultural enterprise \nconcept (which will be referred subsequently,\
    \ \nin short, as “farm”) organization we must take \nA Conceptual Framework for\
    \ Modeling and Design of Cyber-Physical Systems\nhttp://www.sic.ici.ro\n332\n\
    into consideration the following agriculture \nrelated concepts [7]: Sustainable\
    \ and \nconservable Agriculture, Organic Agriculture, \nIndustrial Agriculture,\
    \ as well as Community  \nSupported Agriculture.\nAlso, in accordance with an\
    \ EU Agricultural and \nRural Development Study “Precision Agriculture \n(PA)\
    \ is a whole-farm management approach using \ninformation technology, satellite\
    \ positioning \n(GNSS) data, remote sensing and proximal data \ngathering. These\
    \ technologies have the goal of \noptimizing returns on inputs whilst potentially\
    \ \nreducing environmental impacts.” [4].\nIn Figure 7, a vision of farm components\
    \ is \npresented, focusing on resources, processes \nand products. The general\
    \ farm representation \nis assumed considering both animal and \nvegetal products\
    \ and, consequently, the three \nmajor components that need to be need to be \n\
    addressed when considering a paradigm shift in  \nfarm organization:\nFigure 7.\
    \ Main components and activities of a \ngeneric farm\nIntegrating and processing\
    \ the data regarding the \ncrops, the soil and the agricultural production \n\
    can and should assure the efficient exploitation \nof the agricultural fields,\
    \ the soil and an optimal \nhydration through a real-time intelligent  \ncontrol\
    \ system. \nAgriculture organizations need to address \nthe problem of complex\
    \ systems in relation \nto emerging paradigms such as Internet of \nThings and\
    \ Cyber Physical Systems. CPS are \nvery important in assuring optimal control,\
    \ by \nconnecting intelligent sensor networks.\nAlso, in the logistics field,\
    \ new opportunities \narise in the area of intelligent objects, ensuring \nthe\
    \ optimal level of real-time monitoring of the \nobjects’ state and place.\nIntegration\
    \ CPS in Agriculture Organizations must \ntake into consideration: \n- \nComponents\
    \ heterogeneity and complexity \nthat require new models and representation \n\
    languages in order to allow interoperability \nand composition;\n- \nNatural agents\
    \ interaction (human operators) \nwith hardware and software agents;\n- \nUncertainties\
    \ existing in complex systems, \ngenerated by the physical processes and \ncommunication\
    \ networks;\n- \nPerformance \nmeasuring \nand \nvalidation \nsystems, \ntaking\
    \ \ninto \nconsideration  \nnew metrics.\nWe can identify three major farm subsystems\
    \ in \naccordance with the product type: \n- \nThe soil management subsystem,\
    \ which \nincludes all the general aspects related to \nculture and pasture planning,\
    \ fertilization \nand soil humidity monitoring and control, \nwith respect to\
    \ actual conditions, weather \nforecasts, market predictions, enterprise goals\
    \ \nand production techniques and technologies;\n- \nThe plant management sub-system,\
    \ which \ndeals with the implementation of goals settled \nby the soil management\
    \ sub-system for crops; \nit takes into account aspects related to plant \nselection,\
    \ work planning in accordance with \nthe crop specificities and soil quality and\
    \ \nupdated according with weather conditions, \nplant health and so on;\n- \n\
    The livestock management sub-system, with \nsimilar goals, but related to animals.\n\
    Smart Farming includes the following areas of \ninterest: Sensor system, Traceability,\
    \ Smart agri-\nlogistics, Smart food awareness.\nBy using a suitable selection\
    \ of machines, an \nincreased automation degree, efficient exploitation \nof multi-annual\
    \ databases in the decisional \nprocess, the objective of an agricultural enterprise,\
    \ \nwith real capabilities of self-reconfiguration and \nadaptation at environmental,\
    \ weather and market \ndynamics and perturbations, can be achieved.\nThe architecture\
    \ of the agricultural enterprise is \ncomposed of a generic representation and\

    SHARE Abstract This study investigates the distributed stochastic model predictive
    control (DSMPC) algorithm design for a class of networked subsystems with stochastic
    disturbances and coupled probabilistic constraints, differently from the existing
    work, the network-induced imperfections such as time-varying delays and quantisation
    process are considered. A probabilistic constraint handling strategy and a novel
    DSMPC implementation algorithm are presented. In addition, according to the probabilistic
    distribution of the uncertainties, the probabilistic constraints are transformed
    into a set of determinate constraints. Although the closed-loop system is affected
    by the time-varying delays and quantisation process, the quadratic stability of
    the closed-loop system and the feasibility of the optimisation problem can still
    be guaranteed with the developed algorithm. Finally, a numerical example is provided
    to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results. 1 Introduction Stochastic
    model predictive control (SMPC) has been an active research area in the past decade,
    especially for large-scale industrial systems. Compared with robust MPC (RMPC),
    SMPC not only takes into account the stochastic characteristics of the uncertainties
    but also allows violations of constraints, although such violations are required
    to satisfy probabilistic constraints [1–3]. An important property of probabilistic
    constraints is that it enables SMPC to contain the tradeoff between the satisfaction
    of constraints and control performance, thus, the conservatism of RMPC [4–7] can
    be reduced. A soft constraint approach was proposed for constrained SMPC of linear
    systems with multiplicative noise in [8], where an online optimisation problem
    was given to penalise constraint violations. Based on a dynamic model, an SMPC
    of the air-fuel ratio was designed using MPC theoretic framework of Markovian
    jump systems in [9], where the advantages of SMPC controller were shown. However,
    centralised MPC was utilised in these works and probabilistic constraints were
    not included in the MPC design. Up to date, there are three major methods for
    single-system SMPC, such as stochastic tube methods [10, 11], affine parameterisation
    methods [12, 13] and sample-based methods [14, 15]. The stochastic tube method
    is more flexible for distributed systems compared with the other two methods,
    this method was used in [10] to deal with the probabilistic constraints, and a
    necessary and sufficient condition was proposed to ensure the satisfaction of
    the probabilistic constraints. An SMPC strategy similar to nominal MPC was presented
    in [11] to deal with the probabilistic constraints, the cross-sectional shape
    of a tube contains predicted trajectories was fixed but the centre and scale are
    allowed to vary. However, the results of [10, 11] are limited to single system
    case, therefore, additional techniques are needed to generalise these results
    to distributed systems. Distributed MPC (DMPC) is a further development of MPC
    technique for large-scale engineering systems such as chemical plant [16], process
    control [17], motorcade [18], the computational complexity and information exchange
    rate among subsystems are reduced with DMPC compared with centralised MPC. Moreover,
    it is motivated to generalise a distributed system framework to large-scale systems
    with uncertainties, that is DSMPC or DRMPC. In [19], a novel form of DRMPC for
    multiple dynamically decoupled subsystems with disturbances was presented, and
    the coupling constraints were guaranteed to be satisfied. The results were further
    extended to a class of linear stochastic subsystems subject to additive disturbances
    and coupling probabilistic constraints in [20], and less conservative results
    were obtained. Moreover, in [17], a cooperative DSMPC algorithm for dynamic decoupled
    subsystems with unmeasurable states was presented. Although the network between
    subsystems was considered in [19–21], the networks-induced constraints such as
    time-varying delays and quantisation process were not taken into account. Since
    the subsystems are connected through networks, the time-varying delays it takes
    for the information transmission are inevitable. There have been many literature
    that focused on time-varying delay-induced problems, for instance, the stability
    of continuous-time positive systems with time-varying delays was considered in
    [22]. For a class of discrete uncertain systems with time-varying delays, input
    constraints and normbounded non-linear perturbations, an RMPC algorithm was proposed
    in [23] to compute the state feedback control law by minimising the upper bound
    of the cost function. However, the existing methods cannot be directly applied
    to distributed systems with coupling probabilistic constraints, hence, how to
    deal with time-varying delays in networked systems with probabilistic constraints
    is one of the motivations of this paper. In addition, another network-induced
    problem is network congestion, one of the methods to deal with this problem is
    the quantisation process. There are many kinds of quantisers, such as uniform
    scalar quantisers [24], logarithmic quantisers [25], hysteresis quantisers [26]
    and arbitrary region quantisers [27]. In this paper, a kind of arbitrary region
    quantisers is considered. This class of quantisers were used to obtain the effective
    values of the signals in communication channels [28, 29]. Based on the zoom strategy,
    sufficient conditions were given to ensure the stability of the closed-loop quantised
    networked control system. Therefore,the zoom quantisation strategy is considered
    in this paper to alleviate network congestion. Motivated by the aforementioned
    discussions, in this paper, we consider the DSMPC for networked systems with multiple
    dynamically decoupled subsystems subject to stochastic disturbances, coupling
    probabilistic constraints and network-induced constraints such as time-varying
    delays and quantisation processes. With the proposed Probabilistic Constraint
    Handling Strategy and DSMPC algorithm, the stochastic quadratic stability of the
    entire networked system can be guaranteed. The main contributions are summarised
    as follows. DSMPC for linear systems with network-induced imperfections is studied.
    Time-varying delays and quantisation are considered in this work while they were
    not considered in [20], since these imperfections introduce some difficulties
    for stability analysis and DSMPC design. Therefore, the obtained results in this
    paper are more practical. Though the network-induced imperfections such as time-delay
    and quantisation bring negative influences to the system performance, with the
    proposed DSMPC algorithm, the desired system performance can be guaranteed and
    is comparable to the results in [20]. Recursive feasibility of the optimisation
    problem, and quadratic stability of the overall system are guaranteed even in
    the presence of stochastic uncertainties, time-varying delays and quantisation.
    The rest of this paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, problem statement
    and some preliminaries are given. In Section 3, the main results including quantiser
    parameter design, probabilistic constraints handling strategy and recursive feasibility,
    optimisation problem formulation and distributed implementation algorithm and
    stability analysis are presented. A numerical example is presented to illustrate
    the validity of the proposed DSMPC algorithm in Section 4. Section 5 concludes

    In this section, we introduce the networked system subject to probabilistic constraints
    and stochastic disturbances, and then provide problem statement. The networked
    system configuration is given in Fig. 1. In this paper, we mainly consider the
    network between subsystem controllers, the network between subsystems is not considered.
    However, if each subsystem also communicates via a network, it is an interesting
    research topic and will make the DSMPC design be more difficult, we will consider
    this topic in our future work. Fig. 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Structure
    of the networked system 2.1 Subsystem model Let where is the number of subsystems.
    For all , the dynamics of each subsystem p is described by (1) where , and represent
    the state, input and stochastic disturbance of the subsystem p, respectively.
    The distribution of the i th element of has the form (2) where and . Note that
    each element is truncated from a Gaussian distribution, according to the characteristics
    of truncated Gaussian, the values of is subject to Gaussian random distribution,
    such that the exact values cannot present. Remark 1.The disturbances are unavoidable
    in engineering practice, and they can be induced by many factors such as variations
    of concentration, temperature, humidity etc. In this paper, we consider stochastic
    disturbances with a certain probability, which can be used to simulate the actual
    control process of engineering and has more practical significance. To proceed
    with, we need the following assumptions, which are quite standard. Assumption
    1.Each subsystem has a priori knowledge of model parameters related to all other
    subsystems. Such as system parameters , , , stable controller gain , constraint
    parameters , , , and probability distribution information of random disturbances
    . Assumption 2.Stochastic disturbances are independent and identically distributed
    for each subsystem p, the elements of have zero mean and the distribution function
    is assumed to be continuous. 2.2 Probabilistic constraints The output is given
    as follows: (3) Each subsystem p is subject to a local probabilistic constraint
    on an output which has the form (4) Also assume that there are coupled probabilistic
    constraints across multiple subsystems, and the coupled output has the form (5)
    Each subsystem p is subject to a coupled probabilistic constraint on a coupled
    output which has the form (6) The row vectors , fixed scalars and thresholds are
    all chosen by the designer in advance. The form of (6) is very general, which
    permits coupling to exist between any number of subsystems. And the case of hard
    constraints is treated simply by setting and in (4) and (6). Remark 2.With respect
    to the probabilistic constraint problem considered in this paper, multi-agent
    systems can be viewed as a practical example. Each agent is viewed as a subsystem
    in a distributed system, in which the actuator has a rectangular pressure vessels
    component. The mathematical model of the rectangular pressure vessels component
    is established by using the relevant mathematical theory and optimisation principle.
    The constraints that directly lead to the failure of the vessels are viewed as
    probability constraints, and there are networks between the multi-agent systems,
    such that, the sum of the constraints that directly lead to failure of the vessels
    are defined as the coupled probability constraints. Remark 3.Since has an effect
    on the system states and output, and the stochastic disturbance is subordinate
    to a certain probability distribution, the system output was related to the probability
    of the stochastic disturbance. 2.3 DSMPC controller The DSMPC controller at time
    k is designed as follows, which includes linear state feedback and a decision
    variable (7) where is a linear state feedback gain matrix such that is strictly
    stable, which is determined off-line. For a selected finite prediction horizons
    N, is the decision variable for and for . Remark 4.In this section, we define
    the input sequence by means of the idea of the dual-mode controller, that is,
    the first N steps of the input sequence are free, while the input in the subsequent
    infinite predictive time domain is just a state feedback law. 2.4 Communication
    channel In this paper, the channel received information from the other subsystems
    is defined as reception channel, and the channel sent information to the other
    subsystems is defined as sending channel. The time-varying delays in the reception
    channel at time k are defined as and the time-varying delays in the sending channel
    at time k are defined as . The upper bound of time-varying delays is less than
    prediction horizons N. Remark 5.The time-varying delays are inevitable in real
    networks, one of the advantages of this paper is that it is more practical compared
    with [20], though only the time-varying delays among controllers is considered.
    The case of time-varying delays existing among both the controllers and subsystems
    will be our further research topic. 2.5 Quantiser design Considering the large
    computational load of the model predictive control algorithm, it will also increase
    the network burden. Compared with [20, 21], this paper proposes a quantised strategy
    to deal with network data, which can make better use of network resources and
    ease the network burden. Therefore, it is more practical to consider the strategy
    of quantisation on the basis of [20, 21]. It is an effective way of using quantisation
    to improve network congestion. Quantisation reduces the burden of networks to
    a large extent. Quantisation is to take a reasonable value to accurate data, so
    there is a certain error between the quantised value and the exact value. In this
    paper, the quantiser is chosen as (8) where , . With rectangular quantisation
    area, is a piecewise constant valued function which is satisfied with the following
    two conditions: If , If . Obviously, with arbitrary shape quantisation region,
    uniform quantiser is also satisfied with the following two conditions: If , If
    , where M and represent saturation value and sensitivity of the quantiser, respectively.
    The quantisation of the state information transmitted to controllers is to save
    network resources. For space limitations, how to obtain the aforementioned conditions
    is not given here and can be referred to [28, 29], and the parameter matrix (see
    [28, 29]) will be presented in Theorem 1. Using the Zooming-out strategy in [28,
    29], we can get that quantiser (8) is not saturate. Furthermore, based on condition
    iii, there are (9) (10) where are the state quantisation error and the decision
    variable quantisation error, respectively. Before using the zoom policy, we denote
    as a quantisation period and , note that e is natural constant, when or , and
    when , when . According to the zoom-in strategy, the value of decreases monotonously
    with the raise of k when or . Therefore the quantisation error and are gradually
    reduced to 0 by the Zoom-in strategy. Remark 6.Some other quantisers (such as
    uniform quantisers, logarithmic quantisers etc.) that only consider quantitative
    data but cannot guarantee the stability of the designed quantiser itself. In contrast
    with these quantisers, based on the zoom strategy, sufficient conditions are given
    to ensure the stability of the quantiser itself and the zoom quantiser can make
    better use of network resources and reduce the network burden. Therefore, the
    zoom quantiser is more practical than other types of quantisers. The following
    definitions are given to demonstrate coupled relationships in subsystems. Definition
    1.A set composed of all subsystems associated with a coupled constraint c is defined
    as A set composed of all coupled constraints associated with subsystem p is shown
    as A set composed of all subsystems coupled with the subsystem p is given as Definition
    2.If the entire closed-loop control system as shown in Fig. 1 satisfies the following
    condition: (11) with , are two known weight matrices and a non-zero limit value
    , then the entire closed-loop control system is quadratically stable. We are now
    in a position to address the problem considered in this paper. Consider the networked
    systems configuration as shown in Fig. 1, the objective is to design the decision
    variable via solving the optimisation problem (8), such that the networked system
    is quadratic stability with guaranteed probabilistic constraints. 3 Main results
    In this section, DSMPC is proposed for the networked system. Moreover, recursive
    feasibility and globally quadratic stability are presented for the system. 3.1
    Quantiser parameter design The main purpose of this subsection is to design the
    important parameters of the quantiser, and the parameter matrix is obtained by
    solving the linear matrix inequality. Theorem 1.Consider the linear subsystem
    (1) and the DSMPC controller (7). If there is a matrix such that the following
    matrix inequality holds: (12) where , then, . Proof.The proof is similar to the
    proof of Theorem 1 in [28], and it omitted here due to space limitation. □ Remark
    7.Adding quantiser to the subsystem to alleviate the network burden is one of
    the main contributions of this paper. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that
    the quantiser is stable. Because as long as we get the value of matrix through
    linear matrix inequality (12), then we can guarantee that the quantiser is stable
    [28]. 3.2 Probabilistic constraints handling strategy and recursive feasibility
    The focus of this paper is to deal with probabilistic constraints, that is, to
    transform the uncertain probabilistic constraints into deterministic probability
    constraints. The following theorem presents the handing strategy of probabilistic
    constraints and can guarantee the feasibility of the optimisation problem defined
    in the next subsection. Theorem 2.When the subsystem updates, if the decision
    variable sequence satisfies the following recursive feasible constraint conditions
    for , and , the probabilistic constraint conditions (4) and (6) can be guaranteed
    (13) (14) where the matrix S is a shift matrix and the variable will be defined
    in the following proof. Note that the values of and , are not dependent on the
    decision variable sequence . Therefore they appear as fixed values in (14), denoted
    by . The optimising subsystem p needs to get the values of and for all subsystems
    ahead of time. Moreover, and are defined as the maximum values of the i th columns
    of the matrices and , respectively. The matrices and are given as where Furthermore,
    if conditions (13) and (14) are feasible at time k, then (13) and (14) will be
    feasible at the times . Proof.See Appendix 1. □ 3.3 Optimisation problem formulation
    and distributed implementation algorithm For , suppose that and are known for
    subsystem p, respectively. The local optimisation problem subjects to probabilistic
    constraints (13), (14) is formulated as (15) where and subject to , where the
    inner approximation is obtained from the result in [30]. The optimisation problem
    subjects to the constraints (4) and (6), where with and are two known weight matrices.
    Take a decision variable sequence as When there exists time-varying delays in
    either reception channel or sending channel, a feasible decision variable sequence
    will be applied to the actuator, which is the tails of their previous decision
    variable sequence augmented with . A decision variable set is shown as follows:
    A non-zero limit value is used to guarantee that the cost is finite over an infinite
    horizon, which can be derived using results in [31]. Note that the cost function
    in (15) is expressed as a quadratic function depending on the decision variables
    . Moreover, conditions (13), (14) are affine functions which indicate that the
    terminal set is a polyhedron. Therefore, the local optimisation problem can be
    converted into a quadratic programming problem and a new algorithm is proposed
    to solve this quadratic programming problem. The proposed DSMPC algorithm is presented
    as follows. Remark 8.Denote as the time frequency function, as the auxiliary complexity
    function, as the time complexity function. From Algorithm 1 (see Fig. 2), we can
    see that the function for the offline step, for (1)–(3) of the online step, and
    for (4) of the online step. Thus, the total complexity function for online step
    is . By ignoring the coefficient of the highest power and the constant term, we
    can get the total complexity of Algorithm 1 (Fig. 2) is , it can be seen that
    the proposed algorithm is not too complex to be implemented in practice. Fig.
    2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Algorithm 1 DSMPC algorithm 3.4 Stability analysis
    Recursive feasibility of subsequent optimisation problem is guaranteed by Theorem
    2. In this subsection, the overall closed-loop stability of the entire system
    is verified by the following theorem. Theorem 3.If there exists a feasible solution
    for the initial optimisation problem for each subsystem . The optimisation problem
    is feasible for each subsystem for based on Algorithm 1 (Fig. 2). Moreover, the
    probabilistic constraints (4) and (6) are guaranteed for subsystem p. Furthermore,
    for any choice of update sequences, the overall closed-loop system satisfies the
    quadratic stability condition (11) in Definition 2, therefore, the entire closed-loop
    system is quadratically stable. Proof.See Appendix 1. □ 4 Numerical example In
    this section, a numerical example is provided to show the effectiveness of the
    proposed results. In particular, consider three identical subsystems with the
    system matrices described as There are four probabilistic constraints, including
    three local probabilistic constraints and a state-coupled probabilistic constraint.
    The constraint parameters are given as follows , , , , , , and , , . Each subsystem
    subjects to a series of stochastic disturbances, and the disturbances are independent
    and identical. Each element is truncated from a Gaussian distribution with zero
    mean and variance and satisfies for . The feedback gain is taken as , which is
    the LQ-optimal gain for the given subsystem model. The prediction horizons N and
    are selected as and , respectively. Optimisation update sequence uses simple sequential
    optimisation sequence . The objective is to drive system state to converge to
    a small neighbourhood of origin. The weight matrices Q and R in cost function
    are taken as and . The parameters of the time-varying delays and the quantiser

    In Fig. 9, CSubsystems 1–3 denote the state trajectories of subsystems based on
    Algorithm 1 (Fig. 2) and NSubsystems 1–3 denote the state trajectories of subsystems
    based on unconstrained optimal control. Note that the black straight line represents
    the local constraint of subsystems 1–3. Obviously, the state trajectories based
    on Algorithm 1 (Fig. 2) satisfy the local constraint under a certain probability,
    but the state trajectories based on unconstrained optimal control violate the
    local constraint at the beginning stage. In Fig. 10, CCoupling state represents
    the coupling state trajectory of subsystems based on Algorithm 1 (Fig. 2) and
    NCoupling state represents the coupling state trajectory of subsystems based on
    unconstrained optimal control. The black dashed line represents the coupling constraint
    of the homogeneous subsystems. According to Fig. 10, the coupling state trajectory
    based on Algorithm 1 (Fig. 2) satisfies the coupling constraint with a certain
    probability. However, the coupling state trajectory based on unconstrained optimal
    control violates the coupling constraint from the beginning. In contrast with
    [20], the advantages of the proposed algorithm in this paper are that both time-varying
    delays and quantisation effects are considered, thus, the designed algorithm in
    this paper is more practicable and appropriate. To clearly show the advantages
    of the proposed algorithm, we consider a networked system with time-varying delays
    and quantisation, and both the algorithm in [20] and the proposed algorithm in
    this paper are applied to this system. The simulation results with the algorithm
    in [20] is presented in Figs. 11 and 12, where it is shown that the system states
    have large fluctuations in the presence of time-varying delays and quantisation
    processes, thus, it can be seen that the algorithm in [20] is not appropriate
    for networked systems with network-induced constraints. By contrast, the proposed
    algorithm in this paper can not only deal with the coupling constraints but also
    lead to so small system states fluctuations under network-induced constraints.
    Large fluctuations bring difficulties for implementation in physical, therefore,
    by comparison, it is shown that the proposed algorithm in this paper is more practical
    than the algorithm in [20]. Fig. 11 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Closed-loop

    sum of states with Algorithm 1 in [20] in the presence of time-varying delays
    In this example, the performance index is taken as the weighted sum of local costs
    for each subsystem during the entire simulation period. The average cumulative
    cost of 5000 simulations with Algorithm 1 (Fig. 2) is 767.88, the average cumulative
    cost of 5000 simulations with unconstraint optimal control is 648.07. The unconstrained
    optimal control achieves a lower value of the average cost cumulative at the expense
    of violating the probabilistic constraints. However, due to the constraints in
    practice are inevitable, it is concluded that the Algorithm 1 (Fig. 2) can not
    only obey the constraints but also achieves almost the same performance as unconstrained
    optimal control. Based on the above analysis and compared with [20], it has been
    shown that the proposed algorithm is effective for systems with time-varying delays
    and quantisation processes. 5 Conclusion In this paper, a DSMPC algorithm has
    been proposed for a class of networked subsystems with time-varying delays and
    quantisation processes. The quantisation method has been used to alleviate network
    congestion. Furthermore, recursive feasibility of the optimisation problem has
    been guaranteed and quadratic stability of the closed system has also been ensured.
    Finally, a numerical example has been given to illustrate the validity of the
    proposed DSMPC algorithm. In our future work, we will further consider the network
    between subsystems in addition to the network between controllers, and applying
    the proposed DSMPC algorithm to multi-agent systems is also an interesting research
    topic. 7 Appendix 7.1 Proof of Theorem 2 For a subsystem , the state trajectories
    predicted at time k are decomposed into two components, the nominal one and the
    uncertain one , which are formulated as (17) (18) (19) where and initial conditions
    for are and (since the state at time k is known). An output predicted at time
    k is given as Because is defined as the maximum of the i th column of matrix ,
    constraint (13) is equivalent to constraint . By (5), there exists the coupling
    output Let (20) (21) where and are the minimum values that satisfy (20) and (21).
    Then it is obtained that (22) (23) From (20)–(23), it is implied that the probabilistic
    constraints (4) and (6) are guaranteed for the entire prediction horizons at time
    k. Note that there is no guarantee for the decision variable sequence at time
    , to satisfy conditions (22) and (23) when the decision variable sequence satisfy
    (22) and (23) at time k. There are two cases of the predictive state at time .
    When the subsystem p is not updating at time k, the predicted state is shown as
    (24) (25) (26) where (27) (28) When the subsystem p is updating at time k, the
    state predicted at time is represented as (29) Therefore, when the subsystem p
    is updating, the predicted output is obtained (30) Moreover, the sum of coupling
    output predicted at time is expressed as (31) where is known as the worst-case
    value of . In addition, if the stochastic disturbances are assumed to have bound,
    then it is not difficult to obtain that the worst case of is a limited value.
    Let and where and are two maximum element values of the i th column for the two
    matrices and , respectively. If and are defined as the i th element of the first
    row of matrices and , then constraints (13) and (14) are equivalent to constraints
    (22) and (23), so is the feasible solution at time k. At updating time , condition
    (13) and (14) are equivalent to conditions (22) and (23) for subsystem p, respectively.
    At time , in (30) and (31) is replaced by the maximum value corresponding to all
    possible values of the stochastic disturbances . Then the i th elements of the
    second row in matrices and are obtained. Therefore, feasibility of at time is
    guaranteed. Similarly, feasibility of at time is ensured by the worst value of
    in (30) and (31). If and are chosen according to Theorem 2, then conditions (13)
    and (14) guarantee that there exist feasible solutions for the optimisation problem
    (15) at any time. Moreover considering quantisation process, the constraints (13)
    and (14) are naturally obtained by replacing and with and , respectively. This
    completes the proof. 7.2 Proof of Theorem 3 To consider closed-loop stability,
    the global cost is defined as the summation of the local cost of each subsystem
    . Assume that is a feasible solution at time k and the corresponding local cost
    is for subsystem . By Algorithm 1 (Fig. 2), the optimising subsystem obtains its
    optimal solution by solving at time . At the same time, other subsystems adopt
    their respective candidate solutions , and is the last updated time. Thus, the
    global cost at time is given as (32) Taking expectation on both sides of (32),
    it follows that: (33) where is the global cost that each subsystem adopts their
    respective candidate plans . Since is a known feasible solution at time for subsystem
    , therefore, according to the optimisation principle, the cost associated with
    is an upper-bound of the optimal cost. There exists (34) By inequality (34), one
    has that (35) Since is a feasible solution at time , it can be inferred from (15)
    that (36) Summing (36) over and taking expectation on both sides, there exists
    (37) According to equality (37), inequality (35) can be rewritten as (38) Summing
    (38) over , there exists (39) Because the finite is bounded and can be expressed
    as a quadratic function and function exists the lower bound, therefore inequality
    (39) shows that the quadratic stability condition (11) holds, which completes
    the proof. 6 References Citing Literature Volume14, Issue3 February 2020 Pages

    have become the main subjects of different studies in the last decades, due to
    their high influence on crop performance indicators. This study presents the most
    important parameters that have to be monitored in an irrigation management system
    and the most important ones are synthesized: air moisture and temperature, soil
    air and moisture, evapotranspiration. Based on the monitoring of these parameters,
    different control strategies and methods can be applied for optimization and efficiency
    of irrigation systems. The synthesis in this paper starts with classical control
    systems and, also, advanced methods such as fuzzy concept, decision support systems
    and model predictive control. Considering the currently necessity of integration
    into the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) concept, the paper finally proposes an irrigation
    control system for vineyards. The SCADA architecture is suitable for the Romanian
    context, it allows flexibility and ease of use and it reduced both energy consumption
    and irrigation operation costs. Published in: 2017 9th IEEE International Conference

    IEEE Conference Location: Bucharest, Romania SECTION I. Introduction Irrigation
    quality is a crop performance indicator, its influence being realized both directly
    and indirectly. If we refer to the high quantity of water that crops need, we
    see it as a direct influence factor, as soon as its indirectly role could be seen
    in the influence on the other nutrients availability and on the timing of cultural
    operations. Irrigation requirements are very different from a region to another,
    thus energy efficiency and economic use of water resources depend on a function
    of soil and crop type, climate and moisture [20]. Many factors influence the potential
    water-use efficiency. The meaning of the word potential refers to the maximum
    water-use efficiency that can be achieved when the system is operated properly.
    Global temperature has increased with 0.2-0.3 [ºC] in the last 30 years. The growing
    season in viticulture is very influenced by high or low temperatures. [17] has
    shown that for a 1, 2 or 3 [ºC] rise of temperature, it will also be a crop water
    demand increase with 11%, 19% and even 29%. This paper presents an energy efficient
    proposed system for irrigation management in vineyards. To understand the system
    structure, section II presents the monitored parameters with a huge influence
    on crop productivity. Section III show the main advanced control methods currently
    used in irrigation management, due to the necessity of an advanced irrigation
    system able to manage the installation and receive alerts. The integrated automation
    and telemetry solution for irrigation management in precision agriculture considering
    criteria to energy efficiency and economics, along with the latest control technologies
    is proposed in section IV. SECTION II. Monitored Parameters in Irrigation Management
    Precision of measurements is of high importance in vineyards productivity, modern
    techniques frequently used is focused on the optimization of the oenological potential
    that vineyards have. Precision viticulture is characterized by a crop that is
    dependent of a specific region climate and soil type. This dependence expresses
    the weather influence in vineyards and some of the arguments that support this
    idea are: Daily temperature trend has a huge influence on the grape quality and,
    consequently, on wine [15]; Bunch temperature offers an information related to
    the phenolic compounds maturation [16]; Solar radiation has an impact on phenolic
    compound biosynthesis [18]. A. Air Moisture and Temperature Crop is certainly
    a function of temperature if water is available for optimum satisfaction [1].
    Temperature has a great influence on seeds germination. Due to the biochemical
    processes, the germination phases that include hydration and enzyme activation,
    its degradation and embryo growth are temperature dependent. Validated arguments
    that show the necessity of temperature monitoring are: From 5 to 37 [ºC], the
    rate of photosynthesis is doubled at every 10 [ºC] increase in temperature; The
    respiration rate becomes double at each 10 °C above the optimum temperature; The
    minimum threshold is the temperature below which no growth is possible. Relative
    humidity offers an information regarding the water vapor that is in the air, this
    parameter being in a strong dependence with temperature. Dew point temperature
    explains this dependence, because temperature goes down when the relative humidity
    increases and if the temperature gets cold enough, the air gets to the point in
    which it holds the highest quantity of water vapors. Due to these arguments, air
    moisture and temperature must be monitored in an irrigation management system.
    B. Soil Moisture and Temperature Soil is also very important in irrigation management
    as it is a major source of atmospheric C O 2 and a storage reservoir for carbon
    with soil moisture being a driving force. Some advantages of soil moisture monitoring
    are: The influence in temperature and weather forecasting, due to the fact that
    it has an rise of the evaporation rate that increases the temperature [3]; The
    increasement of the humidity caused by the evaporation rate of the soil moisture
    that increases the dew point; The dependence between temperature and precipitation.
    This is highlighted by the low pressure systems that will condense if air moisture
    is due to the soil moisture evaporation. The result is precipitation occurrence.
    Irrigation management is of high importance in a vineyard. In many regions, growers
    apply irrigations when soil moisture is above an established limit (for example
    50%). Soil moisture is also important because it indirectly influences irrigation
    (the water application and movement across the field, assuring the intake rate).
    The application rate depends of sprinkler and low-volume methods such as deep
    and micro-sprinkles that uses mechanical devices as nozzles [5]. Water that is
    lost by evaporation could be saved by an efficient irrigation appliance capable
    of reducing evaporation with 5 to 15 % depending of the frequency that is used.
    Irrigation without soil moisture monitoring is not indicated, due to the fact
    that this parameter has an influence in the balance between canopy size and fruitfulness
    [19]. The main objective of irrigation is to optimize the plant water stress and
    this could be done by an efficient soil moisture monitoring. The readings of soil
    moisture sensor are temperature dependent and field measured resistance needs
    correction when some differences appear between calibration and field measurements.
    Soil temperature monitoring is influenced in an important proportion by solar
    radiation and humidity. It is considered that soil temperature should be measured
    by sensors that have no moving parts and that do not need calibration. C. Evapotranspiration
    A very important parameter for crop growth and health is evapotranspiration. This
    irrigation management variable is computed based on weather information (air temperature
    and humidity, wind speed etc.). Explanation of the interdependence existing among
    evapotranspiration and meteorological data collected from on-site weather stations
    is offered by using Penman-Monteith method [13]. E T 0 = 0.408Δ( R n −G)+γ 900

    View Source SECTION III. Control Strategies for Irrigation Systems Based on the
    monitoring of several parameters, as seen in chapter II, different control strategies
    and methods can be applied for optimization and efficiency of irrigation systems.
    Different approaches can be used for designing the control strategy in drip irrigation
    systems: constant open-loop control, open loop on/off, feedback control, [23].
    A. Classical PID Control Classical control methods such as proportional, integral
    and derivative methods show good results, Fig. 1. Figure 1. Classical control
    system Show All In [21] a discrete PID controller is used to control an open irrigation
    channel. The actuator is the opening gate and the controller provides the signal
    for position of this gate. PID control is used in [22] in a modified manner, with
    a constrained integral function, and the goal is supplying the appropriate amount
    of water to meet the needs of the plant during the diurnal cycle. A diagram of
    the PID control for soil moisture in dripping irrigation system is presented in
    Fig. 2. The controller computes the command signal based on the error between
    the measured soil moisture from the transducer and the reference one. The actuator
    is represented by a control relay that acts on the water supply valve. Considering
    the varying solar radiation levels, the controller can still follow the soil moisture
    reference, which proved this classical method gives good results. Figure 2. Soil
    moisture PID control Show All B. Fuzzy Control Systems Fuzzy control is a strategy
    used for irrigation management considering several controlled parameters: soil
    moisture, water supply, loss minimization etc. The general architecture for fuzzy
    control of soil humidity is presented in [24], Fig. 3. The water supply is assured
    through a reservoir house height acts as actuating variable h . The soil moisture
    error is the difference between measured soil moisture and the reference one.
    The system has a variable reference depending on the stage of growth of the plant.
    Figure 3. Fuzzy control architecture Show All The soil humidity error''s membership
    function assignment, which is of high importance in fuzzy control, is based on
    the rule that the higher sensitivity membership for little error and the fine
    stability membership for larger error. Totally, there were 16 fuzzy rules in this
    system. C. Decision Support Systems In [6], a decision support system (DSS) is
    proposed for water supply prediction and control. This system collects data from
    a specific weather station. Then, collected data and weather predictions from
    three different sources are analyzed and the result is an evapotranspiration prediction
    and an estimation of plant daily development forecast for the next 10 days. A
    water distribution planning solution is proposed in [8] for irrigation in an arid
    district. Optimal water delivery scheduling for irrigation canals is implemented
    through a DSS system. The DSS structure consists of a water demand module, a supply
    module and a planning module, Fig. 4. Figure 4. DSS architecture for water supply
    scheduling, [8] Show All D. Model Predictive Control Model predictive control
    (MPC) approach is common used in industry offering a number of features: is robust
    against uncertainty system constraints can be handled is easy to accomplish tuning
    is used in multivariable control applications In MPC control strategy the future
    evolution control sequence of the system is determined based on system model by
    minimizing a cost function. The cost function is obtained by minimizing the deviation
    from set points over the prediction horizon, Fig. 5. Figure 5. MPC control Show
    All In [25] a Model Predictive Control framework for real-time irrigation scheduling
    is developed. A state space formulation of the water balance model is developed.
    The accuracy of the water balance approach is affected by uncertain measurements,
    such as evapotranspiration and precipitation and constraints such as limited water.
    The soil moisture deficit set-point tracking is accomplished by the MPC controller.
    The MPC controller also incorporates input and output constraints. The controller
    successfully tracks the commanded set-point as well as meets the constraints.
    SECTION IV. Proposed System for Irrigation Control in Vineyards Irrigation control
    strategies should be integrated in complex automation and telemetry systems. There
    are several such systems in the world, adapted on specific crops and weather.
    Two of the implemented irrigation management systems are presented further. The
    Advanced Scientific Irrigation Management application is a complex SCADA systems
    used for optimization irrigation in an arid district in USA, [6]. In order to
    implement the irrigation program, it is used a 6 six days sample code for each
    of the 369 parcels. Then, code is transferred to the SCADA master system which
    controls the 93 RTU stations by radio communications. Irrigation channels are
    controlled by a Decision Support System (DSS), as described in section III. Advantages
    of this system should be summarized as the overcome of water infiltrations, water
    costs, water-supply shortages, some specific irrigation issues. In [7] an implementation
    of an automated irrigation system, installed in Australia is presented. Efficiency
    of the irrigation system can be improved by an information infrastructure including
    sensors, actuators and supervisory control and data acquisition communication
    network. The task of the supervisory control is to ensure that the physical flow
    capacities are not exceeded. An irrigation system model is constructed based on
    the interconnection of the individual pool models. In order to achieve an entire
    irrigation system under closed loop control where water orders are met in real
    time on demand, the research and development effort has focused on controlling
    water quantity and quality in open channels. Due to knowledge and existing technologies
    in the third wave of the information processing, communication and computing,
    a new telemetry system for precision agriculture should be integrated into the
    Cyber-Physical System (CPS) concept. The CPS paradigm has two connotations. On
    the one hand, it solves the issues related to the way in which inquiry is done,
    whereas the second one is a model that underpins all specific states of the components
    of the process [4]. Considering the analysis on the control systems implemented
    over the world and the specific conditions in the Romanian context, an energy
    efficient irrigation system for water supply control in vineyards is proposed,
    Fig. 6. The irrigation management system for the precision agriculture could be
    seen as a MIMO system. The control strategy follows a fuzzy approach and it considers
    soil moisture control and the disturbances can be air temperature and evapotranspiration,
    as it is a plant disease indictor. Thus, the system must be fully interconnected
    and decentralized, being equipped with the following: One or more telemetry stations
    that establish the irrigation necessity. Considering the arguments exposed in
    the 2nd paragraph, it is of highly importance to have sensors for air and soil
    temperature, air and soil humidity and evapotranspiration computation, [26]. With
    these parameters, they could be calculated the precipitations necessity and the
    irrigations efficiency. A SCADA system (a SCADA master and clients) that receives
    all information from process and, using some specific decision algorithms, sends
    commands to actuators. It must be done a software application that collects and
    processes data from sensors and that has the capability of displaying it in a
    logical format. The main characteristics that a SCADA system for irrigation management
    must have are presented in Fig. 7. A RTU (Remote Terminal Unit) that includes
    solar panels and batteries for independent operation is used for acquisition of
    other field parameters and actuators control. The actuators consist of pumps,
    valves and other Figure 6. Proposed irrigation control system Show All Figure
    7. Main characteristics of the SCADA system in irrigation management Show All
    SECTION V. Conclusions Irrigation management systems should be focused on the
    adequate supply of water in order to increase crop productivity. This study focuses
    at first on the main parameters that must be monitored in an irrigation management
    system to discover the advantages and effects of their control. Both soil and
    air moisture and temperature are monitored with specific measurement probes and
    evapotranspiration can be calculated using Penman-Monteith, Priestley-Taylor or
    Makkink method. The control strategies for irrigation systems are classified into
    4 categories, from classical to new trends equipment that operate directly to
    irrigate the vineyards. All these are chosen for energy efficiency of the system,
    but also for efficient water management. in irrigation control: PID control, fuzzy
    control systems, decision support systems for water supply prediction and control
    and model predictive control. The main contribution of the paper is the proposal
    of an irrigation control system for vineyards, from a Cyber-Physical Systems perspective.
    The SCADA architecture allows a CPS approach and the fuzzy control strategy is

    the system computes the water supply necessity based on a fuzzy controller. The
    communication system based on GSM modules at the field level brigs flexibility
    and ease of use for the telemetry and automation system. The system architecture
    has many other benefits such as low energy consumption, low administration costs
    and forecasting and diagnosis functions. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported

    proliferation of embedded systems, wireless technologies, and Internet protocols
    have enabled the Internet of Things (IoT) to bridge the gap between the virtual
    and physical world through enabling the monitoring and actuation of the physical
    world controlled by data processing systems. Wireless technologies, despite their
    offered convenience, flexibility, low cost, and mobility pose unique challenges
    such as fading, interference, energy, and security, which must be carefully addressed
    when using resource-constrained IoT devices. To this end, the efforts of the research
    community have led to the standardization of several wireless technologies for
    various types of application domains depending on factors such as reliability,
    latency, scalability, and energy efficiency. In this paper, we first overview
    these standard wireless technologies, and we specifically study the MAC and physical
    layer technologies proposed to address the requirements and challenges of wireless
    communications. Furthermore, we explain the use of these standards in various
    application domains, such as smart homes, smart healthcare, industrial automation,
    and smart cities, and discuss their suitability in satisfying the requirements
    of these applications. In addition to proposing guidelines to weigh the pros and
    cons of each standard for an application at hand, we also examine what new strategies
    can be exploited to overcome existing challenges and support emerging IoT applications.

    IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) [1]
    refers to the inter-networking of everyday objects that are equipped with sensing,
    computation, and communication capabilities. These networks can collaboratively
    interact and perform a variety of tasks autonomously. IoT promises to play a remarkable
    role in diverse application domains, such as smart homes [2], medical care [3],
    [4], industrial automation [5], [6], intelligent transportation [7], [8], resource
    management [9], smart cities [10], [11], and energy management [12], [13], as
    shown in Figure 1. For example, in a smart home application, based on user prescribed
    settings, different monitoring and control tasks are carried out by smart sensors
    and actuators, such as the heating control system, air-condition monitoring, and
    fire alarms. Closely related to the IoT are Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication
    [14], Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) [15], Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPANs)
    [16] Wireless Sensors and Actuators Networks (WSANs) [17], [18], and Cyber-Physical
    Systems (CPSs) [19], [20], which are application-dependent terms. FIGURE 1. Applications
    of IoT in different domains. Show All The entire vision of the IoT surrounds the
    concept of communication among smart objects, enabling them to see, hear, think,
    act, and talk to one another to make smart decisions. It fundamentally embeds
    intelligence into the objects by utilizing ubiquitous computing, networking technologies,
    inter-networking protocols, and applications [21]. Both wired and wireless networks
    are utilized to support information exchange at the backbone and local access
    networks. The local access networks, in particular, are wireless, support multi-hop
    communication, and enable mobility [22]. As these networks are usually low-power
    and unreliable, they are referred to as Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) [23].
    These networks lay the necessary foundation of IoT and contribute to making it
    highly accessible. The aspect of ubiquitous accessibility of services and objects
    to mobile users is imperative because most of the IoT services are targeted to
    mobile users. Another strong aspect is the autonomous operation, where IoT helps
    to decentralize the decision-making process to accomplish autonomous operations
    with minimal human intervention. This autonomous feature is of paramount importance
    for a multitude of industrial applications that enable smart processes and systems.
    This has amplified the vision of the fourth Industrial revolution, also known
    as the Industry-4.0 or smart factory [24]. Although IoT promises to revolutionize
    several application domains and enormously transform the way we live and communicate,
    it imposes challenging requirements from the networking point of view. The first
    essential requirement is reliable wireless network connectivity, which is particularly
    important for applications such as industrial process automation and control,
    healthcare, emergency situations, disaster recovery, home safety [25]. Second,
    timeliness or low latency are requirements that guarantee the bounded and deterministic
    delay of data transfer between different objects so that actions are performed
    on time. For example, industrial process control systems require real-time communication
    between machines and controllers. Third, the low-power operation requirement helps
    the nodes save power and avoid unnecessary communication attempts, thereby preventing
    early death and extending network lifetime. All of these requirements led to the
    development of several standards and technologies. These standards propose different
    features and protocols to satisfy the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of
    different IoT applications. However, the practical use of these standards in different
    IoT applications has resulted in several limitations. These limitations accelerated
    the need for further analysis in order to seek viable solutions to meet existing
    and future demands of IoT applications. In this paper, we review the existing
    low-power wireless standards and technologies. We primarily focus on the Physical
    (PHY) and Medium Access Control (MAC) layers because they directly impact several
    performance metrics, such as reliability, latency, scalability, and energy consumption.
    In this paper: We present an overview of some of the active standardization bodies
    that are working on the development of sophisticated standards and protocols for
    IoT. We discuss and analyze several low-power wireless standards and technologies.
    The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) 802.15.4 standard
    and its derivations such as Thread, WirelessHART, IPv6 over Low Power Wireless
    Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN), and IPv6 Over TSCH (6TiSCH) are presented. We
    also study the Bluetooth standard and its variants, such as Bluetooth Basic Rate
    and Enhanced Data Rate (BR/EDR) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Various technologies
    and standards that share common frequency bands, such as Industrial, Scientific,
    and Medical (ISM), generate severe interference in a coexisting environment. We
    investigate how the inherent Physical (PHY) and Medium Access Control (MAC) layer
    design of these standards and technologies help to cope with interference issues.
    We explore the suitability of various standards across different IoT application
    domains, such as smart homes, smart cities, smart healthcare, and industrial automation.
    Possible limitations of each standard in different application domains are also
    highlighted. We emphasize the need to overcome the limitations of the existing
    standards to meet timeliness, reliability, scalability, and energy efficiency
    requirements of IoT applications. We explain how the stringent requirements of
    IoT applications and the constrained resources of objects introduce severe challenges
    in terms of protocol design. The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. In
    Section III, we discuss IEEE 802.15.4, in particular, its PHY and MAC features.
    Several standards based on IEEE 802.15.4 are also presented. Subsequently, we
    discuss how IEEE 802.15.4e overcomes the limitations of IEEE 802.15.4. Section
    IV describes Bluetooth and its radio and link layer working principles in detail.
    The discussion revolves around different versions of Bluetooth such as BR/EDR
    and BLE. Specifically, we demonstrate the communication principles in BLE such
    as beaconing and extended connectivity features. Additionally, we point out the
    limitations of each of the Bluetooth versions. Furthermore, we explain the BLE
    mesh specification. Section V presents the coexistence perspective of different
    standards and technologies that share the 2.4 GHz band. Other non-standard sources
    of interference are also described. In Section VI, we give an overview of the
    Z-wave standard. Section VII examines IEEE 802.11ah, which is another low-power
    wireless standard operating in sub-GHz. In Section VIII, the Long Range (LoRa)
    technology is presented. In Section IX, we discuss broad applications of IoT and
    their characteristics, requirements, and traffic categories. We explore the suitability
    of each standard relative to these application domains. In Section X we discuss
    the existing surveys relevant to IoT. Finally, a conclusion is drawn in Section
    XI. SECTION II. Standardization Bodies A large number of devices from different
    technologies and vendors makes the IoT environment quite heterogeneous, which
    causes interoperability issues across different application domains. To meet this
    challenge, we witness several standardization bodies that accelerated the development
    of low-power wireless standards and technologies. These standards employ unique
    PHY, MAC, network, and application layer enhancements to meet low-power, low-latency,
    high reliability, scalability, and security requirements of IoT applications.
    In the following, we describe some of the well-known standardization bodies that
    are actively working toward developing IoT protocols. IEEE Standards Association
    (IEEE-SA) [26] is the most well-known standardization organization. It mostly
    targets the lower layers in the OSI protocol stack, namely MAC and PHY. In this
    paper, we focus on IEEE 802.15.4, IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth), and IEEE 802.11ah
    due to their low power operation. The IEEE 802.15.4 provides the fundamental blocks
    for many of the key technologies such as ZigBee, Thread, WirelessHART, and ISA100.11a.
    These standards are detailed in Section III. Up to 2017, IEEE-SA has published
    more than 1100 active standards, and it has more than 600 standards under development
    [27]. ZigBee alliance [28] is an open global standard based on IEEE 802.15.4 that
    is targeted to low-power wireless networks. The technical specifications of ZigBee
    are discussed in Section III. The most common applications of ZigBee are in home
    automation, industrial control, and healthcare. They will be described in Section
    IX. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) [29] is one of the non-profit organizations
    that developed IoT standards such as 6LoWPAN or Routing Over Low power and Lossy
    networks (ROLL). IETF encourages more people to communicate and collaborate on
    new ideas such as improving the IoT use cases in smart cities, healthcare, industrial
    Internet and other related applications by providing solutions to overcome issues
    such as scalability, timeliness, and IPv6 adaptation for low-power wireless networks.
    IETF provides a platform where developers and researchers can collaborate voluntarily
    to improve and build standards. The standard documents provided by the IETF, such
    as the Request for Comments (RFCs), can be accessed freely. For example, (RFC4944)
    [30] was developed in 2007 and updated by the drafts (RFC6282) [31], (RFC6775)
    [32], (RFC8025) [33], (RFC8066) [34] up until 2017 for developing 6LoWPAN standards.
    These documents cover a wide range of topics relating to issues of routing, security,
    and applications in IoT. The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)
    [35] is another non-profit body (like IETF) that works for standardization organizations
    in Europe. It produces globally-applicable standards for communication technologies
    for the Internet, such as fixed, mobile, and broadcast, and short-range technologies.
    The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP TM ) is an example of the ETSI
    standards. Currently, ETSI has 800 member organizations from 67 countries. OneM2M
    [36] is a worldwide organization formed in 2012 that aims to provide and develop
    technical specifications in order to meet architectural, security, and interoperability
    requirements for M2M communication. It targets applications such as smart cities,
    smart grids, smart homes, and healthcare. OneM2M cooperates with more than 200
    companies. International Society of Automation (ISA) [37] targets industrial IoT
    covering applications such as security, safety, batch control, and enterprise
    integration. A widely-adopted standard developed by this body is ISA100.11a [38].
    ISA has more than 40,000 members and 140 committees, subcommittees, working groups,
    and task forces that are working to develop the ISA standards. OpenWSN [39] is
    a project created by the University of California, Berkeley. It aims to provide
    an open source platform for developers and researchers to implement the IoT protocol
    stack. The stack implements different hardware and operating systems, such as
    OpenMote [40] and RIOT [41], respectively. One of the important goals of OpenWSN
    is the adaptation of the Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) concept over IEEE
    802.15.4e. TSCH provides the IPv6 support in the network layer based on the IETF
    6TiSCH implementation [42]. We will discuss TSCH in Section III-H. Internet Protocol
    for Smart Object (IPSO) alliance [43] is an active organization for enabling Internet
    Protocol (IP) connectivity for smart object communication in IoT. IPSO was founded
    in 2008 and targets IoT applications, such as smart cities, home automation, healthcare,
    and energy management. Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) [44] developed and
    licensed Bluetooth technology. It is a non-profit organization that was founded
    in September 1998. This body publishes the core specifications for the different
    version of Bluetooth. In Section IV, we will describe the different versions of
    Bluetooth developed by SIG. Currently, SIG is supported by more than 30,000 member
    companies [45]. Although SIG does not sell any Bluetooth products, it owns the
    Bluetooth word mark, figure mark and combination mark, which collectively make
    up the Bluetooth trademarks. SECTION III. IEEE 802.15.4 IEEE 802.15.4 [46], which
    mainly defines PHY and MAC layer specifications, is considered the defacto standard
    for Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Network (LR-WPAN). The standard was developed
    for low data rate monitoring and control applications that require very low power
    consumption. Due to its appealing features such as low-power, low cost, and moderate
    data rate, it is the most widely used standard for home automation [47], industrial
    automation [48], [49], smart cities [50], and Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs)
    [51]. Most of the existing standards, such as ZigBee [28], WirelessHART [52],
    and ISA100.11a [53], employ IEEE 802.15.4 as the PHY layer technology together
    with certain upper layer modifications. At the MAC layer, the standard offers
    a flexible protocol that tries to achieve a better trade-off among several performance
    metrics, such as energy efficiency, delay, coverage, and data rate. The IEEE 802.15.4
    network supports star, tree, and peer-to-peer network topologies as shown in Figure
    2. The network is composed of two types of devices, namely Full Function Device
    (FFD) and Reduced Function Device (RFD). The FFDs can perform activities like
    network coordination, routing, and sensing, whereas the RFDs are constrained nodes
    that can only serve as end-devices to perform sensing tasks. As coordinators,
    FFDs can form, manage, and maintain a Personal Area Network (PAN), but a FFD can
    manage only a single PAN at a time. The FFDs can also serve as routers that relay
    traffic through intermediate routes from source to destination. They can also
    store routing tables. FIGURE 2. The star and peer-to-peer network topologies supported
    by the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Show All The following discussion elaborates more
    on the PHY and MAC layer specifications of the standard. A. PHY Layer The PHY
    layer uses the 2.4 GHz ISM [54] frequency band. Different frequency bands are
    allocated to different regions, as listed in Table 2. TABLE 1 Abbreviations TABLE
    2 Frequency Bands of the IEEE 802.15.4 Standard TABLE 3 Bluetooth 5 Support SoC
    Comparison The PHY offers services such as the transmission and reception of PHY
    Protocol Data Units (PPDUs) across the physical channel. It performs a number
    of suitable functionalities like the activation and deactivation of radio transceiver,
    Energy Detection (ED), Link Quality Indication (LQI), Clear Channel Assessment
    (CCA), channel frequency selection, and packet transmission and reception [46].
    The purpose of the ED is to estimate the power of the received signal within the
    bandwidth of the channel so that the MAC layer can avoid interference. CCA is
    a reliable method to determine any activity on the channel before making a transmission.
    CCA works based on multiple sampling of channel energy. For example, it may sample
    the channel five times and report a free channel if there is at least one sample
    less than the noise floor. There are total 27 different channels available across
    all of the bands as defined by the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. For example, the 2.4
    GHz band includes 16 channels numbered from 11 to 25, where each channel has a
    bandwidth of 2 MHz and center frequencies are separated by 5 MHz. They offer an
    achievable data rate of as much as 250 kbps [55]. IEEE 802.15.4 uses Direct Sequence
    Spread Spectrum (DSSS) which mainly supports coexistence by spreading the signal
    over a larger bandwidth. Upon receiving a request from the MAC sub-layer, the
    radio transceiver may operate in one of the three states: transmit, receive, or
    sleep. The energy consumption states of a transceiver can be classified into the
    following states: transmission, reception, and sleep. During idle listening, the
    device is listening to incoming packets, which may result in overhearing packets
    that are not destined for it [56]. It is observed that in most of the commercial
    IEEE 802.15.4 compliant transceivers the energy consumed during idle listening
    is almost the same as receiving or transmitting a packet [57] and is a significant
    cause of energy waste. For example, the TI CC2420 transceiver at 0 dBm output
    power consumes 17.4 mA in transmission and 18.8 mA in idle listening states [58].
    Since nodes have constrained resources, the IEEE 802.15.4 implements duty cycling
    in the MAC protocol to save power. Duty cycling allows a node to sleep by turning
    off its transceivers to conserve energy periodically. B. MAC Layer The standard
    proposes a flexible MAC that can mainly switch between two channel access modes
    known as beacon enabled mode and non-beacon enabled mode. 1) Beacon Enabled (BE)
    Mode In this mode, communication is based on a superframe structure. The superframe
    starts with a beacon period followed by an active period and an inactive period,
    as shown in Figure 3. The active period consists of the Contention Access Period
    (CAP) and Contention Free Period (CFP), while the inactive period allows duty
    cycling. The active period is further subdivided into 16 equally spaced parts
    called time slots. The superframe information is broadcasted through beacons at
    the start of the network. A beacon is a specific frame generated periodically
    by the PAN coordinator to update synchronization and other network related information
    among the nodes. A superframe is bounded by two beacons. After the beacon, the
    CAP immediately starts where nodes compete, using slotted Carrier Sense Multiple
    Access/Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) to transmit new packets to the coordinator
    or request pending packets. To minimize the probability of collisions over the
    channel, slotted CSMA/CA uses the Binary Exponential (BE) Backoff algorithm. After
    the CAP is the CFP, which contains Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) like Guaranteed
    Time Slots (GTSs) for transmission. GTSs are allocated by the coordinator to the
    nodes that require special bandwidth reservations [59]. Nodes request the GTSs
    from the PAN coordinator during the CAP. GTS can be used either for transmission
    or reception, and a maximum of seven GTSs are allowed per superframe. During the
    GTS, the node has exclusive access to the channel at its disposal. FIGURE 3. The
    superframe structure of the BE MAC mode of IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Show All The
    total duration of the superframe, including active and inactive periods, can be
    configured through two important parameters known as Superframe Order (SO) and
    Beacon Order (BO). The network coordinator defines the superframe structure by
    a Beacon Interval (BI), which is the time between two sequential beacons, and
    a Superframe Duration (SD), which is the active duration of the superframe, as
    shown in Figure 3. The values of BO and BI are related as follows [46]; for 0≤
    BI= BO≤14 α× 2 BO symbols View Source α is known as aBaseSuperframeDuration, which
    is the number of symbols forming a superframe when the SO is equal to zero. The
    SO defines the duration of the active period including the beacon frame. The values
    of SO and SD are related as follows: for 0≤ SD= SO≤BO≤14 α× 2 SO symbols View
    Source Therefore, in the case of 2.4 GHz, the value of SD=15.36× 2 SO  ms with
    a BI=15.36× 2 BO  ms . Thus, the value of BI can be adjusted between 15 ms to
    245 s [59], depending on the value of BO and SO. 2) Non-Beacon Enabled (NBE) Mode
    No GTS allocation is employed in this mode. Nodes mainly utilize unslotted CSMA/CA
    for channel access and perform only a single CCA operation without synchronization
    to backoff boundaries [60]. C. Limitations of IEEE 802.15.4 Mac Although IEEE
    802.15.4 MAC has several appealing features for general IoT applications, yet
    it has several limitations for applications that require high reliability, low
    latency, and energy efficiency, as pointed out in [61] and [62]. To address this
    issue, several investigations on the performance analysis of IEEE 802.15.4 MAC
    were conducted [63]–[66]. Studies in [67] show that the selection of the binary
    exponent is random and does not take into account the number of available nodes,
    the communication activity level, or the priority of data packets, resulting in
    a higher likelihood of collisions. The random nature of the binary exponent causes
    nodes to sleep for prolonged periods than required. This leaves the medium unnecessarily
    idle for an extended period, impacting the throughput. A simulation-based evaluation
    of slotted Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) for beacon-enabled mode for dense
    networks was conducted in [66]. The authors showed that the backoff algorithm
    is not flexible for large-scale networks, since the lower limit of the backoff
    delay is always 0 which is fixed. Thus, it prevents particular ranges for the
    backoff delays. Therefore, it is not sufficient to avoid collisions for large-scale
    networks. The impact on the selection of the BO and SO was analyzed based on the
    average delay. A node that cannot complete its data transmission in the current
    CAP is forced to defer its transmission to the following superframe. Therefore,
    the node has to re-contend to access the medium and face collisions. Such a situation
    makes the delay for the data transmission not only non-deterministic and unbounded,
    but it also deteriorates the throughput. Another study on the performance of slotted
    CSMA/CA for the BE mode was conducted in [63]. The authors showed that the default
    values of MAC parameters, such as MAC minimum binary exponent and number of backoffs,
    may result in lower throughput and high-power consumption. This analytical study
    was based on the Markov model for both saturated and unsaturated periodic traffic,
    and it was suggested to tune the MAC parameters to achieve better results. Anastasi
    et al. [64] gave a comprehensive analysis on the MAC unreliability problem. The
    authors argued that if the power management is enabled, it will result in poor
    packet delivery ratio. The reason was found to be the contention access period
    and its default parameters, such as the minimum and maximum binary exponent value,
    the maximum number of backoffs, and maximum frame retries allowed. The authors
    suggested that the MAC, in its current form, is not suitable for mission-critical
    applications and requires proper tuning of the MAC parameters for better performance.
    Motivated by these shortcomings, several relevant standards and protocols emerged
    to overcome the limitations of IEEE 802.15.4 MAC [68], [69]. We overview these
    protocols and standards as follows. We will present different applications based
    on this standard and elaborates further on their suitability in each application
    domain in Section IX. D. Thread Thread [70] is an open networking stack, which
    has received support from well-known organizations such as Google, Samsung, Nest,
    Freescale, and ARM [71]. It is built on top of the IEEE 802.15.4 PHY and MAC layer
    specifications, operating in 2.4 GHz band. It is cost-effective, reliable, secure,
    works at very low-power, and supports up to 250 devices in a single local mesh
    network. The technology is optimized for low latency (less than 100 ms) and smart
    home networking applications, such as access control, energy management, and light
    control. It does not suffer from a single point of failure due to its mesh networking
    capability, thus improving reliability. It natively supports 6LoWPAN technology
    to benefit IPv6 capability in order to support interoperability. In this way,
    devices can be directly connected to the Internet and can be accessed from anywhere.
    Figure 4 shows the mesh network architecture of Thread. As shown, a typical Thread
    network consists of at least one or more border routers, a router, a leader, sleepy
    end-devices, and end-devices. The border router serves as a gateway that is responsible
    for connecting a Thread network to an adjacent non-Thread network that operates
    on other physical layers like IEEE 802.11 or Ethernet. Multiple border routers
    can be deployed to achieve redundancy. This keeps the mesh network functional
    in case of a failure of the single border router, thereby improving resiliency.
    A router offers routing services to the network devices. It also provides security
    and network joining services for the devices that wish to join the network. A
    router or border router can act as a leader which is required to make decisions
    for some specific functions like assigning router addresses and allowing new router
    requests. FIGURE 4. The mesh networking architecture of Thread. Show All Sleepy
    end-devices can communicate through their parent router and serve as only host
    devices, but they cannot forward messages for other devices. End-devices can exchange
    messages with their parent devices. At the application layer, Thread does not
    impose any particular application layer protocol, however, the common light-weight
    protocols, such as Constrained Application Protocol (COAP), Message Queue Telemetry
    Transport (MQTT), and Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), can be
    used. The standard implements several security enhancements; it supports Transport
    Layer Security (TLS) [72] and its variant, Datagram TLS (DTLS) [73]. A network-wide
    key is used at the MAC that protects the IEEE 802.15.4 data frames against eavesdropping,
    tampering, and targeted disruption from outsiders. Since Thread and ZigBee mostly
    share the same physical specifications and have several features in common, it
    is expected that they are likely to merge in order to create a uniform IoT standard
    [74]. Although Thread claims to have all of the features mentioned above, there
    are no practical implementations or deployments available based on Thread standard.
    E. IEEE 802.15.4E IEEE 802.15.4, in its 2011 version [46], supports enhanced physical
    specifications that enable a variety of applications (see section III-A). However,
    the standard cannot support mission-critical applications due to several limitations.
    Specifically, in order to meet reliability, low latency, and low-power consumption,
    which are the requirements of emerging applications like Cyber Physical System
    (CPS) based Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) [75], [76], smart health care
    [77], and industrial process automation and control, IEEE released an enhanced
    version known as the IEEE 802.15.4e [78]. It specifically introduces five enhanced
    MAC protocols in the form of MAC behavior modes. These protocols will be elaborated
    in the subsequent discussion. 1) Deterministic and Synchronous Multi-Channel Extension
    (DSME) DSME is an extension of the beacon-enabled MAC mode of the IEEE 802.15.4.
    DSME does not rely on a single channel. Instead, it uses multiple channels and
    has a multi-superframe structure, which has an extended number of GTSs. A multi-superframe
    consists of a collection of consecutive non-overlapping superframes as shown in
    Figure 5. The multi-superframe structure can flexibly support both periodic and
    a periodic traffic. DSME mainly targets multi-hop networks and uses Enhanced Beacons
    (EBs), which are shown as black bars inside the multi-superframe in Figure 5.
    EBs are used to announce the presence of the network and contain information related
    to the size of the time slots, slot frames, and time synchronization information
    to maintain synchronization among the network nodes. The superframe consists of
    only the active period, which is further subdivided into CAP and CFP. Nodes in
    the CAP use slotted CSMA/CA for channel access to transmit monitoring, urgent,
    or a periodic data. The CAP is fixed to 8-time slots during which the nodes should
    stay awake. The CFP occupies the remaining seven slots that are known as the Guaranteed
    Time Slots (GTSs) (DSME-GTSs), which are used to transmit time-critical data.
    As mentioned before, nodes remain awake during the CAP; however, in order to save
    energy, DSME reduces the number of CAP periods, and only the first superframe
    of each multi-superframe uses the CAP. The rest of the superframes inside the
    multi-superframe structure do not make use of the CAP, but rather the whole period
    is treated as a CFP that consists of 15 GTSs, as shown in Figure 3 (Section III-B).
    DSME exploits channel diversity to select the best possible channel in order to
    ensure reliability and robustness against external interference and multi-path
    fading. Therefore, it is particularly suitable for factory automation, smart metering,
    and patient health monitoring. FIGURE 5. The multi-superframe structure of DSME
    MAC mode with extended and reduced CAP. The shaded bars show the CFP consisting
    of GTSs and the white bars show CAP. (a) DSME multi-superframe with extended CAP.
    (b) DSME multi-superframe with reduced CAP. Show All DSME MAC mode is scalable
    due to its distributed nature. Specifically, slot allocation and beacon scheduling
    are not performed by a central entity, but rather they are performed by the network
    devices themselves in a distributed fashion. It is adaptive to time-varying traffic
    conditions and to changes in network topology, where each pair of nodes, based
    on their needs, allocates and deallocates GTS slots. Due to its adaptive capability,
    it can be a good candidate for mobile networks, where data rate requirements and
    topology vary over time. It improves energy efficiency through its Group Acknowledgement
    (GACK) option, where a single Acknowledgement (ACK) frame aggregates the acknowledgments
    of multiple data frames. Although DSME MAC presents significant enhancements,
    some of its shortcomings have been identified as follows. For example, Rodenas-Herraiz
    et al. [79] pointed out the overhead of topology change in large-scale networks.
    In particular, the overhead may be high due to the rescheduling of beacon frames
    and/or selection of non-interfering frequency channels, assuming the multi-superframe
    structure is long enough and contains superframes of all coordinators. This increases
    the energy expenditure of the devices. On the other hand, in a dense network,
    DSME incurs considerable delays due to the TDMA multi-superframe structure, where
    the coordinator and the devices become active only in their respective superframes.
    Therefore, if the part of data transmission cannot be completed in the current
    superframe, it needs to be deferred to the following superframe. The coordinator
    and its associated devices would have to wait for the next multi-superframe to
    resume their transmission. 2) The Low Latency Deterministic Network (LLDN) LLDN
    targets applications that require low latency, such as manufacturing and robotics.
    It only works with the star topology and uses TDMA superframe time slots with
    small packets. The duration of the superframe is fixed and has distinctive slots,
    namely the beacon, management, uplink, and bidirectional time slots. The duration
    of a time slot is 10 ms, and the number of time slots determines the number of
    devices that can communicate. Since the size of the superframe is restricted to
    a certain number of time slots, it only allows a certain number of devices to
    participate in the network. However, in order to make the network scalable up
    to more than 100 devices, the PAN coordinator can use multiple transceivers that
    each operate on a different frequency. Moreover, in order to further reduce latency,
    LLDN makes use of short MAC addresses to decrease frame processing and transmission
    time. Similar to DSME, it also exploits the GACK mechanism to minimize the bandwidth
    overhead. The use of star topology makes LLDN more suitable for factory automation,
    where a large number of nodes often communicate with a central entity. However,
    it has some limitations in terms of scalability, topology, and throughput. The
    standard recommends using multiple transceivers in the PAN coordinator to create
    various networks operating on different channels. However, a study by Patti et
    al. [80] argues that this recommendation imposes a higher cost and greater complexity.
    They propose multi-channel LLDN, which improves scalability by allowing a higher
    number of nodes in the network while maintaining low cycle times without the need
    of multiple transceivers for the PAN coordinator. Berger et al. [81] indicate
    that using a star topology restricts coverage. They propose the extension of the
    star topology, which is to collect data from two-hop sensors with the use of a
    relay node strategy. The relay nodes improve transmission reliability by retransmitting
    undelivered packets. The authors are of the view that the use of reserved slots
    and retransmission strategy in default LLDN reduces the number of sensor nodes
    per network, which impacts data throughput. 3) The Time - Slotted Channel Hopping
    (TSCH) TSCH MAC is considered one of the latest generations of MAC protocols in
    the category of reliable and low-power operation. It aims to satisfy the requirements
    of low-power mesh networks in industrial process automation. TSCH is considered
    the most viable MAC candidate for the IoT protocol stack because of its time and
    channel diversity features [82]. It incorporates mechanisms such as time-slotted
    access and multiple channel communication with channel hopping. Time-slotted channel
    access inherently avoids the nodes that are competing for the channel, eliminating
    collisions and improving throughput. It provides every network node guaranteed
    access to the wireless medium, offering deterministic latency, and builds on a
    communication schedule that coordinates the exchange of information among the
    nodes. In this way, each node exactly knows when to transmit, receive, or sleep.
    TSCH achieves low-power through synchronization, causing the receiver to be active
    precisely when the sender transmits. The improved design of TSCH is influenced
    by Time Synchronized Mesh Protocol (TSMP) which is a proprietary MAC protocol
    designed by the Dust Networks [83]. TSMP became the widely accepted MAC protocol
    in the industrial domain, and in particular, is adopted by WirelessHART [84] for
    its MAC operation [52]. Standards like ISA100.11a [53] and WIA-PA [85] use the
    core concepts of TSMP in their MAC design, alongside some higher layer packet
    format modifications. Below, we present an overview of the TSCH slot frame and
    its functionality. The earlier MAC protocol of IEEE 802.15.4 (see section III-B)
    used a single channel approach in combination with the backoff algorithm in order
    to avoid collisions in a shared medium. TSCH takes a multi-channel approach by
    utilizing channel hopping and maintaining a low duty cycle. Channel hopping intelligently
    mitigates external interference and multi-path fading [86], which makes TSCH highly
    reliable and robust. Today, TSCH commercial products offer 99.9% end-to-end reliability
    while consuming an average current that is below 50 μA at 3.6 V [87]. TSCH Slotframe:
    A slot frame combines several time slots that repeat periodically, as shown in
    Figure 6a. FIGURE 6. TSCH slotframe schedule based on the associated topology.
    (a) TSCH slotframe, it also shows sequence of transmission events within a timeslot
    for a transmitter-receiver node pair. (b) The associated topology where dotted
    arrows show transmission in shared slots and solid arrows represent transmission
    in dedicated slots. Show All Not only does this periodic repetition of slot frame
    provide each node the opportunity to communicate in the network, but it also helps
    to update synchronization and other network related information. TSCH does not
    define and impose a slot frame size; instead, the slot frame size is a design
    parameter that is decided by the application programmer. The size of the slot
    frame can be from 0 to 1000 time slots [88]. Enhanced beacons are sent by the
    nodes to advertise the network. A time slot is long enough to send a maximum size
    packet and receive its corresponding ACK. A typical value of the time slot duration
    is suggested to be 10 ms. If an ACK is not received in a defined time period,
    the retransmission will follow the subsequent time slot that is scheduled for
    the same (transmitter-receiver) pair of nodes. A possible communication schedule
    is depicted in Figure 6a. The slot frame is seven slots long, and there are sixteen
    channel offsets available. Each link is assigned a cell. Some of the cells could
    be dedicated to only one pair of nodes, while others could be shared cells, i.e.,
    more than one pair of nodes can communicate in these slots. There could be a possibility
    of collision in a shared slot, but the standard implements a simple back-off scheme
    to deal with it. Each node only cares about the cell it is assigned to. For example,
    in Figure 6a, when node n 5 transmits a packet to node n 0 , it uses time slot
    3 from the dedicated time slots and channel offset (Ch.05) . F. WirelessHART WirelessHART
    [84] is the first open wireless industrial standard, introduced by the HART (Highway
    Addressable Remote Transducer) [89] foundation. It is mainly designed for industrial
    process measurements and control applications while still being backward compatible
    with the HART legacy systems. It is a mesh network with self-organizing and self-healing
    capabilities in combination with a secure and reliable communication protocol.
    Although Bluetooth and ZigBee were prevalent before the release of WirelessHART,
    they could not fulfill the stringent requirements of industrial control applications
    [52]. Specifically, neither ZigBee nor Bluetooth offered guaranteed end-to-end
    delay and reliability. 1) Network Architecture WirelessHART introduces different
    types of devices in the network as shown in Figure 7: network and security manager,
    gateways, access points, and field devices. The network manager is responsible
    for computing and maintaining the communication schedule and routing tables, as
    well as performing the overall network health monitoring. It can query a particular
    field device through the gateway as requested by the host application. The security
    manager and network manager work collaboratively to provide security against intrusion
    and attacks by generating a different session, joint, and network keys [90]. FIGURE
    7. WirelessHART network architecture showing communication among different kinds
    of devices. Show All 2) PHY and MAC Layers The PHY layer is based on IEEE 802.15.4
    [55]. TSMP is the medium access and networking protocol which offers reliable,
    robust, and low-power communication. It features time synchronized, dedicated
    time-slotted access, link layer ACKs, graph-based routing, and multi-layer security
    on every packet. It targets reliability of greater than 99.99% at low-power, scalability
    of hundreds of mesh nodes, flexibility to support time-varying traffic, security,
    and the ability to withstand harsh industrial environments [91]. The communication
    is governed by a time-slotted schedule which lets the nodes know when to transmit,
    receive, or sleep. TSMP follows the same schedule scheme as of TSCH, where the
    schedule is computed and is represented through cells using different time slots
    and channel offsets as described in Section III-E3. G. Ipv6 Over Low-Power Wireless
    Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) The underlying motivation to standardize 6LoWPAN
    [92], [93] was the need to integrate constrained devices to the Internet. IETF
    created the 6LoWPAN and Routing Over Low-Power and Lossy Networks (ROLL) [23]
    working groups with the goal toward standardized IP-based protocols for LLN. The
    ROLL focuses on developing routing solutions for LLNs over IPv6. The fact that
    the IPv6 protocol imposes high overhead and complexity which makes it difficult
    to be deployed in constrained environments, such as the IEEE 802.15.4 network.
    Since the MAC payload of IEEE 802.15.4 cannot be larger than 127 bytes, the 40-byte
    header of IPv6 does not leave much space for actual payload. This prompted the
    need to form an adaptation layer between the network and data link layer in order
    to enable IPv6 packets to fit into the IEEE 802.15.4 specifications. Low Power
    Wireless Personal Area Networks (LoWPANs) impose several constraints, such as
    small packet sizes, different address lengths, small bandwidth, high density of
    nodes, battery operated devices, poor link quality, and duty cycling. This makes
    it challenging to develop an optimized adaptation sublayer to successfully map
    the service required by the network layer on the services provisioned by the link
    layer [93]. In essence, 6LoWPAN defines an adaptation layer through header compression
    (HC) in order to transmit IPv6 packets over the IEEE 802.15.4 network. It supports
    packet fragmentation and reassembly in order to meet the Maximum Transfer Unit
    (MTU) requirements of IPv6, and it allows forwarding to the data link layer for
    multi-hop connections [94]. The 6LoWPAN adaptation layer defines two header compression
    techniques that compress large IPv6 headers (in the best case) to several bytes.
    The compression technique, 6LoWPAN-HC1, compresses IPv6 packets that contain IPv6
    link-local addresses. The size of the packet is minimized by eliminating fields
    such as IP version, traffic class, flow label, and hop limit. The 6LoWPAN-HC2
    technique is proposed for the compression of UDP, TCP, and ICMP. The main objective
    in proposing the HC1 and HC2 techniques was to perform compression in a stateless
    manner that did not require any previous agreements between the two nodes. H.
    6TiSCH IETF formed 6TiSCH [95] working group to support IPv6 over TSCH (see Section
    III-E). 6TiSCH contributes to the IoT by bonding the unique features of TSCH and
    IP networking mechanisms in order to produce an interoperable Industrial IoT (IIoT)
    protocol stack [96]. This will support TSCH MAC being placed under an IPv6 enabled
    protocol stack running 6LoWPAN, IPv6 RPL [97], [98], and CoAP [99], [100]. Figure
    8 shows the reference protocol stack for 6TiSCH [101]. For the successful integration
    of TSCH with upper layer protocols, 6TiSCH introduces a functional entity that
    is responsible for scheduling TSCH time slots to be sent on the network. This
    entity resides at the higher layer and is known as 6TiSCH Operation Sublayer (6top).
    FIGURE 8. Envisioned 6TiSCH protocol stack [101]. Show All 6top is a logical link
    control that resides between the IP layer and the TSCH MAC layer. It controls
    the TSCH schedule, collects the connectivity graph, and monitors and optimizes
    the schedule of the cells. It supports both centralized and distributed scheduling
    approaches. The scheduled cells are labeled as either hard cells or soft cells.
    Hard cells cannot be dynamically reallocated by 6top. Rather, they are typically
    scheduled by a scheduling entity such as Path Computation Entity (PCE), that can
    move or delete cells in the TSCH schedule. In contrast, soft cells can be reallocated
    by the 6top dynamically. Typically, a distributed scheduling entity schedules
    these cells. 6top records the performance of the cells to the same neighbor. If
    a cell performs poorly compared to the other cells with the same neighbor, it
    moves the cell to a different channelOffset and slotOffset, where channelOffset
    and slotOffset perform better. In this way, the 6top sublayer can cope with the
    interference reliably. SECTION IV. Bluetooth In this Section, we discuss the history
    of Bluetooth technology and technical details such as radio, link layer, and network
    topology. Bluetooth is a low-power wireless technology used for short-range communication.
    It was designed to replace serial cables with the wireless links [102]. Nowadays,
    aside from connecting devices like mice, keyboards, cell phones, headsets, and
    multimedia devices, it is used to connect sensors, actuators, controllers, and
    critical wireless infrastructures. Availability is one of the main advantages
    of Bluetooth. The Allied Business Intelligence (ABI) research group predicted
    that by 2021 there would be 48 billion devices connected to the Internet, 30%
    of which would be Bluetooth enabled [103]. Bluetooth was introduced in 1999, and
    the first specification was released in 2001 [104]. In 2002, IEEE assigned the
    802.15.1 standard for it [105]. The technology is divided into two major categories:
    First, Bluetooth Basic Rate and Enhanced Data Rate (BR/EDR) refers to the earlier
    versions of Bluetooth mainly designed for file transmission and audio streaming.
    It is reported that in 2015, 116.32 million BR/EDR headsets were shipped [106].
    Second, BLE refers to the recent versions of Bluetooth targeting low-power consumption
    for IoT applications. Due to the consumer demand for low-power and high throughput,
    both BLE and BR/EDR are available in some devices like smartphones and laptops.
    They are known as dual-mode Bluetooth and switch the protocol stack from BR/EDR
    to BLE and vice versa when is needed [107]. Table 4 highlights the key features
    of each version. TABLE 4 Comparison of Bluetooth Standards A. Bluetooth Basic
    Rate and Enhanced Data Rate The first version of BR/EDR was only designed for
    file sharing by using an Asynchronous Connection-Less (ACL) link. The link is
    a single point-to-multiple point link that can be used for broadcasting data and
    can support both asymmetrical and symmetrical connection. The audio streaming
    capability has been added to BR/EDR by using a Synchronous Connection-Oriented
    (SCO) link in v1.2. The new link provides up to three symmetrical point-to-point
    links that reserve time slots in order to guarantee timely transmission. To avoid
    delay in voice transmission, SCO packets do not deliver ACKs. In 2003, SIG enhanced
    the link and released eSCO to improve voice transmission reliability. The higher
    quality is achieved by employing a limited number of re-transmissions for lost
    or damaged packets. Additionally, this version employs Adaptive Frequency Hopping
    (AFH) to improve coexistence with other wireless protocols [108] (Section V discusses
    AFH in detail). Bluetooth versions up to v1.2 provide a maximum throughput of
    721.2 kbps, known as Bluetooth Basic Rate (BR). Due to the high demand for large
    file and audio transmission, BR was unable to fulfill the throughput requirements.
    Therefore, in 2004, SIG introduced Bluetooth v2.0 to improve throughput and named
    it as Bluetooth Enhanced Data Rate (EDR). This version increased the throughput
    by 2.1 Mbps by using the Differential Phase Shift Keying (DPSK) modulation technique
    [109]. Although EDR tries to improve the data rate, it does not satisfy the entire
    user requirements. Thus, in April 2009, SIG launched Bluetooth v3.0, known as
    Bluetooth High Speed (HS) [110]. Bluetooth HS delivers up to a 24 Mbps data rate
    by using the 802.11 radio. Alternative MAC/PHY (AMP) controller [111] changes
    the radio from BR/EDR to 802.11 and vice versa. AMP enables the 802.11’s radio
    when higher throughput is required. After that, it reverts to primary BR/EDR radio
    to save power. 1) BR/EDR Radio The radio operates on the 2.4 GHz ISM band at frequencies
    between 2402 to 2480 MHz. It uses Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying (GFSK) modulation
    with three output power classes: class one has the maximum output power 100 mW
    and achieving communication range 100 m, class two and class three support output
    power 2.4 mW and 1 mW, respectively. The communication range of class two and
    class three is almost 10 m. Power classification improves energy efficiency and
    avoids interference with other networks by reducing the communication range. For
    example, a few meter communication ranges satisfy the user requirement for Bluetooth
    headphones and a smartphone. Lowering the signal propagation range reduces noise
    for other wireless networks in the vicinity. The physical channel is subdivided
    into 1, 3, or 5 time slots; each time slot is 625 μs and Time Division Duplex
    (TDD) provides full duplex transmission. In TDD, both the uplink and downlink
    can transmit information in the same frequency by using a synchronized time interval
    which resolves contention over the wireless channel. In BR/EDR, the frequency
    band is divided into 79 channels, and each channel is 1 MHz wide. Figure 9(a)
    shows the channel assignment of BR/EDR. The radio uses the Frequency Hopping Spread
    Spectrum (FHSS) technique to avoid interference from any coexisting Bluetooth
    devices with other technologies that share the same frequency band. In the FHSS
    technique, the radio switches the transmission channels 1600 times per second;
    therefore, if a transmission encounters noise on one channel, there is a chance
    that the next channel would be free of noise. In Bluetooth v1.2, AFH added a technique
    that blacklists the channels based on traffic load as good or bad channels. This
    minimizes the chance of collision by only performing transmission in the good
    channels. FIGURE 9. BR/EDR, BLE, IEEE 802.15.4, and IEEE 802.11 sharing 2.4 GHz
    frequency band. Show All 2) Network Topology In BR/EDR, devices communicate in
    a network called a piconet. A piconet is a star based topology, in which a node
    can only communicate with a central node called master and the others are called
    slaves. In the master node, the built-in clock is responsible for synchronizing
    master-slaves communication. The slave nodes receive an inquiry message from the
    master node to identify the address and clock phase. With this information, the
    slave nodes can compute the channel hopping sequence to identify when and on what
    channel to listen. The slaves can only initiate communication after receiving
    permission from the master node. There are two types of slave nodes: active and
    parked. In a piconet, one master, up to seven active slaves, and up to 255 parked
    slaves can coexist. Therefore, in order to address the active and parked slaves,
    three and eight bits are required respectively. The master node continuously polls
    the active slaves to see if they have data to transmit. If an active slave does
    not respond to the polling for a long period, it loses its three-bit active slave
    address and becomes a parked slave by obtaining an eight-bit address. For the
    parked slaves to rejoin the network, the master node periodically checks their
    status if they have any data to transmit. If so, the master node reassigns the
    three-bit active slave address. Since each piconet uses its own frequency pattern
    that is generated by the master node, it would be possible for several piconets
    to coexist. As shown in Figure 10, neighboring piconets can join and construct
    a new network topology called a scatternet. A scatternet is a combination of two
    or more piconets through node sharing. With this, a slave can be shared by two
    piconets, or it can be a master in one piconet and a slave in another. In this
    way, by combining piconets, Bluetooth can extend the number of nodes in the network.
    For example, in Figure 10, the nodes are organized into three piconets: A, B and
    C. However, the piconets can communicate with each other using the shared nodes.
    The shared node between piconets A and B switches the roles from a slave in A
    to a master in B and vice versa. On the other hand, the shared node in piconets
    B and C remain as a slave in both. FIGURE 10. A sample of Bluetooth scatternet
    formation. Although Bluetooth is a star-based technology, node role switching
    enables connection establishment with other networks in vicinity. Show All 3)
    Link Controller Bluetooth does not support the OSI model or the TCP/IP protocol
    stack because it has its own MAC protocol for communication management called
    the link controller. Figure 11 shows the state diagram of the link controller
    in BR/EDR. There are three primary states: standby, connection, and park. The
    standby state is the default state that waits for the connection event. It is
    designed to save power when the connection is not required. The connection state
    is when the BR/EDR radio turns on to discover devices in the vicinity and starts
    exchanging information if they are ready to communicate. Park mode is a deep sleep
    mode that helps to save power when the connection is not required for a long period.
    Only slaves can switch to this mode. They receive the synchronization packet periodically,
    and, once received, they can then join the network whenever it is needed. Before
    switching from the standby mode to the connection state, there are some sub-states
    such as Device Discovery and connection establishment. The connection establishment
    sub-state discovers the devices that are willing to initiate the connection. The
    Device Discovery sub-state has three sections. In the inquiry section, the device
    that attempt to initiate the connection hops among 32 out of the 79 channels,
    which are known as the inquiry channels, and broadcasts ID packets. For channel
    hopping, it uses the built-in clock and pseudo-random numbers to generate the
    pattern. On the other side, the device that is about to become discoverable switches
    to the inquiry scan state and waits for the expected ID packets in the inquiry
    channel. It listens for 1.28 s in every channel. It switches the channels slower
    than the device that broadcasts the ID packet in order to increase the probability
    of handshake at the same time and the same channel. After receiving the ID packet,
    it replies in the inquiry response state with the Frequency Hop Synchronization
    (FHS) packet. The packet contains the node’s address, the clock value, and value
    used for synchronization. After the devices are discovered and the packets have
    been exchanged, the connection establishment sub-state starts. This state is much
    faster than the inquiry state because both devices know each other’s frequency
    and clock information. The previously discovering device changes to the page state
    and becomes the master node while the discovered device changes the state to page
    scanning and becomes the slave. After defining the roles, the connection state
    starts. The master polls the slaves and waits for the response from the slaves.
    During the connection state, the device can be in one of three modes: sniff, active
    and hold. In the active mode, the master node keeps scheduling the slaves by transmitting
    POLL packets. The packet exchange stops in the hold mode, and the master and slave
    nodes get informed about the duration of time that they need to hold. The sniff
    mode is designed to save the battery. In this mode, during the connection the
    device can be temporarily absent from the piconet. For example, a device that
    is not operating, such as a mouse or keyboard, puts itself in sniff mode and transitions
    to the active mode when needed. FIGURE 11. Link controller state for BR/EDR designed
    for communication establishment and power saving. Show All 4) Limitations of BR/EDR
    Two major limitations of BR/EDR are high power consumption and lack of scalability.
    Although BR/EDR uses the standby state, parked mode, and effective duty cycling
    to save energy, these techniques are not enough to guarantee the low-power consumption
    requirement of some IoT applications. A major disadvantage of BR/EDR is high power
    consumption. This is because of continuous polling of the slave nodes by the master
    node in the absence of data to transmit. Many studies address this problem and
    propose scheduling algorithms for polling the slave nodes such as, [112], [113],
    and [114]. Chakraborty et al. [115] proposed a solution for adaptive polling of
    slave nodes. In their method, the master node polls the slave based on the probabilistic
    scheduling estimation. This allows the node to reduce power consumption by extending
    its standby time. Also, in [116], the performance of different scheduling algorithms,
    such as pure round-robin, gated round-robin, and exhaustive round-robin for polling
    the slave nodes in BR/EDR have been evaluated using OPNET simulator. The second
    reason behind the high power consumption of BR/EDR is the scanning of a large
    number of channels (32 channels) for Device Discovery. For example, Duflot et
    al. [117] pointed out the issue and proposed a probabilistic model to scan the
    inquiry channels. They also analyzed the power consumption performance of Device
    Discovery in the best and worst case scenarios. In [118], the effect of Device
    Discovery complexity on power consumption has been analyzed. They proposed the
    adaptive rendezvous protocol as a method of optimizing Device Discovery performance.
    The lack of scalability and mesh networking are other weaknesses of BR/EDR. This
    version of Bluetooth only supports a maximum number of eight nodes, and slave
    nodes are not able to connect to each other directly because of the star-based
    topology. This standard has been primarily developed for the scenarios in which
    a computer plays a master node role, and a limited number of devices, such as
    a mouse, keyboard, and headset, are connected as slaves. Scatternet is one of
    the most highlighted solutions for performing mesh networking and improving the
    scalability of BR/EDR. Scatternet is a formation that is not natively supported
    by the core specification, but there is a huge amount of research that proposes
    scatternet-based solutions or improves on the scatternet formation. For example,
    Jedda et al. [119] mentioned the time efficiency problem in scatternet formation
    and proposed an algorithm to solve this challenge. They also compared the performance
    of other scatternet formation algorithms, such as BlueStars [120] and BlueMesh
    [121]. In [122], the problem with scatternet formation, specifically, was that
    the network overhead was caused by an increased number of bridges that were switching
    the piconets. This increases the probability of packet loss. Reference [123] analyzed
    the performance of algorithms for Bluetooth scatternet formation namely, BlueTrees
    [124], BlueStars and the BlueNet protocol [125], and revealed the problem of time-consuming
    Device Discovery in a scatternet network. In general, these works conclude that
    scatternet is not a reliable and robust solution for Bluetooth networking, specifically
    due to the discovery delay and routing challenges. B. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
    BLE, introduced by SIG in 2011, was created for low-power wireless applications
    that did not require high throughput. To achieve low power consumption, the link
    layer, PHY layer, and packet formats were redesigned. In addition, while BR/EDR
    designed for only two-way communication, BLE devices are capable of acting only
    as either a transmitter or a receiver. For example, a remote control only needs
    to transmit a short command, and it does not need to receive a response. On the
    receiving side, a TV or lamp acts only as a receiver, waiting for a command to
    act. This results in design simplification, yielding higher power efficiency.
    In December 2013, SIG released the first update (v4.1) for the technology [126].
    This update can be applied over the air, and no hardware change is required. In
    the first version of BLE, the devices were only able to establish a connection
    as master or slave. However, in the new update, the link layer is redesigned and
    allows devices to switch their roles when needed. One year later, SIG made noticeable
    changes and released version 4.2 [127]. In this new update, the actual payload
    size was increased from 27 Bytes to 251 Bytes. Increasing the payload size while
    keeping the same packet format increased the throughput up to 2.6 times more.
    This increase in the packet size also increased the feasibility of IPv6 support.
    Although version 4.2 does not support IPv6 in the core specifications, IETF published
    RFC (7668) [128] to provide IPv6 support over BLE with the adaptation of 6LoWPAN
    protocol stack. Bluetooth 5, introduced in December 2016, is the latest version
    of BLE [129]. Its main aim is to overcome the limitations of the older versions
    by increasing the range, size of advertisement payload, and throughput. The extension
    in range provides indoor application coverage and even enables building-to-building
    connectivity. In addition, advertisement extension was introduced in this version
    in order to increase the advertisement payload up to 8 times more by using data
    channels as secondary advertisement channels. This opened a new domain of applications
    for Bluetooth beacons. The last improvement was increasing the data rate by doubling
    the modulation rate, also called BLE high-speed mode. This mode helps lower power
    consumption because of the shorter radio operation time that is needed for transmitting
    the same amount of data. It also improves the coexistence of the technology with
    other devices through shorter occupancy of air time. An application of this mode
    is over-the-air-update of IoT devices. 1) Radio As Table 4 shows, the general
    transmit power range in BLE is between −10 dBm and 10 dBm. However, theoretically,
    version 5 supports output power up to 20 dBm. Similar to the classic version,
    the PHY layer in BLE operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency band. In contrast to BR/EDR,
    it has 40 channels, and each channel is 2 MHz wide. Among these channels, there
    are three special channels called advertisement channels. As shown in Figure 9(b),
    these channels are placed in the center frequency of 2402 MHz, 2426 MHz, and 2480
    MHz and are specified with a gray color. The reason for choosing these frequency
    centers is to avoid the most common cause of interference in the 2.4 GHz, which
    is IEEE 802.11b/g/n. Since IEEE 802.11 b/g/n channels are 22 MHz wide, they overlap.
    Therefore, the conventional technique is to use only none-overlapping channels
    which are channel 1, 6, and 11. Thus, advertisement channels are strategically
    located in places that have minimum interference with non-overlapping channels
    in IEEE 802.11 b/g/n [130]. Advertisement channels are used for various purposes,
    such as Device Discovery, connection establishment, and broadcasting. In BR/EDR
    32 channels are assigned for connection initiating which causes significant power
    consumption and delay. Where BLE reduced initiating links down to three advertisement
    channels that the receiving device needs to scan. By limiting the number of channels,
    connection establishment is faster and more power efficient compared to BR/EDR.
    Although both versions use the FHSS and AFH to cope with interference, only data
    channels are involved in frequency hopping in BLE. Data channels are channels
    that are reserved for information exchange. Please note that BLE 5 in advertisement
    extension mode uses data channels as secondary channels for advertisement. Before
    switching to data channels on the sender side, the device sends a special PDU
    in the advertisement channels and returns to sleep. In the receiver side, the
    device listens to these channels to pick up the PDU. Finally, GFSK modulation
    is used for radio transmission. The modulation rate is 1 Mbps, except in the BLE
    5 high-speed which is 2 Mbps. 2) Link Layer Compared to BR/EDR, the new link layer
    has been simplified to reduce the power consumption and provides a faster connection
    establishment [131]. BLE has only a single packet type, instead of the 17 types
    of packets that are used in the BR/EDR. In particular, BR/EDR has a specific packet
    format for different modulations and file or voice transmission, on the other
    hand, BLE omitted the voice streaming capability and only has GFSK modulation.
    This simplifies the processing of resource-constrained devices. Connection establishment
    only requires scanning advertisement channels. Subsequently, based on the PDU
    format received, it either switches to data channels or receives the broadcast
    data [132]. Figure 12 shows the state machine of BLE, which has five states. Standby
    is the initial or default state. This state is designed to save power, and no
    sending or receiving happens in this state. The device may switch to this state
    from any other state. For example, after advertising device returns to standby
    mode to save power. Advertising is the first step for any BLE connection. In the
    link layer, advertisement channels are responsible for broadcasting PDUs. Based
    on the reason for advertising, these PDUs are classified as either: non-connectable
    advertising, connectable advertising, discoverable advertising, directed advertising,
    scan request, scan response, or connect request [133]. Advertising may result
    in communication establishment or merely broadcasting data. Figure 13(a) shows
    the process in the advertising state. During the Adv_Interval, devices send the
    same PDU in the advertisement channels (channels number 37, 38, and 39), return
    to the standby state for the duration of Adv_Delay, and then repeat the process.
    Scanning state is divided into two parts: passive scan and active scan. In the
    passive scan, the receiver only listens to the advertised packets and does not
    respond. In the active scan, the receiver may respond the received packet to get
    more information in order to make the connection. Initiating happens when the
    initiator receives the packet from the advertiser, and it responds to the packets
    by sending initiating packets. Connection is only required when the devices need
    to switch to data channels and exchange information. The advertising device becomes
    the master node, and the initiating device becomes a slave node. Then, the advertisement
    channels hand over the responsibility to the data channels by employing the AFH.
    After the connection ends, the device is only allowed to transition to the standby
    state. FIGURE 12. BLE link layer state has five states: Standby, Scanning, Advertising,
    Initiating, and Connection. Show All FIGURE 13. Advertisement and scanning process
    in BLE. (a) shows the advertising device, and (b) shows the process in a scanning
    device. Show All C. Bluetooth Beacon The idea of Bluetooth beacons was first introduced
    by Apple and named as iBeacon [134]. A Bluetooth beacon is equipped with BLE and
    was designed to be an simple one-way communication channel. Due to the low-power
    consumption of BLE, these beacons can operate for several years with a small battery.
    The concept of beaconing in Bluetooth refers to the periodical broadcasting of
    small pieces of information, such as sensor data or marketing information. Bluetooth
    beacons have applications in many areas, such as train stations, smart parking,
    and indoor positioning in order to help people by providing a platform directly
    to their smartphones. Currently, there are various types of BLE beacons are available
    in the market, such as Eddystone [135], which is developed by Google in 2015.
    Today, the availability of Bluetooth in smartphones allows people to interact
    with the technology easily. The maximum payload size for advertisement channels
    is 31 B. However, this is only enough to broadcast a short message with a limited
    number of characters. For example, in marketing applications, the packet size
    is not able to carry enough information to introduce the products. On the other
    hand, increasing the packet size creates other complications. For example, [136]
    shows that increasing the packet size in advertisement channels may result in
    significant interference in dense BLE environments. In Bluetooth 5, advertisement
    extension provided a solution to this problem. D. Bluetooth 5 Bluetooth 5 added
    new features to the previous versions. As shown in Figure 9, channel allocation
    in this version is the same as the older versions. However, the maximum transmit
    power increased from 10 dBm to 20 dBm. As mentioned earlier, the boldest enhancements
    in this update are an increase in range by employing Forward Error Correction
    (FEC), utilizing advertisement extension by using the data channels as secondary
    channels, and increasing the throughput by doubling the modulation rate [142].
    We explain these features as follow. 1) BLE Coded and FEC One of the major issues
    in IoT devices is the range limitation, and Bluetooth-enabled devices are not
    an exception. Generally, common solutions for range extension are mesh networking
    and increasing transmission power. Mesh networking and IPv6 extend communication
    range by routing packets to reach their destination. This causes network traffic
    and consumes power from other nodes as well. On the other hand, increasing transmission
    power to achieve more extended point-to-point connectivity causes higher power
    consumption in the transmitter. To avoid these problems, the FEC feature is added
    to BLE. Typically, wireless propagation of waves (transitional region) is much
    longer than the connected region. In BLE connected region is where the acceptable
    Bit Error Rate (BER) in the receiver side is less than 10 −3 bits. For example,
    in Figure 14, node C can receive the signals from node A. However, due to path
    loss and interference, bits are corrupted, and data is not reliable. FIGURE 14.
    Connected region and transitional region in BLE 5 long range. Show All In FEC,
    several bits represent a single bit. If the receiver bits get corrupted, it can
    identify and recover these bits based on the pattern that represents each bit.
    Therefore, using a higher number of redundant bits makes it easier to recover
    the bit. There are two options available in version 5 for coding: S = 8 and S
    = 2. This means that it replaces a single bit with 8 and 2 bits, respectively.
    This feature increases the range up to 4 times and enables Bluetooth 5 to cover
    an entire house or extended outdoor area. Due to the extra bits added to the packet,
    the actual bit rate per second drops from 1 Mbps down to 125 kbps in S=8 and down
    to 500 kbps in S=2 [143]. It is important to note that due to the extra bits,
    the larger packet is more sensitive to interference due to the longer transmission
    time. 2) Advertisement Extension Since only three advertisement channels are available
    in BLE, an increase in the payload size will increase the traffic in these channels.
    Because of this, advertisement extension only uses the advertisement channels
    to address the next packet in data channels. To initiate this feature, the device
    sends the first packet, which includes the pointer to the channel that is randomly
    selected from the 37 data channels. The randomly selected channel is known as
    the secondary channel for advertisement. Figure 15 shows the packet format in
    advertisement channels and the data channels. The transmitted packet in the main
    advertisement channels has a maximum payload of 37 B; however, the secondary advertisement
    channels can carry up to 255 B in their payload. Furthermore, it is also possible
    to extend the payload by adding the next packet address and making a chain for
    data streaming applications. Before this, frequency hopping was only applied in
    the connection mode. Since the data channels are randomly selected as the secondary
    channels in advertisement extension, the receiver needs to know the channel number
    and time to listen. Therefore, the primary packet broadcasted by the advertisement
    channels must contain the hopping pattern. Marco et al. [144] performed a simulation
    experiment to evaluate the performance of service ratio, communication delay,
    and battery life, when advertisement extension is used. They claim that advertisement
    extension offers better performance compared to the connection-oriented and the
    basic advertisement in BLE concerning the factors above. However, they also pointed
    out the issues of higher losses, in comparison with connection mode, and latency,
    compared to the basic advertisement. FIGURE 15. BLE 4.2 and 5 (LE1M, LE2M) packet
    format. Show All 3) Bluetooth 5 2 Mbps In BLE 5 increasing the speed is an optional
    mode known as 2 Mbps version. This mode only operates on data channels and increases
    the throughput by doubling the modulation rate. One of the applications for this
    mode is upgrading the IoT device’s firmware over the air. In this case, higher
    speed helps saving energy by reducing the duty cycle, besides, shorter over the
    airtime minimizes the probability of the collision with other operating networks
    in the frequency band. Please note that BLE 5 maintained the 1 Mbps as the default
    mode to support backward compatibility with the older versions. Because every
    packet transmission requires a gap called Inter-frame Space (IFS) between packets
    and ACK to guarantee a successful transmission, the actual throughput in BLE is
    less than the modulation rate. In BLE IFS is defined as 150 μs for all the versions,
    but packet transmission and ACK periods vary based on the modulation rate. For
    example, as shown in Figure 16 although the packet size in v5 2 Mbps has one more
    octet, the transmit time is almost half of the v4.2 and v5 1 Mbps. This also explains
    the shorter period for ACK. Packet_Transmission_Time=(Packet_size×8)/Modulation_rate
    , however, in order to achieve the actual data rate only the payload of the packet
    has to be considered. Therefore, the actual throughput can be computed by Equation
    (1). Throughput= L payload T frame +IFS+ACK+IFS (1) View Source Where, Transmit_packet+IFS+ACK+IFS
    are in μs and Payload is in bits. From the Equation, it can be observed that the
    actual payload for v5 2 Mbps is (251×8)/(1064+150+40+150)=1.4Mbps . Consequently,
    v5 2 Mbps is 1.7 and 4.6 times faster than v5 1 Mbps/4.2 and 4.0/4.1 respectively.
    FIGURE 16. BLE packet transmission. Show All E. Bluetooth Mesh Draves et al. [148]
    showed the importance of mesh networking over WPAN. Although Qualcomm introduced
    a proprietary Bluetooth mesh known as CSRMesh [149], in the official Bluetooth
    mesh specification was later released by SIG in July 2017 [150]. Prior to this,
    Bluetooth suffered from shortcomings such as a single point of failure, limited
    network size, and range extension. Bluetooth mesh allows 3200 nodes to operate
    in a network. It enables a wide range of applications, such as in smart homes
    and industrial automation, where scalability is a major issue. The new software
    stack supports the BLE versions 4.0 through to 5. The more nodes joining the network,
    the more robust and reliable the network will be due to the nature of mesh networking
    and the ability to have multiple available paths for routing. Nodes in Bluetooth
    mesh are divided into several types. The first type is the low-power nodes that
    mostly rely on battery power [151]. They have the responsibility of transmitting
    or receiving information and going back to sleep for the defined period. Another
    type is called the friend nodes. They are mostly connected to the main power grid.
    Due to the lack of power limitation, they can perform more complex tasks. Friend
    nodes store the incoming message for low-power nodes. BLE shares the radio and
    link layer with Bluetooth mesh in order to adopt any BLE-enabled devices to work
    with mesh networking. F. Limitations of BLE Although BLE has many benefits, such
    as low-power consumption, beaconing, and availability in many devices, there are
    some issues associated with it. It still needs to rely on dual-mode devices and
    BR/EDR for audio streaming and bulky file transmission. There are studies in which
    researchers tried to implement audio transmission over BLE. Gentili et al. [152]
    introduced BlueVoice and examined the feasibility of voice transmission over BLE.
    They also mentioned the requirements, such as using 64.3 kbps bandwidth to transmit
    voice quality of 16 kHz. In their experiment, they measure the power consumption,
    memory, and processing requirements. Another limitation is the lack of seamless
    IPv6 connectivity in the core specification. This leads to a dependency of BLE
    on other networks like Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) or LTE to translate
    the Bluetooth packets to IP packets [131], [153], [154]. For example, a BLE-enabled
    smartwatch is unable to transmit heartbeat information directly to the Internet.
    It has to be done in two steps. First, this information has to be forwarded to
    a smartphone. Then, the smartphone converts the BLE packet to an IP packet to
    be routable over the Internet and transmits it via WLAN or LTE. SECTION V. Coexistence
    in 2.4 GHz Spectrum Wireless networks are susceptible to radio interference. The
    impact of interference becomes even more deteriorated if they operate in the same
    frequency band because it causes disruptive effects in the transmission [155].
    Interference can cause packet loss, latency, jitter, false alarms, and synchronization
    errors [155]. All of these adverse effects, in particular, cause severe problems
    for mission-critical applications. As the 2.4 GHz band is unlicensed globally,
    many technologies use this band for their devices throughout the world, thereby,
    making the band more crowded. In 2003, the IEEE 802.15.2 task group [156] published
    standards for the coexistence of WPAN with other wireless networks. However, raising
    awareness of the new techniques and technologies do not solve the entire coexistence
    issue. The problem of coexistence among BR/EDR, BLE, IEEE 802.15.4, and IEEE 802.11
    networks is causing major difficulties in terms of delay and power consumption
    in IoT networks. The issue of coexistence has gotten further momentum due to the
    fact the emerging standards like WirelessHART, ISA100.11a, and IEEE 802.15.4e
    share the same license-exempted ISM band, resulting in the 2.4 GHz frequency band
    being more crowded. Due to the massive proliferation of IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE
    802.11 networks, the possibility of interference would deteriorate application-specific
    QoS parameters. These networks exist in large numbers today and operate in close
    proximity to a number of application domains. Suitable interference avoidance
    solutions need to be adapted in order to maintain the required service. As presented
    in Figure 9 the different wireless technologies operating in the 2.4 GHz band.
    In Figure 9(a), BR/EDR is operating between 2402 MHz to 2480 MHz. It divides the
    frequency into 79 (1 MHz wide) channels and uses AFH to avoid collisions. Figure
    9(b) shows BLE, which has 40 channels that are 2 MHz wide and also uses AFH. The
    only difference is that the advertising channels (specified with the gray color)
    have the responsibility of initiating the connection in connectable mode, and
    they are not involved in the frequency hopping. As mentioned in Table 4, to achieve
    longer coverage, the maximum transmit power in BLE 5 is increased from 10 dBm
    to 20 dBm, compared to the earlier version of BLE. Figure 9(c) shows channel assignment
    for the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Channels from 1 to 10 for the 868 – 868.6 MHz
    and 902 – 928 MHz bands are defined for lower frequency ranges, whereas the channels
    from 11 to 26 are operating in 2.4 GHz band. Each channel is 2 MHz wide, and the
    center of each channel is 5 MHz apart. Figure 9(d) depicts the channel assignment
    of the IEEE 802.11b standard in the US. There are 11 channels, each 22 MHz wide.
    These channels overlap with each other, and in the best case scenario, we can
    only have three non-overlapping channels: channel 1, 6, and 11. However, the IEEE
    802.11 standards have several versions, and the channel assignment differs in
    some countries. A. Coexistence of IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.11 IEEE 802.11, more
    widely known as WiFi, is the ubiquitous technology defining standards for WLANs.
    Today, WiFi devices are everywhere, and they are causing severe interference with
    IEEE 802.15.4 networks. Unlike IEEE 802.15.4 devices, IEEE 802.11 devices operate
    at a high transmit power, high data rate, and long range. Since they are unable
    to sense IEEE 802.15.4 devices, they create strong interference with them. In
    terms of channel bandwidth, both IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.11 channels are asymmetric,
    i.e., each IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.11 channel has bandwidth 5 MHz and 22 MHz,
    respectively. This causes overlapping of the four IEEE 802.15.4 channels, as shown
    in Figure 9. In most cases, IEEE 802.15.4 is vulnerable to interference [157],
    however, in certain cases, it does cause interference [158]. In order to improve
    network performance and support coexistence, these technologies inherently utilize
    specific techniques that help to promote coexistence. For example, IEEE 802.15.4
    employs a number of inherent mechanisms such as DSSS, CSMA/CA, CCA, low transmit
    power, low duty cycle, channel alignment, ED, and LQI as explained in Section
    III. DSSS promotes coexistence and protects against interference by spreading
    the signal to a wider frequency through chipping code. Chipping code is achieved
    by mapping the bit pattern of the signal into a higher data rate bit sequence.
    As the signal is spread over a larger bandwidth, the narrowband interferer blocks
    a small overall percentage of the signal. The receiver is able to easily recover
    the signal [159]. CSMA/CA works on a “listen before talk” principle, where the
    transmitting devices PHY continuously samples the channel and notifies the receiving
    device when it is clear to transmit. In this way, it is less likely to cause collision
    and interference with other signals. The radio turnaround time for IEEE 802.15.4
    is 192 μs , while the turnaround time of the DIFS (Distributed Interframe Space)
    of IEEE 802.11 is 50 μs . This can cause IEEE 802.11 devices to easily preempt
    the channel access while the IEEE 802.15.4 device is still in the process of radio
    state switching. Acknowledged transmission and retries further ensure reliability,
    where the receiver acknowledges a successful data reception. If the receiver does
    not send an ACK in a stipulated time, the sender assumes failure and retransmits
    data by using its retry limit. This can be particularly useful when the IEEE 802.15.4
    device is encountering interference when coexisting with Bluetooth. Bluetooth
    may interfere with the first transmission, but then it would hop to another channel.
    A retry helps the IEEE 802.15.4 device to make a successful transmission on the
    second attempt. However, studies in [160] show that the timing mechanism employed
    in CCA mechanism of IEEE 802.15.4 is much longer than that of IEEE 802.11 b/g,
    and it causes IEEE 802.15.4 to be in an adverse situation in terms of channel
    access competition. IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH mode uses channel hopping to promote coexistence.
    Every transmission happens on a different channel. This helps to further counter
    the effects of interference from other co-located networks. Likewise, WirelessHART
    utilizes channel hopping in combination with channel blacklisting to deal with
    interference effectively. With this method, a channel that is continuously causing
    transmission problems is eliminated from the list of available channels. ISA100.11a
    employs adaptive frequency hopping using slow hopping, fast hopping, and a hybrid
    combination of both. Although these techniques avoid interference to some extent,
    the rising penetration of these networks in different domains prompts the need
    for more advanced and sound interference avoidance techniques in order to help
    these technologies coexist constructively. Especially for mission critical applications,
    the issue of interference in a coexisting environment becomes more challenging
    due to the real-time characteristics of these applications which always require
    bounded latency and high throughput. The issue of coexistence between IEEE 802.15.4
    and IEEE 802.11a/b/g has been discussed in [157], [158], and [160]. For instance,
    in [160], it is shown how severely an IEEE 802.11 network can interfere with an
    IEEE 802.15.4 network and degrade its performance. This performance degradation
    can lead to adverse consequences for application QoS requirements. For example,
    consider a fire detection application based on IEEE 802.15.4. If there is a substantial
    packet loss due to massive IEEE 802.11 interference, the fire extinguisher may
    not trigger within the set latency bounds, leading to catastrophic consequences.
    Angrisani et al. [155] experimentally studied the coexistence of ZigBee and WLAN.
    The experiment was conducted by varying different characteristics, such as packet
    size, packet rate, and SINR, under different topologies. The authors confirmed
    that ZigBee and WLAN could coexist but to the detriment of packet loss rate and
    throughput. Guo et al. [161] conducted experimental tests to assess the interference
    from an IEEE 802.11 transmitter, Bluetooth transmitter, and microwave ovens sources
    on the link reliability of IEEE 802.15.4 devices. Through their results, the authors
    show that these interference sources (ISs) cause significant packet error rate
    (PER). The value of PER varies from 2% with no IS to an upward 25% depending upon
    the distance between receiver, transmitter, and IS. B. Coexistence of Bluetooth
    With Other Wireless Technologies After version 1.2, Bluetooth employed AFH with
    the pseudo-random FH technique. As random frequency hopping suffered from certain
    complications, such as repeating the transmission in busy channels. Pust and Burda
    [162] performed a comparison between the FH and AFH mathematical models and proved
    that AFH has a better performance in avoiding interference. The basic idea of
    AFH is to classify the channels as good or bad channels. Nodes are only allowed
    to transmit in good channels. To avoid interference, AFH restricts transmission
    on busy channels by labeling them as bad channels. Transmission in a good channel
    helps Bluetooth to establish a reliable connection and leave busy channels for
    other technologies. However, the number of channels should not be less than a
    specific number. Otherwise, the good channels would be more sensitive to interference.
    For example, in BR/EDR, the good channels can be reduced down to only 20 channels
    [163]. In AFH the device is not aware of the other devices and their transmission
    status. In order to identify the traffic condition in a channel for classification,
    there are two main methods: Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) and the
    Packet Error Rate (PER) [164]. Channel noise is one of the factors which has an
    impact on signal strength. In the RSSI technique, the receiver side measures the
    signal strength and informs the transmitter about the channel condition. On the
    other hand, in PER, the transmitter measures channel noise based on the number
    of lost packets. In order to update the channel map, the validity of classification
    needs to be checked periodically. Apart from all of the benefits of the AFH, there
    are also disadvantages to its use. For instance, in order to check the channel
    quality over time, AFH has to periodically scan and classify the channels, which
    increases the duty cycle. Moreover, reducing the number of available channels
    may cause more sensitivity to interference. Lee and Lee [165] simulated packet
    delivery ratio performance in BR/EDR by combining AFH and adaptive transmit power.
    They considered an environment with IEEE 802.11b and a number of BR/EDR piconets.
    They compared the proposed method with the basic AFH in term of interference mitigation
    in different distances. They showed that adaptively controlling the transmit power
    significantly decreases the PER. Another study in [166] analyzed the impact of
    interference of other sources on BLE and ZigBee. The authors monitored the power
    consumption of BLE and ZigBee and showed that BLE is more energy efficient in
    terms of the number of transmitted bytes per Joule. The study presented in [167]
    tested the performance of BLE. They analyzed the probability of BLE network failure
    in different environments and presence of interference. The results showed that,
    with the use of AFH, BLE has a lower probability of failure even in high interference.
    Bronzi et al. [168] presented the application of BLE for robust Inter-vehicular
    communications. They examined the impact of IEEE 802.11g on BLE. The experimental
    results showed that BLE can be a reliable solution when compared to IEEE 802.11p
    if the high data rate is not required. The performance of the advertisement channels
    in BLE was analyzed in [136]. Based on the experiment, in a dense environment,
    authors claimed that when multiple devices are scanning in the same channels,
    it is not feasible to increase packet size to above 31 bytes for the advertisement
    channel. C. Other Sources of Interference Microwave ovens use electromagnetic
    waves in the 2.4 GHz band. Although they are covered by a Faraday cage, there
    is still some leakage that occurs around the doors. These waves increase the motion
    in water molecules and heat up food [169]. According to the US Department of Energy
    (DOE), more than 90% of houses have microwave ovens [170]. They also share the
    same spectrum and cause interference for networking devices based on WLAN, Bluetooth,
    and IEEE 802.15.4. Microwave ovens normally generate 60 dBm signal power and operate
    in a different range in 2.4 GHz (model dependent). Results show that the radiation
    from microwave ovens that operate in the vicinity of WSN networks can cause up
    to 92% packet loss [171] in WSN. This increases further interference for wireless
    networking devices in the 2.4 GHz band. Kim et al. [160] investigated the coexistence
    of WLAN and ZigBee networks in the presence of microwave ovens. The experimental
    results show that the microwave oven is a dominant interferer and it significantly
    increases ZigBee’s PER. Rondeau et al. [172] analyzed the characteristics of microwave
    ovens and their effect on BR/EDR. The experimental results show that the AFH mechanism
    enables BR/EDR to be able to tolerate a high level of interference at a distance
    of one meter. Cordless phones are available almost everywhere. Most of them operate
    in the 2.4 GHz band like microwave ovens. They use DSSS or FHSS to overcome interference
    and achieve better voice quality. Generally, the DSSS method changes the channel
    manually, while the FHSS method automatically changes the channel. Similar to
    microwave ovens, the frequency range and the technique used in these devices are
    model dependent, and there is no global standard for them. SECTION VI. Z-wave
    Z-wave is a low-power wireless technology that is specifically designed for control
    applications in residential areas. It supports full mesh networking. The technology
    was developed by Zensys, which is a company for home automation applications such
    as Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC), Smart Lighting Control (SLC)
    and access control [173]. The main feature of the Z-wave technology is that it
    operates in the sub-1 GHz band, which allows the signal to avoid any interference
    with the 2.4 GHz working technologies. Moreover, it has the advantage of full
    interoperability with other z-wave enabled devices compared to other wireless
    technologies. This means regardless of product type, brand and manufacturer all
    Z-wave devices are able to join one network and help grow the mesh network. For
    example, a BLE enabled thermostat from one company might not connect to BLE smart
    sensor with other brand but in the Z-wave network, all the devices are cooperating
    with one another. The standard is proprietary and is available under a non-disclosure
    agreement. The point-to-point communication range between nodes is about 30 meters.
    The PHY layer in Z-wave is designed for remote control applications, where most
    of their requirements are just a single end-to-end message. For example, turning
    on and off a light requires a very low data rate. The technology operates in the
    908.42 MHz band in the US and the 868.42 MHz band in Europe, employing the Frequency
    Shift Keying (FSK) modulation. By operating in this band, Z-wave avoids collision
    in 2.4 GHz frequency band. The radio has a data rate of up to 40 kbit/s [174].
    In the MAC layer, Z-wave uses the CSMA/CA. The re-transmission technique is based
    on ACKs. There are two types of Z-wave devices: controller and slaves. The controller
    has the responsibility of initiating the control commands and sending them to
    other nodes. On the other hand, slave nodes are responsible for replying and executing
    the commands. It is also possible for the slave to forward the command to other
    nodes. A Z-wave network can support 232 nodes, including multiple controllers
    [175]. The controller node, which creates the Z-wave network, becomes the primary
    controller. There is only one central controller in a Z-wave network. The other
    controllers are the secondary controllers. Controllers can communicate with all
    the slaves. However, just the primary controller can add and remove the nodes
    from the network. Aside from the controller, there are some slave nodes in a Z-wave
    network that are only responsible for performing an action or routing the controller’s
    messages. SECTION VII. 802.11AH WLAN is a worldwide available technology. However,
    this technology suffers from a limited range and high power consumption, which
    are key elements in IoT. In October 2013, IEEE P802.11-TASK GROUP AH [176] provided
    the standard specification over WLAN to overcome these limitations. In the specification,
    MAC and PHY are inherited from IEEE 802.11ac. Additionally, sub-1 GHz frequency
    operation is added to provide better coverage, obstacle penetration, and lower
    power consumption. As explained in Section V, most of the wireless technologies
    opt for operating in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz band. This makes the frequency band
    more and more crowded. Operating in sub-1 GHz is an advantage for IEEE 802.11ah
    to avoid interferes in the 2.4 GHz frequency band. On the other hand, while technologies
    such as Bluetooth and ZigBee are targeting WPAN, IEEE 802.11ah aims for up to
    1 km coverage to be used for applications in Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN).
    Adaptation of IEEE 802.11ah in smart homes, wearables, agriculture monitoring,
    animal tracking, industrial automation, and smart cities eliminates many existing
    wireless communication limitations. For example, a smartwatch can directly communicate
    with an IEEE 802.11ah Access Point (AP) to transmit the information without needing
    to connect to a smartphone, or a single AP in a smart building can manage all
    the connected devices. A. PHY Layer As discussed above, IEEE 802.11ah, like IEEE
    802.11ac, employs Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) modulation
    in order to achieve high throughput and more extended coverage among low-power
    wireless networks. The difference between IEEE 802.11ac and IEEE 802.11ah is that
    the channel widths are ten times clocked down. Instead of 20, 40, 80, and 160
    MHz in IEEE 802.11ac, IEEE 802.11ah uses 2, 4, 8, and 16 MHz in addition to an
    extra 1 MHz channel to extend the range. The 1 MHz and 2 MHz bandwidths are intended
    for applications that require low data rates and power, such as WSN. Furthermore,
    a new modulation and coding scheme, MCS10, has been designed for the 1 MHz channel.
    MCS10 is more reliable than the other modulation and coding schemes, and it can
    provide a coverage range up to 1 km. However, employing all the channels in different
    regions is not possible because of the licensing limitations. Table 5 shows the
    global available unlicensed bands in sub-1 GHz with Emitted Radiated Power (ERP)
    and Channel Bandwidth (CBW) [178]. TABLE 5 Worldwide Availability of IEEE 802.11ah
    Frequency Range [177] B. MAC Layer The IEEE 802.11ah MAC layer is designed to
    support scalability while keeping the power consumption low. Theoretically, the
    standard is able to support up to 6000 nodes. In order to support this amount
    of connected nodes to a single AP, IEEE 802.11ah uses the Restricted Access Window
    (RAW) mechanism. An AP defines RAW by first grouping the clients. The RAW is a
    time slot assigned to a group and the AP. The group is only allowed to communicate
    in that specified time slot window. In each group, nodes are competing for channel
    access. Up to 64 slots are supported [179]. In addition, IEEE 802.11ah introduced
    Target Wake Time (TWT) to save power. TWT assigns access time to the clients that
    need to wake up and access the channel. Clients and the AP exchange information
    about the channel access time and connection duration. SECTION VIII. LoRa LoRa
    is a radio frequency transmission method for wide area network applications. It
    was developed by Cycleo of Grenoble and acquired by Semtech [180]. It is a low-power
    and low data rate technology that covers up to 10 kilometers for wireless communication.
    It operates in the sub-1 GHz spectrum and follows the previously mentioned unlicensed
    band for every region in the world (see Table 5). The frequency band is divided
    into 8 or 15 channels, depending on the operation region. The transmission power
    is limited from 2 to 14 dBm in Europe and from 5 to 20 dBm in the U.S. LoRa has
    three bandwidth classes for communication: 125, 250, and 500 KHz. Although high
    bandwidth has the advantage of high data rate, it consumes more energy, reduces
    the communication range, and increases the possibility of interference due to
    operating in the broader spectrum. In LoRa, modulation is based on spread-spectrum
    techniques and a variation of Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS). In particular, it has
    the spreading factor (SF) of 7 to 12, which represents the number of bits encoded
    per symbol. The larger SF increases the transmission range in the expanse of higher
    power consumption. The CSS does not distinguish the noise in the channel like
    DSSS or AFH, but it has the advantage of using the entire allocated bandwidth,
    making it resistant to channel noise, Doppler effect, and multi-path fading. Normally,
    FSK modulations can only detect signals that are 8 to 10 dB above the noise floor,
    however, using CSS features enables the LoRa to detect signals that are 19.5 dB
    below the noise floor. Together with CSS LoRa uses FEC for error correction with
    the code rate of 4/5, 4/6, 4/7, and 4/8 to increase the robustness of the channel.
    More redundancy bits for error correction helps to extend the range and robustness
    of the link by recovering the corrupted bits that are caused by path loss or interference.
    However, the overhead consumes more energy. The LoRa network architecture uses
    the star-of-stars topology, which consists of end nodes and gateways. End nodes
    are usually battery powered devices and act as slave devices, while gateways are
    potent devices that are connected to AC power source and are responsible for collecting
    the data from the end nodes. In the LoRa network, several gateways can receive
    the information that is transmitted by the end node, and multiple receptions increase
    the reliability of the network. Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) is a layer
    on top of the LoRa that defines roles for communication introduced by the LoRa
    Alliance [181]. It is one of the most adopted, low-power wireless technologies
    for low data rate and long-range connectivity. It has advantages over cellular
    technologies, since cellular technologies are battery hungry and not suitable
    for low-power applications. For example, a soil moisture sensor in agricultural
    monitoring needs to sense the humidity level every few days, and the battery has
    to last for a few years. LoRaWAN extended the network functionality by adding
    a network server and defining different device classes for each application. The
    network server is responsible for managing the communication, filtering the multiple
    copies from one packet received by different gateways and scheduling the communication.
    For example, the network server decides the gateway that should communicate with
    certain end nodes and when to change the data rate. LoRaWAN has a bidirectional-employing
    adaptive data rate and transmission power. This adaptive control optimizes the
    power consumption and performance of the network. As presented in Figure 17 LoRaWAN
    has three device classes that are specified for each application. Class A is the
    default class and uses pure ALOHA to access the link for transmission. In this
    class, the end node wakes up periodically and transmits a packet. Then, it waits
    for the downlink to respond in the same channel and the same SF. If it does not
    receive the packet, it waits for the second packet in a different frequency and
    with different SF. After receiving a response from the gateway, the end node switches
    to sleep mode. On the gateway side, the device is only able to transmit information
    once, exactly after receiving the packet from the end node. Therefore, if the
    gateway needs to send more than one packet, it has to wait for hours or days to
    send the next packet in the queue. This class has the advantage of having the
    lowest power consumption due to the extended sleep period. Meanwhile, it is not
    suitable for real-time applications. This class is mostly used for non-critical
    sensors with long battery life requirements. Class B is designed for applications
    with more frequent connectivity requirements compared to class A. This class is
    a combination of class A and C. Devices in this class wake up whenever the gateways
    have information to transmit. A beacon that is transmitted by the gateway schedules
    the wake-up time for the end node. Frequent access ensures the connection establishment
    when it is required, however, the overhead due to the beacons and the frequent
    wake-up time reduces the battery life. Valves for irrigation are one of the examples
    of uses cases for devices in this class. Class C is normally implemented in devices
    that are connected to an AC power source, where energy consumption is not a concern.
    In this class, devices are continuously listening to the channel, except when
    they are transmitting information. Therefore, they are ideal for real-time applications.
    Devices such as street lights that are connected to the AC power are an example
    of this class and can act as gateways as well. FIGURE 17. LoRaWAN communication
    classes. Show All SECTION IX. Applications In this section, we present an overview
    of the important IoT applications in the home, healthcare, industry, and city
    domain. These applications utilize different wireless technologies and standards.
    First, we summarize the requirements of each application and their traffic characteristics.
    Second, we discuss the suitability of each wireless standard pertaining to each
    type of application. We critically point out the standards that are suitable for
    each application category. Additionally, we identify the drawbacks of each standard
    based on the requirements of the applications. A. Smart Building The basic goal
    of a smart building is to provide a better living environment in order to make
    our life more comfortable and more efficient while also making it safer and pleasant.
    It is reported that we spend more than 87% of our time in indoor environments,
    including home and commercial buildings [182]. In 2016, the global market for
    smart homes was valued at 39.93billionandpredictedtoreachupto 79.57 billion by
    2022 with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 11.3% [183]. However, the concept
    of the smart building is not only about controlling lights or other devices with
    voice commands or a simple point to point remote control. The main idea is to
    have an Ambient Intelligence (AmI) using M2M communication in order for a device
    in the building to make smart decisions based on real-time conditions [184]. According
    to Gartner, a typical family home will have 500 smart devices by 2022 [185]. This
    future requires a scalable wireless technology. As we discussed in Section V,
    with the increasing number of smart objects that communicate with each other using
    the same frequency band, interference becomes a severe issue. Furthermore, issues
    related to Internet connectivity, mobility, availability, energy consumption,
    and reliability need to be addressed. There are many consumer-oriented IoT smart
    home applications. Some of the major use cases and their communication requirements
    are discussed below. One of the common use cases in buildings is Smart Lighting
    Control that provides more comfort and convenience for the owners and has a direct
    impact on saving cost and energy. The Gartner’s report estimated that SLC cloud
    reduce the energy cost by 90%, and its market will grow from 46 million units
    in 2015 to 2.54 billion units in 2020 [187]. SLCs are performed by employing relays,
    motion sensors, daylight sensors, timers, dimmers, and switches. In order to perform
    efficient wireless controlling for this hardware, it requires mobility and scalability.
    For example, a large number of lamps or LEDs may exist and need to be accessible
    from different locations of the building. The mesh networking capability can support
    these to increase the coverage. A person who is moving in the building must be
    able to access the lights. Another key use case is the privacy and safety of the
    buildings. A typical solution for providing safety in buildings is the use of
    video surveillance. However, many users are reluctant to surveillance cameras
    because of privacy concerns, installation costs, lack of real-time responses,
    power consumption issues, and massive storage requirements. A better alternative
    to video surveillance is to use low-cost and low-power sensors that are able to
    detect and perform actions immediately and prevent disasters. For example, in
    the case of a fire in the building, smoke detectors can reliably prevent hazardous
    situations in a promptly manner. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration,
    Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning is the largest contributor to the energy
    bills in a home. It contributes to 48% of the total energy consumption of U.S.
    homes [188]. In many cases, the cost of power consumption changes based on the
    operation hours. Consequently, load balance controlling systems can help in scheduling
    the operation during off-peak periods [189]. The benefits of using smart HVAC
    are not only limited to providing comfort and a pleasant environment, but they
    also have direct impacts on people’s well-being. Smart controlling of HVAC requires
    employing smart thermostats, control valves, heating and cooling coils, dampers,
    actuators, pumps, fans, and vents. In order to access HVAC from anywhere, the
    timers, sensors, and actuators are required to be connected to the Internet and
    support scalability. Interoperability is desirable among sensors and actuators
    from different vendors in order to collaboratively communicate to make decisions.
    For example, a central heating or cooling system must be able to collect information
    about window shades, humidity, temperature, or absence of residents. Entertainment
    is one of the more compelling applications in smart buildings and homes that covers
    the access of multimedia contents such as music and home theaters. These applications
    require high throughput for streaming audio and video contents on the go. Since
    these devices rely on batteries, they require low-power consumption. Figure 18
    shows the forecasting provided by ABI research for the future of wireless technologies
    in smart homes [190]. The numbers prove that technologies like WiFi and Bluetooth
    dual mode will have less share of the market, and low-power and low rate devices
    will be more desired. Table 6 summarizes the general requirements and shows the
    major technologies that support these requirements in smart buildings. A detailed
    discussion about smart building requirements is presented in [191]. TABLE 6 Smart
    Building Requirements and Available Technologies FIGURE 18. Comparison of major
    wireless technology demands for smart home predicted by 2018 (The CAGR is from
    2016 to 2021) (source: [186]). Show All FIGURE 19. Comparison of major Bluetooth
    applications market predicted by 2021 (source: [203]). Show All FIGURE 20. Comparison
    of major applications based on the number of connected devices in smart cites
    (source: [250]). Show All BR/EDR and BLE are available technologies in almost
    every smartphone, laptop, and tablet. This feature enables smart buildings to
    be controlled using these devices. Statistics show that nearly 73% of people would
    like to receive smartphone alerts from their home security system [192]. Compared
    to other low-power technologies, this availability along with lower-power consumption
    are advantages for BLE. As shown in Figure 18, it can be predicted that the BLE
    market will surpass other technologies. BLE’s AFH algorithm and usage of advertising
    channels have reduced interference with most of the common operating wireless
    technologies in the 2.4 GHz band, such as IEEE 802.11. This feature makes BLE
    a suitable option for an environment that is full of wireless devices that operate
    in that band. The aforementioned features also help to reduce battery consumption
    and provide reliability. By increasing the range up to four times more in Bluetooth
    5, the signals can cover an entire building. For example, the user is able to
    access the door lock from anywhere in the building. Another advantage of BLE is
    the recently added mesh networking feature, which increases the network scale,
    reliability, and coverage. Countless amounts of research has been done on Bluetooth
    applications in smart buildings [193]–[196]. For example, Putra et al. [197] compared
    the energy consumption of WiFi and BLE devices in smart home applications. The
    result showed the possibility of occupancy data transmission via BLE with 30%
    less battery consumption. Aside from academic publications on the application
    of BLE in smart buildings, there are some companies such as UniKey [198], BOLT
    [199], and Emerson [200] that are working on home automation devices based on
    Bluetooth. Beaconing is one of the unique features of BLE that is used in many
    applications, such as indoor positioning. For example, by tracking the users inside
    the building, the AmI can perform desired actions like turning on or off the lights
    or playing one’s favorite music [201]. As shown in the Figure 18, the Bluetooth
    beacon market will have the highest market compared to other Bluetooth-enabled
    technologies in 2021. While Bluetooth has its benefits, it does have some limitations
    that are associated with it. For example, there is a lack of scalability support
    in BR/EDR and IPv6 connectivity in both BLE and BR/EDR [202]. Incorporating other
    technologies with Bluetooth will increase the demand. ZigBee is another candidate
    for smart home applications. One of the major advantages of ZigBee is that as
    an open global wireless standard, it provides the open source software stack for
    developers to freely access the network and application layer. It employees mesh
    networking to eliminate the single point of failure and expand the reach of the
    network. Additionally, in the star topology in WLAN, sharing a single node between
    a large numbers of connected devices has the problem of increasing the delay in
    the entire network. The ZigBee network supports more than 400 connected nodes,
    which will be necessary for the future of smart homes, based on the Gartner report’s
    prediction. With mesh networking increasing the number of the devices, the robustness
    of the network is also increasing due to redundancy and decentralization [204].
    A self-organizing network is optimal for a more scalable network architecture
    that incorporates reliability and adaptivity. ZigBee enables a variety of smart
    home applications by connecting the sensors and actuators. Additionally, ZigBee
    is a low-power wireless standard that allows the battery to operate for several
    years. It can also run without a battery by utilizing harvested energy. For example,
    a keychain flashlight gets its power by a simple push of a button. Internet connectivity
    is one of the significant characteristics of an ideal wireless network for home
    automation applications. Although ZigBee natively does not support Internet connectivity
    in the protocol stack, the 6LoWPAN technology adopted the IPv6 connectivity based
    on the 802.15.4 standard [47]. This adoption allows the nodes to be independent
    of the translation gateway in order to access the Internet. Compared to Bluetooth,
    the main limitations of ZigBee-based smart buildings are the lack of support by
    smartphones and the low communication throughput. Similar to Bluetooth, there
    is an ample amount of research that has been done on the application of ZigBee
    in smart buildings [205] [206]. Zigbee also has products on the market that are
    used for smart building applications. Companies such as Control4 [207] and Phillips
    Hue [208] are designing their products based on ZigBee technology. Thread is a
    recently developed wireless technology targeted for home automation. It is IPv6
    enabled and supports mesh networking, thereby all devices can be addressed locally
    or globally. Mesh networking support allows the network to cover the entire building,
    and it improves the robustness of the network and avoids issues such as single
    point of failure. SLC is one of the main applications of a Thread network, and
    scalability is one of the requirements for the SLC applications. A Thread network
    supports up to 200 connected nodes. In addition, operating on MAC and PHY layers
    of IEEE 802.15.4 allows the technology to get the benefit of low-power consumption.
    In addition to Bluetooth and ZigBee, several proprietary standards target building
    automation applications. Standards such as Z-wave [209], INSTEON [210], and EnOcean
    are particularly designed to meet the requirements in home automation applications.
    Z-Wave specifically targets control applications such as SLC and access control.
    A thermostat is one of the examples of these applications and has over 2100 certified
    products. The products are supported by 600 companies like Intermatic [211], Hawking
    Technology [212], Wink [213], and Aeotec [214]. As previously mentioned in Section
    VI, Z-wave has the advantage of using the sub-1 GHz frequency band. However, this
    can also be a disadvantage when the products need to be distributed globally and
    used in other countries that have different rules for operating in the sub-1 GHz
    band. INSTEON Alliance was launched in 2005 by Smartlabs company [215]. The technology
    combined powerline and wireless mesh technology. Devices can support wireless
    technologies, wired technologies, or both. Wireless devices use FSK modulation
    and operate at 904 MHz with a data rate of 38.4 kb/s [216], [217]. INSTEON has
    applications in SLC, thermostats, smart sensors, and remote controls. EnOcean
    [218] is a wireless technology developed for smart homes and standardized by the
    international standard ISO/IEC 14543-3-10 [219]. It aims to use harvested power
    sources from the environment for wireless technology [220]. Devices such as smart
    plugs, SLC, and HVAC can be controlled by EnOcean. Like Z-wave and INSTEON, it
    operates in the sub-1 GHz band with a data rate of up to 125 kbps. B. Smart Healthcare
    Improving the health quality for individuals prompts a need to provide advanced
    systems for diagnosing, treating, and preventing diseases. A robust healthcare
    system can be divided into two generally classified categories: prevention of
    illness and post illness monitoring. Monitoring the blood pressure, Electrocardiogram
    (ECG), Electroencephalogram (EEG), Electromyogram (EMG), glucose level, cholesterol
    level, pulse oximetry, and toxins in the body can help early-stage detection in
    order to prevent fatal diseases, such as cancer or heart attacks [221]. The rapidly
    increasing population and longer life expectancies raise the importance of mechanisms
    for children and elderly health monitoring, artificial organ implementation and
    drug delivery. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), global life expectancy
    increased from 66.4 years in 2000 to 71.4 years in 2015 [222]. As the global life
    expectancy is increasing, the size of the geriatric population is also increasing.
    The number of people over 60 years old increased from 607 million to 901 million
    by a 48% increase. Also, it is predicted that by 2030, this number will grow by
    56% to 1.4 billion and reach to 2.1 billion in 2050 [223]. It is also clear that
    the risk of chronic diseases like neurological conditions, diabetes, heart diseases,
    and strokes increase with age. The other concern is the cost of healthcare, which
    can include hospitalization, home nursing, and medicines. It is estimated that
    in the U.S., healthcare expenses are more than $2 trillion annually [224]. This
    leads to the need to provide an advanced healthcare system for diagnosing, treating,
    and preventing disease. The desired system must be inexpensive, accessible, harmless,
    reliable, and must not restrict the daily activities, mobility, or quality of
    life. IoT, in combination with medical engineering, has the great potential to
    provide this system through wirelessly monitoring and recording medical data.
    Providing the Internet connectivity allows the physician to monitor the health
    condition of the patients. Thus, 41% of the IoT is marketed for healthcare applications
    by 2025 [228]. There are a large number of researchers who are focusing on the
    cure, prevention, and prediction of diseases using IoT and wireless technologies
    [229]–[232]. In IoT-based healthcare systems, smart homes can replace hospitals,
    and bulky, attached-to-the-body monitoring systems can be changed to tiny, implanted
    sensors. Table 7 shows the QoS requirements for a wireless network, including
    the data rate, timeliness, acceptable error rate, and required battery life. TABLE
    7 QoS Requirements for Smart Healthcare (Sources: [225]–[227]) It is important
    to provide a platform that does not limit the normal activities and quality of
    life of patients. For example, bulky attached sensors that are connected to wires
    are hard to carry and restrict the mobility of a patient [25]. Besides, providing
    Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) is important in monitoring health conditions. Smart
    homes or smart hospitals are examples of AAL. For instance, a smart home can receive
    the information from the wearable sensors of the patient in order to manage the
    temperature. Wireless sensors can be placed inside or outside of the body as wearables.
    These sensors can detect changes faster than highly equipped laboratories, especially
    for people who have a history of cancer or other diseases which can be inherited.
    However, this constant monitoring leads to high battery consumption. This increases
    the risk of nonavailability of these sensors in critical moments. Latency in bio-medical
    sensor applications is soft real time. Normally, in critical scenarios such as
    during a heart attack, a few seconds of latency is still acceptable. In [233],
    they implemented real-time and low-power ECG and EEG Bluetooth based sensors.
    They introduced the compressed sensing method, which saves the battery up to 37.1%
    more. In [234], the feasibility of applying dual mode Bluetooth in vital monitoring
    was analyzed. Authors implemented the ARM CPU based sensors, such as ECG, body
    temperature, and motion sensors. Reference [235] reviewed the available commercial
    Bluetooth-based healthcare devices in the market, which are composed of sensors
    such as activity tracking, ECG, EEG, EMG, and glucose monitoring. A BLE-based
    ECG monitoring using a smartphone is implemented in [236], and the result shows
    that power consumption is highly reduced. In addition to reducing power consumption,
    an equally important aspect of using sensors is that the patient is being continuously
    monitored in both indoor and outdoor locations like their home, hospital, and
    outside. Elderly patients are penitent when they feel that they are in danger
    and need to be continuously monitored. Reference [237] proposed a BLE-based indoor
    positioning system for patients who have Alzheimer. There are several commercial
    products like wearable devices on the market. Jawbone [238], Apple Watch [239],
    Samsung Gear [240] and most of the smartwatches are using Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
    technology to send the health sensor information. Heart rate monitoring with ECG,
    activity tracking, sleep monitoring, and other forms of health data are implemented
    in these wearables. However, Bluetooth is not the only low-power wireless technology
    for healthcare applications. ZigBee and 6LoWPAN are other candidates in this area.
    In [241] and [242], ZigBee-based ECG and pulse oximetry sensors are implemented
    by the authors, and the results showed that ZigBee meets the QoS requirements
    for these healthcare applications. Coexistence is also important in healthcare
    applications due to the WiFi-enabled smartphones that are operating close to the
    wireless technologies such as ZigBee. In [243], the impact of WiFi near the ZigBee
    wearables has been analyzed. Although 6LoWPAN and ZigBee share the same PHY and
    MAC, the IPv6 capability of 6LoWPAN makes the devices addressable via the Internet.
    This allows for the opportunity to remotely monitor health conditions or keep
    health records in the cloud. 6LoWPAN-based real-time health monitoring is proposed
    in [244]. They tested the performance of ECG monitoring sensor data for remote
    healthcare using a 6LoWPAN edge router. Doukas and Maglogiannis [245] presented
    the cloud platform in which sensors are connected to the Internet using 6LoWPAN
    technology. C. Industrial Automation During the last decade, wireless technology
    has been increasingly utilized in industries, leading to the Industrial Internet
    of Things (IIoT), where Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks (IWSNs) play a central
    role of behaving like a digital skin for the IoT. IWSNs can monitor critical parameters
    and control industrial processes and then inform the industrial personnel of this
    information promptly. IWSNs offer flexibility, self-organization, rapid deployment,
    and low-cost. They have the ability to make processes autonomous, resulting in
    the minimal human intervention [246] when compared to their wired counterpart.
    The shift from wired to the wireless networks dramatically helps to reduce huge
    capital expenditures of installation and maintenance of wires. Moreover, wired
    networks are rigid and fixed in nature. This makes it difficult to adapt to changes
    in industrial environments. In addition, certain industrial applications require
    mobile robots, which becomes a huge challenge with wired networks. However, wireless
    networks can easily support such mobility scenarios. Although IoT seems to revolutionize
    the industries, it is only if it satisfies the strict requirements and challenges
    that are put in place by the industrial applications. Such challenges include:
    extremely high reliability, low latency, robustness, fault tolerance, massive
    scalability, interoperability, and energy efficiency. Reliability against interference
    is highly indispensable because industries encompass several wireless networks,
    heavy machinery, and co-located communication systems that can interfere with
    IWSNs [246]. This can negatively impact wireless connectivity and result in link
    unreliability issues. Besides, most low-power wireless standards operate in the
    ISM band which can make them highly vulnerable to interference. Certain applications
    in industries, such as closed-loop control systems are extremely delaying sensitive.
    They tend to require low latency so that the control system can function smoothly.
    Furthermore, low power IWSNs have limited battery resources. When the devices
    run out of battery life and die, it leads to network failures. Therefore, the
    network needs to be fault tolerant so that failure of one device or a group of
    devices does not cause the entire network to fail. Scalability is also a challenge
    with wireless networks. The industries require dense networks that consist of
    hundreds and thousands of nodes. Efficient and fair distribution of limited resources
    in such dense networks causes trade-off complexities for several performance metrics.
    As time passes, certain devices and functionalities are removed, and new ones
    may be added. This requires the network to be scalable enough to accommodate such
    changes without compromising performance. Currently, wired networks are already
    prevalent in industries and used to support many processes and operations. The
    use of new wireless standards and solutions should seamlessly work with the legacy
    systems. This requires interoperability among the standards and solutions. Table
    8 shows the different classes of industrial applications, ranging from process
    monitoring, control, safety, and emergency operations as defined by ISA [37].
    The traffic categories are listed according to traffic priority with 0 as the
    highest priority traffic and 5 as the lowest priority traffic. Each application
    category generates a different kind of data traffic. In comparison to user-generated
    traffic on the Internet, the traffic generated by the industrial applications
    has different characteristics. TABLE 8 Different Classes of Industrial Applications
    as Defined by ISA Most of the processes in industries are periodic in nature,
    meaning that they do not require frequent data transmission. The long idle periods
    in between data transmission makes lower power networks more suitable in comparison
    to traditional cellular or next generation wireless networks. Essentially, the
    industrial environment is heterogeneous as shown in Table 9, i.e., certain traffic
    is an extremely high priority, while the other requires less priority. The high
    priority traffic requires immediate response to certain events, i.e., they need
    the right response at the right time, otherwise, the system can run into catastrophic
    situations. Below, we discuss some of the well-known low power standards and technologies
    developed over the years that promise to fulfill the requirements of industrial
    automation and help to realize IIoT. TABLE 9 Industrial Applications and Their
    Typical Requirements (Source: [18], [247]) 1) ZigBee ZigBee offers low power consumption.
    It supports several topologies that make it suitable for industrial monitoring
    and control. However, it is unable to provide high reliability and robustness
    [248]. ZigBee does not employ any frequency-agility protection against interference
    and fading effects. Moreover, the static nature of the channel will create a bottleneck
    for ZigBee communication if other wireless LANs operate in close proximity. This
    also impacts the delay and energy consumption because frequent packet losses will
    cause retransmissions, which will lead to an increase in delay and energy consumption.
    ZigBee uses IEEE 802.15.4 MAC, which renders the delay to be unbounded (cf Section
    III-C). This causes problems for real-time transmission, especially for control
    applications in process automation. 2) WirelessHART WirelessHART is developed
    to cater to monitoring and control in industries. It improves upon the drawbacks
    of ZigBee. The standard is robust and provides secure communication by implementing
    features such as channel hopping and channel blacklisting in order to avoid interference.
    In the case of transmission failures, retransmission occurs on a different channel.
    This improves reliability in harsh industrial environments. It supports mesh networking
    together with graph routing, which offers path redundancy and self-healing features
    that help in case of broken links [248]. The MAC protocol works on TDMA and provides
    multiple features, as discussed in Section 7. The standard employs a dedicated
    security manager, which implements the necessary encryption and security policies.
    Although WirelessHART is suitable in many aspects compared to ZigBee, it lacks
    public key encryption and the ability to connect to other networks without a gateway
    [249]. 3) IEEE 802.15.4E IEEE 802.15.4e defines six MAC modes. In particular,
    its TSCH MAC mode is important because it implements a deterministic TDMA mechanism
    and has channel hopping features in order to avoid the inevitable interference.
    The MAC protocol is multi-channel and offers many improvements as discussed in
    Section III-E3. Although TSCH offers high reliability for industrial automation,
    it lacks a scheduling entity to compute the schedule of nodes based on the traffic
    requirements of the application. TSCH defines the schedule, but how the schedule
    is built and maintained is unknown. Furthermore, 6TiSCH and 6LoWPAN standards
    emerged in order to provide an IP network that is capable of enabling low-power
    wireless standards as discussed in Section III-G and Section III-H, respectively.
    In this way, they promote interoperability among the latest and the traditional
    IP networks. D. Smart City The concept of a smart city envisions a city where
    information and communication technologies offer viable solutions to collect,
    analyze, and smartly distributes information in order to transform the services
    offered to the citizens, enhance operational efficiency, and help the public administration
    make better decisions [251], [252]. One of the promising projects for a smart
    city is the Smart Santander Project [50], conducted in the Spanish port city,
    Santander. It proposes a smart city where sensors, actuators, cameras, and screens
    are deployed around the city to help citizens better utilize information [253].
    The smart city promises to manage and optimize the plethora of public services,
    such as monitoring structural health, air quality and noise, as well as traffic
    management, smart parking, managing city energy consumption, waste management,
    smart lighting, and the automation of public buildings [254]. This vision can
    be realized by utilizing the telecommunication infrastructure, as well as several
    technologies like as WSN, M2M, and Vehicular to Vehicular (V2V) communication.
    A smart city integrates several emerging technologies with existing information
    and communication infrastructure in order to exhibit the successful evolution
    of IoT. The environment is heterogeneous, i.e., it encompasses different types
    of devices and generates different types of data traffic. Such an environment
    vastly depends on the networking connectivity, which demands high reliability,
    availability, low latency, and, at the same time, satisfies the requirements of
    all levels of applications. The major barrier is the interoperability among the
    several heterogeneous technologies to be able to work together to achieve a common
    goal. In such a scenario, providing reliable connectivity is a huge challenge
    not only because of the coexistence of a large number of devices that comply with
    different technologies but also because these devices can face severe interference.
    In such scenarios, impaired network connectivity can result in catastrophic situations
    for the wide variety of offered services and applications. In looking at the requirements
    that are defined by the smart cities, low-power standards, such as ZigBee, Bluetooth,
    IEEE 802.11ah, NFC, and Z-Wave, can fulfill their demands, but they are unable
    to provide high throughput and extended transmission range [255]. Furthermore,
    the advanced technologies, such as 3GPP, WiMAX, LTE, and LTE-Advanced, are not
    suitable due to their high power consumption because most of the smart city applications
    require small sensors that will be deployed everywhere and run on batteries. In
    order to realize the smart city concepts, low-power standards have to promote
    interoperability. A massive number of devices will be installed and need to work
    together efficiently, so scalable protocols are necessary. SECTION X. Related
    Surveys There exist various survey papers that discuss the characteristics, technologies,
    standards, and applications of IoT [21], [256]–[259]. Unfortunately, these studies
    did not cover the recent wireless technologies and their suitability for each
    IoT application. In particular, a comprehensive study on MAC and PHY layers in
    these technologies is missing. A recent study in [257] focuses on exploring the
    network architectures of IoT. The authors discuss the classification of IoT architectures
    and outline future architectural requirements. However, the paper does not cover
    aspects such as low-power standardization or well-known infrastructure protocols
    for IoT. Another survey in [21] provides an excellent, holistic discussion of
    IoT with respect to its architecture, common standards, elements, technologies,
    infrastructure protocols, applications, and market opportunities. It is more of
    a general overview of the various aspects of IoT, however, it does not cover the
    in-depth technical details, pitfalls, and limitations of MAC protocols of low-power
    standards. The survey paper in [258] provides a sound analysis of recent advances
    in IoT. The authors focus the paper on the standardized protocol stack and examine
    the IETF standardization efforts and protocols. The paper provides a profound,
    technical discussion on the application, MAC, routing and transport layers, as
    well as low-power radio characteristics. However, it does not cover their applicability
    and limitations in different IoT application domains. The IoT survey paper in
    [256] examines the IETF current standards and protocols and explores open questions,
    limitations, opportunities, and future challenges. However, it discusses only
    the defacto standards. Besides, some surveys focus on a single IoT application
    and its requirements as well as the suitability of each wireless technology for
    it. For example, Yuehong et al. [229] explored the application of IoT in health
    care. The study provides a general overview of a system architecture for IoT-based
    smart health care. It is a general overview, and the specific requirements for
    applications are not mentioned. Similarly, Domingo [260] studied the research
    trend to improve the quality of life for individuals with disabilities. The study
    shows the possible solutions to overcome the limitations of some disabilities
    by using connected sensors and positioning technologies. The adaptability of optimal
    wireless technology for each scenario has been reviewed as well. The study lacks
    a larger pool of individuals and ignores the challenge of providing a low-power
    network. In [261] WBANs for medical and non-medical applications have been reviewed.
    The authors explained the uniqueness of this network because of the high mobility
    and placement of some sensors inside the human body. The scope of this is limited
    to the WBANs, and challenges, such as the coexistence of the wireless network,
    have not been taken into consideration. As was mentioned earlier, smart homes
    are another potential application of IoT. Alaa et al. [262] reviewed the research
    trend focusing on IoT-based smart homes. The study helps researchers to find out
    the challenges and demands of the desired smart homes. However, the study only
    classifies the number of researchers and directions and does not explain the technical
    specifications. The study in [204] only focuses on home automation. Raza et al.
    [263] reviewed the LPWAN for long-range communication networks such as SigFox
    and LoRaWAN. They explained the available technologies of these networks and applications.
    Due to the operation of LPWAN in the sub-1 GHz frequency and the requirement of
    having a different unlicensed band for every country, these technologies are not
    able to operate globally. In contrast with single application surveys, some other
    reviews only explain a single wireless technology. For instance, Gomez et al.
    [107] and Darroudi and Gomez [264] review the BLE standard from a protocol stack
    point of view and research to provide a BLE mesh network, respectively. On the
    other hand, surveys like [67], [265], and [266] only focus on IEEE 802.15.4 based
    standards. Blanckenstein et al. [267] reviewed low-power transceivers and suitability
    for each application. However, due to the novelty of technologies like BLE 5,
    they did not cover the latest transceivers. Additionally, the survey only reviews
    the hardware requirements for low-power networks. SECTION XI. Conclusion Emerging
    IoT applications impose several constraints in terms of reliability, timeliness,
    scalability, and energy efficiency. The purpose of our study was to provide a
    thorough discussion about existing low-power wireless standards, technologies,
    and protocols, and examine their suitability in diverse IoT application domains.
    We presented the requirements of different applications such as smart healthcare,
    industrial automation, and smart cities, and analyzed the potentials of existing
    standards in meeting such requirements. Our survey focused on the PHY and MAC
    layers because they directly influence the aforementioned constraints. In our
    attempt to explore their suitability, we highlighted several drawbacks of the
    MAC protocols. We also discussed the interference issue among the coexisting,
    low-power wireless networks, which is a major challenge that degrades the network
    performance for reliability and latency. We analyzed how the inherent schemes
    employed by the standards cope with the interference issues. Lastly, we presented
    the application domains of the IoT and the requirements for each scenario. Additionally,
    we introduced the optimal wireless solution for each application based on the
    demands. ACKNOWLEDGMENT (Ali Nikoukar and Saleem Raza contributed equally to this

    Abstract: This article presents the results regarding a systematic literature
    review procedure on

    digital twins applied to precision agriculture. In particular, research and development
    activities

    aimed at the use of digital twins, in the context of predictive control, with
    the purpose of improving

    soil quality. This study was carried out through an exhaustive search of scientiﬁc
    literature on ﬁve

    different databases. A total of 158 articles were extracted as a result of this
    search. After a ﬁrst

    screening process, only 11 articles were considered to be aligned with the current
    topic. Subsequently,

    these articles were categorised to extract all relevant information, using the
    preferred reporting items

    for systematic reviews and meta-analyses methods. Based on the obtained results,
    there are two main

    conclusions to draw: First, when compared with industrial processes, there is
    only a very slight rising

    trend regarding the use of digital twins in agriculture. Second, within the time
    frame in which this

    work was carried out, it was not possible to ﬁnd any published paper on the use
    of digital twins for

    soil quality improvement within a model predictive control context.

    Keywords: precision agriculture; digital twins; soil quality; systematic review

    1. Introduction

    According to [1], the underlying concept of digital twins was born after a presentation

    of M. Grieves at the University of Michigan in the early 2000s. Initially referred
    to as the

    “Mirrored Spaces Model”, this paradigm was presented in the context of product
    lifecycle

    management, where each system could be decomposed in two components: the physical

    system and its mirrored virtual entity where all the information about the system’s
    states

    could be reached [2,3]. Later, in [4], M. Grieves alluded to the same concept
    using the

    alternative term “digital twin”, which was put forward by J. Vickers, a NASA technologist

    in advanced materials [5]. For this reason, many authors credit NASA, the United
    States of

    America National Aeronautics and Space Administration, with coining the term “digital

    twin” [3,6,7]. Grieves and Vickers worked together on adapting the concept of
    digital

    twins in the manufacturing sector to improve product lifecycle management [8].
    Recently,

    in the Industry 4.0 technological umbrella, digital twins was presented as a way
    to increase

    productivity, efﬁciency, and adaptability [3,9–13]. The use of digital twins has
    been reported

    in the manufacturing process [14] of the automotive and energy [15] or even aerospace
    and

    health [13] industries.

    At its basic level, digital twins can be seen as realistic virtual representations
    (digital

    replicas) of entities with physical or logical existence, such as machines or
    processes. This

    virtual representation is accomplished by modelling the processes and assets using
    a

    broad range of different mathematical models and feeding them with massive amounts

    of real-world data. At the present, those data sets can be obtained through real-time
    data

    acquisition systems based on Internet of Things (IoT) technologies [16,17]. A
    digital twin

    model presents a data ﬂow that automatically ﬂuxes from the virtual entity to
    the physical

    entity, and the same process happens in the opposite direction, from the physical
    entity to

    the virtual entity [13,18].

    The implementation of the digital twin enables experimental process testing that

    facilitates the discovery of optimisation points and process simulation. Moreover,
    the

    digital system’s proﬁle can be seen as a fundamental component in a closed-loop
    control

    strategy, where the information provided by the digital twin may lead to physical
    actions

    that drive changes in the manufacturing processes. In addition, it also enables
    a complete

    understanding of the system’s operating mechanisms and contributes to increasing
    agility

    and robustness in response to disturbances [19,20]. Digital twins can also be
    used to

    investigate the status history and simulate future habits. In this way, they are
    implemented

    as a way of answering hypothetical questions and providing spontaneous revelations
    [21].

    Extrapolation from the industrial realm to primary sectors, such as agriculture,
    is a nat-

    ural step to take. Indeed, for agricultural processes, the same goals of productivity
    increase

    and product quality control are typical concerns. For this reason, agriculture
    virtualisation

    comes as a natural response since it seems to be a direct proportional relationship
    between

    productivity and agriculture digitalisation [22–24]. The societal relevance of
    this approach

    is translated by the amount of funding provided for research in this area. Among
    many

    others, the IoF2020 European project is an example where digital twins are employed
    in

    the agri-food area [13,25].

    As in many other sectors, agriculture has seen an increase in data collection
    for

    decision support. For example, through the deployment of local sensors and drones
    to

    access weather data and satellite images from remote servers, growers now have
    access to

    more information about the climate, soil, and crop vegetative states. In some
    way, these

    conditions converge to promote and speed up the integration of digital twins in
    agricultural

    processes. However, despite all this potential, their use in this context is still
    at an early

    stage of deployment [13,26,27]. There are several reasons that can be pointed
    out regarding

    why the use of digital twins in agriculture has not yet taken a quantitative leap.
    On one

    hand, agricultural processes are usually more complex than industrial processes.
    This

    complexity is not only due to the high dimensionality of the data but also to
    the fact that

    many of the variables involved, which strongly condition the behaviour of the
    processes,

    are stochastic in nature and cannot be manipulated or controlled. Moreover, the
    large area

    in which agriculture processes take place, in conjunction with the heterogeneous
    conditions

    found along those terrains, requires spacial and temporal data resolutions that
    are not

    technically and economically feasible. In this frame of reference, the present
    paper aims to

    present the results concerning a systematic literature review on digital twins
    in the context

    of precision agriculture.

    In general, the concept of precision agriculture is tightly connected to crop
    manage-

    ment paradigms, where a layer of information technology is added on top of standard

    production processes. Spatial and temporal information, obtained from a myriad
    of differ-

    ent sources, can be integrated into machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence
    algorithms

    to attain surgical control over all operational aspects of the production activities.
    With this

    new approach, it is expected to reduce the input of chemicals (for weed control,
    plant pro-

    tection against pests and diseases, and fertilisation) and the consequent negative
    effects on

    soil health and overall biodiversity while maintaining crop proﬁtability and good-quality

    food. Indeed, the information provided by these new approaches would support farmer’s

    decision making regarding site-speciﬁc management practices, thus allowing them
    to use

    resources more efﬁciently and with less environmental impact.

    The focus will be narrowed down to the published research that targets the use
    of

    such an approach for promoting the soil quality. Soil quality and soil health
    are often used

    synonymously, and are two terms very difﬁcult to deﬁne due to the extreme complexity

    Sensors 2023, 23, 1007

    3 of 30

    of the soil ecosystem [28]. A healthy soil is generally deﬁned as a soil with
    capacity to

    provide ecosystem services for all forms of life, while soil quality concerns
    the capacity

    of a speciﬁc soil to sustain a particular use, such as crop production [29]. Therefore,
    soil

    health/quality are two important parameters that affect the production of resources
    in

    agricultural ﬁelds. Recently, both soil health/quality have been receiving increasing
    interest

    from the scientiﬁc and political community. Indeed, in recent decades, soils around
    the

    world have been subject to severe and quick degradation processes, mostly due
    to climate

    change, land-use changes, and the implementation of unsustainable agricultural
    practices,

    such as the use of synthetic chemical fertilisers and soil tillage, among others
    [30]. These

    practices have triggered a series of cascading effects within the ecosystem, such
    as soil

    erosion, nutrient and moisture depletion, degradation, and loss of biodiversity
    [30]. It is

    therefore of primary importance to act in order to improve and/or restore the
    “health” and

    “quality” of soils. In this regard, precision agriculture and digital agriculture
    can play an

    important role. Soil quality is a very broad and generic term as it can be considered
    from

    a chemical, physical and biological perspective, or any combination of the three.
    In the

    current context of this work, soil quality will be measured based on the distance
    between

    the ideal chemical and physical characteristics for a healthy soil in olive oil
    production,

    in addition to the effectively observed characteristics. Regarding physical quantities,
    we

    speak, for example, of the temperature and relative humidity of the soil at different
    depths

    and electro-conductivities. From a chemical point of view, the pH and dissolved
    oxygen

    will be considered. Moreover, the concentration of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium

    will also be measured. Effects due to mechanical activities, such as ploughing
    and tilling,

    which cannot be performed automatically, will not be taken into consideration.

    In this work, particular interest will be directed to situations where the dynamic

    behaviour of the process, translated by a digital twin, is included in a closed-loop
    control

    strategy based on predictions generated by that model.

    This systematic review has targeted publications made since the year 2016 using
    ﬁve

    different databases. Details regarding the methodology applied to carry out the
    systematic

    review of the literature, the planning, and the conduction process are provided
    in Section 2.

    Section 3 presents the results and their respective discussion. After an analysis
    of the

    selected articles and the application of the selection criteria, a rigorous discussion
    of the

    subject is presented. Finally, in Section 4, we highlight our ﬁnal conclusions
    and remarks.

    2. Applied Methodology

    A systematic literature review (SLR) is a tool used to evaluate and interpret
    all ac-

    cessible and relevant research for the occurrences of keywords of interest and/or
    search

    questions. Using the systematic literature review method instituted by Kitchenham,
    this

    work was elaborated [27,31–33]. The paths to developing an SLR are divided into
    three

    main steps: planning, conducting, and reporting the review. Each of the phases
    plays an im-

    portant role in the ﬁnal review. The SLR’s mission is to present an assessment
    of a research

    topic by applying a methodology seen as reliable, accurate, and able to be audited
    [34–37].

    It is very important to carry out a preliminary search in a database available
    on the

    internet to identify if there is an SLR with an identical research topic. This
    should be

    performed before starting SLR planning. A new search would be unnecessary if a
    similar

    SLR already exists [38–40]. In the case of this SLR, several results were found
    for the theme

    “Digital Twins in Agriculture”. Modiﬁcations were made so that the topic became
    more

    restricted. For the new theme, “Digital Twins in Precision Agriculture for Soil
    Quality

    Improvement”, no identical results were found.

    2.1. Review Planning

    The SLR planning is divided into the deﬁnition of the search questions; the elaboration

    of the PICOC; the selection of keywords and synonyms; the determination of inclusion

    and exclusion criteria for articles from this systematic literature review; the
    creation of the

    search string; the choice of search sources; quality assessment; and the data
    extraction form.

    2.1.1. Deﬁnition of Search Questions

    In review planning, the process of identifying and deﬁning the review execution

    modes is determined, so that the review is completely replicable and traceable
    [36]. In the

    ﬁrst step, it is necessary to specify the research question to be investigated.
    The research

    questions (RQs) are presented in Table 1.

    Table 1. Key phrases used in the database query. Questions.

    Search Questions

    RQ1

    RQ2

    RQ3

    In the context of agriculture,

    what were the applications of

    digital twins?

    In these digital twins, what

    were the control techniques or

    actions employed?

    Was there a concern or action

    to minimise the impact caused

    on the soil based on reducing

    the application of chemical

    and mechanical actions?

    2.1.2. Preparation of the PICOC Method

    In the second stage, after the determination of the QRs, the PICOC methodology

    was applied to deﬁne the purpose of the review. This methodology helps in the
    article

    analysis process and was developed and described by Petticrew and Roberts [38]).
    Its

    characterisation is shown as:

    •

    Population (P): Who?

    •

    Intervention (I): What and how?

    •

    Comparison (C) : What to compare?

    •

    Result (O) : What are the ﬁnal goals you seek to achieve?

    •

    Context (C): What are the contexts?

    The PICOC method, previously deﬁned, will be used in this search, and is presented

    in Table 2.

    words and their corresponding synonyms, in addition to relating them to the PICOC
    method.

    2.1.4. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

    To deﬁne the relevant articles and relate them to the research questions, the
    inclusion

    (IC) and exclusion (EC) rules were established. If the article meets any of the
    following

    criteria, it must be included or withdrawn from the study. The inclusion criteria
    are

    presented in Table 4.

    The articles were found and extracted from the libraries, to which the inclusion

    and exclusion (EC) criteria were applied. In this step, it is necessary to read
    the abstract

    and the keywords to deﬁne the relevant articles. Finally, they were accepted to
    integrate

    the following steps of the ﬁnal systematic review under study.

    2.1.5. Quality Criteria

    In this stage, quality criteria are applied based on questions of veriﬁcation
    and an

    analysis of the selected paper quality. The article needs to be read completely,
    and the

    questions must be very speciﬁc, with each one having a speciﬁc score. The quality
    questions

    (QQ) are presented in Table 6.

    The answer can have three different values: 1.0 (highest score) if the question
    is

    completely answered, 0.5 (medium score) if the question is partially answered,
    and 0.0

    (lowest score) if the question is not answered.

    All questions can be answered with “yes” or “no”. The ﬁrst three questions are
    more

    comprehensive (QQ1, QQ2, QQ3). The following questions are more speciﬁc (QQ4,
    QQ5,

    QQ6, QQ7, QQ8, QQ9).

    Sensors 2023, 23, 1007

    6 of 30

    Table 6. Quality Questions.

    Quality Questions

    QQ1

    Was the article based on research and not on expert opinion?

    QQ2

    Does the article have a clear research objective?

    QQ3

    Does the article discuss the results of the work?

    QQ4

    Was the development context of the article an agricultural environment?

    QQ5

    Was the application of one or more digital twins discussed in the article?

    QQ6

    Were the applications of digital twins sufﬁciently characterized?

    QQ7

    Were the challenges and activities of applying digital twins discussed in the
    article?

    QQ8

    Were the contributions and beneﬁts of soil digital twin applications discussed
    in

    the article?

    QQ9

    Does the article answer at least one of the research questions?

    The questions QQ4, QQ5, QQ6, QQ7, QQ8, and QQ9 have high relevance in deter-

    mining the quality of the publications under study because they answer the main
    topics

    of interest in this systematic review. The sum of the maximum score of these questions

    corresponds to a score of 6.0.

    Based on the quality criteria, the cut-off score is 6.0 for any article. In this
    way, all

    publications that have a grade greater than 6.0 are added to the ﬁnal SLR. Furthermore,

    those with a lower score are excluded. Likewise, the maximum score for any article
    was

    deﬁned as 9.0. Therefore, no article can score higher than that. The results of
    this quality

    criteria step are presented in Table 3 of Section 3.

    2.1.6. Data Extraction Form

    The ﬁnal step of SLR planning is data extraction, in which new data extraction
    ques-

    tions must be created to determine meaningful information and extract it. Data
    extraction

    issues (DQ) are determined, as follows, in Table 7.

    Table 7. Data extraction questions.

    Data Extraction Questions

    DQ1

    What were the main applications of digital twins?

    DQ2

    What were the main objectives?

    DQ3

    What were the main challenges/obstacles faced?

    DQ4

    What were the main technologies used?

    DQ5

    What were the main contributions found?

    DQ6

    Did the article discuss the applications of soil digital twins?

    After the data extraction step, the results obtained were organised in a table
    format

    and presented in the results section (Section 3) in Table 4. All the classiﬁed
    articles must

    present a score equal to or greater than 6.0.

    2.2. Conduction

    Subsequently, in the planning stage, the process called driving must be carried
    out.

    This was carried out following the PRISMA method, which characterises and describes
    in

    detail the phases of the driving process. Figure 1 illustrates the process of
    performing SLR.

    Sensors 2023, 23, 1007

    7 of 30

    Figure 1. Conduction process.

    Regarding conduction stages, they are broken down into identiﬁcation, triage,
    eligibil-

    ity, and inclusion.

    Upon identiﬁcation, articles are discovered in each search source using the search

    string and are saved. Subsequently, repeated articles were removed. In triage,
    only the

    title, abstract, and keywords were read in each publication. Then, inclusion and
    exclusion

    criteria were applied, and publications that are not classiﬁed by the established
    criteria are

    also excluded. For the remaining publications, eligibility was applied to the
    deﬁned quality

    issues. Each publication, read in its entirety, had a score assigned. Furthermore,
    those who

    do not obtain a minimum score above the pre-established limit (6.0) were excluded.
    Upon

    inclusion, publications that obtained high value were approved and classiﬁed for
    the ﬁnal

    SLR. Eventually, data extractions were performed based on extraction questions.

    The instrument used to complete this systematic literature review was the program

    called “PICO Portal” © (https://picoportal.org/about-us/ (accessed on 6 January
    2022)).

    In this way, by using this tool, it is possible to organise the steps more easily,
    plan the

    review, import the work, and ask questions. Finally, a ﬁnal report on the review
    and its

    main features was prepared, with results being presented in the Results section
    (Section 3).

    Creation of the String and Selection of Search Sources

    In this stage, the search strings are created. It is secondly expressed as an
    equation

    that evidences all the main terms of the search. To ﬁnd relevant publications
    on the topic,

    this string needs to be tested in each one of the databases. Depending on the
    website, the

    search string may vary and require speciﬁc uses of characters.The search string
    created for

    this systematic review is presented:

    (“digital twin*”) AND (agri* OR crop* OR farm*) AND (soil OR land OR ﬁeld OR “ﬁeld*

    management*” OR “soil quality*”) :

    These databases are well-known in this ﬁeld of research: Springer Link, Association
    for

    Computing Machinery, ISI Web of Science, Institute of Electrical and Electronics
    Engineers,

    and Scopus. All selected search sources are important and known in the research
    area,

    especially in the areas of technology. Furthermore, they are very relevant to
    the research

    topic developed in this literature review. Table 8 shows the search phrase used

    In the identiﬁcation step, the search is performed in ﬁve databases using the
    search

    string from the obtained results. A total of 158 articles were found, and we removed

    28 duplicates.

    In the triage stage, we considered the 130 remaining articles, and after the inclusion

    and exclusion criteria were applied, 109 articles were excluded. In the eligibility
    stage, the

    21 remaining articles were read in full before a quality assessment was performed
    (quality

    questions), in which 10 articles were excluded.

    In inclusion, as a result of the ﬁlters applied in the previous phases, a total
    of 11 articles

    were selected to integrate the systematic literature review and data extraction.
    Thus, these

    articles met all the criteria evaluated. The entire conduction process is shown
    in the diagram

    of Figure 3.

    of

    which 11 were classiﬁed for the data extraction stage. Each of the articles that

    more than 6.0 in the answers to the quality questions moved on to the next phase,
    which

    contained the most important scoring questions (pre-set along with the quality
    criteria).

    Ten articles were excluded for presenting scores below the established limit.

    Table 11 presents the data referring to two stages of the SLR. The ﬁrst column
    corre-

    sponds to the years in which the articles were published. The second column corresponds

    to the number of articles selected and the result of the ﬁrst phase of the systematic
    review.

    Furthermore, the third corresponds to the number of articles accepted and the
    result of the

    quality criteria stage.

    Figure 4 symbolises the percentage of articles selected per year through the use
    of

    search phrases. Figure 5 symbolises the percentage of articles accepted per year
    through

    the application of quality criteria. By analysing these ﬁgures, it can be seen
    that the articles

    found are very recent.

    From the scores determined in the previous step, it is possible to calculate the
    statistical

    values of the median and average and determine the maximum and minimum values.
    Fur-

    thermore, this also indicates the cut-off score. Table 12 presents the statistical
    calculations.

    Figure 6 illustrates the distribution of quality data. The median score of the
    21 articles

    included in the quality assessment stage was 6.0, and the mean was 6.5.

    DQ3

    In agricultural production, it has generally been very difﬁcult to plan the work,
    even

    with precision in the composition and order of operations, which is due to the
    great

    lack of knowledge about plant life, characterised by high complexity, uncertainty,

    DQ3

    Digital twins (DT) have a huge margin of success in the ﬁeld of sustainable agriculture.

    However, the number of works carried out in this ﬁeld was relatively less compared

    with other domains. There is a great need to adopt more efﬁcient and sustainable

    production methods. To support this, a detailed review of next-gen DT apps in
    smart

    agriculture was performed in this article. It found that challenges, such as natural

    disasters, soil erosion, climate change, urbanisation, and epidemics, are making
    soil-

    less farming methods increasingly popular compared with soil cultivation

    It is important to highlight that the Scopus and Springer Link libraries were
    the

    databases in which the largest number of articles were found. The libraries wherein
    the

    least amount of articles were found were ACM and IEEE. The articles selected,
    in the

    inclusion stage, are mostly very recent, and most of them were published in 2021
    and 2022.

    3.2. Results Analysis

    After applying the data extraction phase for all these articles, information is
    obtained

    on all the digital twins found. Table 15 lists all 11 digital twin results found,
    as well as their

    respective references. Digital twin applications were mostly related to the cultivation
    of a

    speciﬁc crop, the use of urban farming techniques, and conceptual reviews.

    The use of terms related to ontology and multi-agents were often cited in many
    of the

    articles [41,55,59]. The terms related to IoT and big data were often cited in
    [7,18,46,50,56,57].

    In addition, the terms related to artiﬁcial intelligence and intelligent systems
    were often

    cited in [7,18,41,46,53,56].

    Table 15 presents the relevant information about each application of digital twins
    in

    agriculture, extracted from the last review step and based on the data extraction
    questions

    presented in Section 2.1.6. In the ﬁrst column, each digital twin is related to
    the questions,

    and in the second column, each topic is associated with them.

    The digital twins listed in Table 15 are described in Table 16, as some digital
    twins were

    mentioned in the articles without any detailed information. Table 16 presents
    the applica-

    tions of digital twins, in which it was possible to obtain data through the selected
    works.

    At the end of the systematic literature review and after the extraction of data
    from

    all accepted articles, the previously proposed research questions (Section 2.1.1)
    were an-

    swered. Furthermore, in Table 16 the results of the research questions are presented
    with a

    description of the applications of digital twins (taken from the data extraction
    phase).

    At the end of the systematic literature review and after the extraction of data
    from all

    accepted articles, the research questions (Section 2.1.1) were answered. Furthermore,
    the

    answers are presented below.

    RQ1: In the context of agriculture, what are the applications of digital twins?

    Within the context of precision agriculture, they were categorised into different
    ap-

    plication sectors. The results found are associated with the cultivation of crops,
    such as

    wheat and “ginseng berry”. For example, the DT service for rice cultivation was
    developed,

    which allows the planning and modelling of the rice cultivation process according
    to cli-

    matic conditions [41]. A conceptual model of the digital twin is proposed. The
    proposed

    DT model is implemented in the laboratory environment for the cultivation of “ginseng

    berries” [46]. It describes a prototype system for a DT smart plant and discusses
    the main

    results and perspectives for the development of the digital twin system in wheat
    cultiva-

    tion [55]. The WebGIS framework is presented as an organising principle that connects
    local

    data generators and so-called site-speciﬁc smart farms to a regional and global
    networked

    view of agriculture that can support both the agricultural industry and policymakers
    in

    government [59].

    [41]

    RQ1

    It is developed as a stand-alone service and can be integrated with any existing

    digital agriculture platform. A pilot integration with the cyber–physical system

    for agriculture needs

    RQ2

    Fast, ﬂexible, and efﬁcient planning of agro-technological operations, as well
    as

    the subsequent control of the implementation of selected cultivation technologies.

    Monitoring and control of plant growth and development in ﬁelds using the

    digital twin

    RQ3

    The system performs adaptive scheduling of resources, such as fertilisers, protec-

    tion agents, vehicles, personnel, and ﬁnances. Implementing DT in proper service

    decision making compared with pilot farming experiments makes businesses

    smarter, more ﬂexible, and cost-effective, providing better plant cultivation
    pro-

    ductivity and agriculture sustainability to combat global climate change. The

    idea of accurate agricultural mail is that ﬁeld processing is performed based

    on the actual state of crops at a given time and place. These needs can be de-

    termined by several modern information applications, namely remote sensing.

    At the same time, the treatment means are differentiated in several areas of the

    ﬁeld, providing the best efﬁciency with the minimum environmental impact and

    reducing the amount of waste used

    Case study 02

    [18]

    RQ1

    The Sensing Change project developed a soil probe, while the SWAMP project

    is currently developing an Internet of Things platform for water management

    on farms. This article leverages the technologies developed by these projects

    by building an initial digital environment to create a cyber–physical system

    (CPS) so that farmers can better understand the state of their farms in terms
    of

    resource and equipment usage. The system can collect data from the land probe

    and display its information on a dashboard that allows for the deployment of

    more land probes and other monitoring and control devices to create a fully

    operational digital twin. Presents the primary development of a digital twin

    for smart agriculture using IoT to control an irrigation system based on farmer

    decisions and/or AI

    RQ2

    Project consists of a monitoring station, a smartphone app, and a cloud system.

    A monitoring system was developed for a farm that could collect and analyse

    information. Proposed system: On the farm, there are several devices and sys-

    tems deployed, such as soil probes, weather stations, irrigation systems, seeders,

    harvesters, etc. These devices and equipment are connected to the cloud through

    a gateway that sends information to an IoT Agent (a service that translates var-

    ious communication protocols into the one used in the cloud). However, to

    fully develop a smart digital farm, all environments must be developed using an

    integrative approach . Data collected and analysed in the cloud as viewed in the

    digital environment must be entered into the physical system via the cloud or

    by connecting programmable logic controllers (PLCs) in the irrigation system,

    equipment, and machines

    RQ3

    By using the digital twin model and IoT technology, farmers can connect dif-

    ferent assets and systems to gain greater insight into the different aspects and

    parameters that affect farm behaviour and ﬁnal production and resource con-

    sumption. This is a key feature that allows farmers to make better decisions and

    reduce environmental impacts to water, land, and soil resources. This research

    indicates that the system design and cloud implementation are working and can

    be used in the implementation of the next steps, which are the development of

    AI algorithms and other digital contexts.

    RQ1

    The main contributions and meanings of this study are to suggest the digital twin

    smart farm architecture and to implement the concept in the laboratory environ-

    ment for a practical point of view. This shows how smart farm architecture can
    be

    realised based on digital twin technology. The concept is also applied in the
    smart

    farm environment itself, which shows the possibility of a commercial success

    story. Prescriptive DT: An intelligent digital object that aggregates intelligence
    to

    recommend corrective and preventive actions on real-life objects, usually based

    on optimisation algorithms and specialised heuristics, using predictive analytics.

    This article sets out to explore the recent trend of digital twin modelling prevalent

    in the smart farm context. After a literature review, the conceptual framework
    of

    the DT is proposed

    RQ2

    Digital twins have been adopted in smart agriculture across wide areas in the
    last

    decade. Digital twins can play a central role in farm management, which allows

    for decoupling the physical ﬂow from the cyber control system. In a smart farm

    environment, farmers can be free from soil or farmland. Instead, they can control

    and monitor the status of farming in the build room while using the monitor. This

    transforms agricultural activities into different dimensions compared with those

    used in the past. Several sensors are connected to the plant’s control module,

    which monitors the nutrient status and growth of the plant. External weather

    conditions are also monitored by sensors installed on the laboratory ceiling.

    According to weather conditions, electrical power is automatically supported or

    interrupted. The self-monitoring and control system plays the role of the digital

    twin in the DT system. We designed the LED and LD (laser diode) wavelength-

    controlled vegetable growing system that optimises the elements of plant growth.

    It is fully controlled and monitored based on digital twins and IoT. The actual

    growing system is designed using a laboratory-grade container

    RQ3

    All ﬁeld crops need soil, light (sun), temperature, air, water, and nutrition
    to

    grow. Soil gives plants stability; it also stores water and nutrients that plants

    can absorb through their roots. Light (sunlight) provides the energy needed

    for plant growth. Air allows plants to “breathe”. Water provides moisture and

    nutrition. The practical architecture of DT is explained. The smart farm is free

    of agriculture essentials, such as soil, sunlight, air, water, and fertilisers.
    It is

    designed and operated inside the building where the plant is growing in the

    water with nourishment and without any fertiliser, soil, and sunlight

    Case study 04

    [7]

    RQ1

    This review describes the state-of-the-art digital twin concepts, along with dif-

    ferent digital technologies and techniques in agricultural contexts. It presents

    an overview of digital twins in soil, irrigation, robotics, agricultural machinery,

    and post-harvest food processing in the agricultural ﬁeld. Data recording and

    modelling, including artiﬁcial intelligence, big data, simulation, analysis, and

    prediction, as well as the communication aspects of digital twins in agriculture

    are discussed. Digital twin systems can support farmers as a next-generation

    digitalisation paradigm, continuously monitoring the physical world (farm) in

    real time and updating the state of the virtual world

    Research Questions Results

    RQ2

    Data from the physical world (agricultural area), such as climate, fertiliser,
    and

    soil type, as well as information from developed models that simulate soil and

    crop behaviour, were considered as input data for the digital twin. The digital

    twin concept also consisted of a soil agent (including hydrological models and

    soil data), a crop agent (including crop models and evaporation data), and a ﬁeld

    avatar, which is a digital representation of the ﬁeld, such as geological models

    and climate data. Exchanging information from soil as a physical system to a

    virtual system using IoT, cloud, fog, and edge computing technologies in digital

    twins can allow us to assess the state of soil and irrigation systems. In particular,

    an edge computing technique that saves and executes data processing next to soil

    and irrigation monitoring devices can improve performance and overcome the

    problems of cloud-based systems in digital twin concepts. In addition, it could

    offer different irrigation recommendations based on crop needs that have not yet

    been resolved by researchers

    RQ3

    Monitoring and evaluating soil quality to sustain plant productivity is the basis

    of land-use strategies on agricultural farms. The health and productivity of

    crops depend on the quality and property of the soil. More detailed information

    about soil cultivation can reduce the potential use of chemical fertiliser and
    pesti-

    cide dosages, improve groundwater, and protect the environment and human

    health. This also allows you to deﬁne the plant density more efﬁciently. Digital

    technologies are helping scientists better understand and study the soil. Soil

    monitoring sensors, such as sensors for humidity, temperature, organic matter,

    and soil pollutants, are playing a critical role in digital agriculture

    Case study 05

    [50]

    RQ1

    In this article, several emerging and disruptive technologies for urban agriculture

    are reviewed and evaluated. Based on the literature from 2015 to 2021, IoT,

    automation, and AI are the top three technology innovations that are widely

    implemented and documented. In contrast, genetic modiﬁcation, AM, and

    nanotechnology are relatively new and are in the early stages of adoption

    RQ2

    A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical system. It uses simulation

    and AI to mirror system properties and behaviours in real time, incorporating
    all

    physical system statuses and information. Any changes to the physical system

    may be reﬂected by its digital counterpart. As such, a digital twin can illustrate

    how a physical system will react in different design alternatives and situations,

    supporting decision making without the need to create prototypes. With digital

    twins, farm operators do not need to be physically on the farm site to monitor,

    control, coordinate, and run farm operations. Simulating layers of vertical beds

    in different conﬁgurations optimises building resources. Virtual models of farm

    operating parameters (e.g., energy and water consumption) can guide agricul-

    tural operators in making decisions, thus maximising yields and minimising

    energy and water use. In addition to current data, historical data can be used
    to

    predict system behaviours. Thus, digital twins can act as early warning systems

    when the predicted environment goes outside safe operational limits. However,

    implementing digital twins for agriculture is complicated and demanding. Most

    agricultural variables are associated with living organisms and are difﬁcult to

    accurately model and simulate because of their intricate behaviours. In addi-

    tion, modelling and simulating the fertility of seeds, fertilisers, pesticides,
    and

    pollution is a challenge

    RQ3

    Virtual farm operation models can guide agricultural operators in making de-

    cisions, thus maximising yields and minimising energy and water usage. In

    addition, data is used to predict system histories. Thus, digital twins can act
    as

    early warning systems when the predicted environment exceeds safe operational

    limits. However, implementing digital twins for agriculture is complicated and

    demanding. Most agricultural variables are associated with living organisms

    and are deﬁned from the model

    RQ1

    The article aims to describe the background and related works, namely to describe

    a planning and decision support system for coordinating multiple farms and

    planning agricultural initiatives at the city level, to describe the cyber–physical

    aquaponics system that was developed, and present the results and empirical

    analysis. In the results section, we evaluated the effectiveness of a model-based

    digital twin approach and a machine learning approach to perform predictive

    decision analysis to predict urban agriculture production (a scalable “aquaponics”

    facility). Were also evaluated the ability of a modelling framework to generate

    meaningful insights into urban agriculture system design as a step towards a

    decision support system that uses an online simulation.

    RQ2

    The system architecture required to implement the system from the level of

    individual farms, data acquisition, and through a pre-processing step to enable

    greater coordination at the cloud layer, where global optimisation and advanced

    analysis and modelling capabilities predictors can be implemented. A use-case

    study is operational management. This case is supported by using real-time

    data from sensors to perform adaptive control and tactical management. The

    decision support system would connect different stakeholders and allow them

    to coordinate activities through a gateway. These users include agricultural

    facilities, retailers, distributors, and consumers

    RQ3

    The beneﬁts of urban agriculture have been identiﬁed in food security, resilience

    to climate disturbances, environmental sustainability, and positive economic and

    social outcomes. As an example, there is the possibility of reducing food waste

    by recycling food waste as fertiliser

    Case study 07

    [54]

    RQ1

    In this article, the digital twin of the underground farm faithfully represents
    the

    reality of the environment through real-time data streams, making it a useful

    representation for a farm operator. This includes three crucial elements: (a)
    Data

    Creation: An extensive and robust monitoring system that tracks observable

    environmental conditions at the underground farm. This is supported by data

    curation that ensures data quality and tractability; (b) Data analysis: Using
    ob-

    servable data in conjunction with information reported by agricultural operators

    to identify key variables that inﬂuence the farm environment and therefore crop

    yields; (c) Data modelling: Investigating the most appropriate techniques to

    identify trends and critical changes, predict possible future operational scenarios,

    and provide feedback on the inﬂuence of recent events on the farm environment

    RQ2

    The structure of the article follows the representation of the digital twin. We

    ﬁrst introduce the monitoring process and key data challenges of monitoring in

    a continuously operating environment. We present data analysis that includes:

    (a) the inﬂuence of the farm environment on crop growth, (b) the inﬂuence of

    operable controls on the environment, and (c) the inﬂuence of manual changes to

    operational controls. Within the limitations of the data, this exercise identiﬁes

    the variables that are crucial to tracking and predicting. Next, we introduce

    the data model, which is essentially a predictive model that predicts extreme

    temperatures and provides feedback on operational changes that can reduce

    energy usage and control the farm environment more effectively. We conclude

    with a discussion of the development of this digital twin. The ﬁve environmental

    variables that are continuously monitored are temperature, relative humidity

    (RH), CO2 concentration, air velocity, and light levels. Some of them, such as

    temperature, are monitored by several sensors, linked to different data loggers.

    This differs from typical CEA predictive control models, where changes in control

    processes (heating, ventilation) are automatically regulated in response to short-

    term temperature predictions

    The process of developing a digital twin of a unique hydroponic underground

    farm in London, Growing Underground (GU). The key to the continued oper-

    ational success of this farm and similar ventures is ﬁnding ways to minimise

    energy use while maximising crop growth and maintaining optimal growing

    conditions. As such, it belongs to the environmentally controlled agriculture
    class,

    where indoor environments are carefully controlled to maximise crop growth using

    artificial lighting and smart heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems

    RQ1

    Digital twin from the project to an intelligent cyber–physical system for preci-

    sion agriculture management. The article discusses the constructive principles

    of the DT plant, as well as models, methods, and speciﬁc characteristics of its

    implementation, which is the basis of an intelligent cyber–physical system (ICPS)

    for precision agriculture management. It shows the main directions of digi-

    talisation in agriculture associated with the beginning of the development of

    cyber–physical systems for precision agriculture. It presents the problem state-

    ment for creating a DT in the form of an intelligent decision support system

    using a detailed formalised representation of knowledge about each stage of

    plant development. Provides an overview of existing developments in the use

    of CPS and DTs. It describes the structure and functions of the IDT plant based

    on multi-agent technology and the ontological representation of knowledge. It

    proposes a new model to assess the yield and duration of plant development

    stages based on the range of change for the most important parameters of plant

    development at each stage. It examines the method for calculating the duration

    of the plant’s developmental stage depending on changes in temperature and

    crop yield. It describes a prototype system for a DT smart plant. It discusses

    the main results and perspectives for the development of the system with the

    IDT plant

    RQ2

    If the DT is synchronised with a real plant, i.e., it can properly reﬂect its
    state,

    e.g., through regular inspections of real plants by agronomists, it can be used

    by agronomists to develop and make decisions, such as whether to implement

    agro-technical measures based on planning, in addition to modelling possible

    problem situations and ﬁnding ways to solve them

    RQ3

    Knowledge about the microstates of plant development should help less qualiﬁed

    agronomists to more accurately model and predict plant growth and change

    plans for agro-technical measures on time, developing management actions in

    case of deviations from the actual development of the plant by the application

    of fertilisers. Regarding fertiliser application volumes, it is known that this

    is usually quite expensive, requiring loans that can only be returned after the

    harvest is sold

    Case study 09

    [56]

    RQ1

    A review of research works carried out on the application of DT in smart agricul-

    ture was presented. Performing predictive analysis in hydroponics using DT can

    solve many problems

    RQ2

    To improve the temperature prediction of the nutrient solution, the DT concept

    can be applied with the aid of meteorological data. By using DT, the relationship

    between nutrient solution temperature and meteorological factors can be found

    leading to the development of a predictive model for nutrient solution tempera-

    ture. The various methods suggested by hydroponics producers to control the

    temperature of the nutrient solution are the use of centrifugal or squirrel-cage

    fans or even air conditioners. Using DTs, farmers can estimate the performance

    of such cooling devices when installed on a hydroponics farm without actually

    installing actual devices. It allows farmers to create an efﬁcient initial design
    of

    their farm and evaluate the performance caused by adding new features such as

    fans and heaters

    RQ3

    Hydroponics are one of the popular ways of growing soil-less plants indoors,

    reducing fertiliser usage and providing more protection from pests and adverse

    weather conditions. Hydroponics challenges also include the need for capital

    investment and experience in operational control systems. Reducing the use of

    fertilisers used in hydroponics and the environmental performance of various

    nutrient-recovery methods are discussed

    Case study 10

    [57]

    RQ1

    The growing impact of climate change, the next revolution in precision agricul-

    ture and agriculture in general, will be driven by Sustainable Precision Agri-

    culture and Environment (SPAE, similar to the 7 Rs ). This transitions from a

    site-speciﬁc management focus to a global sustainability notion. In this transition,

    it presents WebGIS as a principle that connects local data systems and as site-

    speciﬁc smart grid generators to an agricultural industry view. The increasing

    use of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Necessary Things, drones,
    and big

    data, which will serve as the global basis for the “digital twin”, will contribute
    to

    the development of conservation practices, site-speciﬁc management that ensure

    the conservation, and general sustainability

    RQ2

    Innovative advances in modern farm management can resemble the notion of

    “digital twins”, which is the conﬂuence of IoT, AI, and big data. A digital twin
    is

    “a digital replica of a living or non-physical entity” that is used “to create
    living

    digital simulation models that update and change as their physical counterparts

    change". In terms of farm management, digital twins mean that “farm operations

    no longer need physical proximity, for the remote monitoring, control, and

    coordination of farming operations"

    Among other positive impacts, SPACE collaborates to increase yields and the

    sustainability of agricultural systems

    RQ1

    An approach was proposed for creating a digital wheat twin based on multi-

    agent knowledge bases and technologies to model wheat cultivation. The need

    to develop physical cybernetic systems for the management of agricultural en-

    terprises was discussed, providing the problem statement for creating a control

    object model, i.e., digital twin plant that will do the research and determine
    the

    entire plant growth and development cycle, as well as the production plan for
    the

    enterprise. It provides an overview of existing approaches to the development
    of

    digital twins and proposes a new approach with ontological models and multi-

    agent systems. It describes a multi-agent system for planning and modelling

    plant development, which is the core part of the plant’s digital twin. I discusses

    the ontology development and knowledge base of plant developmental stages,

    which are the basis for the digital twin and the interaction protocol between
    the

    agronomist and the digital twin plant

    RQ2

    Cyberphysical systems are a new type of system that integrate computing, com-

    munication, and control components, including sensors, actuators, and network

    connectors. Modern precision agriculture technologies with daily controlled

    plant cultivation can signiﬁcantly improve product quality and agricultural pro-

    duction efﬁciency. This approach hypothesises that the reasoning of agronomists

    and other experts in farm management can be modelled as a self-organising

    process from the above entities, which can be implemented using multi-agent,

    plant-growing technology to simulate prospective scenarios for new crops, pre-

    dicting returns and risks for the business. Furthermore, they can improve the

    quality and efﬁciency of agricultural management decisions

    RQ3

    The plant’s digital twin will be created for each ﬁeld to mirror the plant’s current
    growth

    and development. It would mirror the daily development of the plant, representing

    the most anticipated version of the plant development plan, updated daily with
    data

    from the weather server, sensors in the ﬁelds, and observations from agronomists.
    Thus,

    before the agronomist makes suggestions about the actions that need to be taken
    in each

    ﬁeld in a given situation, they can “simulate” the impact on the crop and analyse
    the

    possible “response”. This process needs to be supported in the proposed system
    so that

    the agronomist can use it, and compare it with the real plant response. In this
    way,

    knowledge about plant cultivation can be adjusted year after year, modifying the
    plant’s

    decision-making model and creating a more accurate digital twin, expanding a possible

    state graph of the agent under various conditions. The main idea of the proposed
    approach

    is to consider crop cultivation as a complex adaptive system with collective decisions

    distributed among crop varieties, soil, fertilisers, precise machines, etc.

    The results found are used as important tools to boost the state of the art in
    a speciﬁc

    ﬁeld. This review describes the state-of-the-art digital twin concepts, along
    with different

    digital technologies and techniques in agricultural contexts [7]. It is a review
    of emerging

    and disruptive technologies for urban agriculture [50]. One study is a review
    of research

    work carried out on the application of DT in smart agriculture (predictive analysis
    in

    hydroponics) [56].

    Results related to different applications were found. That is, the use of irrigation

    presents the primary development of a digital twin for smart agriculture using
    IoT to

    control an irrigation system based on farmer decisions and/or AI [18]. Associated
    with city-

    level agriculture, we evaluated the effectiveness of a model-based digital twin
    approach

    and a machine learning approach to perform predictive decision analysis to predict
    urban

    agriculture production (a scalable aquaponics facility) [53]. Results were found
    about

    controlled-environment agriculture, and the digital twin of the underground farm
    faithfully

    represented the reality of the environment through real-time data streams, making
    it a

    useful representation for a farm operator [54]. Finally, concerning sustainable
    precision

    agriculture and the environment, the WebGIS framework is an organising principle
    that

    connects local data generators and so-called speciﬁc smart farms to a regional
    and global

    network view of agriculture. This will help to integrate databases located on
    networks into

    a system to achieve the necessary SPAE management and connect different ﬁelds
    [57].

    RQ2: In these digital twins, what are the predictive control techniques and control

    actions employed?

    After analysing the data obtained, the responses were organised in different domains

    and correlated with the control actions found. The results found are associated
    with multi-

    agent technologies: the monitoring and control of plant growth and development
    in ﬁelds

    using the digital twin. To support the decision-making process and management
    of agricul-

    tural production, ontologies and multi-agents must be used [41]. Data from the
    physical

    world, such as climate, fertiliser, and soil type, as well as information from
    developed mod-

    els that simulate soil and crop behaviour, were considered as input data for the
    digital twin.

    The digital twin concept also consisted of a soil agent (includes hydrological
    models and soil

    data), a crop agent (includes crop models and evaporation data), and a ﬁeld avatar,
    which is

    a digital representation of the ﬁeld, such as geological models and climate data
    [7]. Cyber–

    physical systems (CPS) are a new type of system, integrating computing, communication,

    and control components, including sensors, actuators, and network connectors.
    Modern

    precision agriculture technologies with daily controlled plant cultivation can
    signiﬁcantly

    improve product quality and agricultural production efﬁciency. This approach hypothe-

    sizes that agronomists and other experts in farm management can model a self-organising

    process of the entities to be implemented using multi-agent technology. Furthermore,
    it

    improves the quality and efﬁciency of agricultural management decisions [59].
    The results

    found are related to predictive control, the architecture of necessary for implementation

    at a farm level, data acquisition, and a pre-processing step. Thus, advanced analysis
    and

    modelling predictors can be implemented to allow for global coordination and optimisation.

    A use-case study is operational management. This case is supported by using real-time

    data from sensors to perform adaptive control and tactical management [53]. Within
    the

    limitations of the data, crucial variables for tracking and prediction are identiﬁed.
    The

    data model was introduced, which is essentially a predictive model that predicts
    extreme

    temperatures and provides feedback on operational changes that can reduce energy
    usage

    and control the farm environment more efﬁciently. We conclude with a discussion
    of

    the development of this digital twin. The ﬁve environmental variables that are
    contin-

    uously monitored are temperature, relative humidity, CO2 concentration, airspeed,
    and

    light levels [54]. By using DT, the relationship between nutrient solution temperature
    and

    meteorological factors can be found, leading to the development of a predictive
    model for

    nutrient solution temperatures. The various methods suggested by hydroponics producers

    for controlling the temperature of the nutrient solution include the use of centrifugal
    fans,

    squirrel-cage fans, or even air conditioners [56]. The main results found are
    related to the

    management of farms, and a monitoring system was developed for a farm that could
    collect

    and analyse information. On the farm, there are various devices and systems deployed,

    such as soil probes, weather stations, irrigation systems, seeders, harvesters,
    etc., [18]. The

    proposed digital twin model was implemented at the laboratory and ﬁeld levels.
    According

    to weather conditions, electrical power is automatically supported or interrupted.
    The

    digital twin plays a role in farm management to enable self-monitoring and control
    of

    systems. The system is fully controlled and monitored based on digital twins and
    IoT [46].

    With these architectural advances in farm management, the modern farm can resemble

    the notion of “digital twins”, which is the conﬂuence of IoT, AI, and big data.
    Digital

    twins mean that agricultural operations no longer require physical proximity,
    which allows

    for the remote monitoring, control, and coordination of agricultural operations
    [57]. The

    results found are associated with other forms of mitigating actions. This, coupled
    with the

    coordination of agricultural operators, means that the digital twin uses simulation
    and AI

    to mirror system properties and behaviours in real time, incorporating all the
    statuses and

    information of the physical system. With digital twins, agricultural operators
    do not need

    to be physically at the agricultural site to monitor, control, coordinate, and
    run agricultural

    operations. Any changes to the physical system can be reﬂected by its digital
    counterpart.

    The digital twin will support decision making without the need to create prototypes
    [50].

    Finally, associated with monitoring the state of nutrients, if the DT is synchronised
    with

    a plant (physical), it can adequately reﬂect its state, such as through regular
    inspections.

    They can be used by agronomists to develop and make management decisions in carrying

    out agro-technical measures based on planning and modelling possible problem situations

    and ﬁnding ways to solve them [55].

    RQ3: Is this minimisation of the impact caused on the soil based on reducing the

    application of chemical and mechanical actions?

    Within the context of precision agriculture, they were categorised into different
    actions

    related to the reduction in impacts on the soil. The results found are related
    to resource

    management, such as the implementation of DT in decision making on the efﬁciency
    and

    sustainability of agriculture under global climate change. The platform determines
    the

    control of agro-technical conditions, including the determination of the volumes,
    con-

    centrations, and application rates of fertilisers and phytopharmaceutical products
    (plant-

    protection products) as a function of climate [41]. The use of digital twins makes
    it possible

    to determine the parameters that affect the behaviours of the farm and the ﬁnal
    production

    and consumption of resources. This is a key feature that allows farmers to make
    better

    decisions and lessen the environmental impacts on resources [18]. Virtual models
    of farm

    operating parameters can guide agricultural operators in making decisions, thus
    maximis-

    ing yields and minimising energy and water use. Digital twins can act as safe
    operating

    boundary monitoring systems [50]. Monitoring and evaluating soil quality can reduce

    the potential use of chemical fertiliser and pesticide dosages, improve groundwater,
    and

    Sensors 2023, 23, 1007

    26 of 30

    protect the environment and human health. This also supports setting the plant
    density

    more efﬁciently. Soil monitoring sensors, such as sensors for moisture, temperature,
    organic

    matter, and soil pollutants, can provide soil moisture information that can be
    used to assess

    irrigation efﬁciency in the agricultural ﬁeld [7]. The digital plant twin will
    be created for

    each ﬁeld to mirror the actual growth and development of the plant, representing
    the

    most anticipated version of the plant development plan, updated daily with data
    from the

    weather server, sensors in ﬁelds, and observations from agronomists. The main
    idea of

    the proposed approach is to consider crop cultivation as a complex adaptive system
    with

    collective decisions [59].

    The results found are related to soil-less cultivation, namely hydroponics and
    the

    process of developing a digital twin of a unique underground hydroponic farm.
    The key

    to the continued operational success of this farm and similar ventures is ﬁnding
    ways

    to minimise energy use and maximise crop growth while maintaining optimal growing

    conditions in which indoor environments are controlled [54]. Hydroponics is one
    of

    the popular soil-less ways to grow plants indoors, which reduces fertiliser usage
    and

    provides more protection from pests and adverse weather conditions. It aims to
    study the

    environmental performance of various nutrient-recovery methods [56].

    Results were found related to various actions to reduce impacts on the ground.
    That

    is, in urban agriculture, food security, resilience to climate disturbances, environmental

    sustainability, and positive economic and social outcomes have been identiﬁed.
    By pre-

    dicting the effect of agricultural policy decisions on social and economic variables
    [53],

    SPAE will contribute to increasing sustainability, reducing nutrient transport
    [57]. Finally,

    it investigates actions that are related to monitoring the state of nutrients

    The project is operated inside the building where the plant is growing in water
    with

    nourishment and without any fertiliser, soil, or sunlight. Several sensors are
    connected

    to the plant’s control module, which monitors the plant’s nutrient and growth
    status

    and external weather conditions as well [46]. Knowledge about the microstates
    of plant

    development should help to more accurately model and predict plant growth [55].

    3.3. Discussion

    In the present work, a systematic literature review was carried out. This work
    intended

    to survey the scientiﬁc publications, produced since 2016, that had developed
    or worked

    with a soil’s digital twins in the context of smart farming and precision agriculture.
    Par-

    ticularly, the interest lies in the use of the soil’s digital twin in the context
    of a closed-loop

    predictive control, where this digital twin, fed with real-time data, can be used
    to carry out

    short- and long-term forecasts.

    Following the methodology used in this review, a total of 158 articles were found
    and

    extracted from ﬁve different electronic databases: Springer Link, Association
    for Computing

    Machinery, ISI Web of Science, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,
    and Scopus.

    While performing the search, it was possible to build a deeper insight regarding
    the overall

    amplitude of this particular researched ﬁeld and its current state of the art.
    Moreover, it is

    important to highlight that the Scopus and Springer Link libraries were the databases
    in

    which the largest number of articles were found and classiﬁed. Both ACM and IEEE
    were

    the libraries in which the least amount of articles was found. In particular,
    the least-ranked

    articles were extracted from the ACM Digital Library. It is worth noting that
    the articles

    selected during the inclusion stage were mostly recent, since they were published
    between

    2019 and 2022.

    After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the quality assessment stage

    identiﬁed 11 relevant articles to be included in the ﬁnal report review. Among
    them,

    the most often cited investigated the cultivation of a speciﬁc culture, water
    management

    platforms, and urban agriculture techniques, and performed systematic reviews.
    Moreover,

    some keywords were found in most articles. For example, the use of ontology- and
    multi-

    agent-related terms were often cited in many of the articles [41,55,59]. The terms
    related

    to IoT and big data were often cited in most articles [7,18,46,50,56,57]. The
    words related

    Sensors 2023, 23, 1007

    27 of 30

    to artiﬁcial intelligence and intelligent systems were also present in the large
    majority of

    papers [7,18,41,46,53,56].

    In view of this, it can be concluded that the amount of papers associated with
    the

    use or development of soil’s digital twin is being gradually increasing. Indeed,
    after the

    systematic review carried out in this work, it is possible to conclude that there
    is a growing

    trend toward the use of digital twins within various domains and with different
    goals.

    However, no studies address the precise problem of soil quality control in general
    and

    within a predictive control framework in particular.

    4. Conclusions

    In the present century, agricultural producers face challenges to preserve water
    and

    soil while achieving food safety and promoting sustainability. The latter is being
    tackled by

    resorting to more modern farm management and cultivation approaches that jointly
    use

    ecological technologies (plant-cover plants that are beneﬁcial to other plants)
    and precision

    agriculture. Precision agriculture is a broad concept that includes the use of
    sensors and

    information technology to improve the many processes that occur in agriculture,
    such

    as irrigation and fertilisation. Sustainability and soil-quality management are
    strongly

    dependent on the surgical deployment of fertilisers and/or pesticides, which must
    be

    accompanied by an increase in crop yield [57].

    Taking into consideration the research results that document the application of
    digital

    twin paradigms in the industry, it is expected that deploying equivalent approaches
    in

    agriculture will lead to an increase in productivity while keeping a leaner trend
    regarding

    the use of energy, water, fertilisers, and pesticides. In this framework, digital
    twins not only

    will help farmers to increase crop yields but also reduce production costs and
    allow them

    to grow crops with better nutritional value [60].

    Digital twins are still in the process of deﬁnition and it seems that the advantages
    of

    their use are especially pronounced when standard assets management and control
    systems

    are of limited utility [54,61]. Examples of digital twins that successfully and
    perfectly match

    these elements in a complex operational environment are rare or even non-existent.

    After a thorough and careful search of several databases, a set of relevant articles

    aligned with the the use of digital twins in agriculture were found to be available
    in the

    scientiﬁc literature. Some of those publications are focused on studies and exploratory

    cases. Some of the points-of-view presented by the authors, such as the use of
    digital

    twins to organise, monitor, manage, and maximise agricultural procedures, require
    further

    explanation and validation.

    According to the literature, the slow penetration of digital twins on agricultural
    pro-

    cesses occurs due to several reasons, such as low amounts of technical resources,
    the lack

    of ease of communication on remote farms, a shortage of economical funding, an
    unpre-

    dictable environment and continuous changes in climate, soil quality, producer
    resistance

    in sharing their agricultural information, and the low-level technical qualiﬁcations
    of agri-

    cultural growers [56]. Nevertheless, over the past decade, there are records on
    the use of

    digital twin technology employed in the context of smart farming [46]. Usually,
    the aim of

    such an approach is to promote the separation between the physical ﬂows and the
    planning

    and control. In particular, providing the grower with the ability to remotely
    manage all the

    systems in real time by using virtual information [18].

    Based on the results obtained from this systematic review, it is possible to conclude
    that

    there are no relevant scientiﬁc papers published on the use of digital twins for
    soil-quality

    management. Moreover, no papers were found regarding the use of such a paradigm
    in the

    context of model predictive control for the closed-loop regulation of fertilisers
    or pesticides.

    \ Systems (CPS) have seen a dramatic increase in research and real-world application\
    \ in recent \nyears. Many parts of our everyday lives have been affected, including\
    \ electrical power systems, oil and gas delivery, \ntransportation networks, medical\
    \ equipment, home appliances, and a host of other areas. For example, many critical\
    \ \ninfrastructure and life support equipment are relying on these kinds of systems.\
    \ As a result, they are required to be \ncompletely secure and resistant to all\
    \ forms of assaults, which is almost unachievable for any real-world system. This\
    \ \npaper focuses on security analysis in CPSs, whereby security in CPSs, security\
    \ threats in CPSs, and security challenges in \nCPSs, have been discussed \n \n\
    Keywords – Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Industrial Control Systems (ICS), Information\
    \ Technology (IT) \n \nI. \nINTRODUCTION \nCyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) [1] are\
    \ a new study topic that has the potential to bring together the physical and\
    \ digital \nworlds. In order to integrate the physical and digital worlds, these\
    \ systems use integrated components to perform tasks \ncollectively. CPSs have\
    \ grown more dispersed as a result of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the increased\
    \ complexity of \njobs, thus it is vital to design ubiquitous CPSs capable of\
    \ providing timely service delivery. A distributed CPS with \nmultiresolution\
    \ dynamism and connectivity allows for the efficient, reliable, safe and secure\
    \ administration of monitoring \nand management of physical objects in the real\
    \ world. Innovations such as Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), \ninteractive\
    \ platforms, and cloud technology have emerged in the construction of CPSs after\
    \ the merger of CPSs and IoT. \nThe potential of service-oriented CPSs has been\
    \ highlighted by the need of devices in CPSs to work together on both a \ncyber\
    \ and a physical scale. While the service-oriented methodology may be used to\
    \ create dispersed real-time CPSs that \ncan interact with real-world objects\
    \ in real-time, it is not adequate to fully realise complete distributed CPSs\
    \ that take into \nconsideration the interrelations between virtual and real elements.\
    \ A distributed embedded computing framework depends \non agents that are aware\
    \ of their context is therefore more appealing because it is possible to incorporate\
    \ various attributes \ninto agents and achieve distributed cloud computing with\
    \ improved coordination and interconnectivity between \nindependent and inhomogeneous\
    \ agents. When it comes to CPSs, context-awareness is a must, since this new technology\
    \ \nrelies heavily on sensors, resources, adaptability, and augmentation. Partial\
    \ observability in CPSs is a given, given the \ndynamic nature of distributed\
    \ CPSs domains. As a result, in order to get high model performance while using\
    \ ontology as \nthe underlying semantic technology, it is necessary to use uncertainty\
    \ modelling methodologies. \nThere are substantial challenges to the security\
    \ and privacy protection of CPS because of the complexity of CPS and its \nheterogeneity.\
    \ Cyber-physical interactions have made assessing threats and vulnerabilities\
    \ more challenging, and new \nsecurity concerns have arisen. Because the assaults\
    \ may come from various CPS components, tracing and examining them \nis particularly\
    \ complex. The construction of defensive systems requires an in-depth study of\
    \ the vulnerabilities, threats, and \nassaults. Identifying gaps, weak linkages,\
    \ and new avenues for investigation will be made possible by a review of current\
    \ \nCPS privacy and security measures. This paper focuses on security analysis\
    \ in CPSs, whereby security in CPSs, security \nthreats in CPSs, and security\
    \ challenges in CPSs, have been discussed. The remaining part of the paper has\
    \ been organized \nas follows. Section II focusses on the background analysis\
    \ of the paper. Section III focuses on a critical survey of the \nsecurity of\
    \ CPSs. Section IV finally draws conclusions to the paper and presents suggestions\
    \ for future studies.  \n \n \n \n \nISSN: 2788 –7669                        \

    \ and Computing 2(3)(2022) \n \n135 \n \n \nII. \nBACKGROUND ANALYSIS  \nCPSs\
    \ (Cyber Physical Systems) are IT structures integrated into real-world applications.\
    \ There are sensors and actuators \nincluded in these systems. Advances in information\
    \ and communications technology (ICTs) have resulted in a rise in the \ninterconnection\
    \ between physical processes. \n \nReal-life Application of CPSs \nIt is the current\
    \ iteration of instrumentation and control systems that can constantly monitor\
    \ the physical environment. \nCPSs are becoming more important in a wide range\
    \ of industries, including energy, aviation, and healthcare. As a very \nsignificant\
    \ and symbolic consideration, it is contingent on the technology used. An example\
    \ of a CPS is the SCADA, \nwhich is employed in CI, e.g., smart/intelligent grids\
    \ and industrial control systems, and wearable and implanted gadgets \n(utilized\
    \ in medical care). There are so many versions of CPSs that it would be impossible\
    \ to mention them all here, but in \nthis article, we'll focus on four examples\
    \ (see Table 1) of how CPSs might be used. \n \nTable 1. Examples of CPSs applications\
    \ \nApplication \nDetails  \nIndustrial Control \nSystems (ICS) \nNuclear power\
    \ facilities, water and sewage treatment plants, and irrigation systems all use\
    \ ICS \n(SCADA or distribution systems) to better their control and output. We\
    \ use a variety of \ncontrollers in ICS, including PLCs (Programmable Logic Controller)\
    \ [2]. You may use this \ngadget to accomplish a variety of goals by combining\
    \ its many features. A variety of actuators \nand sensors are being employed to\
    \ link this gadget to the real-world. This system has both \nwireless and cable\
    \ communication capabilities that may be employed depending on the \nenvironment.\
    \ Using PC systems, it is also possible to monitor and control systems in a control\
    \ \ncentre. \nSmart Grid Systems \nSmart grids are the next generation of grids\
    \ for producing energy, even though they have been \nin use for decades. By giving\
    \ consumers more control over their energy use at the local scale, it \nis both\
    \ economically and ecologically viable. In addition, it improves pollution management,\
    \ \nglobal load balance, and saves energy at the national scale. \nClinical Devices\
    \ \nIn an aim to render between medical care, clinical gadgets have been enhanced\
    \ with a \ncombination of cyber and physical capabilities. In order to help patients,\
    \ these medical gadgets \nmay either be implanted in the body or worn as wearable\
    \ devices. These gadgets are \nintelligent, and they can connect with other gadgets\
    \ using wireless technology. A programmer \nis responsible for establishing this\
    \ line of communication, which is necessary for performing \nsoftware updates\
    \ and configuration changes on the devices. Patients who use a wearable \ngadget\
    \ are more likely to keep track of their daily routines. \nSmart Vehicles \nSustainable,\
    \ fuel-efficient, cleaner and more convenient: these are the characteristics that\
    \ \ndistinguish smart cars from traditional automobiles. Electronic Control Units\
    \ (ECUs), a system \nof up to 70 computer networks, allowed these improvements.\
    \ ECUs are responsible for \noverseeing and controlling a variety of functions,\
    \ including machine emission controls, \nrecreation controls (audiovisual and\
    \ radio players), braking control, and recreational elements \n(cruise control,\
    \ and closing and window opening). To help alleviate traffic congestion and \n\
    prevent accidents on the road and in the area, these kinds of advancements are\
    \ critical in the \npresent era's technological landscape. \n \nDevelopments in\
    \ Clinical CPSs \nWe have analysed the wearable technology and IMDs, and now it's\
    \ time to talk about the relevance of CPSs in clinical \nuses, such as insulin\
    \ pumps, ventilation systems, and patient surveillance systems that are software-intensive.\
    \ Many \nindividuals are interested in these medical gadgets because they promise\
    \ to make their lives more comfortable and stress-\nfree (via determining causal\
    \ factors of diseases or treating diseases). Because of this, new difficulties\
    \ and possibilities for \nthe scientific community arise when big changes are\
    \ made to these devices. The following (see Table 2) are some of the \nmost common\
    \ developments in medical instruments: \nOverdosing should not be possible with\
    \ a properly set PCA device since it is meant to only deliver a certain number\
    \ of \ndoses, no matter how frequently the button is pushed. This safety system,\
    \ on the other hand, is insufficient to meet the \nneeds of all patients. Misprogrammed\
    \ pumps, pump developers who overestimate a patient's maximal dosage, drugs placed\
    \ \nincorrectly into the device, and PCA-by-proxy are just a few of the possible\
    \ causes of overdoses that may lead to death or \nserious illness in many patients.\
    \ It is not possible to address all of the clinical practise situations that PCA\
    \ infusion pumps \nare implicated in, even with established precautions like medication\
    \ libraries and programmable thresholds. Because of \nthis, we'll need more effective\
    \ medical gadgets to examine people in the near future (equipment are also required\
    \ to \n \nISSN: 2788 –7669                                                   \

    \ \n \n136 \n \ndetermine the patient's medication concentration). Medical gadgets\
    \ are also increasingly being used to monitor a patient's \nheart rate, respiratory\
    \ rate, sugar levels, perceived stress, and body temperature. Despite this, since\
    \ they lack real-time \ndiagnostic ability, these instruments are limited to a\
    \ store-and-forward mode of operation and performance. Vital signs can \nbe monitored\
    \ in real time using closed-loop technologies in physiology, although this requires\
    \ continual attention. \n \nTable 2.  Common developments in medical instruments\
    \ \n \nDevelopment \nDetails \nNew software-enabled \nfunctionality \nEmbedded\
    \ system concepts [3] are used to bring new technology into medical equipment,\
    \ \nsuch as robotic surgery and proton therapy treatment, using software-based\
    \ design. Real-time \nprocessing of high-resolution pictures and haptic feedback\
    \ is required for this (robotic \nsurgery). In contrast, proton therapy treatment\
    \ is one of the most digital therapies and \nrequires one of the biggest clinical\
    \ device systems in the world. Patients with cancer get \nprecise treatment directions\
    \ from a cyclotron using a proton beam that give exact dosages of \nradiation.\
    \ Beam planning and projecting might potentially be disrupted by the fact that\
    \ the \nsame beam is disseminated to several patients and must be transferred\
    \ from place to site. \nResearch on the safety of proton beam machines has mostly\
    \ focused on one type in the last \ndecade, namely, devices that must be turned\
    \ off in an emergency. One of the key issues \nconfronting medical device makers\
    \ and the industry is how to properly analyse and evaluate \nsuch massive and\
    \ complicated structures. \nEnhanced connectivity of \nclinical gadgets \nNowadays,\
    \ health gadgets are connected with network connections since they increasingly\
    \ \ndepend on software. The usage of such interconnected healthcare devices allows\
    \ the creation \nof more decentralized structures of clinical devices, which have\
    \ to be planned properly and \nstructured to perform particular functions. Electronic\
    \ health records (EHRs) might be \nemployed to save patient data via the localized\
    \ or distant interconnection of these clinical \ndevices for tracking patients\
    \ or for tele-ICU telemonitoring in Electronic Health Records \n(EHR). As a consequence\
    \ of these limitations, novel treatment approaches and enhanced \npatient safety\
    \ may be achieved via the use of such healthcare devices in the present context.\
    \ \nMedical Device Plug-and-and-Play (MD PnP) interoperability approach is a standard\
    \ open \nframework for scalable and safe interconnections of clinical devices,\
    \ and for enhancing \npatient safety and efficacy within the healthcare system.\
    \ \nPhysiologically closed-\nloop systems \nIn most clinical facilities, a nurse\
    \ is assigned to keep an eye on the systems (or more than \none). During an operation,\
    \ an anaesthesiologist manages the patient's sedation and decides \nwhen to alter\
    \ the sedative stream. This reliance on \"person in the loop\" may jeopardise\
    \ \npatient safety, which is why some in the clinical community worry about it.\
    \ Nurses who are \noften overburdened and under tremendous time constraints may\
    \ overlook a critical warning \nsign. There may be times when nurses are unable\
    \ to care for numerous patients \nsimultaneously; however, they can operate a\
    \ device, which will be a significant assistance to \nthe nurse and enhance patient\
    \ safety and care. Nonetheless, even though the machine \n(computer) can never\
    \ replace the caregivers (in emotion), it may significantly reduce the \ncaregiver's\
    \ labour by bringing attention to the caregiver only when anything out of the\
    \ \nnormal occurs. The medical device industry has long employed case-based on\
    \ closed-loop \nphysiologic control. PCA (Patient-Controlled Analgesia) is a medical\
    \ condition that takes use \nof the closed loop technique [4]. Pain treatment\
    \ after surgery is usually achieved using PCA \ninfusion pumps. PCA pumps allow\
    \ patients to request a dosage at any time, rather than \nrelying on a caregiver's\
    \ set schedule for delivery. \nContinuous Monitoring \nand Care \nResidential\
    \ care, supported living, telehealth, and medical monitoring of sports activities\
    \ are \nbecoming more popular as an alternative to in-hospital treatment because\

    \ \nSecurity in CPSs \nIn this section, we provide various instances to demonstrate\
    \ the criticality of safety to the CPS process. Cryptography, \naccess management,\
    \ penetration testing, and a slew of other concepts fall under the umbrella of\
    \ security control (used in IT \nmodels). When it concerns safeguarding an ICT's\
    \ infrastructure, they play a critical role [5]. There will be a lot of demand\
    \ \nfor error-free cyber physical systems in the near future. There will be many\
    \ more assaults like these in the future, therefore \nit's important to be prepared\
    \ now. Uses of CPSs as shown in Table 3 need various levels of security. \n \n\
    Table 3. Security breach of CPSs Applications \nCPSs Application \nDetails \n\
    Nuclear energy \nBased on the facts, it might be disastrous if the CPS lacks enough\
    \ protection. In the case of a \nnuclear facility, for example, the safety of\
    \ the CPS might be compromised, posing a global \nsecurity risk. As recently as\
    \ 2010, Iran's nuclear power reactors were targeted by an assault known \nas Stuxnet.\
    \ Big industrial control systems also have a large number of outdated systems.\
    \ In fact, \nthis also holds true. Over the past decade, several individuals have\
    \ worked on \"lightweight \ncryptographic mechanisms\" (mechanisms that make data\
    \ safe, accessible, and secure). However, \nmuch work remains to be done in each\
    \ of these areas. Make sure to take into account that some \nsecurity level is\
    \ preferable to none at all. An ICS's security is critical, and researchers must\
    \ do \ntheir share to ensure it. \nSmart Grid \nSecurity \nIf smart grid security\
    \ is breached, users might lose particular services and the utility agencies \n\
    might lose particular funds. It is also possible to target smart grids from a\
    \ distance, which might \nresult in widespread power outages. For example, malfunctioning\
    \ medical devices, information \nloss at the data center, and also enhanced crime\
    \ rate might occur if there are power or energy \nshortages. As a result, the\
    \ security of Smart Grid CPSs is fundamental (also to safeguard user data \nwithin\
    \ a system) \nPatient safety \nThe safety of patients might be jeopardised if\
    \ hacker-targeted wearables and IMDs are not \nadequately guarded. Licensing authorities\
    \ must be able to gain access to and utilize datasets, they \nhave to have the\
    \ capabilities to recognize, modifying, updating and ensuring that gadgets are\
    \ \naccessible to them. As a result, ensuring the safety of a medical app's users'\
    \ and patients' personal \ninformation is of paramount importance. \nAutomobile\
    \ \nindustry \nAutomobile manufacturers are always looking for innovative ways\
    \ to improve the usability and \ncomfort of their vehicles for their consumers.\
    \ Researchers aren't always thinking about safety \nwhen they create vehicles,\
    \ but that's a good thing to keep in mind. Security safeguards the \nvehicle's\
    \ capacity to continue operating in the event of a minor collision. In contrast,\
    \ safety was \nnot a segment of the design, but rather an added feature. For the\
    \ vehicle’s novel element to work, \nthey must be able to connect wirelessly and\
    \ physically. For the most part, smart cars rely on these \ntwo technologies to\
    \ protect them from most security breaches or attacks. We must find ways to \n\
    defend ourselves that are both secure and effective. \n \nIn order to adequately\
    \ safeguard CPSs, the underlying technologies should accomplish particular performance\
    \ \nnecessities. This allows for the implementation of proven safety systems and\
    \ standards. \n \nSecurity Parameters \nFor CPSs, there are a number of variables\
    \ to consider in order to ensure, which the system they protect are safe enough\
    \ \n(actual-work application). In order to protect CPSs, we must adhere to strict\
    \ security guidelines. \nIn recent years, it has become more evident that the\
    \ reliability of control functions is a critical component. The most \nsignificant\
    \ distinction between control schemes and IT security is the absence of patching\
    \ or updating requirements for \ncontrol systems. The process of upgrading a computer\
    \ may take months, for example. Stopping an industrial computer \nevery time a\
    \ new security patch is released is not worth the effort. After a software upgrade\
    \ on March 7, 2008, a gadget \ndesigned to monitor chemical data and diagnostic\
    \ datasets from the plant’s corporate systems began operations again. This \n\
    resulted in the shutdown of a nuclear power facility by accident. There was no\
    \ evidence that water reservoirs had \ndecreased, which meant that nuclear fuel\
    \ rods could not be kept cold. When the machine was rebooted, it generated this\
    \ \nerror. Autonomy is critical, but so is the requirement for decision-making\
    \ that occurs in real time (another management \n \nISSN: 2788 –7669         \

    \ Much attention has been paid to availability as a security concern. The real-time\
    \ operational \nenvironment, on the other hand, is more stringent than that of\
    \ most other IT systems. \nThe last portion of the report discusses the various\
    \ security factors and standards for CPSs (i.e., in intelligent control \nsystem,\
    \ intelligent grid system, etc.). In the sub-section below, we will discuss the\
    \ various forms of security threats in CPSs \n(i.e., intelligent grid system,\
    \ intelligent clinical devices, intelligent control schemes, etc.). \n \nSecurity\
    \ Threats in CPSs \nOur discussion of the security standards for four distinct\
    \ CPS applications may be found in the preceding section. For each \nof these\
    \ applications, we will now discuss some probable attacks. In this sub-section,\
    \ we're going to discuss about various \ndifferent cyber physical assaults. \n\
    \ \nReal-world cyber physical threats \nCPSs systems could be attacked by Physical\
    \ (P), Cyber-Physical (CP) and Cyber (C) threats, and how to prevent them [6].\
    \ \nThere are just a few recorded public assaults, and it's quite difficult to\
    \ get back or figure out exactly what occurred in the \nimmediate aftermath. In\
    \ this chapter, attacks are categorised according to the location of the injuries.\
    \ The term \"cyber\" \nrefers to assaults on computers that do not compromise\
    \ sensors or actuators. The term \"physical\" refers to assaults that \ntarget\
    \ specific physical components. When it comes to cyber-physical threats, on the\
    \ contrary, they are threats that attack \nphysical elements through the employment\
    \ of cyber elements. But extortion control systems have been around for a long\
    \ \ntime, so this is nothing new. Terrorism and physical violence are being employed\
    \ as a means of extortion in many nations. \nBecause they are quicker, cheaper,\
    \ and do not have to be constricted by distances, cyberattacks are a logical next\
    \ stage in \nthe development of physical assaults. The following are examples\
    \ of cyber and physical assaults against CPS that may now \nbe documented: \n\
    \ \nCyber attacks on cyber physical systems \nTable 4 presents the cyber-attacks\
    \ of CPSs. \nTable 4. Cyber-attacks of CPSs. \n \nAttack \nDetails \nIndustrial\
    \ Control \nSystem Attacks \nIran was hit by a \"Stuxnet\" assault in 2010 that\
    \ damaged many nuclear reactors. Iran has recently \nbeen the target of many cyberattacks\
    \ by cybercriminals from the United States. There have been \ntwo kinds of attacks\
    \ discovered against ICS. \n1. Communication protocols: In several cases, attackers\
    \ exploited holes in communication \nsystems. A SCADA system [7], for instance,\
    \ demonstrated how to evade the domain \nresolution protocol. \n2. Espionage:\
    \ Hacking ICS hacks like DuQu and Flame may be exploited to spy on \nindividuals.\
    \ A number of ICS networks were detected in the Mideast in 2012 by Flame, \nfor\
    \ example The primary purpose of this spyware was to steal confidential information\
    \ \nfrom businesses, such as their locations and the passwords they entered into\
    \ their \ncomputers. \nIn many nations, intruders who are not authorized are attacking\
    \ them on a daily basis. At this \npoint, governments are employing these assaults\
    \ as a weaponry to inflict maximum harm on their \nadversary (the enemy). \nSmart\
    \ Grid CPS \nAttack \nCPS assault on a Central Processing System (CPS). The most\
    \ frequent occurrence is a total power \noutage. Smart grids are vulnerable to\
    \ cyberattacks, which might result in a complete blackout in a \nnation. It was\
    \ quite significant whenever it happened in USA and Europe a few times over the\
    \ past \n10 years. \nClinical CPS attack \nIn a distributed framework, insider\
    \ threats, spies and other types of threats are probable. This is a \nmajor danger.\
    \ Medical gadgets may be tampered with or hacked by an insider, allowing him to\
    \ \ncontrol the machinery in any way he sees fit. The wireless transmissions that\
    \ medical gadgets use \nto keep individuals healthier might easily be jammed by\
    \ an invader. In this case, the gadget would \nbe rendered useless and would not\
    \ be able to render the necessary treatments. \nIntelligent Vehicles \nAttack\
    \ \nTaking control of a motor vehicle or automobiles from a specific distance\
    \ or through an assault \nfrom the outside is a major security issue. An assailant\
    \ might take control of any car, which could \nresult in a major traffic incident.\

    \ Machines compromised with the Slammer worm at the Davis Besse power company\
    \ in Ohio, took down \nsecurity surveillance system in January 2003. iii) the\
    \ Maroochy Shire Council in Queensland, Australia, was attacked in \n2000, on\
    \ the sewage control system (that was undertaken by disgruntled ex-worker of the\
    \ contractor company, which has \nestablished the control systems). In this part,\
    \ we'll look at an example of a threat framework in CPS. \n \nAdversary Framework\
    \ in CPS \nIdentifying potential threats to a system's security requires an in-depth\
    \ investigation. An adversary model can be used to \nassess the scope and severity\
    \ of a problem. Cybercriminals have been breaking into computers all over the\
    \ world for the \nbetter part of the last decade or so (even in control models).\
    \ Control systems compromised with malware might not work as \nplanned. From a\
    \ safety perspective, these attacks are critical because they are the result of\
    \ unauthorised access to control \nsystems' computers and networks. Attacks by\
    \ insiders can occur even when control networks are completely isolated from \n\
    the public Internet and other networks. Currently, targeted computer attacks are\
    \ primarily perpetrated by disgruntled \nemployees. Most of the time, these employees\
    \ don't collaborate with each other. \" Larger, better-coordinated groups can\
    \ do \nmore damage, but these individuals may not. As a major issue in CPS, this\
    \ one necessitates a solution that is both practical \nand realistic. \nCriminal\
    \ groups and terrorists may try to access the security models. Presently, there\
    \ are no proofs that terrorists and \nactivists have used computer threats to\
    \ access controllers. Although criminal clusters may be involved, there is some\
    \ \nevidence. CPS initiatives aren't new, but they're gaining in popularity these\
    \ days because of how much money they can \nmake. Iran and Iraq, for example,\
    \ have been subjected to physical attacks in the last few years as a result of\
    \ this tactic. \nCyberattacks on other nations' physical infrastructure will become\
    \ more commonplace in the near future. Table 5 depicts \nthe concept of attacks\
    \ and consequences of attacks.  \n \nTable 5. Concepts of Attacks and Consequences\
    \ \nConcept \nDetails  \nAttacks  \nResonance assaults on control systems may\
    \ be used by attackers to gain access (i.e., threats that are \nnon-feasible in\
    \ more conventional information technology schemes). Someone tampered with some\
    \ of \nthe sensors or controls, causing physical systems to oscillate at a natural\
    \ frequency.  \nConsequences of \nAttacks  \nWe're not aware of anybody who's\
    \ done research on the potential consequences of assaults on critical \ninfrastructures.\
    \ A person may get entry to a control scheme that does not correspond to them\
    \ via \nSCADA security reports, which may look like overreaction. The majority\
    \ of controllers have \nsafeguards in place to prevent catastrophic failures.\
    \ \n \nSecurity challenges in cyber physical systems \nAll of these terms, as\
    \ well as others, are intertwined in this piece of writing (paper). We define\
    \ challenges as unanswered \nproblems, and our goal is to entice individuals to\
    \ do more investigation to discover solutions. An internal (security) \nweakness\
    \ that may be exploited by intruders is referred to as a \"vulnerability.\" Things\
    \ that potentially harm a system are \nknown as threats. \n \nOverall  CPSs security\
    \ Isues \nSecurity based on Design  \nSince most CPS are not linked to other systems\
    \ like the web, they are not meant to be secure. CPS are not linked to other \n\
    networks, which implies that cybersecurity isn't taken into concern while designing\
    \ them. Keeping people secure, then, was \nmostly a matter of physical security.\
    \ \n \n Cyber Physical Security \nKeeping people secure, then, was mostly a matter\
    \ of physical security. Designers of CPSs must rethink security from a \ncyber\
    \ and physical perspective if they are to succeed. Our ability to foresee and\
    \ prevent new cyber-attacks which have \nphysical implications should be improved.\
    \ There is a need to develop infrastructure for resolution components (cyber-\n\
    physical technologies), which have hitherto been dismissed.  \n \nReal-Timeliness\
    \ Nature \nIn case a certain criterion in real-time is not reached, it has a direct\
    \ impact on the condition of defence. In order to survive \nan assault, networks\
    \ rely on CPS to make timely judgments. CPS security that considers the interplay\
    \ between real and \nvirtual factors may be shown to the whole globe. Better risk\
    \ evaluation and threat detection may be achieved by using this \nmethod. Since\
    \ cryptographic techniques must be put on top of these approaches to facilitate\
    \ real-time interoperability, \nwhich is what ought to occur. \n \n \n \nISSN:\

    \ \n \nUncoordinated Changes \nThe CPS employs a large number of employees. Those\
    \ who manufacture, use, own, and operate goods are all included, as \nare those\
    \ who work for them. They need to be well managed, even if their jobs and responsibilities\
    \ are distinct. This shift \nwill need the attention of many personnel and several\
    \ CPS divisions (an issue that we must not ignore). Stakeholders in a \nCPS community\
    \ should coordinate their efforts at some point. Upgrading hardware, upgrading\
    \ or modifying software, and \nintroducing new features are all examples of methods\
    \ to improve things. A country's security may be jeopardised if \nunanticipated\
    \ improvements to CPSs security (i.e., novel flaws) were to occur. \nIndustrial\
    \ Control System Issues \nChange Management \nNumerous Internet of Things (IoT)\
    \ gadgets must be removed or modified in ICS environments. Replacement, \nmodification,\
    \ or deletion of these systems is required (at one place). ICS system updates,\
    \ for example, must be scheduled \nmeticulously in order to minimise issues. The\
    \ ICS system's security plan may change without the awareness of many \ninvestors;\
    \ therefore, we must organize change controls in order to monitor and prevent\
    \ security-based changes within \nCPSs. \nMalicious Insider \nDue to the fact\
    \ that the assault originates from inside the organisation, tracking down and\
    \ stopping a hostile insider are very \ndifficult tasks. Internal attacks like\
    \ those in Maroochy’s sewage system and water supply, or Stuxnet, might be launched\
    \ by \nan insider who has the trust and inside knowledge necessary to carry out\
    \ the attack. This is only one illustration of what \nmay be accomplished (via\
    \ a USB stick). Insiders may unintentionally utilise virus-attacked computers\
    \ or USB sticks, \namounting in ICS entry points being made available to unauthorised\
    \ users. Finding out who is an internal attacker has been \nthe main difficulty\
    \ that many independent researchers have neglected or ignored. \nSecure Integration\
    \ \nTo prevent new security issues, new components must be integrated into existing\
    \ systems in a secure manner. It's important \nto keep in mind that the ICS depends\
    \ heavily on out-of-date technology that might be susceptible. In order to make\
    \ ICS as \nsafe as possible, all of the old components must be removed and new,\
    \ safer ones installed. So, short-term fixes are needed \nto avoid any difficulties\
    \ with ICS. \n \nSmart grids challenges \nTable 6 presents the challenges in the\
    \ smart grid. \nTable 6. Smart grid challenges \nChallenge \nDetails \nChange\
    \ \nManagement  \nSmart grid adjustments aren't any simpler to cope with than\
    \ ICS updates, but they're also not much \neasier. Even while smart grids are\
    \ increasingly complex and include a greater number of people, \nthey are unable\
    \ to adapt to changes. It necessitates the use of change management in order to\
    \ keep \nsmart grids healthy. \nTwo-Way \nCommunications \nThe Advanced Metering\
    \ Infrastructure (AMI) [8] in an intelligent grid allows for two-way \ncommunication.\
    \ Consumers' residences are less of a target for physical attacks since AMI smart\
    \ \nmetres can connect with utility providers that are nearby, unlike the power\
    \ grid. Since the \nintroduction of smart grids, keeping these gadgets secure\
    \ has grown increasingly complex. \nAccess \nControl \nMechanisms  \nWith a vast\
    \ reach and many investors, smart grids require strong access control systems\
    \ to keep \nthem safe. It is critical to keep watch on and regulate any potential\
    \ accessibility to the smart grid \nsystem, data, or gadgets. Whenever possible,\
    \ it is important to empower the individuals or \norganisations that are meant\
    \ to assist. \nPrivacy Concerns \nAnxieties about the usage of personal information\
    \ are common. Increasing use of smart grids has \nmade this an issue for many\
    \ individuals. Moreover, it is essential to provide anonymization \nstrategies\
    \ to prevent attackers from deducing trends or encrypted information to disclose\
    \ sensitive \ninformation. The term for this is \"anonymization.\" As a result,\
    \ we must ensure that the methods \nwe design can encode and consolidate data\
    \ securely. \nExplicit Trust \nWe should just not put any faith in the perceived\
    \ data or directives that have been transmitted in \nthis circumstance. Instead,\
    \ new methods must be devised to recognise bogus data and actions that \nare not\
    \ permitted. Because smart grids are so big, it might be difficult to employ algorithms\
    \ that \njust search for faults to identify FDI assaults. \nComprehensive \nSecurity\
    \ \nSmart grids benefit from having high levels of security. Even at the lowest\
    \ levels, it's a problem \n(as a result of limited capacities in devices on the\
    \ lower level). There might be variations in the \nnumber of securities, which\
    \ has to be in place at every level as a consequence. Several academic \nresearchers\
    \ have to come up with compact technologies in order to achieve this. Encryption\
    \ is also \ncritical for maintaining the privacy and security of data at all layers\
    \ of the smart grid. This is to \nensure that there is no security breach at any\
    \ time. \n \nISSN: 2788 –7669                                                \

    \ of this, it is imperative that the cryptographic processes affecting the functionality\
    \ and \ncost of medical equipment (that are accessible to patients) be as low\
    \ as feasible. \nLimited Resources \nIt takes a lot of power (a finite resource)\

    \ period (long time). Surgery-dependent implants, for example, should last no\

    \ the moment. The loop should be \nsecurely and swiftly closed in this manner.\
    \ \nSecurity and Privacy \nBecause MCPSs gather health records and organize the\
    \ information they acquire, security \nand privacy are of the utmost importance.\
    \ As a result, it's critical that no unauthorised party \nhas access to or alters\
    \ their data. A patient's privacy, discrimination, abuse, or even physical \n\
    harm might result from such an act. \nCertifiability \nMCPS requires a low-cost\
    \ method of demonstrating that biomedical device software is safe \nand dependable,\
    \ e.g., clinical device certifications. \nExecutable clinical \nworkflows \nMCPS\
    \ may be built and deployed fast in order to deliver effective medical services\
    \ for a \n(particular) patient since more and more healthcare systems are connecting\
    \ and working \ntogether. With MCPS, patients' security is the foremost concern.\
    \ Consequently, we must \nguarantee patient safety in these cases by employing\
    \ medical protocols that are legitimate \nand effective. \nModel-based Development\
    \ \nPrior to building or developing a software system, we will be able to determine\
    \ how safe \nthe situation is for patients, and we will be able to establish requirements\
    \ for safe equipment \nand their connections. To ensure that the application is\
    \ safe, these standards may be \ninspected during deployment. Take note of the\
    \ way scenario analysis is carried out using \nMCPS model-based growth. Static\
    \ and dynamic vulnerability checks are the most difficult \nto understand. \n\
    Physiological close-loop \ncontrol \nMany individuals dislike employing automated\
    \ control in medical treatment for a variety of \nreasons, including regulating\
    \ an application to a specific location, doing many treatments at \nonce that\
    \ might influence a variety of bodily system in patients. It should be noted that\
    \ \nexperiences will be unique.  \nPatient Simulation and \nModelling \nPatient\
    \ modelling is essential if we are to analyse how distinct conditions and closed-loop\
    \ \ncontrols operate. It is fundamental to keep watch on elements such as clients’\
    \ respiratory \nand heart rates in closed-loop PCA circumstances, as well as how\
    \ much medication is being \nabsorbed. More basic ways are needed to assist us\
    \ in solving the difficulty of developing \nand analysing things. These techniques\
    \ have the potential to simplify certain complex \nmodels. \nAdaptive Patient\
    \ and \nsmart alarms \nThe majority of medical equipment is designed for use with\
    \ several patients (having the \nsame medical clinical conditions). In MCPS, patients\
    \ may have a wide range of reactions to \ntherapy, which may lead to confusion\
    \ and loss of time. Most medical gadgets, for example, \nwill sound an alert if\
    \ a potentially harmful situation is discovered. Medical gadgets might \npotentially\
    \ mistakenly send out false alerts. They don't have to deal with stuff like this\
    \ in \ntheir line of work. For the benefit of patients and the collection of data\
    \ for use in the \ncreation of EHR Systems, healthcare systems are now establishing\
    \ reliable network \nconnections to accomplish this goal. \nIn such situation,\
    \ we'll need algorithms that can be customised to meet the unique \nrequirements\
    \ of each patient. Using the patient's activity record in EHR, we aim to alter\
    \ \nalert settings so that there are less false alarms as well. Using \"smart\
    \ alarm services\" in \nmedical equipment in the near future will reduce the number\
    \ of false alerts. \nUser Centred Design \nIf the caregiver is overworked or anxious\
    \ or has difficulty operating a piece of equipment, \nthey may make errors in\
    \ their care. There are a number of ways that medical devices may \nbe designed\
    \ to be more user-friendly, such as providing interactive methods to learn how\
    \ to \noperate the device in the event that the user gets stuck, and providing\
    \ means for users to \nrectify errors so that they are satisfied with their gadgets.\
    \ \nInfrastructure for \nMedical-Device \nIntegration and \nInteroperability \n\
    Distributed MCPS that use an exclusive network communication are currently being\
    \ \ndeveloped by just one business (lessening inter-device communication's advantages,\
    \ while \nmaking regulatory clearance more straightforward). Open standards (interconnectivity)\
    \ are \nthe standard in the MCPS industry (establishing the foundation for medical\
    \ device \ninteroperability). It's still necessary for these standards to be utilised\
    \ on systems that are \nsimple to create and use. They must follow specific guidelines\
    \ while making their goods so \nthat they may function together and interface\
    \ with each other in order to obtain the greatest \nbenefit from them. \nCompositionality\
    \ \nUsing methods like contextual induction, it is possible to better understand\
    \ how linked \ndevices interact with one another, hence enhancing the security\
    \ of MCPS systems. Figuring \nout how medical gadgets could interact in unexpected\
    \ ways is the most challenging thing to \n \nISSN: 2788 –7669                \
    \                                                                         Journal\
    \ of Machine and Computing 2(3)(2022) \n \n143 \n \nundertake in this scenario.\
    \ Due to their proximity to one another, radio interference may \noccur between\
    \ medical equipment that provide various therapies to the same patient. \nTreatments\
    \ might conflict with one another if the body's response to them changes. A good\
    \ \nexample of this is \"mixed prioritisation\". The sensor's position in regard\
    \ to the patient \ndetermines the MAP measurement's accuracy. The MAP measurement\
    \ changes when the \npatient's bed, which is a Class I medical equipment, is elevated,\
    \ since it is the least \nsignificant in the FDA classification. False reports\
    \ or other undesirable behaviour might \nresult from the sensor's abrupt shift\
    \ when it is component monitoring things like vital signs. \nThis issue was utilised\
    \ to provide the monitoring system with more information. Making \nthese gadgets\
    \ while taking into account is difficult. \nPrivacy and Security \nThere are a\
    \ number of networking capabilities built into medical equipment that, when \n\
    combined, might contribute to security and privacy concerns. If a hacker gains\
    \ entry to the \nMCPS network, they might hurt or even kill individuals (by re-programming\
    \ devices). \nRehired gadgets that may be rehired through the local area network\
    \ but do not get any \nrequests from the networks might be restricted in this\
    \ way. There must be a delicate \nbalancing between freedom of travel and the\
    \ requirement for security. A strategy is needed \nfor coping with EHR system\
    \ problems. \nVerification, Validation \nand Certification \nWhen the design is\
    \ complete, verification and validation are performed. Currently, this is \nhow\
    \ things are going. By using a \"design for verification approach,\" it will be\
    \ possible to \ndemonstrate the validity of the verification process on an ever-larger\
    \ scale [10]. It is also \npossible to do verification earlier in the design process\
    \ thanks to a technology known as \nmodel-based generative approaches. Keep in\
    \ mind that run-time components may be \ncreated from medical devices. \nHigh\
    \ Assurance Software \nSome elements of medical equipment, such as hardware (such\
    \ as security locks) and other \nthings, are automated with the help of technology.\
    \ It is commonly accepted that software \ndevelopment is essential to the security\
    \ of MCPS, however this is not enough. \n \nIV. \nCONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH\
    \ \nThis paper focuses on security analysis in CPSs, whereby security in CPSs,\
    \ security threats in CPSs, and security \nchallenges in CPSs, have been discussed.\
    \ A contemporary Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs) is at its peak in terms of \nengineering,\
    \ making it intricate and multi-scale structures that are versatile. The systems\
    \ are employed in various fields in \nreal-life, and they have significantly attracted\
    \ the attention of researchers and the academia. CPSs have not become \npopular,\
    \ but there are some major segments of the fields, which are not appropriately\
    \ defined or that not sufficiently \nstudied. It necessitates more efforts to\
    \ make CPSs function in real-life. This incorporates a broader range of \ninterdisciplinary\
    \ expertise, as well as tighter integration of important enabling technologies\
    \ and a focus on environmental \nand societal concerns. It is essential for networks\
    \ to have a shared language, abstract structures, modeling techniques, and \n\
    protocols that function together in a coordinated manner. In order for abstraction\
    \ to work properly in CPS testing, \nexecution, design, and conceptualization,\
    \ all of these processes need strong methodologies and theories (also computational\
    \ \nand conceptual abstraction, i.e., that are fundamental for both computer and\
    \ human agents). Computational reasoning has \nto be employed for autonomous control\
    \ systems (for the physical system) and for discrete virtual structure (of the\
    \ physical \nsystem) in order to facilitate the writing, connecting, and building\
    \ of CPSs (with high integration levels). Different \nconcepts, e.g., time-correct\
    \ controls and operations, compositionality, synergy and goal-centric learning,\
    \ among others, \nalso require investigation in future studies.  \n \nReferences\

    scarcity in water resources due to inefficient water management practices. Current
    methods for water control are based on supply rather than demand. Due to the manual
    nature of the current system, there is a lot of wastage of water and human error
    often results in flooding of the fields. Water theft is an additional problem
    in the developing countries. This paper aims to control water level in irrigation
    channels especially in the context of Pakistan''s irrigation network and proposes
    an appropriate demand response solution, catering to the needs of the end user.
    To achieve this purpose, a Gate Automation & Control Module (GACM) has been designed
    and implemented. The module is a deployable and scalable solution that can be
    coupled with any of the existing canal gates to regulate downstream water level
    with minimum involvement of active labor. Experimental results for water level
    setpoint control at Khaira Distributary off Main BRB Canal, Lahore are added to
    validate the usefulness of GACM. Published in: 2015 13th International Conference

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Islamabad, Pakistan I. Introduction Pakistan
    has the largest congruous canal network in the world, running for over 90,000
    km and irrigating a total area of approximately 36 million acres [1]. Currently,
    primitive methods are being used to regulate the system which results in water
    wastage, disputes due to unequal distribution and difficulty in management of
    water resources [2], [3]. In order to ensure all the aforementioned problems are
    addressed, there is a dire need to revisit the deployed water resources and make
    them function more efficiently. This efficient operation can be achieved by engineering
    Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) and feedback control strategies through the use of
    automation and decision support systems [1, 4–6]. The feasibility study for envisioning
    the canal irrigation system as a “smart water grid” and converting it to a fully
    automated CPS has been done by the authors'' group in [1], [7]. In recent years,
    some implementations of automation and control on actual canals have been reported
    in Australia [8], US [9] and Spain [10]. This paper demonstrates canal automation
    and control in the context of a developing country, for instance, Pakistan where
    the incomparably large scales of deployment and general economic constraints demand
    highly cost-effective and robust solutions. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors

    Abstract: The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) refers to the employment of
    the Internet of Things

    in industrial management, where a substantial number of machines and devices are
    linked and

    synchronized with the help of software programs and third platforms to improve
    the overall pro-

    ductivity. The acquisition of the industrial IoT provides beneﬁts that range from
    automation and

    optimization to eliminating manual processes and improving overall efﬁciencies,
    but security remains

    to be forethought. The absence of reliable security mechanisms and the magnitude
    of security features

    are signiﬁcant obstacles to enhancing IIoT security. Over the last few years,
    alarming attacks have

    been witnessed utilizing the vulnerabilities of the IIoT network devices. Moreover,
    the attackers can

    also sink deep into the network by using the relationships amidst the vulnerabilities.
    Such network

    security threats cause industries and businesses to suffer ﬁnancial losses, reputational
    damage, and

    theft of important information. This paper proposes an SDN-based framework using
    machine learn-

    ing techniques for intrusion detection in an industrial IoT environment. SDN is
    an approach that

    enables the network to be centrally and intelligently controlled through software
    applications. In

    our framework, the SDN controller employs a machine-learning algorithm to monitor
    the behavior

    of industrial IoT devices and networks by analyzing trafﬁc ﬂow data and ultimately
    determining

    the ﬂow rules for SDN switches. We use SVM and Decision Tree classiﬁcation models
    to analyze

    our framework’s network intrusion and attack detection performance. The results
    indicate that the

    proposed framework can detect attacks in industrial IoT networks and devices with
    an accuracy

    of 99.7%.

    1. Introduction

    For a long time, precarious infrastructures, such as communication networks, electric

    systems, and industrial systems, have customarily worked in segregation from extrinsic

    networks, such as the Internet. However, advanced technologies, such as artiﬁcial
    intelli-

    gence and software-deﬁned networking, are progressively being combined in such
    rigid

    environments to provide further beneﬁts, such as increased ﬂexibility and improved
    quality.

    The deﬁnition of the SDN is as follows: “In the SDN architecture, the control
    plane and

    data plane are decoupled, network intelligence and state are logically centralized,
    and

    the underlying network infrastructure is abstracted from the applications” [1].
    The SDN

    centralizes the switch control functions into an SDN controller. The switches
    then function

    as packet-processing devices and carry out the commands from the SDN controller
    [2].

    The SDN controllers can use machine learning and deep learning techniques to improve

    network security and monitoring [3]. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)
    is another

    such technology. The typical Internet of Things consists of devices from simple
    sensors

    to smartphones and wearable ones that are connected. Combining these interconnected

    devices with automated systems makes it possible to collect information, analyze
    it, and

    create an action to assist someone with a speciﬁc task or learn from the process.
    In reality,

    it ranges from smart mirrors to beacons in stores and beyond. The Industrial Internet
    of

    Things is an innovative attempt to set up a smart manufacturing environment by
    employing

    the beneﬁts of the Internet of Things in industrial process management. Industrial
    IoT

    focuses on machine-to-machine (M2M) communications, machine learning, and big
    data

    to enable enterprises and industries to have better reliability and efﬁciency
    in their opera-

    tions. Leveraging the industrial IoT is revolutionizing factory and industrial
    segmentation

    by presenting its eminence. The Industrial Internet of Things is swiftly progressing
    and

    comprises several services and industries, as shown in Figure 1. In the hospitality
    industry,

    the IoT can be helpful in understanding guests’ context and predicting their needs
    through

    intelligence and embedded sensors. There are endless possibilities with the IoT
    in the

    healthcare sector. The telemedicine system is based on the IoT. It is a practice
    of providing

    medical care by using data communications and interactive audiovisuals. Educational

    institutions are also taking advantage of various IoT applications. For instance,
    the IoT is

    being used in e-learning, m-learning, and u-learning.

    Figure 1. IoT in different sectors.

    The ﬁnancial services sector also seems to be taking up the IoT. Insurance companies

    use telematics applications to foretell and assess the possible risks that might
    result in

    a claim from the client. Energy companies use smart grids to capture analytics,
    improve

    security, and allow for rapid restoration when power failures occur. The IoT is
    changing

    how the retail market works. Automated checkouts are installed on the front side
    of the

    stores. This solution allows workers to focus on business opportunities and needs
    instead

    of spending time as a cashier. One of the ﬁnest examples of industries that are
    adopting IoT

    applications is the manufacturing industry. The manufacturers are using the IoT
    to keep

    track of production ﬂow during the production process. Through the data gathered
    from

    IoT devices, manufacturers can measure the quality of items.

    The automated industry relies on the Industrial Control System (ICS). The ICS
    consists

    of various types of controllers that are used to control the industrial plants
    and monitor

    Sustainability 2023, 15, 9001

    3 of 18

    their performance to guarantee their accurate operations [4,5]. There are various
    types of

    ICSs, such as distributed control systems (DCS), programmable logic controllers
    (PLC),

    supervisory control, and data acquisition systems (SCADA). Since the introduction
    of

    the IoT in industrial systems, they have changed into open architecture environments.

    As a result, industrial control systems have become vulnerable to security threats
    and

    attacks. A survey conducted by the UK Government has estimated that the average
    cost

    of a cyber-security breach ranges from £75,000 to £311,000 for small and medium-sized

    enterprises (SMEs) and from £1.46m to £3.14m for larger organizations. The Stuxnet
    attack

    against a nuclear power plant in Iran in 2010 is one of the most prominent cyber
    attacks.

    An SQL injection attack through a Trojan called the Night Dragon was conducted
    in 2010

    to target oil companies globally. In 2013, the energy companies of North America
    were

    targeted by a Trojan called Dragonﬂy, and, in 2014, by Havex [6]. Some of the
    signiﬁcant

    cyber incidents in ICSs are mentioned in Table 1.

    The Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) at-

    tacks are the most prominent attacks that prevent legitimate users from accessing
    services

    for which they have paid. These types of attacks have become serious security
    risks for

    computer networks, causing a drop in network performance by consuming resources

    and deactivating services [8]. The DoS/DDoS also affects industrial IoT networks
    and

    devices [9–11]. Jamming attacks are also carried out against industrial IoT devices
    and

    networks. In this attack, fake signals are sent to interrupt proceeding radio
    transmissions

    of the IoT devices, and it further depletes the energy, bandwidth, CPUs, and sensors
    or

    memory resources of the IoT devices during failed communication attempts [12–14].
    Thus,

    the security of industrial IoT devices and networks is one of the most critical
    concerns for

    researchers nowadays. There are various challenges with the implementation of
    security

    within industrial IoT networks and devices. Industrial IoT systems are heterogeneous

    systems containing several types of devices, types of data being shared and transferred,

    methods of communication, different resource levels of the devices, and system
    conﬁgura-

    tions. Each of these elements adds up to the challenges of IoT security. Secondly,
    billions of

    devices are connected and provide a vast area of research to focus on when considering

    resiliency, nominal function, and security.

    Sustainability 2023, 15, 9001

    4 of 18

    Previously, the ICSs were autonomous systems, and they were isolated from the
    world.

    Thus, they were not open to attacks. However, the increase in connectivity of
    ICSs with

    the Internet for industrial management and communication for information transmission

    has made these systems more vulnerable to cyberattacks and anomalies. Thus, security

    has become a signiﬁcant concern in industrial IoT systems because of their sensitive
    nature.

    The reliability, safety, and availability of industrial IoT systems are compromised
    by the

    lack of security parameters in the communication protocols.

    1.1. Problem Statement

    The IIoT makes use of the IoT technology in ICSs, i.e., industrial control systems.
    Since

    ICSs perform operations continuously, they also produce a large amount of data.
    These

    systems have become vulnerable to network attacks and other malicious attacks
    due to

    internet connectivity. Therefore, it is not possible to ensure the authenticity
    of the data.

    Thus, ensuring the security of IIoT devices and the IIoT network is a signiﬁcant
    problem

    that needs to be solved.

    1.2. Limitations of Existing Work

    Various intrusion detection and classiﬁcation schemes employing artiﬁcial intelligence

    have been studied in the literature [15]. Most of the security frameworks developed
    to

    secure industrial IoT networks had a high false alarm rate. Furthermore, they
    were unable

    to detect unknown attacks on the network. Hence, they were not very effective
    in securing

    industrial IoT networks against network attacks, resulting in costly damages to
    industrial

    IoT networks, data losses, and loss of revenue. Thus, we used machine learning
    algorithms

    and SDN technology in our framework for the effective detection of malicious attacks,

    network intrusion, and the identiﬁcation of abnormal behavior in industrial IoT
    networks

    and devices.

    1.3. Contributions of this Paper

    The major contributions of our paper are manifold:

    1.

    In this paper, a discussion on cyber attacks and security threats to the industrial
    IoT

    environment is given.

    2.

    We propose an SDN-based security framework to detect industrial IoT network

    intrusion by analyzing trafﬁc ﬂow data.

    3.

    The main objective of our work is to protect industrial IoT devices and networks

    against malicious attacks and security threats. For that purpose, we consider
    different

    attacks on industrial IoT environments, such as DoS/DDoS attacks, jamming attacks,

    and man-in-the-middle attacks.

    4.

    We use machine learning algorithms, i.e., SVM and Decision Tree on an SDN controller,

    for early intrusion detection within a network or device of the industrial IoT
    and

    determine the ﬂow rules for the SDN switches based on analyzed data.

    5.

    We evaluate the proposed SDN-based security framework using the NSL-KDD intru-

    sion detection dataset.

    6.

    The evaluation results show that the proposed framework provides high efﬁciency
    of

    security and can detect intrusion and malicious attacks in industrial IoT networks.

    2. Literature Review

    Several studies have been conducted to analyze the security vulnerabilities in
    IIoT

    systems. Various challenges prevent securing the IIoT and ensuring end-to-end
    security

    in the IIoT environment. In this section, we present brief descriptions of the
    various

    types of research conducted for the IIoT environment. These types of research
    mainly

    focus on the attacks on the IIoT environment and several other threats to the
    IIoT systems.

    George et al. [16] proposed a graph-based framework to represent the vulnerability
    re-

    lationship in the IIoT network. It also helps in the risk assessment of the IIoT
    network.

    They also proposed various risk mitigation strategies for improving IIoT network
    security.

    Sustainability 2023, 15, 9001

    5 of 18

    Furthermore, they discussed methods to identify hot spots in the IIoT networks.
    The

    proposed system performance is evaluated by simulating with graphs of varying
    sizes and

    structures. Rubio et al. [17] presented the analysis of applying Opinion Dynamics
    in the

    IIoT environment. They addressed how the Opinion Dynamics algorithm can improve

    attack traceability in the IIoT environment. The proposed system is evaluated
    through

    a case study, and the results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach in IIoT
    infras-

    tructures. AL-Hawawreh et al. [18] proposed a deep learning-based model that can
    learn

    using the information gathered from TCP/IP packets for anomaly detection in IICSs.
    The

    authors developed the model by a continuous training process that is carried out
    using

    a deep auto-encoder and a deep feed-forward neural network framework evaluated
    using

    NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15.

    Samsonov et al. [19] presented various approaches to provide security in IIoT
    environ-

    ments. They employed edge and fog computing technologies, various data transmission

    technologies, cryptographic techniques, IIoT device protection, and blockchain
    technology

    to secure IIoT systems. However, they have not discussed the system reconﬁguration

    for new tasks, the motive for choosing security mechanisms, and shared IIoT devices

    management. Teochew [20] addressed various security problems in the IIoT. The
    author

    also discussed various attacks on different IIoT architecture layers, attacks
    based on ap-

    plication scenarios, and third-party hardware/software-based attacks. Furthermore,
    the

    recommendations for approaching these security challenges are discussed.

    Esfahani et al. [21] proposed a hash and OR operation-based lightweight authentica-

    tion mechanism for M2M communication in an IIoT environment. The authors claim
    that

    the proposed system has a low computational cost, storage, and communication overhead

    while conﬁdentiality, authentication, and session key agreement are achieved.
    Moreover,

    the proposed system also resists speciﬁc security attacks, i.e., man-in-the-middle
    attacks,

    modiﬁcation attacks, replay attacks, and impersonation attacks. Wing et al. [22]
    proposed

    a blockchain-based solution to secure the IIoT through its security technology
    and tools.

    They further gave recommendations to guide future blockchain developers and researchers.

    Chen et al. [23] analyzed the security threats in IIoT systems and designed a
    protection

    framework for securing IIoT systems. The author analyzed the security threats
    to the IIoT

    through the communication protocols used and the main functionalities for each
    level of

    typical IIoT architecture. They identiﬁed the concealed dangers in the data processing

    layer, data transmission layer, and data acquisition layer. The proposed security
    framework

    provides protection measures against security threats in these layers. Choo et
    al. [24]

    presented various performances, privacy, and security-related issues of the IIoT.
    They

    addressed existing cryptographic solutions presented in 21 papers. Lastly, they
    presented

    various potential research agendas. Sinai et al. [25] presented the concept of
    the IoT, IIoT,

    and Industry 4.0. They addressed various opportunities and challenges associated
    with

    these systems. The work also focuses on the security challenges of IIoT systems
    that

    originate from the high sensitivity of managed information. Bakhshi et al. [26]
    addressed

    various security issues and threats in the IIoT. They focused mainly on the security
    threats

    on a cloud-side layer, consisting of abstraction levels and data accumulation,
    of the IoT.

    The authors referred to the Cisco and Microsoft Azure IoT architectures as the
    reference

    models. Further, they subdivided the threats based on security attacks and vulnerabilities.

    Kwon et al. [27] analyzed the security issues of the provisioning process in the
    IWSN by

    investigating the necessary ISN standards, i.e., WirelessHART, ISA 100.11.A, and
    Zigbee,

    an ISA 100.11a-certiﬁed device, and various provisioning process-related research
    works.

    They tested and analyzed the provisioning process using ISA 100.11a to verify
    its security

    issues. Lastly, they discussed the future research direction on providing security
    for the

    IWSN in the IIoT age. The summary of the techniques presented above is listed
    in Table 2.

    Numerous studies have been proposed for the detection of malicious trafﬁc and
    attacks

    in the industrial IoT. From the studies discussed above, it is noticed that machine
    learning

    algorithms could improve network security in the IIoT environment. Moreover, it
    is also

    observed that the models for securing IIoT networks are still under development.
    For this

    Sustainability 2023, 15, 9001

    6 of 18

    purpose, we combined SDN technology and machine learning algorithms for intrusion

    detection in IIoT networks.

    3. IoT, Industrial IoT, and Industry 4.0

    3.1. IoT

    The IoT refers to a system of billions of interrelated physical devices, i.e.,
    computing

    devices, digital and mechanical machines, animals, people, or objects connected
    to the

    Internet, and can transfer and share data over the Internet.

    Layers of IoT

    The essential IoT layers act as the backbone of IoT systems. These layers can
    form

    the basis of the development of effective IoT multilayered architecture. These
    layers are

    discussed below and summarized in Table 3.

    •

    Perception Layer: This is the physical layer that consists of sensors, actuators,
    devices,

    and machines. Sensors, i.e., gauges, meters, and probes, sense and gather information

    about the industrial IoT environment. The actuators used in lasers, motor controllers,

    and robotic arms translate electrical signals from IoT systems into physical actions.

    •

    Transport Layer: This layer transports the sensor data between the perception
    layer

    and processing layer using technologies, such as WiFi, LPWAN, Ethernet, and ZigBee.

    Sustainability 2023, 15, 9001

    7 of 18

    •

    Processing Layer: This layer is also called the middleware layer. The processing
    layer

    is responsible for collecting information from the transport layer and performing

    processing on it [28].

    •

    Application Layer: The application layer is responsible for interacting with end-users

    directly. It consists of various applications, such as mobile apps, device monitoring

    software, business intelligence services, etc. All the applications have their
    application

    layer protocols.

    There are some additional layers in IoT systems to cater to the business needs
    of IoT

    systems. These layers are described below:

    •

    Edge Layer: This performs the preprocessing of data close to the edge. It occurs
    on

    local servers, gateways, and other edge nodes across the network.

    •

    Business Layer: The business layer is the layer on which businesses, based on
    collected

    data, can make decisions.

    •

    Security Layer: The security layer covers all the IoT layers mentioned above.
    It

    includes device security, connection security, and cloud security.

    3.2. Industrial IoT

    The industrial IoT refers to the utilization of the IoT in the industrial sector
    and

    business settings. The industrial IoT is the intersection of operational technology
    (OT)

    and information technology (IT). An advance notiﬁcation is generated from a machine

    about an approaching breakdown; the cloud-based intelligent factory ﬂoors obtain
    the

    status of assembly-line production or the progress of raw materials in real time.
    These are

    examples of how future industries and factories will work. Industrial Control
    System: An

    industrial control system refers to hardware devices and software integration
    that support

    and monitor critical infrastructures. It includes a programmable logic controller
    (PLC),

    a remote terminal unit (RTU), an intelligent electronic device (IED), a control
    server, a

    distributed control system (DCS), supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA),
    and

    sensors [29].

    Components of Industrial IoT

    The components of the industrial IoT can vary concerning the application. However,

    generally, they are categorized into three areas discussed below and shown in
    Figure 2.

    Figure 2. Components of industrial IoT.

    •

    Front-End Edge Devices: Front-end edge devices, i.e., sensors or control devices,
    are

    responsible for data collection and acting on the data. This data can be a temperature

    reading, accelerometer reading, or video feed. The sensors/devices can be used

    as individual units or multiple sensors bundled together, and the sensors can
    be

    embedded into devices that perform more tasks than just sensing things.

    •

    Connectivity Technology: Once the data is collected, the next step is to send
    the data

    to the cloud. Similarly, the cloud sends back commands to the industrial IoT system.

    Industrial IoT systems rely majorly on wireless technology, including Bluetooth,
    Mesh

    Networks, WiFi, and LPWAN.

    Sustainability 2023, 15, 9001

    8 of 18

    •

    Industrial IoT Platform Data Analysis: The industrial IoT system contains industrial

    IoT software for the analysis of acquired and transmitted data. The industrial
    IoT

    software can also make decisions and push commands back to the controls at the
    edge.

    3.3. Industry 4.0

    Industry 4.0 is the term often used for the fourth industrial revolution. Industry
    4.0,

    which includes the industrial IoT and smart manufacturing, combines physical production

    and operations with smart digital technologies, big data, and machine learning
    to build

    a more complete and well-connected environment for organizations focused on supply

    chain management and manufacturing. It is deﬁned as the current trend of data
    exchange

    and automation in manufacturing technologies, including the Internet of Things,
    cyber-

    physical systems, cognitive computing, cloud computing, and creating a smart industry
    or

    factory. Industry 4.0 is based on the cyber-physical system, i.e., intelligent
    machines. These

    systems use modern control systems with software systems embedded and connected
    to

    the IoT through Internet addresses. In this way, production and products get connected
    to

    the network and can communicate, enabling value creation, real-time optimization,
    and

    new ways of production. The objective is to monitor the processes and assets in
    real time,

    enabling processes to make autonomous decisions and fulﬁll customer needs. Industry
    4.0

    is characterized in the following way:

    •

    Provides more automation compared to the third industrial revolution;

    •

    Shifting from centralized industrial control systems to systems where intelligent

    products deﬁne the production steps;

    •

    Bridging the gap between the digital and physical world using cyber-physical systems;

    •

    Customization or personalization of products;

    •

    Closed-loop control systems and data models.

    4. Proposed Methodology

    In this section, we propose an SDN-based model for attack detection in an industrial

    IoT environment. The proposed framework comprises three components, i.e., industrial

    IoT devices, a centralized SDN controller, and SDN-enabled switches, as shown
    in Figure 3:

    Figure 3. SDN-Based Model for Industrial IoT Anomaly Detection.

    •

    The industrial IoT device is any IoT-enabled device operating in the industry.
    Indus-

    trial IoT devices may include drilling gears, green energy devices, smart meters,
    smart

    irrigation devices, smart frost systems, smart assembly lines, and various sensors.
    All

    of these devices are connected to the allocated SDN-enabled switch.

    •

    Each industry is assigned an SDN switch to connect its devices. The switch is
    SDN-

    enabled and security policies are installed within it. The SDN-enabled switches

    Sustainability 2023, 15, 9001

    9 of 18

    monitor the trafﬁc ﬂow in industrial IoT devices and provide trafﬁc data to the

    SDN controller.

    •

    The industrial IoT devices are connected to the SDN switches and these switches
    are

    connected to the SDN controller. The machine learning algorithm is applied to
    the

    SDN controller to detect anomalous trafﬁc and the abnormal behavior of the trafﬁc

    ﬂow. As a result, the ﬂow rules are deﬁned for the switches.

    The industrial IoT devices working in the same industry are connected to the SDN-

    enabled switch. The SDN-enabled switches provide the trafﬁc ﬂow data to the SDN

    controller, responsible for determining whether the trafﬁc ﬂow is normal or anomalous.

    Based on the analyzed data, it determines the ﬂow rules for the SDN-enabled switches.

    Based on these rules, the SDN-enabled switches perform various operations on the
    trafﬁc

    ﬂow, such as complete ﬂow blocking, partial ﬂow blocking, and blacklisting the
    attack

    source. For anomaly detection, a machine learning algorithm is applied to an SDN
    controller.

    Machine learning techniques can aid in developing security policies for SDN controllers
    by

    accurately predicting potential susceptible hosts [30].

    Dataset: We evaluate the performance of the framework using the NSL-KDD dataset,

    which is used for network intrusion detection. The reasonable number of test and
    train

    set records makes this dataset run experiments affordably on a complete set instead
    of

    selecting a small portion of the dataset randomly. Each record contains 41 attributes
    that

    describe various aspects of the ﬂow and are labeled as either an attack type or
    normal.

    The 42nd attribute contains information on the various ﬁve kinds of network connection

    vectors, which are divided into one normal class and four attack classes. The
    NSL-KDD

    dataset has the following advantages:

    •

    The train set contains no duplicated records, therefore, the classiﬁer will not
    provide

    any biased outputs.

    •

    There are no duplicate records in the test set, resulting in higher reduction
    rates.

    In this dataset, there are 22 different types of attacks classiﬁed into four major
    types

    of attacks [31]. The four attack types are classiﬁed as DoS, R2L, Probe, and U2R.
    These

    attacks are shown in Table 4.

    Table 4. Attacks in NSL-KDD [31].

    Data Preprocessing: In data preprocessing, feature selection is done to select
    the subset

    of the most relevant features. For feature selection, we have used a correlation-based
    feature

    selection (CFS) algorithm. Correlation is a measurement of the linear relationship
    between

    two or more variables. The reason for using CFS for feature selection is that
    useful variables

    have a strong correlation with the target. The variables should also be uncorrelated
    with

    one another but correlated with the target. We can predict one variable based
    on the other

    if the two are correlated. As a result, if there is a correlation between two
    features, the

    model only requires one because the second does not provide any new information.
    Using

    the CFS algorithm, 23 uncorrelated features were selected for prediction. Support
    Vector

    Machine(SVM): Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised learning technique
    used for

    the regression and classiﬁcation of problems. The kernels and algorithms in SVM
    are used

    to analyze the data for regression and classiﬁcation. The SVM algorithm’s goal
    is to create

    a decision boundary or best line that can segregate the n-dimensional space into
    the classes

    such that in the future new data points can be easily put into an incorrect category.
    The best

    Sustainability 2023, 15, 9001

    10 of 18

    line is called the hyperlink. For creating a hyperlink, SVM chooses the extreme
    points. The

    extreme points are called support; hence, the algorithm is named Support Vector

    Decision Tree: The Decision Tree is a supervised machine-learning technique where
    the

    data is split based on a certain parameter. The Decision Tree contains two types
    of entities,

    i.e., leaves and decision nodes. The leaves are outcomes, whereas; on the decision
    nodes,

    the data is split. There are two types of decision trees based on the target variable
    type:

    •

    Categorical Variable Decision Trees: Categorical Variable Decision Trees are those

    which have categorical target variables.

    •

    Continuous Variable Decision Trees: Continuous Variable Decision Trees are those

    which have continuous target variables.

    The proposed SDN-based framework effectively overcomes the problem of network

    anomaly detection in the industrial IoT. The SDN controller has a global view
    and receives

    monitoring information from the SDN switches. The SDN switches are responsible
    for

    monitoring the industrial IoT devices’ trafﬁc ﬂow and sending each packet of ﬂow
    to the

    SDN controller. The SDN controller detects anomalous behavior through the data
    provided

    by the switches. The machine learning algorithm is applied to the SDN controller
    for

    detecting potentially dangerous network trafﬁc. Based on the classiﬁed data, the
    SDN

    controller determines the trafﬁc ﬂow rules for the switches, which makes this
    framework

    effective in network anomaly detection.

    5. Experimentation and Results

    We used the NSL-KDD dataset in our analysis, which is used for network intrusion

    detection. The machine learning techniques, i.e., SVM and Decision Trees, are
    used to

    evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model. We assessed the machine learning

    algorithms by using the following quality metrics [32]:

    Accuracy =

    TN + TP

    FP + FN + TP + TN

    (1)

    Precision =

    TP

    FP + TP

    (2)

    Recall =

    TP

    FN + TP

    (3)

    F1-score = 2 × Recall × Precision

    Recall + Precision

    (4)

    5.1. Classiﬁcation Using SVM

    The NSL-KDD dataset is classiﬁed using the linear SVM model and quadratic SVM

    model of classiﬁcation. The beneﬁt of using SVM is that, while it is a linear
    model, we

    can utilize the kernels to represent the linearly non-separable data. Moreover,
    SVM uses

    considerably less memory and is more efﬁcient in large dimensional spaces. The
    dataset in

    the linear and quadratic SVM models is classiﬁed using 125,973 observations. The
    accuracy

    of the quadratic SVM classiﬁer model is higher compared to the linear SVM model.
    The

    prediction speed of the linear SVM model is greater compared to the quadratic
    SVM model.

    The training time taken by the linear SVM model to classify the NSL-KDD dataset
    is 699.22 s;

    whereas; it is 465.28 s in the quadratic SVM model. The summary of the results
    of both of

    the SVM models is shown in Table 5.

    Since the quadratic SVM model shows greater accuracy compared to the linear SVM

    model, the confusion matrix for the classiﬁed data in the quadratic SVM model
    is shown in

    Figure 4, which summarizes the performance of the quadratic SVM classiﬁcation
    model.

    Figure 4a shows the number of observations against the predicted class and true
    class.

    Figure 4b shows the true positive rates and false negative rates. Figure 4c shows
    positive

    predictive values and false discovery rates.

    The scatter plot, ROC curve, and parallel coordinates chart for the NSL-KDD dataset

    using the quadratic SVM model are given in Figure 5. The horizontal lines in the

    5b shows

    the area under the curve (AUC) to be 1.00 or 100%, which denotes an ideal curve
    for data

    classiﬁcation. Thus, the positive and negative results are distinguished 100%
    of the time

    using this classiﬁer. The parallel coordinates plot for the dataset in the quadratic
    SVM is

    shown in Figure 5c.

    5.2. Classiﬁcation Using Decision Tree

    The NSL-KDD dataset is classiﬁed using a Decision Tree classiﬁer model, i.e.,
    Fine Tree

    and Medium Tree. A Decision Tree is a quick technique to ﬁnd the most important
    variables

    and relationships between two or more variables. In comparison to other classiﬁcation

    algorithms, they are extremely quick and efﬁcient. Moreover, there is no outsider
    inﬂuence

    or missing data in the Decision Tree; the Decision Tree requires less data. The
    dataset is

    classiﬁed using 125,973 observations. The accuracy of the Acceptable Tree classiﬁer
    model

    is much higher than the Medium Tree classiﬁer model. The prediction speed of a
    Fine

    Tree classiﬁer is also much higher than a Medium Tree classiﬁer. The training
    time of the

    Fine Tree classiﬁer model is 11.029 s; whereas, it is 35.687 s for the Medium
    Tree classiﬁer

    model. The summary of the results of both of the Decision Tree classiﬁer models
    is shown

    in Table 6.

    Since the Fine Tree classiﬁer model shows greater accuracy compared to the Medium

    Tree classiﬁer model, the confusion matrix for the classiﬁed data using the Fine
    Tree model

    is shown in Figure 6, which summarizes the performance of the Fine Tree classiﬁcation

    model. Figure 6a shows the number of observations against the predicted class
    and true

    class. Figure 6b shows the true positive rates and false negative rates. Figure
    6c shows the

    positive predictive values and false discovery rates.

    The scatter plot, ROC curve, and parallel coordinates chart for the NSL-KDD dataset

    using the Fine Tree model are given in Figure 7. The ROC curve in Figure 7a shows
    the

    area under the curve (AUC) to be 1.00 or 100%, which denotes an ideal curve for
    data

    classiﬁcation. Thus, the positive and negative results are distinguished 100%
    of the time

    using the Fine Tree classiﬁer model. The horizontal lines in the scatter plot
    in Figure 7b

    depict an excellent ﬁt to the data. The parallel coordinates plot for the dataset
    in the Fine

    Tree model is shown in Figure 7c.

    5.3. Performance Analysis

    We classiﬁed our data using the SVM models and Decision Trees as shown in Figure
    8.

    In the SVM model, we used the linear SVM model and Quadratic SVM model; whereas,

    in the Decision Trees, the Fine Tree model and Medium Tree model were used. The

    comparison of the accuracy of the classiﬁer models is shown in Figure 8a. The
    bar chart

    shows the accuracy of the Quadratic SVM model to be 99.7%, which is the highest
    compared

    to the other three models. Thus, the Quadratic SVM model is the most accurate
    data

    classiﬁcation model used in our experimentation. The comparison of the prediction
    speed

    of the classiﬁer models is shown in Figure 8b. The bar chart shows the prediction
    speed

    of the Fine Tree classiﬁer model to be 570,000 obs/s, which is the highest compared
    to the

    other three models. Thus, the Fine Tree model is the highest prediction speed
    model used

    in our experimentation.

    6. Conclusions and Future Work

    IoT deployment in the industrial sector has several beneﬁts, such as optimization,

    automation, the elimination of manual processes, and increased efﬁciency. However,

    security remains a challenge in industrial IoT devices and networks. The security
    threats

    and cyber-attacks on industrial IoT networks and devices cause industries and
    businesses to

    suffer ﬁnancial losses, reputational damage, and the theft of important information.
    Many

    approaches and frameworks have been applied for intrusion detection in industrial
    IoT

    devices and networks. Machine learning techniques play a vital role in these approaches.

    In this work, we proposed an SDN-based framework using machine learning techniques
    to

    detect threats and cyber-attacks in industrial IoT networks and devices. We used
    the NSL-

    KDD dataset in our experimentation for classiﬁcation. SVM and Decision Tree classiﬁcation

    models are used for the evaluation of our framework. The performance of the SVM
    and

    Decision Tree is evaluated, and the quadratic SVM showed 99.7% accuracy. In the
    future,

    we will employ newer data sources to enhance the adaptability and efﬁcacy of this
    study.

    How much is enough in watering

    plants? State-of-the-art in

    irrigation control: Advances,

    challenges, and opportunities

    with respect to precision

    irrigation

    Lina Owino* and Dirk Söffker

    Chair of Dynamics and Control, Faculty of Engineering, University of Duisburg-Essen,
    Duisburg,

    Germany

    With a rapidly expanding global population placing an ever growing demand on

    freshwater resources, an increased focus on irrigation techniques tailored to
    the

    speciﬁc needs of plant appears as one solution to minimize overall freshwater

    consumption. Precision irrigation methods seek to realize an acceptable

    compromise

    between

    yield

    and

    irrigation

    water consumption

    through

    control of the timing and quantity of water supplied to plants. The goal is to

    maintain the water content of the soil, achieve speciﬁc water use efﬁciency with

    regard to yield or maintain the physiological response of the plant to water

    stress within predetermined limits. Reliance on soil moisture measurements to

    establish irrigation water demand inadequately addresses heterogenous

    distribution of water in soil. Growing research interest is observed detailing

    the determination of plant water status directly from physiological responses.

    This paper reviews irrigation control approaches based on different plant water

    status assessment techniques. A distinct focus is made on application scale of

    the discussed control approaches, an aspect that has not been considered

    intensively enough in previous discussions of irrigation control approaches. A

    discussion of the observed strengths and shortcomings and technological

    advances supporting the various methods used to quantify plant water status

    extends the review. Emerging trends that are likely to have an impact on plant

    water status determination and optimal timing and quantiﬁcation of irrigation

    water requirements are integrated to show latest results. A peek into the future

    of precision irrigation foresees greater reliance on plant-based signals, both
    in

    characterization of the control variable, namely the plant water status, and in

    generation of controller outputs in terms of quantity and timing.

    1 Introduction

    As the world advances further into the 21st century, a rapidly

    growing global population continues to exert greater demand on

    agricultural food production (van Dijk et al., 2021). The effects of

    climate change provide an additional challenge to traditional

    rain- and reservoir-based crop production, making the case for

    use of irrigation either exclusively throughout the growing

    season, or as a supplement to natural precipitation (Wada

    et al., 2013; Rosa et al., 2020). Maintaining crop yields from

    the available land area, using a diminishing quantity of the

    required freshwater for irrigation is a delicate balancing act

    that has acted as a motivation for extensive research in

    precision irrigation approaches, with the overall goal of

    maximizing water use efﬁciency of irrigated crops, while

    simultaneously meeting the rising global food demand.

    While water treatment and desalination provide alternatives

    to cover the freshwater need, existing techniques are costly and

    energy intensive, particularly at low to medium scale (Arborea

    et al., 2017; Hagenvoort et al., 2019; Arena et al., 2020;

    Oubelkacem et al., 2020; Ofori et al., 2021). Concerns about

    the safety of treated wastewater, even with application of

    advanced treatment methods, have resulted in a call to more

    rigorous regulation and combination of treatment processes

    (Rizzo et al., 2020). Freshwater generation via atmospheric

    water harvesting (Tu et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2022) offers a

    novel, but energy intensive alternative which is currently

    limited to smaller production units (LaPotin et al., 2021). As a

    conclusion optimization of crop irrigation appears to be the most

    suitable solution to achieve a sustainable compromise between

    increasing freshwater demand for food production and the

    associated energy and environmental costs to realize adequate

    global food supply.

    In the history of mankind, adequate food production has

    been a fundamental requirement in the growth and advancement

    of human society. As early as 5000 BC, early agricultural

    civilizations in Egypt and Mesopotamia had come upon the

    idea of expanding the extent of arable land through use of

    irrigation, making use of the ﬂoodwaters of the Nile, Tigris,

    and Euphrates which was diverted into arable farmlands

    bordering the rivers through an extensive network of canals

    (Bazza, 2007). Through the use of intricate systems of canals,

    with later additions of reservoirs, dikes, and overﬂow canals,

    ﬂooding could be mitigated (Grenfell et al., 1900; Westermann,

    1919). Similar implementation of surface irrigation was also

    recorded in ancient China, Crete, India, and Persia (Biswas,

    1970). Irrigation control in this case was focused on direction

    of irrigation water to speciﬁc locations, regulation of irrigation

    duration and mitigation of ﬂooding. Surface irrigation methods

    involving use of ﬂooded basins, furrows, dykes, dams, and

    artiﬁcial reservoirs remain the predominant form of irrigation

    to date (Jägermeyr et al., 2015). Control methods aimed at more

    efﬁcient use of irrigation water have been targeted at regulating

    the timing, duration, and frequency of supply to the ﬁelds

    through control of gates, sluices, valves, and pumps.

    Introduction of new methods of water application to

    plants in the ﬁeld, namely through sprinklers and drip

    lines, provided new opportunities for more accurate control

    of irrigation water supply, allowing the regulation of water

    supply down to the individual plant level. These developments

    on the actuation side of irrigation have been accompanied by

    corresponding

    developments

    in

    sensing

    and

    control

    approaches.

    The incorporation of spatial variability in the management of

    irrigation is a key concept in distinguishing between traditional

    irrigation and precision irrigation (Sadler et al., 2005; Smith and

    Baillie, 2009). In Smith et al. (Smith et al., 2010), a distinction is

    made between traditional deﬁnitions of precision irrigation,

    which

    focus

    on

    maximizing

    efﬁciency

    through

    precise

    determination of volume, location and timing of irrigation,

    with uniform application over the entire system, and an

    updated deﬁnition that incorporates spatial and temporal

    variation in irrigation treatment. The focus is shifted from

    ﬁeld level to management zones within the ﬁeld (Gonzalez-

    Dugo et al., 2014; Fernández, 2017), or to individual plant

    level (Kizer et al., 2018; Klein et al., 2018). Camp et al.

    describe

    precision

    irrigation

    as

    “site-speciﬁc

    water

    management, speciﬁcally the application of water to a given

    site in a volume and at a time needed for optimum crop

    production, proﬁtability, or other management objectives at

    that speciﬁc site” (Camp et al., 2006). In this review, the

    supporting technologies are considered with regard to their

    ﬂexibility in allowing variable precision irrigation of individual

    plants or zones, rather than achieving efﬁciency through

    generation of uniform irrigation schedules.

    Traditional deﬁnitions of precision irrigation consider the

    “precise amount” of water to be applied to be the full amount of

    water required to meet the plant demand, which has commonly

    been determined based on the relationship between crop

    evapotranspiration and environmental factors (Morillo et al.,

    2015; Morales et al., 2016). Current irrigation practices that

    explore the cultivation of irrigated crops under regulated

    water deﬁcit provide a new Frontier for precision irrigation,

    where the required amount to be delivered is determined with a

    goal of avoiding irreversible water stress damage, without

    necessarily

    fully

    matching

    evapotranspiration-based

    plant

    demands. This provides further avenues for improvement of

    water use efﬁciency. Deﬁcit irrigation-based applications of

    precision irrigation approaches have been employed in control

    of both pre- and post-harvest yield quality (Pérez-Pastor et al.,

    2007; Lipan et al., 2019; Venturi et al., 2021). The observed effect

    of deﬁcit irrigation approaches on crop maturation (Zegbe-

    Domínguez et al., 2003; Cui et al., 2008) is an additional

    research target, with the possibility to enhance economic

    outcomes for the farmer by matching harvest timing to

    periods of greatest market demand. In this review, precision

    irrigation control approaches incorporating regulated water

    deﬁcit are emphasized.

    Previous

    contributions

    in

    the

    review

    of

    precision

    irrigation

    approaches

    have

    addressed

    model-based

    and

    sensor-based monitoring (Adeyemi et al., 2017; Liang et al.,

    2020; Plaščak et al., 2021; Bwambale et al., 2022), speciﬁc

    control algorithms applied in irrigation scheduling (Romero

    et al., 2012; Abioye et al., 2022), and technological advances

    supporting future development in precision irrigation control

    (Neupane and Guo, 2019; Bodkhe et al., 2020; Han et al.,

    2020).

    This

    review

    similarly

    provide

    a

    comprehensive

    summary of monitoring, control, and actuation approaches

    applied in precision irrigation control. Additionally, the

    implementability of deﬁcit irrigation-based strategies for

    increased water use efﬁciency is addressed, allowing the

    extension of achievable water savings thus contributing to

    sustainable expansion of global food production without

    exhausting available freshwater resources.

    2 Precision irrigation control

    approaches

    Control techniques are broadly classiﬁed as open or closed

    loop, deﬁning the existence of any kind of calculated or otherwise

    technically realized feedback (output to the input of the system

    considered). Open loop precision irrigation control relies on an

    accurate understanding (in the best case: a model) of plant water

    requirements, while closed loop methods include sensing

    mechanisms to dynamically adjust the control input to the

    irrigation system based on measured values.

    The performance of precision irrigation control approaches

    depends on the deﬁnition of plant water requirements. The

    characterization of plant water demand and the subsequent

    responses to the water application is described in Kögler

    (Kögler and Söffker, 2017) along a soil-plant-atmosphere

    continuum.

    This

    paper

    similarly

    groups

    approaches

    in

    precision

    irrigation

    into

    soil-based,

    plant-based,

    and

    atmosphere-based approaches. Further distinction is made

    between approaches targeted at enhancing precise delivery at

    ﬁeld level, within irrigation management zones and at individual

    plant level.

    2.1 Soil-based approaches

    Growing plants obtain water required for their growth from

    the soil. The soil moisture content has therefore been applied as a

    measure of the water status of the plant, with a plant-speciﬁc

    lower limit describing the minimum moisture content required

    to maintain the plant above wilting point (Briggs and Shantz,

    1911) and a soil-speciﬁc maximum water holding capacity, also

    referred to as the ﬁeld capacity (Veihmeyer and Hendrickson,

    1931). The main goal of traditional irrigation methods is to

    maintain soil moisture content at ﬁeld capacity during the

    growth phases, with scheduling of irrigation events based on

    plant growth models such as FAO Aquacrop (Steduto et al., 2009)

    or multivariable models simulating soil moisture, plant growth,

    and evapotranspiration such as DSSAT (Hoogenboom et al.,

    2019).

    Model-based predictive control approaches applied in

    precision irrigation allow the integration of soil moisture

    models

    in

    a

    predictive

    control

    scheme,

    which

    allows

    forecasting of moisture content and update of control actions

    based on measured variables. Spatial and temporal variability is

    accounted for using regression models (Hedley C. and Yule I.,

    2009), a predictive model with weekly measurement-based

    updates performing online optimization (Nahar et al., 2019),

    employment of Kalman ﬁlters (Roy, 2014), and application of

    deep belief networks and macroscopic cellular automata, with

    dynamic environmental measurements providing additional data

    for prediction (Song et al., 2016).

    The learning capabilities of neural networks allows the

    adaptation of plant growth models for the design of precision

    irrigation controllers. Speciﬁc neural-network based approaches

    allow online updating of control decisions based on measured

    real-time conditions, resulting in more accurate behavior. These

    capabilities are utilized by Capraro et al. (Capraro et al., 2008) in

    the development of an adaptive closed loop controller that allows

    for

    modiﬁcation

    of

    control

    actions

    when

    environmental

    perturbations such as rainfall or extreme temperatures cause a

    change in irrigation requirements. Long short term memory

    neural networks are employed for prediction of soil moisture

    content (Adeyemi et al., 2018) or soil matric potential Jimenez

    et al. (2020) with varying performance, both in terms of water

    savings and prediction accuracy. These are attributed to soil

    characteristics and duration of the prediction window. Difference

    in performance of neural network-based predictive models are

    also reported by (Gu et al., 2021), with larger estimation errors

    observed at lower soil moisture content levels, affecting

    performance of the precision irrigation scheduling system.

    A major challenge in the use of model-based methods for

    precision irrigation is that the control performance is limited by

    the accuracy of prediction or estimation achieved by the model.

    Incorporation of soil moisture data into irrigation management

    decisions offers a signiﬁcant performance improvement in soil-

    based precision irrigation approaches. Sensor readings have been

    used to calibrate and reﬁne model output, as described in (Tseng

    et al., 2018), where soil moisture measurements are used in

    labelling images acquired from an unmanned aerial vehicle for

    training a deep learning-based predictive algorithm. Conversely,

    application of predictive models can be integrated in sensor-

    based control approaches to reduce the quantity of sensor

    readings required to make an accurate assessment of soil

    water content, as proposed in (De Benedetto et al., 2013b)

    and (Andugula et al., 2017).

    Soil-based closed loop control methods integrate soil

    moisture measurements in the control loop. On/off switching

    algorithms triggered by designated soil moisture sensors with

    preset static thresholds have been employed in precision

    irrigation control by Xiao et al. (Xiao et al., 2010). Use of

    dynamic switching thresholds allows real-time response to

    ﬁeld

    conditions,

    with

    the

    adaptation

    of

    the

    thresholds

    accomplished in Capraro et al. (Capraro et al., 2008) by

    neural networks, and numerical simulation employed by Egea

    et al. (Egea et al., 2017). An alternative approach involves

    placement of sensors at varying depths to track inﬁltration

    rate, allowing anticipatory switching (Benzekri and Refouﬁ,

    2006; Zhao et al., 2007; Liu and Xu, 2018).

    Development of a large variety of soil moisture sensors with

    greater accuracy and reliability has facilitated the precision

    control of irrigation based on real-time conditions. A major

    challenge to implementation of sensor-based control approaches

    has been the unit cost of sensors, which limits the economic

    viability of ﬁeld scale application of appropriately accurate and

    precise sensors. New low-cost soil moisture sensors have been

    developed in recent times based on sensing approaches

    commonly used in commercially available sensors, including

    frequency domain reﬂectometry (FDR) (Xiao et al., 2010),

    time

    domain

    reﬂectometry

    (TDR)

    (Wei

    et

    al.,

    2013),

    impedance

    spectroscopy

    (Umar

    and

    Setiadi,

    2015),

    and

    capacitance-based methods (Kojima et al., 2016; Gao et al.,

    2018). Novel approaches in the measurement of soil moisture

    content have also been developed in recent times, such as a time-

    domain multiplexing approach described in Saeed et al. (Saeed

    et al., 2019) and a high frequency double-resonance tuning

    approach developed by Qinglan et al. (Qinglan et al., 2020).

    Ding and Chandra introduce a Wi-Fi-based measurement

    system that relies on radio-frequency propagation (Ding and

    Chandra, 2019). Development of more precise calibration

    techniques and incorporation of fault detection mechanisms

    generates an opportunity for improvement of measurement

    accuracy and ﬂexibility of application in both novel and

    existing soil moisture sensors (Oates et al., 2016; Chen L.

    et al., 2019; González-Teruel et al., 2019; Nagahage et al.,

    2019). Additionally, dynamically variable irrigation thresholds

    based on plant growth requirements can be incorporated through

    calibration based on plant measurements. This is employed in

    Lou et al. (Lou et al., 2016) to generate a set of soil potential

    thresholds that allows precision irrigation through different plant

    growth stages.

    Location and distribution of moisture sensors within the ﬁeld

    has traditionally relied on expert knowledge from manufacturers

    or farmers. Approaches for optimizing the spatial distribution of

    soil moisture sensors for improved mapping of water content

    include use of clay percentile (Zhao W. et al., 2017), analysis of

    soil elevation maps combined with measurement of electrical

    conductivity (Adamchuk et al., 2010), and application of graph-

    theoretical methods (Roy, 2014).

    Field level precision irrigation based on soil moisture content

    relies on accurately modeling and/or measurement of soil water

    dynamics, incorporating the effects of precipitation, irrigation,

    leaching, run-off, and drainage to establish the moisture available

    within the root zone of the plant. Precision irrigation control

    approaches are therefore employed primarily to address accuracy

    of moisture content measurement and monitoring, and the

    scheduling the timing and quantity of ﬁeld-level irrigation

    events. Remote sensing techniques capable of extracting soil

    moisture characteristics with increasing precision and more

    frequent intervals is a key factor in the further development

    of soil-based precision irrigation at ﬁeld level. Electromagnetic

    surveys have been applied in (Hedley et al., 2013) to assess the

    spatio-temporal dynamics of soil moisture and water table depth

    for precision irrigation control. Satellite data are also used to

    determine the soil water index, which is used as an indicator of

    soil moisture content (Termite et al., 2019).

    Zone level precision irrigation relies on accurate demarcation

    of the ﬁeld into homogeneous management zones based on

    physical and chemical characteristics of the soil (Bazzi et al.,

    2018; de Lara et al., 2018; Chen S. et al., 2019). Integration of

    plant-related

    measurements

    to

    complement

    soil

    sensor

    measurements has been explored in (Rojo et al., 2016; Ortuani

    et al., 2019; Vera et al., 2019; Serrano et al., 2020) for better zone

    delineation as a means to increasing irrigation efﬁciency. Recent

    research investigates the adoption of Bayesian maximum entropy

    (Han et al., 2020) and clustering approaches (Haghverdi et al.,

    2015; Oldoni and Bassoi, 2016; Ohana-Levi et al., 2019; Javadi

    et al., 2022) for achievement of optional zoning. To address

    challenges arising from static management zone delineation

    based on spatial characterization, dynamic determination of

    zone boundaries has been explored with integration of real-

    time soil and plant sensor measurements (Scudiero et al.,

    2018;

    Fontanet

    et

    al.,

    2020)

    or

    use

    of

    deep

    learning

    approaches (Song et al., 2016).

    With regard to the current status of soil-based precision

    irrigation control approaches summarized in Table 1, it can be

    stated that the maintenance of soil moisture level between a user-

    deﬁned lower boundary related to the wilting point and an upper

    boundary deﬁned by the soil water capacity has been employed as

    the basis for control decisions. Challenges related to soil water

    dynamics arising from inherent hydraulic characteristics or

    changes in the spatial envelope deﬁning root-available water

    have been addressed. Optimization of location and distribution

    of soil moisture sensors to allow accurate mapping of soil

    moisture distribution while minimizing the required number

    of sensors is a potential area for further work in the

    implementation

    of

    sensor-supported

    soil-based

    precision

    irrigation control. Variations in the upper soil moisture

    boundary during scheduling of irrigation quantity has not

    been

    considered

    in

    literature,

    signifying

    a

    gap

    in

    the

    application of soil-based precision irrigation methods to

    deﬁcit irrigation strategies. Additionally, a signiﬁcant gap

    Frontiers in Control Engineering

    Owino and Söffker

    10.3389/fcteg.2022.982463

    exists in soil-based approaches applied at individual plant level.

    Advancements in the ﬁeld of wireless sensor networks, remote

    sensing and machine learning approaches are expected to drive

    future developments in soil-based precision irrigation control,

    allowing for more localized decision support systems and greater

    adaptability to individual plant water requirements.

    2.2 Atmosphere-based approaches

    Atmosphere-based precision irrigation control approaches

    involve balancing the water supplied to the plant with the water

    released

    to

    the

    atmosphere

    through

    evapotranspiration.

    Achievement of the high accuracy required in precision

    irrigation

    is

    either

    accomplished

    by

    reﬁning

    evapotranspiration models for use in open loop control or by

    incorporation of sensor feedback in closed loop control.

    Common models of evapotranspiration incorporated into

    precision irrigation include FAO’s Penman-Monteith model

    (Allen, 1998; Fourati et al., 2014; Robinson et al., 2017;

    Pereira

    et

    al.,

    2020),

    the

    Hargreaves-Samani

    model

    (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985; Gordin et al., 2019; Pelosi

    et al., 2019; Domínguez-Niño et al., 2020) and the Surface

    Energy Balance model (SEBAL) (Bastiaanssen et al., 1998;

    Gobbo

    et

    al.,

    2019).

    Both

    the

    Penman-Monteith

    and

    Hargreaves-Samani models generate an estimated reference

    evapotranspiration rate, which is multiplied by a crop-speciﬁc

    coefﬁcient to predict the actual evapotranspiration rate of the

    crop.

    The

    Hargreaves-Samani

    model

    provides

    a

    simpler

    approach due to its ability to provide an estimate based solely

    on temperature values, as compared to the Penman-Monteith

    approach, where several environmental, geographic and soil-

    related variables are required. Better temporal stability in

    evapotranspiration prediction accuracy using the Hargreaves-

    Samani approach has also been reported in (Lorite et al., 2015),

    making it a more reliable option for control approaches

    integrating longer prediction windows. The SEBAL approach

    directly computes the actual evapotranspiration rate from

    thermal imagery without requiring speciﬁc soil- or crop-

    related coefﬁcients, making it more readily applicable to new

    or inadequately researched crop varieties for which physiological

    coefﬁcients are yet to be established.

    Machine learning approaches have more recently been

    applied in estimation of evapotranspiration, and hence plant

    water requirements, based on weather data (Sidhu et al., 2020;

    Farooque et al., 2021). Linker et al. use temperature forecasts to

    estimate evapotranspiration values, which are applied in

    precision scheduling of irrigation to achieve targeted optimal

    combinations of yield and irrigation amount selected by the

    farmer (Linker et al., 2018). Estimation of evapotranspiration

    using remote sensing data is employed in Barker et al. (Barker

    et al., 2018) for variable rate irrigation control. In Ma et al., the

    Root Zone Water Quality Model is calibrated using lysimeter

    measurements for estimation of plant evapotranspiration, which

    is then applied in irrigation scheduling (Ma et al., 2017). The

    authors suggest further improvement of irrigation scheduling by

    inclusion of weather forecasting data. Improvements in water use

    efﬁciency are observed in this case. However, due to the

    implementation

    of

    an

    open-loop

    control,

    real-time

    evapotranspiration values play no role in the decision-making,

    making the system susceptible to environmental variations. For

    greenhouse-based applications (Incrocci et al., 2014), developed a

    data-driven evapotranspiration model for precision irrigation

    control, achieving a 45% reduction in seasonal water use.

    An

    alternative

    atmospheric-based

    approach

    relies

    on

    prediction of precipitation rather than evapotranspiration

    (Roy,

    2014;

    Tsakmakis

    et

    al.,

    2016).

    Roy

    introduces

    a

    stochastic

    weather

    forecasting

    module

    for

    predicting

    precipitation (Roy, 2014) using publicly available weather

    forecasts. Tsakmakis et al. use a weather prognostics model

    based on the air pollution model (Hurley, 2005), which

    predicts

    precipitation

    by

    solving

    given

    scalar

    equations.

    Irrigation scheduling is adjusted based on predicted timing

    and quantities of precipitation.

    Hybrid approaches combining ET estimation with soil

    moisture sensing (Lozoya et al., 2016; Nocco et al., 2019;

    Bhatti et al., 2020) or plant-based methods (Tsakmakis et al.,

    2016; Gobbo et al., 2019) have also been used to achieve greater

    accuracy

    in

    precision

    irrigation

    control.

    These

    allow

    compensation

    of

    weather-related

    disturbances

    to

    the

    evapotranspiration model by integrating the dynamic behavior

    of soil moisture or of the plant. However their reliability depends

    on the accuracy of crop coefﬁcients used in determination of

    actual evapotranspiration.

    A major challenge in atmospheric-based precision irrigation

    approaches arises from the difﬁculty in differentiating between

    evaporation (from the soil surface) and transpiration (from the

    plants), requiring dynamic adjustment of irrigation control

    algorithms as plant cover increases during the growth season.

    A recent approach described by Chen et al. (Chen et al., 2020)

    involves the partitioning of evapotranspiration values into its two

    components through machine learning techniques. This could

    provide a key to achieving greater accuracy in precision irrigation

    control, allowing the focusing of water delivery to meet actual

    plant demand rather than maintaining constant soil moisture

    levels, including in areas where no plant growth is present. A

    summary of existing atmosphere-based control approaches is

    provided in Table 2.

    2.3 Plant-based approaches

    To alleviate the gaps inherent in soil-based and atmospheric-

    based precision control approaches, plant-based precision

    irrigation control has been widely seen as the best approach

    in accurately determining and meeting plant water requirements

    (Jones, 2004). The timing and quantity of irrigation is based on

    the plant physiological response to lack of water, which results in

    changes in leaf surface temperature, water potential, or turgor

    (Ayars and Phene, 2007).

    Canopy temperature-based crop water stress indices (CWSI),

    both based on theoretical (Idso et al., 1981) and experimental

    models (Jackson et al., 1981) have been employed in irrigation

    scheduling since the early 1980s. Due to their reliance on canopy

    temperature measurements taken at a speciﬁc time of day

    (typically midday), they are constrained in their adaptability

    to dynamically varying stress conditions. Applications of

    CWSI

    in

    precision

    irrigation

    control

    are

    described

    in

    O’Shaughnessy et al. (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012b), where a

    cumulative

    time

    threshold

    is

    incorporated

    in

    the

    determination of irrigation timing, and in Osroosh et al.

    (Osroosh

    et

    al.,

    2015),

    where

    a

    dynamic

    threshold

    is

    implemented to account for changes in water stress thresholds

    at different growing stages. A recent approach described by

    Andrade et al. (Andrade et al., 2018) is the implementation of

    machine learning algorithms for forecasting of crop water stress

    indices based on historic data.

    Advancements in canopy temperature measurements have

    contributed greatly to the development of plant-based precision

    irrigation approaches. High resolution satellite thermal images

    have been used for mapping of plant water stress levels for site-

    speciﬁc irrigation scheduling, with the capability to replace

    locally obtained leaf water potential (LWP) measurements

    (Meron et al., 2010). At a local level, thermal imagery

    obtained from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) (Gonzalez-

    Dugo et al., 2013; Martínez et al., 2016; Matese et al., 2018) or

    all-terrain vehicles moving within the irrigated ﬁeld (Gutiérrez

    et al., 2018) has been used in mapping of plant water

    requirements for generation of irrigation management zones.

    At plant level, surface temperature sensors mounted on

    individual leaves have been applied to allow continuous

    monitoring of stress status (Rojo et al., 2016; Kizer et al., 2018).

    Determination of plant water status by measurement of water

    potential in a pressure chamber was ﬁrst described by Dixon and

    Joly in 1895 (Dixon and Joly, 1895). Various approaches have

    been developed for determination of water potential, with

    measurements taken either from the leaves or from the stem

    (SWP). Water potential measurement is done either directly on

    the plant (Mirás-Avalos et al., 2016; Blanco-Cipollone et al.,

    2017) or estimated from multispectral imagery (Baluja et al.,

    2012; Zhao T. et al., 2017; Beeri et al., 2018; Helman et al., 2018;

    Tung et al., 2018). Precision irrigation control approaches based

    on use of plant water potential-based thresholds for triggering of

    irrigation events are described by (Acevedo-Opazo et al., 2010;

    Bellvert et al., 2015; Mirás-Avalos et al., 2016) and (Ruiz-

    Sánchez et al., 2018). The application of machine learning

    approaches enables integration of historical water potential

    measurements

    to

    predict

    spatial

    variations

    in

    water

    requirements, as described in (Pôças et al., 2020). An

    alternative method

    involves the use of

    water potential

    thresholds

    as

    the

    standard

    for

    calibration

    of

    other

    measurement approaches, such as trunk diameter shrinkage

    and growth rate (Livellara et al., 2011). Near infra-red

    spectroscopy

    measurements

    have

    also

    been

    applied

    in

    precision irrigation control, as described by (Diago et al., 2018).

    Water is required for the maintenance of turgor pressure

    in plants. Plant water status can therefore be monitored or

    measured through measurement of turgor. Developments

    related

    to

    leaf

    turgor

    measurements

    and

    potential

    application

    in

    precision

    irrigation

    are

    described

    in

    (Martínez-Gimeno et al., 2016; Rodriguez-Dominguez et al.,

    2019). A novel approach employing ultrasonic sensing

    techniques for determination of leaf water content as

    related to turgor pressure is described in (Álvarez-Arenas

    et

    al.,

    2016),

    allowing

    for

    non-contact

    application

    of

    turgor-based precision irrigation control.

    Other emerging methods of assessing plant water status that

    could provide useful feedback for precision irrigation control

    include measurement of leaf thickness (Seelig et al., 2011), trunk

    diameter (Conejero et al., 2011; Meng et al., 2017), leaf reﬂectance

    (Katsoulas et al., 2016) and various applications of image analysis

    (Hendrawan and Murase, 2009; Chen et al., 2018; Mateo-Aroca

    et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2020). The demarcation of irrigation

    management zones based on plant-based sensors is also a

    potential area of exploration (Bazzi et al., 2018), allowing the

    realization of zone-based irrigation control that better matches

    the plant water requirements.

    In general, while plant-based approaches (summarized in

    Table 3) provide the closest match to plant water requirements,

    there still exist open questions regarding the determination of

    appropriate

    irrigation

    quantity,

    the

    distinguishing

    of

    physiological responses to water stress from other stresses,

    and the dynamic adaptation of irrigation control to account

    for physiological coping mechanisms employed by plants in

    response to water stress.

    The interaction between the soil, plant and atmosphere

    provides a broad spectrum of combinations for precision

    irrigation control approaches. Selection of a suitable approach

    depends

    on

    the

    speciﬁc

    soil,

    plant

    and

    environmental

    characteristics under consideration, as well as the desired scale

    of application. While signiﬁcant progress has been made in

    development of ﬁeld-level and zone-based precision irrigation

    applications using all three approaches, there remains a

    signiﬁcant gap in plant-level precision irrigation control,

    which has the potential to further improve the efﬁciency of

    irrigation water supply to meet actual plant demand.

    3 Advances in precision irrigation

    The development of precision irrigation control has beneﬁted

    from technological advances in various ﬁelds. In this section, the

    technological advances contributing to precision irrigation

    control are discussed under three main categories: sensor

    development and data acquisition, data processing and control

    approaches, and actuating devices. Speciﬁc elements of Industry

    4.0 are directly addressed in each section.

    3.1 Advances in sensing

    3.1.1 Remote sensing

    Greater availability of satellite data has provided a signiﬁcant

    boost to integration of remote sensor data in precision irrigation

    applications. The soil moisture and ocean salinity (SMOS)

    satellite (Kerr et al., 2010) launched by the European Space

    Agency and the soil moisture active and passive (SMAP)

    (Entekhabi et al., 2010) satellite by NASA have in particular

    been

    instrumental

    in

    furthering

    research

    on

    remote

    measurement and monitoring of soil water content. Drought

    assessment using soil water deﬁcit indices derived from SMOS

    Martínez-Fernández et al. (2016) and SMAP (Zhu et al., 2019)

    enables the tracking of changes in soil moisture content over

    time, enabling precision irrigation management. In (Brocca et al.,

    2018), satellite data are used to quantify amount of irrigation

    water supplied at various sites, demonstrating the potential of

    applying remote sensing data to monitoring and control tasks

    associated

    with

    precision

    irrigation.

    The

    challenge

    of

    downscaling regional scale satellite data for local application,

    such as in precision irrigation, is presented in (Peng et al., 2017),

    with a discussion of satellite-based, geoinformation-based, and

    model-base approaches. A key limitation of microwave satellites

    is that soil moisture information describes the surface condition

    rather

    than

    root

    zone

    characteristics.

    The

    Global

    Land

    Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) (Martens et al.,

    2017) provides a set of algorithms allowing estimation of

    root-zone soil moisture and evaporation from satellite data,

    allowing for incorporation into precision irrigation strategies.

    Termite et al. (Termite et al., 2019) describe the harnessing of

    machine learning capabilities in analysis of satellite imagery to

    predict soil moisture dynamics for application in irrigation

    decision support systems.

    3.1.2 Wireless sensor networks

    Advancements in wireless sensor network technology have

    led to improved collection and analysis of sensor data for high

    resolution mapping of soil moisture (Zhao et al., 2007; Xiao

    et al., 2010; Hedley et al., 2013). Real-time communication

    between

    sensors,

    actuators,

    and

    human

    users

    is

    easily

    achievable

    over

    locally

    available

    telecommunications

    infrastructure and interfaces can be implemented on mobile

    hand-held devices (Işık et al., 2017). An expansion of sensor

    networking has seen the rise of Internet-of-Things-based

    sensing applied for monitoring of plant water requirements,

    whether via soil-based, atmosphere-based, or plant-based

    measurements (Vasisht et al., 2017; Goap et al., 2018; Munir

    et al., 2018). Integration of wireless sensor networks has also

    found

    application

    in

    dynamic

    of

    irrigation

    management

    zones

    for

    zone-based

    precision

    irrigation

    control in Sapna et al. (Sapna et al., 2020).

    3.2 Advances in data processing and

    control

    3.2.1 Big data

    The vast quantities of data generated from networked sensors

    generate a need for expanded processing and storage capabilities.

    In this respect, cloud computing approaches provide a viable

    solution, ﬁnding application in monitoring of real-time irrigation

    status (López-Riquelme et al., 2017; Vaishali et al., 2017) and

    modeling of plant water requirements for soil-based (Raikar

    et al., 2018; Mezouari et al., 2020), plant-based (Roopaei et al.,

    2017), and atmosphere-based (Bendre et al., 2015) precision

    irrigation control approaches. Data analysis techniques applied

    on Big Data applications are also proving beneﬁcial in

    management of precision irrigation control systems (Zhang

    et al., 2017).

    3.2.2 Machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence

    Machine learning involves generation of self-modifying

    or

    adapting

    algorithms

    whose

    performance

    accuracy

    increases

    with

    experience

    (Marsland,

    2014).

    Machine

    learning techniques have been crucial in development of

    dynamic

    control

    approaches

    through

    integration

    of

    learning capabilities. Applications in the area of precision

    irrigation are primarily in predictive modeling of soil

    moisture dynamics (Hinnell et al., 2010; Adeyemi et al.,

    2018) and optimized irrigation scheduling (Jimenez et al.,

    2018;

    Murthy

    et

    al.,

    2019).

    Recent

    research

    involves

    application of Machine learning algorithms to identify new

    parameters that can be employed in characterization of plant

    water content, primarily through image analysis (Hendrawan

    and Murase, 2009).

    3.2.3 Multi-agent systems

    Multi-agent systems expand the capabilities of artiﬁcial

    intelligence by introducing multiple autonomous intelligent

    agents capable of interacting with each other. Multi-agent

    systems have been employed in simulation of plant growth

    response

    to

    multiple

    irrigation

    strategies,

    allowing

    the

    selection

    of

    optimal

    precision

    irrigation

    approaches

    for

    speciﬁc conditions (Isern et al., 2012; Belaqziz et al., 2013;

    Zaryouli et al., 2020). With the incorporation of real-time

    sensed

    variables

    describing

    plant

    response

    to

    water

    application,

    multi-agent

    systems

    have

    additionally

    been

    proposed

    for

    dynamic

    tuning

    of

    irrigation

    scheduling

    algorithms (Villarrubia et al., 2017; Wanyama and Far, 2017;

    González-Briones et al., 2019), allowing for constant adaptation

    of water supply to plant needs. Further research in incorporation

    of artiﬁcial intelligence in plant-based precision irrigation control

    could be useful in enabling further individualization of plant

    water requirement estimation, resulting in precision irrigation

    control applications that more closely meet individual plant

    needs.

    An emerging ﬁeld in precision irrigation control is the

    modeling

    of

    irrigation-related

    parameters

    using

    hybrid

    automata.

    Here,

    plant,

    soil,

    and

    atmosphere-related

    parameters are modeled using ﬁnite state-machines, with

    individual

    states

    described

    using

    simple

    linear

    models,

    enabling the modeling and control of complex dynamic

    systems, as described in Lozoya et al. (Lozoya et al., 2019) and

    Jihin et al. (Jihin et al., 2019). Future work in this area would

    involve integration of the generated plant models in precision

    irrigation control algorithms, with the aim of predicting plant

    water

    requirements

    and

    adaptively

    adjusting

    irrigation

    scheduling based on plant response.

    3.3 Advances in actuation

    Delivery of irrigation water involves control of suitable

    individual or combinations of pumps, valves, gates, and drip

    lines through connected actuators in the form of motors,

    mechanisms, and/or linkages. To ensure that the required

    amount of irrigation water is delivered in a timely manner to

    the required location, improvements at the delivery end play a

    signiﬁcant role. A common unifying factor is uniform supply of

    irrigation water, with precision control approaches mainly

    concerned with on/off switching of actuators to accomplish

    scheduling and determine irrigation quantity.

    3.3.1 Variable rate irrigation

    The achievement of precision irrigation requires variable

    delivery of water to different locations, based on localized

    requirements. The development of variable rate irrigation is

    described in Mulla and Khosla (Mulla and Khosla, 2015) as

    one of the major contributors to the widespread adoption of

    precision agriculture. In variable rate irrigation, the amount of

    water delivered by individual nozzles or groups of nozzles is

    independently adjustable, allowing for delineation of a ﬁeld into

    different irrigation management zones. This is a widely used

    approach in cases where variations in scheduling or frequency of

    irrigation for different zones within the ﬁeld may not be desired.

    Implementation of variable rate irrigation has been achieved by a

    number of researchers through modiﬁcation of commercially

    Frontiers in Control Engineering

    09

    Owino and Söffker

    10.3389/fcteg.2022.982463

    available sprinkler irrigation systems to supply preset quantities

    of water under the control of a programmable system (McCann

    et al., 1997; Camp et al., 1998; Chávez et al., 2009) or

    development of new systems with variable rate irrigation

    capabilities (Han et al., 2009). With hardware capable of

    supplying different amounts of water, precision irrigation

    control is transformed into a zoning/mapping operation, with

    regions requiring similar quantities of irrigation water (based on

    soil properties or plant requirements) clustered together.

    Delineation

    of

    irrigation

    management

    zones

    has

    been

    accomplished through measurement of soil properties at

    different locations within the area under irrigation to generate

    databases that are used to determine location-speciﬁc irrigation

    settings (Hedley C. B. and Yule I. J., 2009; Chávez et al., 2009;

    Moral et al., 2010; Nahry et al., 2011; Liakos et al., 2015; Boluwade

    et al., 2016). Aggregation of on-site sensor measurements with

    satellite data to develop decision support and zone management

    systems for use in precision irrigation control is described by

    multiple researchers as well (Zhang et al., 2009; Jiang et al., 2011;

    De Benedetto et al., 2013a; Barker et al., 2018).

    Variable

    approaches

    relying

    on

    result

    in

    generation

    of

    applications. Such approaches, however, fail to respond to the

    dynamics of plant water requirements. Recent approaches

    incorporate plant-based measurements to dynamically update

    zoning maps generated from soil properties. O’Shaughnessy et al.

    use real-time plant water stress readings taken during irrigation

    events to dynamically update the zoning maps used for precision

    irrigation

    control

    (O’Shaughnessy

    et

    al.,

    2012a).

    In

    Goumopoulos et al., a wireless sensor network integrating

    measurements from soil, plant, and atmosphere is applied in

    generation of irrigation management zones and used for control

    of a wireless actuator network for precision irrigation within a

    greenhouse (Goumopoulos et al., 2014).

    3.3.2 Agricultural robots

    Introduction of robotic agents in automation of irrigation

    water delivery is an emerging area of research interest. With

    appropriate path planning and ﬁeld preparation, greater

    ﬂexibility in geographical location of irrigation heads is

    achievable, and the role of such robots is easily expandable to

    include multiple functions, such as sensing of soil and plant

    characteristics, collection of samples, and delivery of agricultural

    chemicals. Jafari et al. introduce an autonomously guided vehicle

    for relocation of sprinkler heads within an irrigated ﬁeld (Jafari

    et al., 2013). The replacement of manual labour with robotic

    actuation improves on accuracy and speed of irrigation, as well as

    minimizes wastage of water. Gealy et al. develop a hand-held

    robotic device used for ﬁne-tuning emitter settings in a modiﬁed

    drip irrigation system (Gealy et al., 2016). Water delivery can be

    set to match individual plant requirements by adjustment of ﬂow

    settings at each emitter. Thayer et al. introduce a routing

    algorithm to allow a similar robotic device for precision

    adjustment of emitter settings to operate autonomously within

    a vineyard (Thayer et al., 2018). Developments in collaborative

    robotics provide further opportunities for integration of robotic

    actuation in precision irrigation. Dusadeerungsikul et al.

    (Dusadeerungsikul et al., 2019) discuss the development of a

    collaborative control protocol which integrates robotic agents

    into a smart greenhouse to create a cyber-physical system that

    includes human and robotic agents. The described system

    primarily

    serves

    a

    monitoring

    and

    detection

    role

    with

    response provided by human operators. The system however

    is an indicator of the potential application of collaborative robots

    in a precision irrigation scenario, whether in sensing or actuation.

    Current research involving collaborating robotic ﬂeets,

    otherwise described as swarm robotics, is an emerging area of

    interest that could further inﬂuence future developments in

    precision irrigation control. The scalability, ﬂexibility, and

    robustness in solution of complex tasks could be employed in

    tailoring precision control decisions to allow more individually

    adapted irrigation on larger scale (Albani et al., 2017). This is

    facilitated by having specialized functions distributed among a

    larger number of robots, which can then be deployed as and when

    needed with coordinated communication (Emmi et al., 2014). Of

    particular interest are swarms composed of aerial and ground

    robots, which could integrate airborne sensing capabilities with

    ground-based application tasks, allowing real-time, closed-loop

    precision irrigation control (Grassi et al., 2017; Vu et al., 2017;

    Potena et al., 2019).

    4 Challenges and opportunities

    Irrigation

    control

    has

    primarily

    been

    targeted

    at

    minimization of water consumption at the expense of yield, or

    maximization of yield at the expense of water consumption.

    Research on the effect of targeted water stress during speciﬁc

    growth periods however indicates that it is possible to achieve

    equivalent

    or

    even

    greater

    yield

    while

    reducing

    water

    consumption

    through

    strategic

    alternation

    of

    moderate

    drought stress and recovery periods (Blum et al., 1990; Cui

    et al., 2009; Niu et al., 2018). With the ongoing depletion of

    global freshwater supplies, minimization of water consumption

    will remain an overarching target of precision irrigation, with

    advancements in technology increasingly targeting more efﬁcient

    use of every applied drop of water. An emerging Frontier that

    presents interesting research questions is the individualized

    direct control of plant growth and development by targeted

    application of environmental stresses, such as is accomplished

    through deﬁcit irrigation. This has been suggested in various

    research works (Hunt and Nicholls, 1986; Kang and Wang, 2017;

    Sánchez-Blanco et al., 2019). Kögler and Söffker compare such

    targeted growth control based on precise irrigation sequencing to

    sports training (Kögler and Söffker, 2020). Development of more

    Frontiers in Control Engineering

    Owino and Söffker

    10.3389/fcteg.2022.982463

    efﬁcient precision irrigation technology and more accurate

    models representing the complex relationship between plant

    growth and irrigation water supply is necessary to achieve

    this. More direct targeting of irrigation application to the

    speciﬁc plants that require it, with quantity and timing

    selected to just avoid the region of drought stress within

    which physiological damage or yield reduction occurs, could

    result in signiﬁcant water savings and more reliable projection of

    irrigation water use throughout the growing season.

    Integration of networking and remote access into precision

    irrigation solutions has led to a new set of challenges related to

    data security. Wireless sensor networks, Internet-of-Things

    enabled devices, and cloud-based systems can be particularly

    vulnerable to cyber security threats such as distributed denial of

    service (DDoS) attacks, integration into malicious botnets

    (Antonakakis et al., 2017) and exploitation by ransomware

    creators. This creates an additional layer of considerations to

    be included in design of precision irrigation control systems.

    Legal challenges stemming from ambiguity in regulatory

    frameworks governing implementation of new technology

    could be a setback in some precision irrigation applications,

    such as those involving robotic actors and artiﬁcial intelligence.

    Progress has been made in enacting legislation to govern

    operation of unmanned aerial vehicles within the European

    Union

    (European

    Commission,

    Directorate-General

    for

    Mobility

    and

    Transport,

    2019a;

    European

    Commission,

    Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport, 2019b). Social

    and ethical issues stemming from implementation of artiﬁcial

    intelligence and autonomous robotic agents are also a cause of

    concern,

    with

    questions

    arising

    regarding

    data

    privacy,

    accountability in decisions involving human interaction and

    accessibility of criteria applied in decision-making (Müller,

    2020).

    Despite existing challenges, a wealth of opportunities

    abounds in precision irrigation research and implementation.

    Recent advances in high resolution remote sensing technology

    could also play an important role in precision irrigation. In

    particular, the use of satellite data to infer soil moisture is

    particularly practicable in introduction of precision irrigation

    principles in decision support systems for large scale irrigation

    platforms. Termite et al. apply machine learning techniques to

    infer soil moisture status from satellite imagery, providing crucial

    information for irrigation management at a municipality level

    (Termite et al., 2019).

    Further opportunities exist in application of cloud-based data

    storage and processing, allowing for reduction in setup and

    FIGURE 1

    Agriculture 4.0- The future of precision irrigation control, with cloud-based
    data storage and processing, real-time communication between

    plant-based sensors, intelligent agents (including robots), supported by weather
    data and market analytics.

    operational costs through remote sharing of data and processing

    power. Enhanced accumulation of soil, plant, and environmental

    data facilitated by networked devices expands available agricultural

    data from which new models and control approaches can be

    generated and tested. On the actuation front, assistive technologies

    such as subsurface water retention technology (SWRT) (Roy et al.,

    2019), which uses an impermeable membrane to extend the

    duration of water availability to plants, could be integrated into

    precision irrigation scheduling approaches.

    What then, does the future hold for precision irrigation

    control? The incorporation of elements of Industry 4.0 in

    agricultural applications (also referred to as Agriculture 4.0)

    provides a guiding framework (see Figure 1). Plant-level

    sensors would give individual plants or plant monitoring units

    the ability to communicate their needs in real time. This

    information would be collected and processed in real time in

    an interconnected network of devices and agents. Artiﬁcial

    intelligence would then interpret the collected data and

    combine

    it

    with

    accurate,

    dynamic

    growth

    models

    encompassing speciﬁc scenarios with regard to exactly how

    much water should be consumed during the entire growth

    season, what yield is to be produced from each sector, by

    which

    date

    the

    crops

    should

    be

    arriving

    at

    speciﬁc

    developmental stages (including targeted harvest dates), and

    employing

    additional

    soil-speciﬁc

    and

    weather-speciﬁc

    information to tailor the prescription to each ﬁeld, growing

    season, and set of user preferences. A robust, adaptable

    controller would then generate a database containing the

    speciﬁc irrigation needs of each individual, and delivery of

    water would be implemented by opening of irrigation valves

    at the individual plant level, activated either remotely from a

    cloud-connected platform, or on site by swarms of mobile robots,

    each responsible for speciﬁc zones within the ﬁeld. After all, the

    best-placed entity to answer the question “how much water is too

    much water” is the individual plant, communicating its needs in

    real time and determining when it wishes to be watered, how

    much water it requires, and how much thirst it can take before

    compromising the ﬁnal expected yield.

    Abstract: Wireless technologies are increasingly used in industrial applications.
    These technologies

    reduce cabling, which is costly and troublesome, and introduce several beneﬁts
    for their application in

    terms of ﬂexibility to modify the layout of the nodes and scaling of the number
    of connected devices.

    They may also introduce new functionalities since they ease the connections to
    mobile devices or

    parts. Although they have some drawbacks, they are increasingly accepted in industrial
    applications,

    especially for monitoring and supervision tasks. Recently, they are starting to
    be accepted even for

    time-critical tasks, for example, in closed-loop control systems involving slow
    dynamic processes.

    However, wireless technologies have been evolving very quickly during the last
    few years, since

    several relevant technologies are available in the market. For this reason, it
    may become difﬁcult to

    select the best alternative. This perspective article intends to guide application
    designers to choose the

    most appropriate technology in each case. For this purpose, this article discusses
    the most relevant

    wireless technologies in the industry and shows different examples of applications.

    Keywords: industrial Internet of Things (IIoT); wireless control systems; wireless
    sensor networks

    (WSNs); Industry 4.0; cyber–physical systems (CPS)

    1. Introduction

    The fourth industrial revolution, commonly known as Industry 4.0, introduces new

    concepts that enforce connectivity, such as cyber–physical systems (CPS), the
    Internet

    of Things (IoT), and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) [1]. These concepts are aimed
    to

    improve productivity and efﬁciency in manufacturing processes by connecting sensors,

    actuators, and controllers, boosting the economy as a result [2,3]. Communication
    tech-

    nologies are becoming key enablers in smart manufacturing processes since they
    ease

    integration between cyber–physical production systems (CPPS), which are at the
    core of

    Industry 4.0. In this scenario, communication technologies are evolving quite
    rapidly to be

    able to satisfy the quality-of-service (QoS) needs of modern applications. These
    technolo-

    gies are typically used in industrial applications for diverse tasks that involve
    monitoring,

    predictive maintenance, supervision, and control operations.

    Currently, wired solutions prevail in industrial domains. This is mainly because

    several standards have reached a high degree of maturity. Some of them are based
    on

    industrial Ethernet standards, such as Proﬁnet, Ethernet/IP, or EtherCAT. In fact,
    it is still

    common to ﬁnd even older digital buses in use, such as Proﬁbus, CANbus, or Modbus.

    These mature technologies are frequently considered safe and reliable, which are
    key issues

    in some conservative industrial domains [4]. Wired technologies will clearly remain
    in use

    in the future, especially in critical operations, such as closed-loop control
    over fast dynamic

    processes. However, wired solutions have several drawbacks: Cabling is expensive
    and

    difﬁcult to deploy, it produces not very ﬂexible layouts, and it is complex to
    use with

    mobile devices or parts. Unfortunately, these drawbacks introduce some limitations
    in

    applications using wired solutions.

    In this scenario, wireless technologies enhance the interconnection capabilities
    at smart

    factories, thus allowing fully intelligent manufacturing systems [5,6]. Their
    use may achieve

    several beneﬁts: (1) introducing higher ﬂexibility to modify the layout of the
    links, which

    eases the deployment of the nodes and improves scalability; (2) enhancing the
    connectivity

    between decision-taking nodes and mobile devices or parts; and (3) eliminating
    wires,

    which reduces the deployment cost. Wireless technologies are becoming key enablers
    in

    different domains of the industry and, consequently, becoming increasingly relevant
    in

    academia. In fact, during the last few years, their use has remarkably grown in
    industrial

    environments. This trend is expected to follow during the next several years.
    A case in

    point is the estimated number of connected devices worldwide in 2021, which was
    around

    11.3 billion. This number is expected to reach 29.4 billion devices by 2030 [7].

    However, wireless technologies have also some drawbacks that reduce their pre-

    dictability and augment their error rate. The nature of wave propagation may cause
    diverse

    phenomena that reduce the quality of service (QoS) of wireless applications. The
    most rele-

    vant of these are fading, multipath propagation, shadowing, and interferences
    [8]. These

    phenomena have an impact on the reliability, integrity, and security of communication

    links when compared with wired communications. As a result, the bit-error rate
    increases,

    which may cause uncertainty in the applications.

    The introduction of wireless technologies in industrial facilities must face additional

    challenges. On the one hand, many industrial applications require deterministic
    communi-

    cation links in order to be accepted. Certain QoS parameters, such as the latency,
    jitter, and

    error rate, must be bounded. On the other hand, they must operate in environments
    full of

    metallic surfaces that may hinder wave propagation. This fact may cause difﬁculties
    given

    the strict requirements in critical applications.

    Currently, wireless technologies are frequently accepted in the industry for non-critical

    applications, i.e., those that involve monitoring, alerting, or data-logging tasks.
    In these

    cases, application failures do not have severe safety implications or do not produce
    large

    economic losses. However, the use of these technologies in critical applications
    is still

    under scrutiny. In fact, this is an interesting research topic that involves the
    mitigation of

    the inﬂuence of interferences, some of them caused by different technologies,
    handling the

    frequency spectrum adequately, and resolving collisions.

    To date, no wireless technology has been developed to be valid for all applications.
    On

    the contrary, different protocols were created over the years aiming to address
    speciﬁc sce-

    narios. Currently, several WSN standards are available. Some of them are general-purpose

    standards that are being applied in industrial applications. Others have been
    speciﬁ-

    cally designed for industrial applications by adapting standards such as IEEE
    802.15.1 [9]

    and, predominantly, IEEE 802.15.4 [10]. In fact, these standards have become the
    basis

    of many wireless technologies used at industrial factories for process automation.
    Thus,

    IEEE 802.15.4 is the foundational stone for some standards such as ZigBee, WirelessHART,

    ISA100.11a, or WIA-PA, whereas IEEE 802.15.1 is the base technology of WISA and
    WSAN-

    FA. All these technologies can coexist in the spectrum space but cannot be easily
    intercon-

    nected, so the problem of heterogeneity still persists. Moreover, most of these
    technologies,

    e.g., conventional WiFi, operate at the industrial, scientiﬁc, and medical (ISM)
    radio bands,

    in particular at the 2.4 GHz band, which may become saturated. Thus, interferences
    among

    different technologies are difﬁcult to avoid.

    This perspective article aims to present an overview of the most relevant technologies

    currently found in industrial WSN systems. It recaps the major characteristic
    of each

    technology, discusses their application domains, and shows some implementation
    examples.

    Thus, the authors intend to clarify the potential use of WSN technologies in industrial

    scenarios and guide application designers to select the most appropriate technology
    in each

    case. The layout of this brief perspective article is as follows: Section 2 presents
    a short

    overview of different IWSN technologies, including some implementation examples
    and

    domains. Finally, Section 3 draws some conclusions.

    2. State of the Art

    Industrial applications can be divided into six different classes depending on
    their

    requirements. Table 1 shows the classiﬁcation proposed by the ISA100 committee
    [11].

    These classes range from critical safety and control applications, which must
    satisfy very

    strict requirements in terms of latency, reliability, timing, and jitter, to monitoring
    applica-

    tions, in which failures have a limited impact. Table 1 also includes the typical
    accepted

    values for latency and packet loss probability [12], as well as some application
    examples.

    The most critical class involves safety applications, with strict requirements
    in terms of

    determinism, reliability, and data integrity. In these applications, latencies
    may reach values

    of up to 10 ms. Closed-loop regulatory control applications also have strong requirements,

    and the accepted latency values depend on the controlled process dynamics. Classes
    2

    to 5 have more relaxed requirements, due to their non-critical nature. Currently,
    wireless

    technologies are frequently accepted in non-critical operations, which typically
    involve

    monitoring, alerting, supervisory control, and data-logging tasks. In those applications,
    fail-

    ures do not produce severe consequences or economic losses. Thus, the most problematic

    applications for wireless technologies involve feedback control and safety operations
    [4].

    Wireless technologies are starting to be accepted in some closed-loop operations,
    notably

    in slow dynamics plants, in which the QoS provided by the WSN is able to ensure
    the

    required rate. Some application examples may be found in chemical, pulp and paper,
    or

    oil and gas industries [13]. These domains are especially suitable for wireless
    technologies

    due to the large areas covered, and the difﬁculties, costs, and safety problems
    that wiring

    may introduce.

    2.1. WiFi

    WiFi, the IEEE 802.11 standard, has come a long way since it was originally deﬁned
    in

    1997. There have been several reviews improving its behavior. IEEE 802.11b was
    the ﬁrst

    version massively adopted, after polishing the details of previous versions. Since
    then, WiFi

    has become a very common wireless technology in general-purpose systems. However,

    some characteristics of the standard, mainly the non-determinism caused by the
    MAC

    policies, make it not suitable for some industrial applications. Often, WiFi has
    been used as

    Energies 2023, 16, 1349

    4 of 13

    a gateway between wired or wireless LANs, and the Internet in industrial automation
    [14].

    Initially, WiFi was deployed over the 2.4 GHz ISM band. More recently, the 5 GHz
    band

    has been included. This approach may reduce interference problems between WiFi
    and

    other technologies that employ the overpopulated 2.4 GHz band. One of the disadvantages

    of WiFi, when compared to other wireless technologies, is power consumption. As
    a result,

    WiFi devices provide a shorter battery life than other technologies.

    The IEEE 802.11ax standard, commercially known as WiFi6, increments the scala-

    bility of the nodes connected to one access point. The use of some technologies,
    e.g.,

    orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA), multiple-user multiple-input

    multiple-output (MU-MIMO), or spatial frequency reuse, may help to deploy a high
    density

    of nodes avoiding collisions. WiFi6 claims a latency of 10 ms, which may be adequate
    for

    some industrial applications. WiFi6 may reach a data rate of up to 9.6 Gbps. This
    data rate

    can only be compared with the latest technologies, such as 5G networks.

    WiFi HaLow, or WiFi 802.11ah, follows a different approach. This technology seeks

    to adapt WiFi to the requirements of IoT systems. The coverage range is increased
    to

    around 1 km [15], the power for transmission is reduced, making it more suitable
    for

    battery-powered devices, and it is less affected by physical obstacles [16]. This
    is because it

    uses sub-GHz frequencies. However, WiFi HaLow presents some drawbacks: the data
    rate

    is lower than conventional WiFi, and it is not able to solve the problems of determinism

    and latency of WiFi.

    Since WiFi is widely spread, there have been interesting initiatives to develop
    WSN

    systems with real-time requirements. For example, Banz et al. (2020) [17] presented
    some

    amendments in the data link layer to allow control applications that require a
    data sample

    of up to 1 kHz. The authors tested their approach with a balancing robot as hardware

    in the loop. In [18], a similar approach was used. In this case, a sampling rate
    of 1 kHz

    was required by using advanced control techniques over a real Segway-type balancing

    robot. In the near future, the introduction of new technologies, such as WiFi6,
    may become

    a real alternative for time-critical control applications in industries. There
    are several

    monitoring and supervision use cases in the literature. For example, in [19],
    a scalable

    IoT architecture was presented based on the edge–fog–cloud paradigm for monitoring
    the

    Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) combining the use of MQTT over WiFi. The authors

    of [20] implemented a WiFi HaLow network-based information system for scenario-speciﬁc

    multi-sided applications for the coordination, documentation, and surveillance
    of rescue

    forces in mass casualty incidents.

    2.2. ZigBee

    ZigBee is a technology based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, which is used for
    low-

    energy communications with a low transmission rate [21]. It was developed in 2004
    by

    the ZigBee Alliance, now inside the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA). IEEE
    802.15.4

    deﬁnes the physical and MAC layers, whereas the network and application layers
    are

    deﬁned by the Alliance. It supports star, tree, and mesh topologies. The mesh
    topology

    tends to be the most used since the availability of redundant paths improves reliability.
    The

    star topology, on the other hand, reduces the latency and is the most adequate
    for achieving

    tight industrial requirements. ZigBee is conformed by three types of devices:

    •

    One coordinator per network that initializes, maintains, and manages the network;

    •

    Routers, which can ﬁnd paths for the messages from one node to another;

    •

    End devices, which are normally battery-powered. They collect and transmit data

    from sensors and may sleep and wake up to extend their battery life.

    ZigBee implements self-healing mechanisms in case of lost or changed status of
    node

    links. However, it does not implement any system to replace the coordinator in
    case of

    failure, with this node thus becoming a single-point failure [22]. In theory,
    ZigBee supports

    up to 65,000 nodes per network, but frequently, this number is more limited. The
    maximum

    distance between devices can reach 50 m. However, larger distances may be covered
    by

    hopping between the nodes.

    Energies 2023, 16, 1349

    5 of 13

    ZigBee has become a widely used technology in several domains, such as home

    automation. The major reason behind its popularity is its low cost. In fact, it
    is an open

    standard protocol without licensing fees for manufacturers. However, ZigBee is
    less

    capable of meeting the industrial requirements of deterministic latency and reliability.
    That

    makes ZigBee adequate for less critical tasks, such as monitoring and data acquisition,

    and, therefore, less suitable for security tasks. An important characteristic
    of ZigBee is that

    supports 868 MHz and 915 MHz radio bands, in addition to the 2.4 GHz band; therefore,
    it

    can help to avoid using the saturated 2.4 GHz band. This characteristic is important
    since

    ZigBee is a low-energy technology, and consequently, it is more inﬂuenced by networks

    such as WiFi.

    Common applications of ZigBee networks involve monitoring and data acquisition

    tasks. For example, in [23], the authors used a ZigBee network to monitor an industrial

    motor and predict maintenance needs using fuzzy logic. In [24], artiﬁcial intelligence
    was

    combined with a ZigBee network to reduce costs and energy consumption in a warehouse.

    There are efforts to implement control tasks using ZigBee networks, but they need
    to ﬁnd a

    solution in case of Qby oS degradation. This question has been tackled in different
    ways.

    For example, in [25], a two-level control scheme was presented. The highest level
    executes

    sophisticated algorithms, and in case of QoS degradation, the control tasks are
    shifted

    to edge devices with lower computing resources. This approach, tested over a robotic

    arm, avoids the system from becoming uncontrolled. This article proposes the use
    of the

    900 MHz radio band to avoid collisions between the ZigBee and 2.4 GH WiFi technologies.

    In [26], authors proposed a redundant wireless network based on ZigBee and WiFi
    to make

    the ship course-keeping control with a robust PID. Their approach adds compensation

    control of time delay and packet loss. Other attempts try to achieve higher determinism.

    For example, in [27], time-division multiple access (TDMA) policies were implemented

    according to a static schedule. They were applied in a high-precision, micro-positioning

    application with a piezoelectric actuator (PEA).

    An alternative to ZigBee is Z-Wave. This technology is similar to ZigBee. However,

    Z-Wave is a proprietary technology, provided by Silicon Labs. Although ZigBee
    is more

    common in industrial applications, the main advantages of Z-Wave result from its
    pro-

    prietary nature. The compatibility between devices is guaranteed. Z-Wave also
    provides

    better security mechanisms [28]. An example of Z-Wave use can be observed in [29],
    where

    a Z-Wave network is implemented to achieve real-time control in a smart home.

    2.3. WirelessHART

    WirelessHART is also based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. However, WirelessHART

    is used for building reliable and secure wireless network systems in industrial
    appli-

    cations [10,30]. It was introduced by HART Communication Foundation in 2007. The

    physical OSI layer is based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, but WirelessHART speciﬁes

    the data, network, transport, and application layers. Transport and application
    layers are

    compatible between WirelessHART and the rest of the HART protocols. All devices
    are

    time-synchronized and communicate in pre-scheduled, ﬁxed time slots. This is achieved

    because this technology implements a TDMA network. The use of TDMA reduces colli-

    sions and saves power consumption in the devices. WirelessHART operates in the
    ISM

    2.4 GHz band. It implements some mechanisms to coexist in this band, such as Frequency

    Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) which changes between channels avoiding interferences.

    WirelessHART allows for the use of star and mesh topologies, but star topology
    is not rec-

    ommended. One of the main advantages of WirelessHART is its low energy consumption.

    Battery-operated devices can reach a battery life of up to 10 years with sampling
    periods

    between 4 and 8 s [31]. All devices have routing capabilities. There are six types
    of devices

    in WirelessHART:

    •

    Field devices are connected to the sensors and actuators of the processes;

    Energies 2023, 16, 1349

    6 of 13

    •

    Router devices are not directly connected to the process. They only have communica-

    tion functionalities and are especially useful when the networks need to be improved

    or extended;

    •

    Adapter devices connect wired HART devices to wireless networks;

    •

    Handheld devices are used for installation, diagnosis, and maintenance operations;

    •

    Gateway devices connect the networks to the plant automation host. They translate

    among different protocols;

    •

    The network manager is responsible for managing the wireless network. This includes

    the following tasks: scheduling, network path conﬁguration, and reconﬁgurations.

    Only one node per network can be active as a network manager, but this technology

    allows a backup manager to take over in case of failures.

    WirelessHART also introduces several layers of protection. All trafﬁc is secured,
    and

    the payload is encrypted. All devices need a secret join key and a network ID
    in order to

    join the network.

    Previous characteristics make WirelessHART able to perform critical control tasks
    in slow

    dynamic processes. For example, in [32], a co-designed dynamic PIDPlus controller
    over

    the WirelessHART network was presented for the closed-loop control of slow-temperature

    processes. This work achieved the major requirements for industrial wireless control.
    In [33],

    WirelessHART was used to implement temperature control and device diagnostics.

    2.4. ISA 100.11a

    The International Society for Automation (ISA) proposed the ISA 100.11a standard
    in

    2007. This standard introduces a wireless low-bit rate, low-power technology designed
    for

    different tasks such as non-critical monitoring, alerting, supervisory control,
    and open- and

    closed-loop control applications [11]. The ISA 100.11a standard addresses the
    performance

    needs of those applications for latencies on the order of 100 ms. It uses the
    IEEE 802.15.4

    physical layer over the 2.4 GHz band and has a low data link layer. The MAC access

    is provided by means of TDMA, although it can also be implemented with CSMA-CA.

    For avoiding collisions in the 2.4 GHz band, it implements diverse mechanisms
    [34]. (1)

    Clear channel assessment (CCA): The device that initiates transmission checks
    whether

    the channel is busy and cancels the transmission when it is found busy; (2) spectrum

    management functionality: This mechanism limits the number of used channels to
    a subset

    of the available ones; (3) adaptive channel hopping: Devices autonomously avoid
    channels

    with a poor history of connectivity. The ISA 100.11a standard allows for the use
    of star and

    mesh topologies. There are different types of devices in the ISA 100.11a standard:

    •

    Routing end devices are the I/O devices, connected to the sensors and actuators,
    with

    routing capabilities;

    •

    Non-routing end devices are also I/O devices, but they lack routing capabilities;

    •

    Backbone routers are responsible for routing data packets from one subnet over
    the

    backbone network to its destination, which can be another subnet or the gateway;

    •

    Handheld devices are used for installation, diagnosis, and maintenance operations;

    •

    System manager, which is the administrator of the network responsible for the
    con-

    ﬁguration of the communication (e.g., resource allocation and scheduling), device

    management, and run-time control of the network;

    •

    Gateway, which acts as an interface between the ﬁeld network and the plant network

    (and control host applications);

    •

    Security manager, which is responsible for managing the security policy of the
    applications.

    The ISA 100.11a standard is designed for non-critical tasks. In fact, it can be
    introduced

    in control loops that involve slow dynamic processes. For example, in [35], the
    authors

    used the ISA 100.11a standard to control a tank level with a wireless control
    loop and a PID.

    The authors evaluated the performance of the standard, which can also provide
    wireless

    communications in harsh environments due to its robustness. In [36], a slightly
    modi-

    ﬁed version of the ISA 100.11a standard was used for communication tasks in a
    satellite,

    considerably reducing the wiring weight, which is a key limiting factor in satellite
    designs.

    2.5. WIA

    Wireless network for industry automation (WIA) includes three different standards
    [37]:

    The ﬁrst of them is WIA-PA for process automation, the second is called WIA-FA
    factory

    automation, and lastly, WIA-NR, which stands for new radio. Every standard combines
    dif-

    ferent technologies. WIA-PA implements the IEEE802.15.4 physical layer over the
    2.4 GHz

    band. The data link, network, and application layers are speciﬁcally deﬁned by
    the WIA

    standard. WIA-FA adopts the IEEE 802.11 physical layer, whereas the data link
    and ap-

    plication layers are deﬁned by the WIA standard. WIA-NR uses the physical layer
    and

    medium-access control sublayer of 5G and deﬁnes the application layer. Every standard

    adopts different topologies: WIA-PA supports star or hierarchical star–mesh topologies;

    WIA-FA implements a redundant star topology; and WIA-NR uses a hierarchical star

    topology that supports device-to-device (D2D) and coordinated multi-point (CoMP)
    com-

    munication. WIA introduces different methods to avoid collisions, such as multi-channel

    access, adaptive frequency hopping, and time synchronization schemes. In the application

    layer, WIA facilitates interconnection with other industrial communication technologies.

    The standard deﬁnes different types of devices:

    •

    Field devices are connected to the ﬁeld I/O devices, such as sensors and actuators;

    •

    Routing devices, access devices, and base stations (PA, FA, and NR, respectively),

    which are responsible for connecting ﬁeld devices with gateways;

    •

    Gateways provide a connection between the hosts and WIA networks. A redundant

    backup gateway can be added to increase the system’s robustness;

    •

    Handheld devices enable connection with the routing devices for installation,
    diagno-

    sis, and maintenance operations.

    Several works analyze the application of diverse WIA variants in process and factory

    automation tasks. An example of its implementation for factory automation is shown

    in [38], where a 1000-node plant was simulated, proving that WIA-FA is able to
    meet

    strict requirements in terms of reliability and timeliness in a large plant. In
    [39], the

    authors implemented a WIA-PA network for monitoring different processes. The WIA-NR

    technology proved to be able to meet high industrial requirements, with low latencies
    and

    reliability, as shown in [40].

    2.6. LPWAN

    Low-power, wide-area networks (LPWANs) are wireless networks that are used for

    long-range communications. They can be used to create networks that cover large
    areas,

    enabling IoT networks in large scales such as cities, rural environments, or agricultural

    ﬁelds. Due to the nature of the environments and devices, battery-powered devices
    are

    often used. The use of low-power communications increases the autonomy of the
    batteries,

    reaching years of battery life, since low-power, low-bit rates reduce consumption.
    This

    limitation makes them unsuitable for sending large volumes of data, but they are
    adequate

    for transmitting small volumes, such as the magnitudes captured with sensors or
    commands

    sent to actuators. Therefore, the main objectives of LPWANs are to achieve (1)
    long-range,

    (2) low-power, and (3) low-cost communications. Within the LPWAN communications,

    several speciﬁcations may be found. Below the most relevant ones are introduced,
    with

    special emphasis on LoRa, which is shown as an example of these technologies.

    LoRa is a type of LPWAN communication technology aimed to provide connectivity

    of battery-operated devices over a long-range, wide area [41]. In fact, LoRa stands
    for long

    range. Its physical layer is based on a proprietary spread spectrum modulation
    algorithm.

    LoRa uses different frequency bands depending on the region; for example, in Europe,

    LoRa is deployed over the 863-873 MHz band. The range that this technology covers

    varies depending on the terrain obstacles. For example, it typically reaches a
    5 km range

    in urban environments, but in more open environments, LoRa can achieve a range
    of

    more than 15 km. LoRa transmissions have very low power consumption, making this

    technology adequate for battery-powered devices. LoRa only deﬁnes the physical
    layer,

    whereas the data link and network layers are covered by LoRaWAN (long-range, wide-area

    Energies 2023, 16, 1349

    8 of 13

    network) [42]. LoRaWAN was deﬁned by the LoRa Alliance in 2015. It is a low-transmission

    rate technology able to achieve data rates between 0.3 kbit/s and 27 kbit/s. Three
    types of

    devices are deﬁned:

    •

    Class A devices are most of the time idle. Typically, these devices wake up when
    an

    event occurs, such as when a timer expires or a monitoring variable passes a threshold.

    Then, class A devices initiate the transmission and listen for a response. If
    nothing is

    received, devices go back to the idle status for a brief time interval and listen
    a second

    time for a response. If during this time, the devices do not receive any message,
    they

    go back to sleep until the next event occurs. There is no way to wake up externally
    an

    end device. These devices are only suitable for connecting sensors but not actuators.

    All LoRa devices must support the class A mode of operation.

    •

    Class B devices look for transmission windows in ﬁxed, synchronized, and regularly

    scheduled time intervals. They can also transmit deﬁned events since they implement

    class A behavior. These devices are suitable for carrying out periodic operations
    with

    both sensors and actuators.

    •

    Class C devices are always listening to messages unless they are sending data.
    For

    that reason, they have lower latency than all the LoRa class devices. Class C
    devices

    implement two receive windows as class A devices, but they never close the second

    window until the next transmission is sent. Therefore, they can receive a message
    at

    almost any moment. They are suitable for connecting sensors and actuators. As
    Class

    C devices must be operative all the time, they do not typically operate with batteries,

    but they must be connected to power all the time.

    LoRa networks consist of different devices, all of them providing unique identiﬁers.

    End devices are typically used to connect sensors or actuators. Gateways are used
    to

    bridge between LoRa networks and higher bandwidth networks such as WiFi, Ethernet
    of

    3G/4G/5G, or other IP-supported technologies. Multiple gateways can be connected
    in the

    same network, reducing the error rate. Finally, network servers manage the entire
    network,

    including the application and join servers. The joint servers allow the secure
    joining of

    the devices, as well as handling, managing, and interpreting the application data
    captured

    from the sensors. LoRa introduces several spreading factors to avoid collisions
    so that they

    appear as noise to one another. If packets have the same spreading factor, collisions
    can

    occur, but if one of the signals is 6 db stronger than the other, the stronger
    signal will prevail.

    The adaptive data rate (ADR) is essential to successfully implement LoRaWAN networks.

    The closest nodes to the gateway use a lower spread factor to reduce the transmission
    time.

    LoRa is suitable for long-range, low-energy communications, though the transmission

    speed is low. These characteristics make LoRa difﬁcult to use in closed-loop control

    applications. Use cases tend to address automation for devices distributed in
    wide areas.

    For example, Sánchez Sutil (2020) [43] developed a smart public lighting control,
    while

    Usmonov (2017) [44], the authors implemented a LoRa-based wireless control for
    a drip

    irrigation system, and in [45], an IoT multi-sensory platform was presented for
    agriculture

    monitoring and pump control. Due to the low cost and range capabilities of LoRa,
    there

    are attempts to modify it to make LoRa closer to industrial requirements. As an
    example,

    Fahmida (2022) [46] developed a real-time scheduling framework (RTPL) for LoRa
    to

    enable industrial automation. Their results showed that RTPL achieved, on average,
    a 75%

    improvement in real-time performance.

    There are other LPWAN speciﬁcations. The most important ones, along with LoRa,

    are Sigfox, NB-IoT, and LTE-M. Sigfox is developed by a French network global
    operator

    company of the same name. It uses the 868 MHz band in Europe and the 902 MHz band
    in

    the US. The use of ultra-narrowband allows low-energy communication that may cover

    large areas, with a maximum range of 30–50 km in rural areas. Its main characteristics
    are

    the use of differential binary phase-shift keying (DBPSK) and Gaussian frequency-shift

    keying (GFSK) and a one-hop star topology [47]. Sigfox operates with a closed
    IoT solution,

    but the chipset speciﬁcation is open to manufacturers. NB-IoT is a proprietary
    technology

    developed by 3GPP. NB-IoT focuses on indoor coverage. It uses a subset of the
    LTE standard

    Energies 2023, 16, 1349

    9 of 13

    but limits the bandwidth to a 200 kHz band [48]. Finally, LTE-M, also developed
    by 3GPP,

    relies on LTE machine-to-machine communications. The advantages of LTE-M over
    NB-IoT

    include its higher data rate, up to 1 Mbps [49], and better mobility, although
    it requires

    more bandwidth and is more costly. Both NB-IoT and LTE-M are still under development

    and are scheduled to be upgraded to be capable of achieving URLCC capabilities
    with

    the release-14 version [50]. Therefore, these technologies have the potential
    to be used in

    wireless networking if these objectives are fulﬁlled.

    2.7. BLE

    BLE was deﬁned in 2010 as part of the Bluetooth 4.0 speciﬁcation. BLE is a short-range,

    low-energy communication technology. Even though Bluetooth was initially conceived

    as a star topology, BLE stacks can be modiﬁed to support mesh topologies. Thus,
    the

    layers above the network layer must be changed to support BLE mesh [51,52]. The
    BLE

    physical layer has 40 channels on the ISM 2.4 GHz band. Three of them (channels
    37–39)

    are used as advertising channels (ACs) for device discovery, connection establishment,

    and broadcasting. The remaining 37 channels (0–36) are data channels (DCs), providing

    two-way data transfer. BLE implements the adaptive frequency hopping (AFH) technique

    between DC to minimize the effect of the interferences. The data link layer deﬁnes
    different

    roles for BLE devices. Speciﬁcally, there are three kinds of devices: masters,
    slaves, and

    advertisers. First, a device broadcasts its presence. When a connection is established
    with a

    central device, the central node acts as master and the peripheral device as slave.
    Devices

    can support different roles to create complex topologies. There have been several
    efforts to

    standardize BLE mesh, the most important of which are Bluetooth SIG: Bluetooth
    Smart

    Mesh and IETF: IPv6 over BLE mesh networks. However, the BLE mesh technology is
    not

    considered mature yet.

    Some efforts sought to implement real-time capabilities in BLE mesh networks.
    For

    example, in [53], multi-hop real-time wireless communications were achieved using
    the

    MRT-BLE protocol. Nevertheless, this approach only allows the deﬁnition of the
    topology

    ofﬂine, so there cannot be mobile nodes in the network, which is a clear limitation.
    Some

    implementation examples outside real-time domains can be found. For example, in
    [54], the

    authors used a BLE network to implement a position algorithm along with WiFi to
    make

    more accurate position identiﬁcation and tracking. Another example can be found
    in [55],

    where a BLE mesh was used to make a smart lighting control, extending the coverage
    area

    and increasing its ﬂexibility.

    2.8. 5G

    Cellular networks have come a long way since 1G was launched in the early 1980s
    [56].

    These technologies have evolved over the years, augmenting data transmission rates
    and

    security and reducing their cost. The introduction of 4G, in the 2010s, was an
    important

    achievement since it considerably enhanced the data rate. At the beginning of
    Industry

    4.0, despite its high cost, 4G became an important IoT technology for devices
    with high

    mobility. For example, in logistics, the capabilities of 4G facilitate digitization
    in the industry.

    More recently, in 2019, the ﬁrst commercial 5G networks were deployed. This technology

    promises to revolutionize the wireless communication paradigm, achieving more
    strict QoS

    requirements than actual wireless technologies. Notably, 5G uses a millimetric
    wavelength

    spectrum [57]. As a result, the range is more limited. For that reason, the deployment
    of 5G

    networks is based on a large number of small cellular stations, in contrast to
    the traditional

    large cellular towers, which can slow down its deployment outside urban areas.

    Currently, 5G is not a cost-effective technology for industrial applications.
    However, its

    price is expected to considerably reduce in the near future, thus opening new
    opportunities.

    Some experimental 5G technologies may reach 10 Gb/s transfer speeds. It also provides

    high scalability and massive machine-type communication (mMTC) since it may admit
    up

    to 100 nodes/m2. One of the key characteristics of 5G is that it provides ultra-reliable,
    low-

    latency communication (uRLLC). In fact, it is expected to have a latency value
    below 1 ms

    Energies 2023, 16, 1349

    10 of 13

    and a reliability rate of over 99.999%. If these ﬁgures are achieved, the requirements
    of many

    industrial applications would be satisﬁed. Indeed, it could become an alternative
    in devices

    with high mobility, such as autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs), robots, or logistics.

    Private 5G networks are particularly interesting in industrial applications [58].
    Private

    networks may provide dedicated coverage, which is key to having robust indoor
    networks

    even in remote areas. Furthermore, there is no contention for network resources
    as in public

    networks, adding reliability and robustness to the network. Intrinsic control
    of the network

    can be achieved. This allows the implementation of trafﬁc priorities or security
    policies

    to ensure data. Private networks can be customized to meet the speciﬁc requirements
    of

    diverse applications. All these characteristics make private 5G networks reliable
    and de-

    pendable. It is believed that 5G is going to be implemented in many industrial
    applications

    since 5G characteristics make it adequate to be used in IoT and IIoT applications.
    Many

    domains can beneﬁt from the massive introduction of 5G technologies, such as industrial

    automation (smart factories), automotive industry and smart cars, warehouse operations,

    utilities, industrial remote operation, intelligent transportation (logistics),
    mining operation,

    railway networks, healthcare, or smart grids and smart cities. Notably, 5G can
    be key

    in the achievement of tactile internet [59], becoming the communication technology
    for

    haptic systems. Applications in augmented reality, healthcare monitoring and intervention,

    navigation, and transportation are expected to be developed with this technology
    in the

    not-too-far future.

    Previously, 5G had to overcome some obstacles: Technological maturity, global
    stan-

    dardization, government regulations, and cost are the major concerns for massive
    5G

    adoption. Companies are especially reluctant to change. Signiﬁcant barriers were
    iden-

    tiﬁed such as data security and privacy, lack of standards, and challenges of
    end-to-end

    implementation [60]. The upgrade or replacement of networks to adopt 5G may involve

    design problems, training, and, inevitably higher costs [61].

    Other technologies are also available for WSN, such us RPMA, eMTC, EC-GSM IoT,

    Weightless, DASH7, Wi-Sun, and Matter-or-Thread protocol. However, at the moment,

    they are less common in Industry 4.0 applications.

    3. Conclusions

    Connectivity is a key issue in Industry 4.0 applications since it allows the introduction

    of new key concepts. Today, wired technologies prevail in industrial scenarios,
    and they

    will clearly remain in use in the future, especially in critical applications.
    However, the

    use of wireless networks achieves several beneﬁts when compared to wired technologies:

    They introduce higher ﬂexibility to modify the layout of the links; enhance the
    connectivity

    between taking nodes, sensors, and actuators; and eliminate wires, reducing the
    deploy-

    ment cost. In fact, they introduce new possibilities into Industry 4.0 applications
    since they

    facilitate connection with mobile devices or parts.

    Wireless communication technologies had already found a place in factories for
    non-

    critical operations, such as data acquisition, monitoring, and supervision. Failures
    in these

    tasks do not have severe consequences, which may involve the security of people
    and assets.

    However, the use of these technologies in critical applications, for example,
    in closed-loop

    control operations, is not mature yet. Some application examples may be found,
    especially

    in slow dynamic processes such as those found in the oil, gas, and chemical industries.

    However, this topic is still under research in academia.

    Currently, several protocols are available. Each technology may be valid for different

    scenarios. The development of the newest technologies, such as WiFi6 and 5G, could
    allow

    WSN to compete in performance with traditional wired communications. If they are
    capable

    of delivering such promising specs, the introduction of wireless technologies
    in factories

    may be disruptive. The ﬂexibility and scalability that offer wireless communications
    can

    make the factory evolve into more smart factories, ﬂexible enough to adapt quickly
    to the

    needs and circumstances of different products and productive environments. Nevertheless,

    there are obstacles to overcome. Factories are a really harsh environment for
    wireless

    Energies 2023, 16, 1349

    11 of 13

    technologies, due to several phenomena such as interferences, shadowing, or fading.

    Moreover, the cost of the deployment of these technologies is still high. In the
    short term, it

    is expected that both wired and wireless technologies coexist in factories. In
    the long run, it

    seems clear to the authors that wireless solutions are going to be massively deployed
    in

    the industry.

    This perspective article covered the most relevant technologies for use in industry.
    We

    sought to provide an overview of these technologies and some cases of use to illustrate

    their application in different domains. Thus, this study helps researchers and
    application

    designers to select the most appropriate technology in each case.

    \ Summary \nOver the past decade, the use of demand response and other flexible\
    \ distributed resources for market \nefficiency and grid reliability has grown\
    \ dramatically.  Federal and state policy objectives point to an \nimportant role\
    \ for customers’ loads, generation, and storage in the management of an increasingly\
    \ \nunpredictable power system.  As we consider the need to substantially scale\
    \ the use of flexible distributed \nenergy resources, growing attention has been\
    \ devoted to the need to address not only the economics, but \nalso the control\
    \ system implications to ensure grid reliability.  This has led to a focus on\
    \ an area of \nactivity called “Transactive Energy.”  Transactive energy refers\
    \ to the use of a combination of economic \nand control techniques to improve\
    \ grid reliability and efficiency.  These techniques may also be used to \noptimize\
    \ operations within a customer’s facility. \nThe U.S. Department of Energy has\
    \ supported the GridWise® Architecture Council (“the Council”) in \ndeveloping\
    \ a conceptual framework for developing architectures, and designing solutions\
    \ related to \ntransactive energy.  The goal of this effort is to encourage and\
    \ facilitate collaboration among the many \nstakeholders involved in the transformation\
    \ of the power system and thereby advance the practical \nimplementation of transactive\
    \ energy. \nBuilding on workshops sponsored by the Council in 2011 and 2012, the\
    \ Council began to address the \ntopic of transactive energy in a workshop portion\
    \ of each face-to-face meeting.  This culminated in the \nFirst International\
    \ Conference and Workshop on Transactive Energy held in Portland, Oregon, on May\
    \ 23 \nand 24, 2013.  At the conference the Council announced plans to release\
    \ the first version of a \n“Transactive Energy Framework” document in October\
    \ 2013. \nThe valuable input from industry researchers and practitioners at these\
    \ conferences and workshops \nreinforced to the Council that there was a need\
    \ for the following: \n• clear definitions \n• explanations of technical and economic\
    \ drivers motivating transactive energy \n• addressing of transactive energy from\
    \ multiple perspectives including \n– \nbusiness and policy considerations \n\
    – \nbusiness models \n– \nvalue creation \n• conceptual or reference architectures\
    \ for transactive energy systems \n• identification of the implementation challenges\
    \ of such systems. \nThe Council developed this document to address these needs\
    \ by providing definitions of terms, \narchitectural principles and guidelines,\
    \ and other descriptive elements that present a common ground for \nall interested\
    \ parties to discuss and advance transactive energy. \nThe motivations for transactive\
    \ energy come from the increasing diversity of resources and components \nin the\
    \ electric power system and the inability of existing practices to accommodate\
    \ these changes.  \nExpanded deployment of variable generation on the bulk power\
    \ side, distributed energy resources \nthroughout the system, and new intelligent\
    \ load devices and appliances on the consumption side—all of \nthese necessitate\
    \ new approaches to how electric power is managed and delivered, and in the economic\
    \ \nand business models involved.  Conventional wisdom is that once variable generation\
    \ resources reach \n30%, the current control systems for the grid will be simply\
    \ inadequate [1]. \nPage iii \n \nThe Transactive Energy Framework is a work of\
    \ the GridWise® Architecture Council \nTransactive Energy Framework \n \nVer.\
    \ 1.0 \n \nTransactive energy systems provide a way to maintain the reliability\
    \ and security of the power system \nwhile increasing efficiency by coordinating\
    \ the activity of the growing number of distributed energy \nresources.  These\
    \ multiple goals pose a multi-objective control and optimization challenge.  This\
    \ is one \nreason why transactive energy embraces both the economics and engineering\
    \ of the power system.  The \nsame considerations outlined for the electric grid\
    \ apply to building energy systems and other local energy \nsystems such as microgrids\
    \ [2].   \nIn the past, these systems could be considered simply end nodes on\
    \ the physical power grid that act as \nsimple “dumb” loads.  But they are becoming\
    \ increasingly more interactive with the grid, providing \nintelligent load, storage,\
    \ and generation sources.  They now need to be considered integral and active\
    \ \ncomponents of the grid as a whole.  Building energy systems account for a\
    \ majority of the electric power \nconsumed in the United States.  Recent U.S.\
    \ Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates project \nthat buildings (residential\
    \ and commercial) will account for around 70% of electricity consumption in the\
    \ \nUnited States in 2014 [3].  From the grid perspective, buildings are examples\
    \ of loads that may be \nintegral, active components of the end-to-end electric\
    \ power system.  Within buildings, the same need \nexists to achieve similar economic\
    \ and reliably optimized solutions to manage energy and potentially to \nrealize\
    \ new revenue streams through participation in markets related to electric power\
    \ systems.  The \ngrowing adoption of electric vehicles presents a new class of\
    \ controllable and possibly even generating \nloads that can interact with the\
    \ grid. \nAsset owners, system operators, and other economic entities involved\
    \ in the generation, transmission, and \nuse of electric power all have a stake\
    \ in a reliably efficient power system envisioned with the use of \ntransactive\
    \ energy.  There is a clear need to align value streams for all of these parties\
    \ by using incentives \nfor participation in an actively managed system.  In this\
    \ document, we describe the dimensions and basic \nelements for all stakeholders.\
    \  This provides an opportunity for discussing how various approaches may \nenable\
    \ alignment of value streams and the creation of sustainable business models.\
    \ \nRegulatory, policy, and business issues frame the discussion about the functional\
    \ characteristics of \ntransactive energy systems.  From these characteristics,\
    \ this report also presents a conceptual or reference \narchitecture illustrating\
    \ the principal functional entities and relationships.  The intent of this material\
    \ is \nnot to define a specific solution but to describe the transactive energy\
    \ environment and to enable \ncomparisons among various approaches. \nWe further\
    \ examine the practical dimensions of implementing transactive energy systems\
    \ by considering \nthe cyber-physical system aspects.  Here, too, we avoid prescribing\
    \ specific solutions, but rather identify \ngaps and technology challenges that\
    \ may need to be addressed. \nThe Council intends the Transactive Energy Framework\
    \ to be a starting point for further development \nthrough engagement with the\
    \ broad community of smart grid researchers and practitioners.  We welcome \n\
    feedback on the document and encourage others to adopt its framework concepts\
    \ and terminology for \ntheir discussions within the growing transactive energy\
    \ community. \n \n \nPage iv \n \nThe Transactive Energy Framework is a work of\
    \ the GridWise® Architecture Council \nTransactive Energy Framework \n \nVer.\
    \ 1.0 \n \nAbout GridWise® and the Architecture Council \nThe GridWise vision\
    \ rests on the premise that information technology will revolutionize planning\
    \ and \noperation of the electric power grid just as it has transformed business,\
    \ education, and entertainment.  \nInformation technology will form the “nervous\
    \ system” that integrates new distributed technologies—\ndemand response, distributed\
    \ generation and storage—with traditional grid generation, transmission, and \n\
    distribution assets.  Responsibility for managing the grid will be shared by a\
    \ “society” of devices and \nsystem entities. \nThe mission of the GridWise Architecture\
    \ Council (“the Council”) is to enable all elements of the electric \nsystem to\
    \ interact.  We are an independent body that believes tomorrow’s electric infrastructure\
    \ can be \nmore efficient and secure by integrating information technology and\
    \ e-commerce with distributed \nintelligent networks and devices.  To achieve\
    \ this vision of a transformed electric system, the Council is \ndefining the\
    \ principles for interaction among the information systems that will effectively\
    \ and \ndynamically operate the grid.  The Council, which is supported by the\
    \ U.S. Department of Energy, \nincludes 13 representatives from electric energy\
    \ generation and delivery, industrial systems control, \nbuilding automation,\
    \ information technology and telecommunications, and economic and regulatory \n\
    policy. \nThe GridWise Architecture Council is shaping the guiding principles\
    \ of a highly intelligent and \ninteractive electric system—one ripe with decision-making\
    \ information exchange and market-based \nopportunities.  This high-level perspective\
    \ provides guidelines for interaction between participants and \ninteroperability\
    \ between technologies and automation systems.  We seek to do the following: \
    \ \n• Develop and promote the policies and practices that will allow electric\
    \ devices, enterprise systems, \nand their owners to interact and adapt as full\
    \ participants in system operations. \n• Shape the principles of connectivity\
    \ for intelligent interactions and interoperability across all \nautomation components\
    \ of the electric system from end-use systems, such as buildings or heating, \n\
    ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, to distribution, transmission,\
    \ and bulk power \ngeneration. \n• Address issues of open information exchange,\
    \ universal grid access, distributed grid communications \nand control, and the\
    \ use of modular and extensible technologies that are compatible with the existing\
    \ \ninfrastructure. \nThe Council is neither a design team nor a standards-making\
    \ body.  Our role is to bring the right parties \ntogether to identify actions,\
    \ agreements, and standards that enable significant levels of interoperation \n\
    among automation components.  We act as a catalyst to outline a philosophy of\
    \ inter-system operation \nthat preserves the freedom to innovate, design, implement,\
    \ and maintain each organization’s role and \nresponsibility in the electrical\
    \ system. \n \nPage v \n \nThe Transactive Energy Framework is a work of the GridWise®\

    \ Council \nTransactive Energy Framework \n \nVer. 1.0 \n \n \n1. \nIntroduction\
    \ \nAs stated in the introduction to the GridWise Interoperability Context-Setting\
    \ Framework, “The GridWise \nArchitecture Council (GWAC) exists to enable automation\
    \ among the many entities that interact with the \nelectric power infrastructure”\
    \ [4].  That introduction goes on to discuss the important role of \ninteroperability\
    \ as a key objective to enable “a larger, interconnected system capability that\
    \ transcends the \nlocal perspective of each participating subsystem.” \nSince\
    \ the Interoperability Context-Setting Framework was published significant progress\
    \ has been made \nin developing interoperability standards and implementing them\
    \ while smart grid technology has been \ndeployed.  During this time the attention\
    \ of the GWAC has turned to a related question of how to take \nadvantage of the\
    \ increased availability of two-way communications and intelligent, communicating\
    \ \ndevices and sensors within the electric power infrastructure and end-use sites\
    \ of electric power.  The topic \nof transactive energy as a means to effectively\
    \ manage and control an increasingly complex electric \npower infrastructure has\
    \ emerged as a focal topic in GWAC’s work to build on previous interoperability\
    \ \nwork. \nThe GWAC’s work in this area began with a workshop convened by the\
    \ Council and hosted by Open \nAccess Technology International, Inc. (OATI) at\
    \ OATI’s Redwood City, California, facilities in May \n2011.  This workshop brought\
    \ together a small group of people, ranging from researchers to independent \n\
    system operator/regional transmission organization (ISO/RTO) staff, all of whom\
    \ had been either \nworking on projects referred to as “transactive” in some aspect,\
    \ or had been taking part in the various \ndiscussions about transactive approaches\
    \ for the power system.  One of the outcomes of this workshop \nwas an initial\
    \ working definition of transactive energy: \nThe term “transactive energy” is\
    \ used here to refer to techniques for managing the \ngeneration, consumption\
    \ or flow of electric power within an electric power system \nthrough the use\
    \ of economic or market-based constructs while considering grid reliability \n\
    constraints.  The term “transactive” comes from considering that decisions are\
    \ made \nbased on a value.  These decisions may be analogous to or literally economic\
    \ \ntransactions. \nThe Council continued to consider the topic in a second workshop\
    \ with larger participation in March 2012 \nat IBM’s research facilities in Yorktown\
    \ Heights, New York, and in May 2013 it organized the First \nInternational Conference\
    \ and Workshop on transactive energy in Portland, Oregon.  Leading up to the \n\
    latter event, the Council also held a series of workshops as part of its regular\
    \ face-to-face meetings.  From \nthose workshops and the conference it became\
    \ apparent that transactive energy involves not only \neconomic aspects, as covered\
    \ in the definition above, but also the operational reliability and related \n\
    control objectives and technology within the electric power infrastructure.  The\
    \ Council believes that both \nelements must be considered to move forward with\
    \ the practical development and application of \ntransactive energy. \nAt the\
    \ First International Conference and Workshop, the plenary sessions provided a\
    \ combination of \ninformation about the changing nature of the electric power\
    \ infrastructure, related challenges and \nopportunities with buildings as the\

    \ including a refined definition of the \nterm “transactive energy” that is discussed\
    \ in Chapter 3. \n1.1 \nWhy Develop a Framework? \nThe GWAC addressed this question\
    \ in “The GridWise Interoperability Context-setting Framework”[4].  \nA subset\
    \ of that material is included here.  As illustrated in Figure 1 below, by framework,\
    \ we mean \nsomething at a high, organizational or conceptual level that provides\
    \ neutral ground upon which a \ncommunity of stakeholders can discuss issues and\
    \ concerns related to a large, complex system. \n \nFigure 1:  A framework provides\
    \ high-level perspective. \nThe intent of the Transactive Energy Framework is\
    \ to promote discussion at the conceptual level of \ncommon features or elements\
    \ of specific models, designs, or implementations of transactive energy \nsystems.\
    \  At this conceptual level the framework is intended to be broad and overarching.\
    \ \n1.2 \nThe Importance of Multiple Viewpoints \nIn promoting broader discussion\
    \ multiple diverse stakeholders need to be considered.  Consequently, \ntransactive\
    \ energy involves contributions from multiple disciplines spanning both economics\
    \ and \nengineering.  The implications of the potential new approaches for managing\
    \ and controlling electric \npower systems call for a broad involvement of economists,\
    \ regulators, policy makers, vendors, \nintegrators, utilities, researchers, end-consumers\
    \ such as building owner-operators, and other \nstakeholders.  The diversity of\
    \ thought provided by multiple viewpoints is important to achieving a \nframework\
    \ that addresses the variety of perspectives and needs these stakeholders bring\
    \ to the table. \nA framework is a method and a set of supporting tools that can\
    \ be used for developing an architecture.  \nThe Transactive Energy Framework\
    \ is a tool that can be used for developing a broad range of different \narchitectures\
    \ for implementing transactive techniques.  This document discusses approaches\
    \ for designing \na transactive system in terms of a set of building blocks, and\
    \ for showing how the building blocks fit \ntogether.   \nFramework \nModel \n\

    \ 1.0 \n \n1.3 \nAudience for this Document \nIn creating the Transactive Energy\
    \ Framework, the authors presume an audience with a good \nunderstanding of interoperability,\
    \ familiarity with the GWAC Interoperability Context-Setting \nFramework, and\
    \ knowledge of energy markets and associated business models.  People with this\
    \ level of \nbackground should be reasonably able to understand the proposed ideas,\
    \ critically review them, and \nparticipate in reworking or refining the framework\
    \ so that it becomes a shared creation with tools that \npropagate and serve the\
    \ diverse smart grid community.  The document covers the topic of transactive\
    \ \nenergy at an abstract, conceptual level.  This is because the Council does\
    \ not want to prescribe specific \nimplementations and because we hope to engage\
    \ an audience that includes policy makers, regulators, \nvendors, utilities, researchers,\
    \ practitioners, and end-use asset owners.  Subsequent work products are \nexpected\
    \ to engage subsets of this broad audience at levels that best communicate with\
    \ each targeted \nsegment. \n1.4 \nReport Contents and Organization \nThis document\
    \ is organized in four main chapters.  Chapter 2 summarizes the context and motivation\
    \ for \ntransactive energy approaches.  The changing nature of the grid and the\
    \ combination of regulatory, policy, \neconomic and engineering challenges due\
    \ to those changes are summarized.  Chapter 3 refines the \ndefinition of transactive\
    \ energy and includes a set of associated attributes that may be used to discuss\
    \ \ndifferent approaches and implementations of transactive energy systems.  Chapter\
    \ 4 puts transactive \nenergy into a framework of regulatory and policy considerations,\
    \ business models and value creation, \nconceptual system architectures, and the\
    \ general cyber-physical considerations important in implementing \ntransactive\
    \ energy applications.  The intent throughout all of these chapters is not to\
    \ prescribe a specific \ntransactive energy solution.  Rather, the intent is to\
    \ provide a common point of reference and encourage \nbroad discussion of the\
    \ concepts and approaches possible for designing and implementing transactive\
    \ \nenergy systems or applications. \n \nPage 3 \n \nThe Transactive Energy Framework\
    \ is a work of the GridWise® Architecture Council \nTransactive Energy Framework\
    \ \n \nVer. 1.0 \n \n2. \nContext Setting \nThe intent of a transactive energy\
    \ framework is to provide the context for identifying and debating \ntransactive\
    \ issues to advance actions that simplify the integration and monetization of\
    \ distributed energy \nresources within the complex power system.  The framework\
    \ recognizes that these objectives can only be \nachieved when agreement is reached\
    \ across many layers of concern.  These layers span the details of the \nprocesses\
    \ and technology involved to link systems together, to the understanding of the\
    \ information \nexchanged, and to the objectives of customers, businesses, organizations\
    \ and economic and regulatory \npolicy. \nThis document frames the topic by defining\
    \ the meaning of the term “transactive energy,” presenting \nattributes of transactive\
    \ energy systems, and enabling the discussion of methods for accommodating \n\
    increasing numbers of distributed energy resources within power systems.  The\
    \ framework is then a \nuseful tool for further development of the topic. \n2.1\
    \ \nThe Problem \nA number of recent reports and studies (for example, [1, 2,\
    \ 5-7]and [8]) have discussed the significant \ntransformations occurring in the\
    \ electric power system.  These transformations include growth in the use \nof\
    \ renewable energy resources in the bulk power system, proliferation of distributed\
    \ energy resources of \nvarious capacities in both transmission and distribution\
    \ systems, an increasing number of installations of \nlocal renewable resources\
    \ at end-use points, and load growth through electrification of transportation\
    \ and \nother end-uses.  Some of these transformations, such as the deployment\
    \ of distribution-level photovoltaic \n(PV) systems, represent relatively minor\
    \ quantities of generation to date.  The continued penetration of \nsmall-scale\
    \ PV systems may have less impact on the grid than casual conversations might\
    \ suggest, yet it \nstill has the capability to be a force worthy of consideration.\
    \  Today PV accounts for 0.2 quadrillion Btu \n(quads) per year, which compares\
    \ with 1.03 quads consumed by televisions nationally per year [3].  Yet \nPV is\
    \ highly concentrated in some areas and there the numbers have a larger net impact.\
    \  The same effect \nis true for plug-in electric vehicles, which make a small\
    \ impact overall but present significant challenges \nwhere they become concentrated\
    \ in small areas. \nThe fact remains that we are deploying more and more technology\
    \ on the grid, in businesses, and in \nhomes.  Devices are becoming smarter and\
    \ increasing amounts of renewable sources of energy are being \ndeployed, driven\
    \ by state renewable goals and growing social desire for environmental stewardship.\
    \ \nDaniel Burrus stresses the need to understand the difference between hard\
    \ and soft trends so we might \nknow which parts of the future we can be right\
    \ about [9].  Hard trends give us the ability to see \ndisruptions before they\
    \ happen and the insight we need to create strategies based on a new level of\
    \ \ncertainty.  Hard trends also provide a way to accurately predict changes in\
    \ consumer behavior based on \ngame-changing technology shifts.  Soft Trends can\
    \ be changed and therefore influenced, producing \nanother way to influence the\
    \ future.  Whether or not PV and plug-in vehicles represent hard trends or soft\
    \ \ntrends, current projections by the Energy Information Administration (EIA)\
    \ show PV increasing by an \norder or magnitude in the next 30 years [3].  Whether\
    \ or not PV on its own has the ability to destabilize \nthe grid, the trend suggests\
    \ a significant increase in technology at the edge of the grid and a likelihood\
    \ of \nincreasing interactions occurring between devices as social networks and\
    \ energy networks converge.  This \nmakes PV a strong catalyst for increasing\
    \ transactive energy (TE) adoption and general understanding of \nthe topic. \
    \ \nAt the edge of the grid where consumption occurs, there is growing interest\
    \ in high-performance and net-\nzero buildings as well as building-to-grid integration.\
    \  These considerations of end-uses of electric power \nPage 4 \n \nThe Transactive\
    \ Energy Framework is a work of the GridWise® Architecture Council \nTransactive\
    \ Energy Framework \n \nVer. 1.0 \n \nare among the issues that have significant\
    \ ability to influence the extent to which devices, people, and \norganizations\
    \ interact with each other to meet personal goals and to influence future grid\
    \ operations, value \ncreation and realization. \nOf particular concern is growth\
    \ in the use of intermittent resources in both the bulk power system and at \n\
    end-use points served by distribution systems.  Historically, the electric power\
    \ system was operated as a \nload-following system.  Loads were variable but predictable,\
    \ generation was dispatchable, and there was \nno significant amount of bulk energy\
    \ storage in the power system; so generation resources were operated \nthrough\
    \ periodic dispatches that roughly aligned supply with demand and allowed automatic\
    \ closed-loop \ncontrols to adjust generation to precisely match load.  This approach\
    \ yielded a reliable source of electric \npower and system frequency served as\
    \ a key indicator of overall system stability.  While this system and \nmany other\
    \ aspects of the power delivery chain were originally designed for reliability,\
    \ in recent times \nthere has been a significant move toward operation for economy\
    \ and sustainability.  This has led to the \nintroduction of new energy sources\
    \ whose characteristics are quite different from what was originally \ndesigned,\
    \ as well as the introduction of non-passive load behavior.  This move has also\
    \ introduced \nopportunity as energy markets open up to smaller participants,\
    \ including non-utility players.  This trend \ncan unlock new economic value through\
    \ new kinds of energy services, but raises the issue of how such \nservices can\
    \ be technically coordinated with grid operators in a secure manner that does\
    \ not compromise \nsystem manageability or reliability. \nThe increased use of\
    \ intermittent resources, such as wind and solar power, has made it increasingly\
    \ \ndifficult to continue to use the load-following operational model.  The variability\
    \ of the generation \nresource has resulted in a new problem that involves the\
    \ presence of somewhat predictable variability in \nboth generation and loads.\
    \  Over time it is predicted that the old model of generation following load will\
    \ \nbe superseded by a future model of load responding to supply [10].  During\
    \ the transition between these \ntwo paradigms, the new problem is one of finding\
    \ a means to manage that variability most efficiently, \nwhile maintaining system\
    \ balance, stability, supply security, and reliability. \nIn addition to the use\
    \ of intermittent resources, the increased use of distributed energy resources\
    \ (DERs) \nhas increased the complexity of the electric power system.  While distribution\
    \ systems were originally \ndesigned assuming power flow from bulk power generation\
    \ to end-use load points at the edges of the \ndistribution system, incorporation\
    \ of DERs increasingly violates that assumption, with significant \nconsequences\
    \ for grid operations when penetration levels of DERs pass tipping points that\
    \ are becoming \nwell recognized.  Introducing DERs at the edges and also at intermediate\
    \ points now creates the \npossibility of power flows in multiple directions,\
    \ as well as loop flows in distribution circuits.  These \nchanges were not anticipated\
    \ in the present generation of grid controls, so they introduce new challenges\
    \ \nfor distribution system operators. \nElectrification of transportation introduces\
    \ new challenges, too.  Electric vehicles hold great promise for \nhelping achieve\
    \ carbon footprint reductions by reducing our use of fossil fuels for transportation.1\
    \  They \nalso present the possibility of increased peak loads if electric vehicle\
    \ owners all want to charge their \nvehicles in the evening when they get home\
    \ from work.  This impact is significantly more pronounced for \nLevel 2 AC charging\
    \ or for DC Fast Charging.  A 2007 study by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory\
    \ \nshowed, however, that we have the capacity to accommodate a 70% penetration\
    \ of electric vehicles if we \nmanage their charging through the use of “smart”\
    \ charging technology [8].   \n1 This assumes the carbon content of the grid is\
    \ less than the carbon content of petroleum, as it currently is. \nPage 5 \n \n\

    \ Framework \n \nVer. 1.0 \n \nConsidering the situations summarized above, we\
    \ are faced with a set of issues requiring simultaneous or \njoint solutions.\
    \  This is because these problems are not isolated in only one element of the\
    \ electric power \nsystem and because the coupling that exists via the electrical\
    \ physics of the grid causes the various \nelements to interact in ways that can\
    \ be detrimental if they are not properly addressed.  New objectives \narising\
    \ from the emerging trends discussed above are as follows: \n• wholesale prices/production\
    \ costs minimization \n• provision of ancillary services, ramping, and balancing\
    \ (especially in light of renewables) \n• managing transmission congestion costs\
    \ \n• peak load management \n• resource ramp management \n• minimization of new\
    \ transmission capacity, relief from existing dynamically constrained capacity\
    \ \nlimits \n• minimization of new distribution capacity \n• management of distribution\
    \ voltages in light of rapid fluctuations in rooftop solar PV system output \n\
    • accommodation of new loads and integration of responsive loads \n• maintenance\
    \ or improvement of the services power provides in homes and buildings. \nAchieving\
    \ these objectives may be thought of as a multi-objective optimization problem.\
    \  There have \ntypically been two approaches to achieving the operational objectives\
    \ of the electric power system—the \nuse of economic systems such as markets and\
    \ the use of control systems technology.  The remainder of \nthis chapter considers\
    \ the challenges from these two perspectives, beginning with consideration of\
    \ the \ntime scales for which they apply, leading to subsequent chapters that\
    \ consider TE as a means to treat these \ntwo classes of objectives jointly for\
    \ energy systems. \n2.2 \nTime Scales \nThe fundamental problem in operating an\
    \ electric power infrastructure is maintaining balance between \nsupply and demand.\
    \  The physics of the electrical power system will force balance to be maintained;\
    \ \notherwise imbalance outside of the tolerance of the system will cause the\
    \ system to fail through a chain of \nevents resulting in blackouts.  The key\
    \ objective of the operators of the system is to supply power to loads \nreliably\
    \ (within specified limits), thereby avoiding blackouts.  To achieve this objective\
    \ actions take place \non a range of time scales from years to milliseconds. \n\
    Figure 2 illustrates the relative time frames involved in the electric power system.\
    \  On the right, the time \nframes are slow—days to years to decades.  Even in\
    \ those time frames, however, the initial steps for \nmaintaining the balance\
    \ of supply and demand take place with utilities estimating load changes and \n\
    entering into long-term contracts to meet their basic estimated needs.  In nearer\
    \ time frames—hours to \ndays—markets or other economic interactions take place\
    \ to balance supply and demand now that the load \nfor tomorrow or for the coming\
    \ hour can be more accurately estimated.  Recently, some of the regional \nsystem\
    \ operators (ISOs or RTOs) have begun to operate markets on intervals as short\
    \ as five minutes to \nmanage supply and demand. \n \nPage 6 \n \nThe Transactive\
    \ Energy Framework is a work of the GridWise® Architecture Council \nTransactive\
    \ Energy Framework \n \nVer. 1.0 \n \n \nFigure 2:  Electric Power System Timelines\
    \ (used with permission) [11]. \nThe left half of Figure 2 represents the faster\
    \ time frames of operation ranging from microseconds to \nminutes.  Action on\
    \ these time frames is taken by an automatic control system such as automatic\
    \ \ngenerator controls (AGC) responding to signals such as area control error\
    \ (ACE) or local measurements \nthat drive components such as voltage regulation\
    \ or protective relays.  Historically, controls have been \nhierarchical in nature,\
    \ using supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) technology to link remote\
    \ \ncontrol points or sensors to a centralized control center, and having human\
    \ operators in the loop for many \nkinds of grid control operations.  As the emerging\
    \ trends develop, operations will increasingly shift to the \nleft in Figure 2,\
    \ meaning that human-in-the-loop control is likely not sustainable going forward\
    \ and that \nmore automated control with human supervision will be needed.  Also,\
    \ the number of data paths, \nconnection points, and control points is growing\
    \ and becoming exceedingly complex. \n2.3 \nEconomic/Market Context \nThe increasing\
    \ diversity of resources in the physical system has implications for the existing\
    \ economic- \nand market-based elements of the power system.  These impacts are\
    \ illustrated in the Transactive Energy \nInfographic [12], which depicts interactions\
    \ at the transmission, local, microgrid, and residential levels.  \nThese represent\
    \ interactions that may or may not use utility wires to deliver power and services,\
    \ but that \nmay nonetheless affect grid performance.  These changes are driving\
    \ and will continue to drive impacts in \nseveral ways, such as the following:\
    \ \n• development of new market structures to deal with the variability of large-scale\
    \ renewable resources; \nfor example, energy imbalance markets \n• the emergence\
    \ of markets operating on shorter and shorter time scales such as Energy Imbalance\
    \ \nMarkets (EIMs) in the west and PJM’s five-minute markets in PJM, New York\
    \ Independent System \nOperator, and other organized markets \n• changing retail\
    \ customer relationships with the introduction of premises-level renewable resources\
    \ \nand new loads such as electric vehicles \n• formulation of policies going\
    \ beyond renewable portfolio standards to promote development of very \nefficient\
    \ high-performance buildings, including net-zero energy buildings \n• the emergence\
    \ of the distribution system operator (DSO) construct to take on the responsibility\
    \ for \nbalancing supply and demand variations at the distribution level and linking\
    \ the wholesale and retail \nmarket agents \nPage 7 \n \nThe Transactive Energy\
    \ Framework is a work of the GridWise® Architecture Council \nTransactive Energy\
    \ Framework \n \nVer. 1.0 \n \n• “hidden” changes in the behavior of the grid\
    \ such as the increasing capacity of behind-the-meter \nsources of generation\
    \ displacing conventional electricity generation that would otherwise occur, \n\
    which has contributed to electricity sales declining in four of the past five\
    \ years [13]. \n• the need for new business and regulatory models.  The traditional\
    \ utility model is predicated on load \ngrowth, but efficiency has severed the\
    \ link between population/economic growth and energy growth.  \nThis change plus\
    \ the shorter time scales for adding DERs when compared to traditional generation\
    \ \nsources, and the increasing technical capabilities to facilitate cooperation\
    \ and coordination between \nDERs, users, and devices creates a need to re-evaluate\
    \ our cost of service regulation model. \n• requiring action in the time frame\
    \ of minutes (see Figure 2) at major system-to-system interfaces \nbetween transmission\
    \ and distribution or distribution and retail customers.  Thus, the changes impact\
    \ \nboth the economics of electric power systems and the control of both the power\
    \ systems and the end-\nuses of electricity.   \nWith respect to regulatory changes,\
    \ investor-owned electric utilities point to a paradigm shift caused by \nthe\
    \ need for large new capital additions at a time of declining sales growth and\
    \ reduced credit worthiness.  \nThey urge the development of new regulatory frameworks\
    \ that provide for cost recovery outside of the \ntraditional rate case [14].\
    \  Perhaps a regulatory tool to stimulate innovation is required such as a tiered\
    \ \nrecovery mechanism based on levels of customer participation and/or customer\
    \ satisfaction [15]. There \nseems little doubt that regulatory models must evolve\
    \ to address the ability for edge devices to offer \nservices.  The topic of policy\
    \ and market design is addressed more in Section 4.1. \n2.4 \nGrid Control Systems\
    \ Context \n“The mix of control methods either in use or contemplated today has\
    \ resulted in a chaotic situation further \ncompounded by the lack of true interoperability\
    \ between and across many of these systems” [2], as shown \nbelow in Figure 3,\
    \ which depicts inter-tier control, with control flowing downward.  The diagram\
    \ in \nFigure 3 is difficult to read because grid control is becoming increasingly\
    \ complex.  The curved red lines \non the right side of the diagram illustrate\
    \ the recent proliferation of new control relationships.  These \nrepresent attempts\
    \ by the utilities to deal with new functions and requirements within the bounds\
    \ of \nexisting control infrastructure.  It is clear that the overall control\
    \ architecture of the full electric power \nsystem is becoming chaotic.  This\
    \ is due to the mismatch between the old grid control requirements, for \nwhich\
    \ existing control systems were well-designed, and the emerging requirements that\
    \ violate many of \nthe long-standing grid-operating assumptions.  Less apparent\
    \ however, is how markets, which have \nhistorically operated in a manner mostly\
    \ decoupled from short-term grid operations, might integrate with \ngrid control\
    \ on short timescales appropriate for the new grid functions. \nTo provide for\
    \ joint market and control functionality (i.e., TE capability) in an environment\
    \ that supports \nnew grid capabilities, it is clear that overall grid control\
    \ architecture must evolve in line with changing \nrequirements.  Such evolution\
    \ will lead to a more distributed2 kind of control especially at the distribution\
    \ \nlevel, with much faster operation, human supervision rather than human-in-the-loop\
    \ operation, and \ncontrol coordination that spans multiple levels of the power\
    \ grid hierarchy, while respecting local \noptimization and decision making. \n\
    2 Note that the term “distributed” can be applied to systems architecture concepts\
    \ as well as decision-making \ncapabilities. \nPage 8 \n \nThe Transactive Energy\

    \ and synchronization \n• structural scalability for large numbers of participating\

    \ controls, non-utility grid-connected \nenergy assets (DER), third-party energy\
    \ services organizations, and responsive loads \n• low-cost control and communication\

    \ Energy Framework is a work of the GridWise® Architecture Council \nTransactive\
    \ Energy Framework \n \nVer. 1.0 \n \nSuch control frameworks are not only possible,\
    \ but feasible given recent trends in advanced grid control.  \nTwo key issues\
    \ here are  \n1. How utilities make the transition from traditional controls to\
    \ an advanced control framework, \ngiven investments in legacy control and communication\
    \ systems.   \n2. The availability and ease of use of low-cost control and communication\
    \ gateways and \nsensing/control devices enabling large participation of end-use\
    \ prosumers, devices, and systems. \nFortunately, the emerging layered approaches,\
    \ which draw upon several well-established principles from \ncontrol engineering\
    \ and network design, apply and set the stage for TE.  It is important to understand\
    \ the \nrole of TE relative to other elements of system control and coordination.\
    \  An overall coordination \nframework can coordinate TE and other forms of control.\
    \  It would also facilitate properties such as \n• local selfish optimization\
    \ inside system coordination \n• control federation, constraint fusion, and command\
    \ disaggregation \n• boundary deference, because multiple system, organization,\
    \ and jurisdictional boundaries must be \ncrossed \n• means to ensure reliability\
    \ and stability \nThese changing requirements for grid related control systems\
    \ have several implications.  One of the most \nchallenging is to move from highly\
    \ centralized control systems to more distributed controls systems.  In \nmaking\
    \ this shift, the desired end result will be a loosely coupled set of controls\
    \ with just enough \ninformation exchange to allow for stability and global optimization\
    \ through local action. \n \nPage 10 \n \nThe Transactive Energy Framework is\

    \ was developed based on extensive discussion of both the nature of the evolving\
    \ electric \npower system, as summarized in the previous chapter, and the concepts\
    \ that have been discussed at \nworkshops on TE held by the Council starting in\
    \ May 2011.  The definition is purposely broad.  One can \nargue that TE is not\
    \ new because bulk power system operators use markets to help manage and maintain\
    \ \nbalance and reliability of the bulk power system.  The broad definition allows\
    \ us to recognize their \nexisting use of such techniques and to also consider\
    \ the how to enable new techniques that may be used in \ndistribution systems,\
    \ at the interface between transmission and distribution, and perhaps even more\
    \ \nbroadly. \nThe definition by itself does not provide a complete picture of\
    \ the entire domain of TE.  To provide a \nmore complete view and to help facilitate\
    \ discussion of various approaches to implementing TE we have \ndefined additional\
    \ attributes below. \n3.2 \nTransactive Energy Attributes \nThe following attributes\
    \ represent qualities or characteristics that describe significant dimensions\
    \ of TE.  \nThese have been included to assist the reader in understanding the\
    \ boundaries of TE systems and \nsupplement the definition provided above.  These\
    \ attributes are intended to serve two purposes.  First, \nthey provide a broader\
    \ view of TE by applying the definition in the context of possible implementations\
    \ \nof TE.  Second, in considering different implementations they provide a common\
    \ way to describe the \ncharacteristics of specific TE systems.  In this way they\
    \ are intended to help promote discussion and \ncomparison of different approaches.\
    \ \n \nPage 11 \n \nThe Transactive Energy Framework is a work of the GridWise®\
    \ Architecture Council \nTransactive Energy Framework \n \nVer. 1.0 \n \narchitecture\
    \  All TE tools and methodologies are described as constituents or subsystems\
    \ \nof a system architecture.  A key distinction is whether the architecture is\
    \ \ncentralized, distributed, or a combination of the two.  Note that the entire\
    \ \nelectrical infrastructure is an ultra-large-scale (ULS) system of systems\
    \ as \ndefined in the in the Software Engineering Institute’s ULS Book, 2006 [16].\
    \ \nextent A TE system will typically apply within some geographic, organizational,\
    \ \npolitical, or other measure of extent.  A geographic extent, for example,\
    \ might \nbe within a region and apply across multiple participating entities.\
    \  An extent \nmay be described organizationally, for example, if an implementation\
    \ is \nintended for use within a single utility, building, or campus.  Likewise,\
    \ a \ntransactive system may apply across political boundaries with different\
    \ \nregulatory or policy constraints.  Extent may also be considered relative\
    \ to the \ntopology of an electrical infrastructure including end-users.  Thus,\
    \ a \ntransactive system may apply in transmission, distribution, or both; it\
    \ may \nalso be useful for managing energy within buildings or by end-users of\
    \ \nelectrical energy. \ntransacting parties Fundamentally, TE involves transacting\
    \ parties.  In most cases these will be \nautomated systems, possibly acting as\
    \ surrogates for human parties.  In some \ncases humans may be in the loop.  A\
    \ TE system must be explicitly \ndescribable by the entities that are parties\
    \ to transactions.  Because a TE \nsystem will provide services to various parties,\
    \ its success in delivering these \nservices will depend in part on the expectations\
    \ and needs of each group and \nin part on the qualities of the delivered service.\
    \  Understanding such criteria is \na critical aspect of the monitoring and assessment\
    \ of a ULS system [16]. \ntransaction A TE system must clearly define transactions\
    \ within the context of that \nsystem.  The following questions (and possibly\
    \ others not anticipated here) \nmust be able to be answered:  Who are the transacting\
    \ parties, what \ninformation is exchanged between them to create a transaction,\
    \ and what is \nexchanged between them to execute a transaction?  What are the\
    \ rules \ngoverning transactions?  What is the mechanism(s) for reaching agreement?\
    \ \ntransacted \ncommodities \nAlthough the primary commodity transacted is energy,\
    \ derivative products \nsuch as reliability-driven call options (e.g., Ancillary\
    \ Services) may also be \ntransacted among the transacting parties. \ntemporal\
    \ \nvariability \nTransactive systems may interact across multiple timescales.\
    \  For example, \ntransactions within a single system may range from sub-second\
    \ to five \nminutes or to some longer periodicity.  It is also possible for transactions\
    \ to \nbe event-driven.  In characterizing a given transactive system the timescale(s)\
    \ \nof transactive interactions need to be specified and analyzed for compatibility.\
    \  \nThis will be a key to interoperability between different transactive systems.\
    \ \ninteroperability Transactions are enabled through the exchange of information\
    \ between \ntransacting parties.  There are two elements to consider here:  technical\
    \ \ninteroperability and cognitive (semantic) interoperability.  The systems must\
    \ \nbe able to connect and exchange information (emphasizing format and \nsyntax),\
    \ and they have to understand the exchanges in the context that was \nPage 12\
    \ \n \nThe Transactive Energy Framework is a work of the GridWise® Architecture\
    \ Council \nTransactive Energy Framework \n \nVer. 1.0 \n \nintended in order\
    \ to support workflows and constraints.  For any given \ntransaction the information\
    \ exchanged during a transaction must be explicitly \nidentified.  Furthermore,\
    \ one should be able to explain how interoperability \nhas been addressed in support\
    \ of the information exchanges. \nvalue discovery \nmechanism \nA value discovery\
    \ mechanism is a means of establishing the economic or \nengineering value (such\
    \ as profit or performance) that is associated with a \ntransaction.  Fundamentally,\
    \ a value discovery mechanism is the process by \nwhich transacting parties come\
    \ to an agreement on value.  The inclusion of \nthis attribute recognizes that\
    \ the mechanism may be simple or complex.  For \nat least some transactive systems,\
    \ the value discovery mechanism is a key \nelement of value-driven multi-objective\
    \ optimization.  Value realization may \ntake place through a variety of approaches,\
    \ including an organized market, \nprocurement, a tariff, an over-the-counter\
    \ bilateral contract, or a customer’s \nor other entity’s self-optimization analysis.\
    \  Value discovery mechanisms \nshould include considerations of economic incentive\
    \ compatibility and \nacceptable behavior. \nassignment of value Assignment of\
    \ value is fundamental to value discovery.  For sub-elements of \na TE system,\
    \ a means may be needed for assigning value to objectives that \ncannot be addressed\
    \ through a discovery mechanism or for values that do not \nhave a common dimension\
    \ that can be used for valuation.  For example, end-\nusers of electricity may\
    \ have non-quantitative values such as comfort that \nrequire a mechanism to translate\
    \ them into elasticity, thus enabling \nquantification in a transaction. \nalignment\
    \ of \nobjectives   \nA key principle in the broad application TE systems is the\
    \ continuous \nalignment of multiple objectives to achieve optimum results as\
    \ the system \noperates.  This alignment enhances the economic and engineering\
    \ impacts of \nthe dynamic balance(s) achieved by TE systems.  Note that optimal\
    \ relates to \nbalancing the entire transactive system, and to achieving an optimum\
    \ balance \nnecessary to optimize objectives, variables, and constraints.  It\
    \ is important to \nunderstand that optimization does not simply add intelligence\
    \ to existing \nbusiness processes, it changes business practices. \nassuring\
    \ stability The stability of grid control and economic mechanisms is required\
    \ and must \nbe assured.  Consideration of system stability must be included in\
    \ the \nformulation of TE techniques and should be demonstrable.  Unfortunately,\
    \ \nthere are no public benchmarks for the stability of TE systems and during\
    \ \nnumerical optimization minor errors can build on each other, and sometimes\
    \ \nspiral out of control.  It is important to mitigate optimization instabilities\
    \ \nbecause grid stability may be compromised by poor value optimization \ntechniques.\
    \  In addition to the need to assure stability from a control systems \npoint\
    \ of view, stability should also be assured with respect to existing grid \nstability\
    \ limits. \n3.3 \nTransactive Energy Principles \nDuring the February 2014 GWAC\
    \ workshop held at PJM in Philadelphia, the participants agreed on the \nneed\
    \ for a set of high-level principles that apply to TE systems.  As discussed during\
    \ the meeting, such \nPage 13 \n \nThe Transactive Energy Framework is a work\
    \ of the GridWise® Architecture Council \nTransactive Energy Framework \n \nVer.\
    \ 1.0 \n \nprinciples are, in effect, statements of high-level requirements for\
    \ such systems.  A working group was \nformed to organize the material from the\
    \ meeting and the following six principles were defined: \n• Transactive energy\
    \ systems implement some form of highly coordinated self-optimization. \n• Transactive\
    \ energy systems should maintain system reliability and control while enabling\
    \ optimal \nintegration of renewable and DERs. \n• Transactive energy systems\
    \ should provide for non-discriminatory participation by qualified \nparticipants.\
    \ \n• Transactive energy systems should be observable and auditable at interfaces.\
    \ \n• Transactive energy systems should be scalable, adaptable, and extensible\
    \ across a number of devices, \nparticipants, and geographic extents. \n• Transacting\
    \ parties are accountable for standards of performance. \n3.4 \nEvolution of the\
    \ Grid and its Impact on Transactive Energy \nAs more and more DERs penetrate\
    \ distribution systems, and more micro-grids and campus networks \nappear as well\
    \ as entities such as virtual power plants, the potential for these and other\
    \ entities, such as \nprosumers and smart buildings and smart equipment, to interact\
    \ with each other will increase.  A concern \nthat is often expressed is that\
    \ this will create a decentralized3 control system that could affect grid \nreliability\
    \ in a negative manner.  These views are typically applied to today’s system architecture\
    \ and \nmanagement techniques that are heavily centralized.  The role of the utility\
    \ will change in the long term \nand it needs to include consideration of TE techniques\
    \ in order to support the evolution of a flexible \nenergy coordination eco-system.\
    \ \nAs the diagram in Figure 4 illustrates, the industry is in the early stages\
    \ of transactive operations.  As \nmore and more intelligent devices are deployed,\
    \ the opportunities for automation will increase, which will \nincrease opportunities\
    \ for TE.  The time frame shown in the figure is aggressive and some in the industry\
    \ \nsuggest a longer time horizon will apply.  Survey results from recent regional\
    \ workshops conducted by \nDOE and the GridWise Alliance, however, concluded that\
    \ there can be significant change in the electric \npower system by 2020 [17].\
    \  While not all elements of the electric power system will change at this pace,\
    \ \nit appears likely that parts of the system will. \n3 Decentralized computing\
    \ or control exists when multiple distinct (and usually but not always physically\
    \ separated) \nelements operate independently.  Distributed computing or control\
    \ exists when the decentralized elements explicitly \ncooperate to solve a common\
    \ problem.  Mechanisms to ensure that decentralized elements stay focused on the\
    \ \ncommon problem are known as coordination methods.  \nPage 14 \n \nThe Transactive\
    \ Energy Framework is a work of the GridWise® Architecture Council \n        \
    \                                              \nTransactive Energy Framework\
    \ \n \nVer. 1.0 \n \n \nFigure 4:  Stages of adoption of transactive operations\
    \ for industry [18].  \nIf a common approach can be established for TE implementations\
    \ then a foundation may be created \nallowing various systems to cooperate to\
    \ maintain reliability while also serving their own objectives to \nincrease value.\
    \  But this is either just a technical challenge nor just a business challenge\
    \ but a policy \nchallenge to consider at the state, regional, and federal levels.\
    \  This is one reason why a framework such \nas that defined in this report is\
    \ essential.   \n3.5 \nElements of Transactive Energy \nThe elements of TE are\
    \ the components of a transactive architecture that need to be addressed in the\
    \ \ndesign of a system.  They provide a starting point for discussion by presenting\
    \ the basic structure for an \napproach to transactive architecture design with\
    \ reference to a summarized GWAC Stack as defined in \nthe GWAC’s “Interoperability\
    \ Context-Setting Framework” [4].  The GWAC Stack represents the \ndimensions\
    \ of interoperability ranging from physical (or cyber-physical) at the lower levels,\
    \ information \ninteroperability in the mid-levels, and business models, market\
    \ structures, regulation, and policy in the \nupper-levels.  With these three\
    \ broad groupings of the GWAC Stack in mind we can define elements of \nTE as\
    \ depicted in the Figure 5. \n \n   \n   \nPage 15 \n \nThe Transactive Energy\
    \ Framework is a work of the GridWise® Architecture Council \nTransactive Energy\
    \ Framework \n \nVer. 1.0 \n \n \nFigure 5:  GWAC Stack with elements of transactive\
    \ energy. \nThese three groupings from the GWAC Stack provide the elements that\
    \ need to be addressed by any \ntransactive design.  A TE system within a smart\
    \ building or corporate campus may face challenges \ndifferent from a microgrid,\
    \ a virtual power plant, or an energy trading or a demand reduction system.  \n\
    Nevertheless, all of them should address appropriate levels in the following areas\
    \ during design. \n• Business/Markets/Policy/Regulation.  Ideally, policy makers\
    \ would have a TE toolkit available to \nthem that would include a catalog of\
    \ policy guidance and mechanisms.  The regulators could use this \ntoolkit to\
    \ compose TE policy specific to the needs of their regulated jurisdictions.  Until\
    \ the toolkit \nexists, transactive designs must address a set of broader and\
    \ potentially more abstract questions (as \nidentified in the attributes described\
    \ in Section 3.2) including:  Who or what are the transacting \nparties?  What\
    \ is the purpose and regulatory extent of transactions?  How are transactions\
    \ closed or \nsettled?  Is the economic “reward” directly associated with the\
    \ transactions or separate?  (For \nexample, one can construct an “engineering-economic\
    \ signal” that is used to drive system behavior \nbased on monetizing all considerations;\
    \ however, this signal is not used as a literal basis for the \nexchange of money).\
    \ \n• Information Interoperability (including system architecture).  Information\
    \ interoperability needs to \naddress the semantics behind the valuation of transactions\
    \ (meeting participant objectives), the \noperation of the TE mechanisms, and\
    \ the control aspects of understanding the impacts of the \ntransactive system\
    \ on the electric grid.  Thus, the semantics of information interoperability are\
    \ \ndirectly linked to both the business and operational models.  One challenge\
    \ is how to include in the \n“business model” the engineering imperatives.  What\
    \ specific information is exchanged?   \n• Cyber-Physical.  The Cyber-Physical\
    \ Infrastructure element of TE deals with the technical layers of \nthe GWAC Stack\
    \ and the physical layers of the Control Abstraction Stack.  The power grid includes\
    \ \ntwo cyber-physical networks:  the electrically connected network and the communications\
    \ networks \nnecessary to monitor and control it.  Transactive energy designs\
    \ need to address both of these \ninfrastructure elements to the extent of understanding\
    \ what physical connectivity is required to \nsupport the exchange of information\
    \ in support of transactions and without detrimentally affecting the \nreliability\
    \ of the electrical network. \n \nPage 16 \n \nThe Transactive Energy Framework\
    \ is a work of the GridWise® Architecture Council \nTransactive Energy Framework\
    \ \n \nVer. 1.0 \n \n4. \nFramework \nThis chapter dives deeper into the elements\
    \ of TE described in the previous one.  Building on the \ndiscussion of the GWAC\
    \ Stack at the end of the previous section, as illustrated in Figure 5, the GWAC\
    \ \nStack may be mapped into four areas of concern for discussion of TE: \n• Policy\
    \ and Market Design \n• Business Models and Value Realization \n• Conceptual Architecture\
    \ Guidelines \n• Cyber-Physical Infrastructure. \nOne way to think about this\
    \ mapping of the GWAC Stack to TE is to think of TE as a smart grid \napplication\
    \ taking advantage of the deployment of two-way communications capabilities and\
    \ intelligent, \ncommunicating sensors and devices.  With this view in mind one\
    \ can apply the GWAC Stack and the set \nof principles described in the “Interoperability\
    \ Context-setting Framework” to TE [4].  In doing so we are \nidentifying the\
    \ “interoperability” challenges to be considered for TE.  As with the GWAC Stack\
    \ itself, a \nnumber of cross-cutting and end-to-end issues need to be considered,\
    \ including those related to the \nGWAC Stack and new ones specific to TE. \n\
    4.1 \nPolicy and Market Design \nAn initial view of the policy and market design\
    \ drivers is provided in Section 2.3 where the economic and \nmarket context is\
    \ presented.  This section begins with a more detailed discussion of policy considerations.\
    \  \nThese include traditional concerns such as system reliability joined by new\
    \ concerns such as renewable \nportfolio standards and the variability of renewable\
    \ energy resources as they become an increasing part of \nthe power mix in response\
    \ to those standards.  The section then discusses policy and market design \n\
    considerations stemming from TE. \nFrom the Resnick Institute’s Grid 2020 report\
    \ [5], “The electric industry, driven by 30 years of energy \npolicy, technology\
    \ and commercial innovation, is experiencing significant growth in intermittent\
    \ \nrenewable resources, responsive demand, on-site generation and customer participation\
    \ in markets.  These \ngrowth trends point toward a significantly different electric\
    \ system by 2020 in many parts of the United \nStates.  In essence, the electric\
    \ industry is transitioning from the traditional vertical structure of \ndeterministic\
    \ centralized production and operations into a more horizontal structure that\
    \ is increasingly \nvariable and distributed in terms of productions and operations.”\
    \ \nThe report goes on to state that “to date, 37 states representing over 80%\
    \ of the US population have \nenacted renewable portfolio standards or goals that\
    \ require 10% to 33% of energy delivered to customers \nby 2020.  These mostly\
    \ variable resources present an operating challenge since the amount of power\
    \ over \nthe next month; hour or even the next minute is generally harder to predict\
    \ than power available from \nhydro, gas, coal or nuclear plants.  While many\
    \ of these renewable plants were originally interconnected \nto transmission systems,\
    \ more recently large amounts of rooftop solar have begun to create operating\
    \ and \neconomic issues for distribution systems.” \nFurther, “Customers are becoming\
    \ active participants in electricity markets and grid operations.  The \nadoption\
    \ of on-site generation and responsive demand capabilities is allowing customers\
    \ to also provide \nexcess energy and services in the market.”  This means that\
    \ existing market and grid control systems, \nPage 17 \n \nThe Transactive Energy\
    \ Framework is a work of the GridWise® Architecture Council \nTransactive Energy\
    \ Framework \n \nVer. 1.0 \n \nbased on traditional centralized resources and\
    \ one-way distributed power flows, require new policies, \ntariffs, operational\
    \ paradigms, systems architectures, and market structures.  Many policy issues\
    \ must be \naddressed to ensure that this transition is successful.  These policy\
    \ development challenges arise for \nseveral reasons, including the following:\
    \ \n• extreme reliability.  The power grid is extremely reliable and consumers\
    \ expect it to stay that way.  \nWhen a customer turns on a switch, the customer\
    \ expects high-quality power to flow. \n• volatility of some renewable generation\
    \ and customer demand.  How the variability of power \nfrom PV solar or wind generation\
    \ and customer load/supply on the grid will affect the integrated \nelectrical\
    \ system is not well understood. \n• timescales of economic and grid control actions.\
    \  The grid is extremely reliable because it is \ncontrolled adaptively at timescales\
    \ of seconds.  By contrast, contracts between load-serving entities \nand power-generation\
    \ companies last for many decades.  In the coming decade, millions of \nindependent\
    \ agents, individuals, and devices will make economic and control decisions at\
    \ vastly \ndifferent timescales. \n• rapid changes in technology.  The cost effectiveness\
    \ of solar power has improved significantly in a \nfew years and may well continue\
    \ to improve rapidly.  The technology of energy storage systems is, \nlikewise,\
    \ improving.  Similarly, the energy efficiency of common appliances/electrical\
    \ loads \ncontinues to increase (particularly in the fields of lighting; heating,\
    \ ventilation, and air-conditioning \n(HVAC); and water heating), combined with\
    \ simpler techniques to remotely monitor and control \nthese devices.  The growing\
    \ population of electric vehicles and their charging devices represent an \nentire\
    \ new class of consuming (and potentially generating) assets.  Bulk energy contracts\
    \ span \nmultiple decades and during that time advances in technologies may cause\
    \ seismic shifts in the energy \neconomy. \n• incentives for reducing dependence\
    \ on fossil fuels.  Some governments and agencies provide \nsubstantial incentives\
    \ for renewable energy generation and for improving energy efficiencies of \n\
    homes, offices, and factories, and accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles.\
    \  The influence of \ncurrent incentives and expectations of future incentives\
    \ makes long-term analyses of markets \nchallenging. \nThe aforementioned items\
    \ are a restatement of the objectives summarized in Section 2.1.  As described\
    \ in \nthat section, the problem is to achieve multi-objective optimization. \
    \ Transactive energy approaches are \nintended to do so through the combination\
    \ of economic practices, such as markets, with distributed \ncontrol systems so\
    \ that all objectives may be addressed.  The economic aspects of TE, however,\
    \ relate to \nexisting Federal and State policies and regulations.  From an interoperability\
    \ point of view there is a need, \nthen, for alignment of regulation and policy\
    \ in several dimensions.  For example, TE systems may be \nimplemented across\
    \ multiple jurisdictions.  This may happen horizontally if a TE implementation\
    \ engages \nmultiple utilities, especially if they are in multiple states.  In\
    \ addition, one may think of this as happening \nvertically for TE implementations\
    \ that operate from “end-to-end” linking the bulk power and distribution \nsystems.\
    \ \nFor TE implementations engaging multiple regulatory jurisdictions there is\
    \ a need for some consistency \nof approach in formulating related policy and\
    \ regulations.  At the same time, one can ask how any given \nimplementation impacts\
    \ existing policy and regulations.  One concern, given the integration of \nengineering\
    \ and economic mechanisms, is whether a given implementation violates any “firewall”\
    \ \nrequirements between markets and operations. \nPage 18 \n \nThe Transactive\
    \ Energy Framework is a work of the GridWise® Architecture Council \nTransactive\
    \ Energy Framework \n \nVer. 1.0 \n \nThere is similarly a need to consider how\
    \ a given TE implementation interacts with existing market \nstructures.  As already\
    \ discussed in Section 2.2 and illustrated in Figure 2, power system operations\
    \ occur \non many time scales.  The combination of engineering controls and economic\
    \ structures is strongest in the \ntime scales from seconds to minutes.  The interfaces\
    \ with existing market structures should be considered \nwithin this time band.\
    \ \nGoing forward, there is a clear need for convergence of Federal and State\
    \ policies, wholesale and retail \nmarkets, resource control systems, transmission\
    \ and distribution control systems, and customer energy \nmanagement systems to\
    \ achieve the scale and scope envisioned in public policy.  As such, policy action\
    \ \nto transition from tariffs and incentives that are unsustainable in the long\
    \ term to a TE framework that \nappropriately values energy services in supporting\
    \ grid optimization must address each of the issues listed \nabove.  Such policy\
    \ must focus on aligning stakeholder (Figure 6) interests to support the reliability\
    \ of the \npower systems in an economically fair market design.   \n \nFigure\
    \ 6:  Transactive energy stakeholders. \nBy understanding each stakeholder’s primary\
    \ goal across the evolving energy landscape, fair energy \npolicies and market\
    \ mechanisms may be designed to motivate behaviors that support the overall health\
    \ of \nthe electric system and its participants.  For example, consumers of energy\
    \ (or by proxy distributed \ngeneration [DG] leasing companies that own and operate\
    \ equipment at consumer premises) would like to \nmaximize their return on investment\
    \ in their energy technology.  This means that despite incentives and \nfavorable\
    \ tariffs, additional mechanisms that monetize the participation of the consumers’\
    \ energy \nequipment in reliability services may have strong appeal to the following:\
    \  \n• Distribution utilities that manage the delivery of power and are responsible\
    \ for the reliability of the \nelectric distribution network would like access\
    \ to reliability services, such as voltage support and \nsupplemental reactive\
    \ power to help manage and balance a distribution system that now involves two-\n\
    way power flows;  \n• Independent system and regional transmission operators that\
    \ serve as reliability coordinators of \nthe bulk electric system would like access\
    \ to energy and ancillary services aggregated from customers \nthat own DG across\
    \ their control areas when supplies are tight or frequency is drifting out of\
    \ tolerance \non the system.   \nHence, policies that align these interests would\
    \ include pricing and valuation of consumer energy \nservices.  Such pricing and\
    \ valuation should be optimized to contribute to distribution system reliability\
    \ \nPage 19 \n \nThe Transactive Energy Framework is a work of the GridWise® Architecture\
    \ Council \nTransactive Energy Framework \n \nVer. 1.0 \n \nwith mechanisms that\
    \ aggregate from retail markets and participate in wholesale market support when\
    \ \nrequired. \nUsing localized retail market mechanisms as opposed to standard\
    \ cost recovery tariffs spread across \nutilities’ customer bases represents a\
    \ great challenge for cost of service regulation.  Current service \nregulation\
    \ is based on standard services provided in exclusive service franchises.  It\
    \ is very likely that \nregulatory innovations such as the following will be needed\
    \ to enable at least some portions of the \ninnovative transactive market strategies\
    \ suggested above: \n• retail rate redesign, to allow a larger portion of fixed\
    \ network costs to be recovered through fixed \ncharges, and also to establish\
    \ more equitable rate incentives for DERs \n• standardized regulatory treatment\
    \ for investments in grid modernization, based upon sound principles \nof long-term\
    \ customer benefit \n• a regulatory policy that effectively separates allowed\
    \ cost recovery for necessary infrastructure \ninvestments from earnings associated\
    \ with new platform services.  This policy provides more latitude \nfor the use\
    \ of customer intelligence in new service offerings, and establishes suitable\
    \ affiliate rules \nthat will enable utilities to partner with other companies\
    \ in offering new products and services. \n• policies that enable the creation\
    \ of profitable local market coordination services to facilitate customer \nparticipation\
    \ in providing energy service to bulk power system and distribution operations\
    \ \n• policies that confer upon utilities the right to own DERs and/or provide\
    \ services related to these, and \nestablish the conditions under which investments\
    \ in these are subject to regulated cost recovery. \nIdeally, policy makers would\
    \ have a TE toolkit available to them that would include a catalog of policy \n\
    guidance and mechanisms such that regulators could compose TE policies specific\
    \ to the needs of their \nregulated jurisdictions.  However, any policy would\
    \ require flexibility to compensate for deficiencies in \nmarket design (such\
    \ as undue market power or gaming) that are discovered in the course of market\
    \ \noperations.  In addition, regulators may take a conservative, phased approach\
    \ to introducing TE \nmechanisms in their jurisdictions by using familiar tariff\
    \ constructs and testing the effectiveness of certain \npricing and market designs\
    \ in limited pilots to ensure participants are properly incentivized and aligned\
    \ \nthrough these mechanisms. \nTransactive energy approaches for DER integration\
    \ will differ from current approaches.  It is important \nthat policy makers recognize\
    \ at least two of these differences:  \n• controllability of the large-scale influx\
    \ of DERs is not currently addressed \n• economic value is currently insufficiently\
    \ expressed and captured. \nAs policy makers realize these fundamental differences\
    \ between present and future systems, their focus \nshould move to designing policies\
    \ to maximize customer engagement and accommodate the scale of \nDERs that will\
    \ enter the system in future.  This should yield policies and market designs that\
    \ support the \nfollowing: \n• customer value.  Customers need to be exposed,\
    \ if they so choose, to more than the limited value \nstreams that exist today.\
    \  There also needs to be mechanisms that are able to monetize the value \nstreams\
    \ in a transparent manner. \n• merger of economics and control.  Economic systems\
    \ need to be designed that bridge the gap \nbetween operators and market makers\
    \ and do not violate the control objectives.  Regulators need to \nPage 20 \n\
    \ \nThe Transactive Energy Framework is a work of the GridWise® Architecture Council\
    \ \nTransactive Energy Framework \n \nVer. 1.0 \n \nensure the full suites (toolkits)\
    \ of mechanisms (organized markets, forward markets, tariff-based, and \nreal-time\
    \ prices) are available to express value streams to customers. \nThe objectives\
    \ supporting the customer value and the economics of control principles that policy\
    \ makers \nneed to consider when designing markets and policies are as follows:\
    \ \n• Create a more level playing field for all stakeholders. \n• Respect ownership,\
    \ jurisdictional boundaries, and customer privacy, \n• Expand opportunities for\
    \ engagement between customers and the grid, \n• Allow customers to control their\
    \ relationships with the energy infrastructure, \n• Increase customer choice to\
    \ provide services to the system and the services they choose to purchase \nas\
    \ both producers and consumers of energy. \n• Spur technical and commercial innovation.\
    \ \n• Recognize and account for impacts on business models of current key entities\
    \ such as the load-\nserving entities (LSEs). \n• Optimize system reliability\
    \ and capital infrastructure investment. \nMeeting these objectives should achieve\
    \ the goal of creating a fair and transparent energy market that \nallows economic\
    \ value realization proportional to contributions to support grid reliability,\
    \ support \nadoption of new DERs, and provide services that distribution and transmission\
    \ operators may call upon to \nensure a highly reliable power grid is available\
    \ to power society. \n4.2 \nBusiness Models and Value Realization \nAs described\
    \ in Section 2.1 above, fundamental forces are driving a significant change in\
    \ the electricity \nindustry, and leading to the creation of a new energy paradigm.\
    \  It is important to recognize that as the \nelectric power system continues\
    \ to evolve some business models may no longer be viable.  However, \nopportunities\
    \ now exist for businesses to avail themselves of opportunities by creating and\
    \ sharing new \nvalue streams with customers, aided by new and innovative market\
    \ designs and regulatory policies, as \ndiscussed in Section 4.1.  In particular,\
    \ the Transactive Energy Framework provides an opportunity for \nbusiness models\
    \ to evolve in a way that helps reconcile the need for increased customer choice\
    \ and \nparticipation, while respecting the operational needs of the power system.\
    \   \n4.2.1 Customer Evolution and Value Streams \nGrowing penetration of DERs\
    \ that are owned by customers or third-parties introduces change and \nopportunity\
    \ for reformulation of business models.  Utilities have the opportunity to engage\
    \ the DERs as \nactive elements of the overall electric power system and coordinate\
    \ their flexibility to help alleviate \nproblems introduced by variable resources\
    \ and new variable loads.  A key to achieving this coordination \nis clear understanding\
    \ of both utility and DER owner value streams and respect for ownership boundaries.\
    \  \nBuilding on these principles new business models may be defined.  \n4.2.1.1\
    \ Alignment of Value Streams \nFed by seemingly unlimited and increasingly accessible\
    \ information, customer expectations (across the \ncustomer classes) of the reliability\
    \ and quality of service, lower costs, and eco-friendly options are rising.  \n\
    In addition, customers have access to new revenue opportunities and value streams—aided\
    \ by innovative \nPage 21 \n \nThe Transactive Energy Framework is a work of the\
    \ GridWise® Architecture Council \nTransactive Energy Framework \n \nVer. 1.0\
    \ \n \nmarket designs and regulatory policies—by providing services to the grid.\
    \  Figure 7 shows 30 value \nstreams that may conceivably be exposed to customers\
    \ for providing services spanning across bulk power \nand distribution systems.\
    \   \n \nFigure 7:  Value streams available to DERs. \nTransactive energy approaches\
    \ present an opportunity for utilities, in addition to third parties, to provide\
    \ \nvalue-added services to customers and extend their business models beyond\
    \ the regulated sphere.  Viable \ntransactive approaches, however, should introduce\
    \ the opportunity to create and align value streams for \nall participating entities.\
    \  In other words, the value realized by the distribution utility should not be\
    \ at the \nexpense of either the customer or the transmission system operator\
    \ or the generator (the same applies for \ncustomer utility streams).  The need\
    \ for multi-objective (operational and economic) optimization requires \nthis\
    \ alignment.  Existing business models may not support this value creation and\
    \ alignment; they need to \nbe examined from this point of view, adjusted when\
    \ necessary, and in some cases new business models \nwill emerge.  This last point\
    \ is especially true when considering the second-and third-degree opportunities\
    \ \nthat emerge from greater customer engagement for provision of various grid\
    \ services. \nPage 22 \n \nThe Transactive Energy Framework is a work of the GridWise®\
    \ Architecture Council \nTransactive Energy Framework \n \nVer. 1.0 \n \n4.2.1.2\
    \ Customer Choice \nCustomers are gaining the ability to have greater control\
    \ over their energy supply and management \noptions.  To the extent that they\
    \ exercise this capability, they evolve from passive consumers to active \nparticipants\
    \ in managing the supply and delivery of electricity.  This evolution, if adopted\
    \ on a \nsufficiently large scale, could ultimately transform the entire electrical\
    \ grid.  Business models that use \ntransactive approaches have the potential\
    \ to extend greater control of customer assets to the customers \nthemselves,\
    \ while providing the necessary value streams to all participants.   \nClosely\
    \ associated with the issue of customer choice is who controls any given asset.\
    \  The most desirable \noutcome is that the asset owner controls the asset.  The\
    \ whole idea of transactive approaches is to provide \nan economic incentive for\
    \ the owner to operate the asset in a beneficial manner that supports global \n\
    optimization.  The need to do this may be appreciated by considering the problem\
    \ of coordinating the \nactivity of millions of assets, spread across multiple\
    \ utilities (and thus jurisdictions.) \n4.2.1.3 Market Potential \nThe potential\
    \ size of opportunity stemming from customer adoption of DERs and related services\
    \ is \ndifficult to quantify, but estimates from different sources suggests that\
    \ it may total about $165 billion in \nincremental revenue through 2020.  This\
    \ rough estimate suggests that there is more than enough market \nopportunity\
    \ to support lucrative new market ventures for utilities and other third-party\
    \ service providers. \n4.2.2 Adaptive Business Strategies \nGiven the technology-driven\
    \ changes in electricity markets, and the need to tap into market potential, the\
    \ \nchallenge for utilities and third-party providers is to understand how the\
    \ value chain in electricity markets \nis changing.  This understanding should\
    \ foster the development of business models that lead to proper \nalignment of\
    \ values across the participating entities.   \n4.2.3 Business Value Creation\
    \ and Capture \nDelivering value to customers involves one of two approaches:\
    \  volume services and custom solution \noriented businesses.  These two models\
    \ are defined as follows: \n• volume:  a high transactional approach where significantly\
    \ smaller dollar amounts and more frequent \ntransactions with millions of customers\
    \ are the objective \n• custom solution:  a complex-systems approach focused on\
    \ growing a customer base of thousands \nwith each generating a few high-dollar,\
    \ high-margin transactions per year through customer intimacy.   \nWith either\
    \ approach, net operating margins will depend on the total value added, which\
    \ in turn will \ndepend upon three key factors:  strategic platforms, control\
    \ points, and sources of revenue, as described \nbelow.  The business design concepts\
    \ can be combined into successful business models as described in \nSection 4.2.3.4.\
    \ \n4.2.3.1 Platforms \nPlatforms are a set of information technology, physical\
    \ infrastructure, and standardized business \nprocesses integrated to provide\
    \ unique services.  Two basic platform types apply to the volume services \nand\
    \ custom solutions approaches, respectively: \nPage 23 \n \nThe Transactive Energy\
    \ Framework is a work of the GridWise® Architecture Council \nTransactive Energy\
    \ Framework \n \nVer. 1.0 \n \n• Volume businesses are increasingly using open\
    \ marketplaces and portals (multi-sided interaction \nplatforms) designed to enable\
    \ multiple buyers and sellers to engage in a variety of transactions or \nsimply\
    \ find products and services. \n• Custom solutions tend to rely on platforms that\
    \ provide standardized business processes oriented to \nachieving specific desired\
    \ enterprise or residential customer outcomes. \nDepending on the business model\
    \ (i.e., volume services vs. custom solutions) and value streams to be \ncaptured,\
    \ a combination of different transactive mechanisms may be needed to properly\
    \ align interests of \nall the participating entities. \n4.2.3.2 Strategic Control\
    \ Points \nEvery good business has at least one strategic control point (i.e.,\
    \ where influence can be exerted over the \nuse of a value chain, or between networks\
    \ of value chains to gain competitive advantage and improve \nprofitability).\
    \  Customer adoption of DERs has seen more utilities lose “control” over a substantial\
    \ \nportion of their sales and profitability, not to mention the potential for\
    \ additional reductions in sales due \nto energy efficiency measures.  However,\
    \ corresponding opportunities can add new value by providing \nnetwork services\
    \ and creating multi-sided platforms, using transactive mechanisms, that allow\
    \ DER \ncustomers and others to realize the full value of their investments. \
    \  \n4.2.3.3 Revenue Models \nHistorically, the electricity industry has participated\
    \ very narrowly by focusing on capturing value along \nthe traditional electricity\
    \ production-to-consumption value chain.  Today, opportunities are available to\
    \ \ncapture additional value by “growing the pie” along other related dimensions.\
    \  In fact, opportunities are \nalready being monetized in the electricity industry\
    \ in two of these dimensions.  Including the conventional \nvalue chain, three\
    \ degrees (dimensions) of value may be stated as follows: \n1. Value from the\
    \ primary energy channel; i.e., the traditional “core business” of the utility,\
    \ including \nunregulated energy trading activities and support services such\
    \ as energy efficiency and demand \nresponse programs. \n2. Value from service/product\
    \ sales through fees and revenue sharing from co-marketing, co-branding, \nor\
    \ referrals that are related to the core business (e.g., appliance sales, energy\
    \ equipment maintenance \nand financing). \n3. Value from service/product sales\
    \ that are not directly related to the core business, but are made \npossible\
    \ by capitalizing on information/intelligence derived from the first two streams\
    \ (e.g., non-\nenergy related financial services, security, water-related services).\
    \ \nThese three degrees of value can and are being combined to create more compelling\
    \ business strategies \nfor new and existing ventures.  Transactive mechanisms\
    \ will allow utilities to extend revenue streams \nbeyond their core business\
    \ via greater customer engagement for provision of grid services in return for\
    \ \nmonetary incentives; this will result in an alignment of the value streams\
    \ of all interested parties.  The \nvalues from the secondary and tertiary sources\
    \ may be by-products of greater customer engagement \nfostering an eco-system\
    \ of third-party providers of specialized services.   \n \nPage 24 \n \nThe Transactive\
    \ Energy Framework is a work of the GridWise® Architecture Council \nTransactive\
    \ Energy Framework \n \nVer. 1.0 \n \n4.2.3.4 Business Models  \nThe following\
    \ discussion illustrates how the business design concepts above can be combined\
    \ into \nsuccessful business models that provide a variety of services using different\
    \ transactive mechanisms.   \nVolume Services:  Market Facilitator  \nOne volume-based\
    \ opportunity is to create an enabling platform for DER transactions among many\
    \ \nmarket participants.  It may be most natural for utilities to serve the role\
    \ of market facilitators, although, \nother third-party providers may just as\
    \ well be contracted to serve in such a role.  Potential users of such a \nplatform\
    \ include not just retail commodity suppliers, but also demand response aggregators,\
    \ third-party \nmerchant DG and storage providers, and customers with excess distributed\
    \ energy.  In addition to \nrecovering fixed infrastructure costs through access\
    \ fees, incremental revenue might also be obtained \nfrom fees charged for managing\
    \ transactions between participants—not unlike eBay and PayPal.  This \nwould\
    \ include facilitating, clearing, and settling multi-party transactions related\
    \ to bilateral and perhaps \nauction-based deals for DERs.  It is likely that\
    \ distribution utilities may also need to procure balancing \nservices from these\
    \ resources to manage distribution operations.  Such services could include voltage\
    \ and \nVAr optimization, phase balancing, and power routing, as well as coordination\
    \ between distribution and \ntransmission operations and bulk power markets. \
    \ A transactive mechanism that fully aligns the interests \nof all participating\
    \ entities—i.e., incentives for customer participation, as well as grid services\
    \ at both \nbulk and distribution systems—would help maximize the value creation,\
    \ and thus the revenue potential, \nof a business venture acting as market facilitator.\
    \  Successful business ventures in this sphere would \nfurther serve to increase\
    \ the penetration of DERs fostering an eco-system where providers of custom \n\
    solutions proliferate as well.   \nCustom Solutions \nCustom solutions involve\
    \ a wide range of potential revenue sources.  In addition to engineering solutions\
    \ \nand energy portfolio management, direct revenues can be obtained from hedging\
    \ services, brokerage \nservices, operations and maintenance services, and supply\
    \ management (including distributed resource \naggregation).  These services have\
    \ been in existence since retail deregulation, but new indirect revenue \nopportunities\
    \ are arising in the areas of lead generation and referrals, and third-degree\
    \ opportunities may \nbe possible from the sale of proprietary applications to\
    \ non-competitive firms in other business sectors.  \nUnique customer solution-based\
    \ services have been provided by energy retrofit firms, onsite generation \nproject\
    \ developers, integrated energy service firms, energy brokers and information\
    \ services firms, and \ncommercial and industrial demand aggregators for more\
    \ than two decades.  The challenge has been that \nnearly all of these have faced\
    \ at least three issues:  1) high customer acquisition costs, 2) difficulties\
    \ in \nscaling operations profitably, and 3) inconsistent or limited revenue potential.\
    \  Today, however, the \nconvergence of expanded data management capabilities,\
    \ sophisticated analytic models, cloud computing, \nand anywhere connectivity\
    \ is allowing firms to develop new technology platforms that can form a new \n\
    foundation for these businesses.   \n \n \nPage 25 \n \nThe Transactive Energy\
    \ Framework is a work of the GridWise® Architecture Council \nTransactive Energy\
    \ Framework \n \nVer. 1.0 \n \nBusiness Benefits \nTransactive mechanisms that\
    \ properly align value streams across all interested parties will lead to greater\
    \ \nproliferation of DERs.  This in turn will lead to an increase in volume services,\
    \ potentially leading to \ngreater need for and provision of custom solutions\
    \ as well.  Utilities may be able to substitute volume \nservices (and revenues)\
    \ of one kind—provision of electrons—for a role as a market facilitator for better\
    \ \ncoordination and control of DERs, thereby extending the value streams.   \n\
    4.3 \nConceptual Architecture Guidelines \nThe purpose of this section is to provide\
    \ guidance on the creation of a conceptual architecture for TE.  \nThis section\
    \ does not provide such an architecture; that is, the work to be done by a core\
    \ team of \nexperienced system architects that and would represent the design\
    \ of a specific example of a TE system.  \nRather, it suggests key elements and\
    \ principles to be considered in the development of the Transactive \nEnergy Conceptual\
    \ Architecture (Figure 8), building upon principles and content that \n• have\
    \ been relied upon in previous related work, or \n• have been useful in the development\
    \ of TE concepts and frameworks to date, or \n• represent the best thinking around\
    \ methods and tools, as determined in the various GWAC workshops \nand working\
    \ sessions on TE. \n \n \nFigure 8:  Transactive energy conceptual architecture\
    \ \nAs depicted in Figure 8, conceptual architecture (also known as a reference\
    \ architecture) is a top-level \nstructural depiction of the abstract components,\
    \ the relationships among these components, and the \nexternally visible properties\
    \ of these components.  It does not specify how to implement any of the \narchitectural\
    \ elements; instead it provides the minimum number of constraints necessary to\
    \ depict what \nneeds to be done without specifying design decisions.  A formal\
    \ definition that has been of use in past \nGWAC and other architecture development\
    \ work is as follows: \nA conceptual architecture is focused on the “what” aspect\
    \ of the solution set.  It is \nindependent of any solution, and is benefits-driven.\
    \  It provides a stable foundation for \nConceptual \nLogical\nPhysical\nPhysical\n\
    Logical\nPhysical\nPage 26 \n \nThe Transactive Energy Framework is a work of\
    \ the GridWise® Architecture Council \nTransactive Energy Framework \n \nVer.\
    \ 1.0 \n \narchitectural decisions that are made at the logical (how) and physical\
    \ (with what) phases \nof the architecture process.  A conceptual architecture\
    \ supports one or more logical \narchitectures and a logical architecture supports\
    \ one or more physical architectures.   \n4.3.1 Guiding Architectural Principles\
    \ \nThe GWAC recommends that a Transactive Energy Conceptual Architecture, like\
    \ any architecture, be \nbased on rigorous foundational principles wherever possible.\
    \  To that end, the following principles are \nlisted as starting points for the\
    \ architectural foundation: \n1. Strong consideration should be given to the inherent\
    \ structure of the energy systems under \nconsideration; the hierarchical structure\
    \ of large-scale power delivery systems from the Balancing \nAuthority to distribution\
    \ grid endpoint on one hand, and the smaller scale less hierarchical structure\
    \ \nof micro-grids on  the other.  Likewise, the existing control structure for\
    \ involved energy systems \nshould be considered when developing the structure\
    \ of the TE architecture. \n2. Self-similarity or an approximation may be evident\
    \ in the relevant structures and should be \nconsidered as a means of obtaining\
    \ scalability and organizational regularity (as a means of dealing \nwith complexity),\
    \ but recognize that differing goals may apply at different levels in the recursion.\
    \ \n3. Layering for optimization decomposition may be considered as a mathematical\
    \ foundation for \nstructure of the control and coordination portions of the architecture.\
    \ \n4. The architecture should be agnostic to the general physical layer (refer\
    \ to the Control Abstraction \nModel):  specific sensors and controls, energy\
    \ types, etc., should not be specified nor eliminated by \nthe architecture. \n\
    5. The ability of the TE system to operate should not be limited to any specific\
    \ type of communications \nnetwork or specific technology; e.g., it must not be\
    \ limited to broadband Internet communications \nonly. \n6. The architecture should\
    \ accommodate open international standards, and must not restrict \nimplementations\
    \ to proprietary interfaces, algorithms, communication protocols, or application\
    \ \nmessage formats. \n7. To the extent possible, the architecture should be adaptable\
    \ to changes in underlying energy systems, \nin terms of structure, capabilities,\
    \ business models, and innovation in value creation and realization. \n8. The\
    \ architecture should include plans for convergence of network types over time:\
    \  physical networks \n(energy system infrastructures), information and communication\
    \ networks, financial networks, and \nsocial networks. \n4.3.2 Scope of the Conceptual\
    \ Architecture for Transactive Energy \nThe scope of the conceptual architecture\
    \ for TE must address the following elements:  \n• Reference Model:  This is a\
    \ depiction of the problem domain. \n– \nDomain diagram – graphical depiction\
    \ of the problem space, showing key elements in relation to \neach other \n– \n\
    Industry descriptions and emerging trends analyses \n– \nKey use case list – list\

    \ regard to a specific use \ncase, but arise due to the fundamental nature of\
    \ the problem  \nPage 27 \n \nThe Transactive Energy Framework is a work of the\

    \ \n– \nControl federation and disaggregation \n4.3.3 Organizing Paradigms \n\
    The following are some of the key architecture models that have been used in the\
    \ development of TE \nprinciples.  The first two are the GridWise Architecture\
    \ Council's Interoperability Framework (the \nGWAC Stack) in Figure 9 and the\
    \ National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Smart Grid \nConceptual\
    \ Model in Figure 10.  One of the major benefits that TE management provides is\
    \ an approach \nthat can establish interoperability and integration across the\
    \ entire energy value chain from bulk \ngeneration through end-use consumption\
    \ and that can also convey objectives for one or more layers of the \nGWAC Stack.\
    \  Within any layer, value can be determined for every objective or constraint,\
    \ and by \ncombining the values from all the layers, the needs of all layers can\
    \ be represented at any interface point \nwithin or between domains in the Smart\
    \ Grid Conceptual Model. \n \nPage 28 \n \nThe Transactive Energy Framework is\

    \ energy management is a relatively simple and flexible concept that can map onto\
    \ any part of \nthe electricity value chain, as discussed above.  The Grid Vision\
    \ 2050 Transactive Energy Abstraction \nModel in Figure 11 captures this thought:\
    \  any transactive entity in the system can be decomposed using \nthis model [10].\
    \  A good example is a storage entity that can at times be a user of energy or\
    \ a maker \n(supplier) of energy.  It can both respond to requests from other\
    \ transactive entities in the system and it \ncan issue requests to other entities.\

    \ \n4.4 \nCyber-Physical Infrastructure \nThe Cyber-Physical Infrastructure deals\
    \ with the technical layers of the GWAC Stack, and the physical \nlayers of the\
    \ Control Abstraction Stack.  The power grid architecture includes two cyber-physical\
    \ \nnetworks—the electrically connected network and the communications networks\
    \ necessary to monitor \nand control it.  When the grid was first instantiated,\
    \ there was no communications network of any kind, so \nthe grid was designed\
    \ to deliver power with highly optimized local control to protect equipment and\
    \ \nsupport safe operation of the grid.  As the grid has evolved, an increasingly\
    \ pervasive communications \nnetwork has emerged to support the ever-increasing\
    \ demands on grid infrastructure and to ensure the \ncontinued safe and reliable\
    \ operation of the grid as a system of systems.   \nThe physical power grid is\
    \ made up of a large number of interconnected networks; each of these networks\
    \ \ngrew independently to support local customers and then was connected to a\
    \ larger, higher-voltage \nnetwork to interconnect the local networks.  Over time\
    \ the local networks have acquired the name \n“distribution network” or “distribution\
    \ grid” and the higher-voltage network has acquired the name \n“transmission network”\
    \ or “transmission grid”; for the purposes of this section they will be referred\
    \ to as \ndistribution and transmission, respectively.   \n \nFigure 13:  Grid\
    \ communications technologies. \nBecause of the decentralized nature of the design\
    \ and construction of the network, there are few common \nstandards and the transmission\
    \ SCADA systems is largely regionalized at best.  Each operator working \nwith\
    \ its chosen vendors evolved its protocols as needed to support specific sections\
    \ of the grid.   \nTransactive energy applications will operate in both the cyber\
    \ domain, making use of the communications \ninfrastructure, and the physical\
    \ domain, delivering electricity products and ancillary services.   \nAs we evolve\
    \ the grid further to support the concepts and goals of TE, we must transform\
    \ the cyber-\nphysical elements of the grid.  New sensors, actuators, and distributed\
    \ and centralized control elements \nnot necessary for the traditional operation\
    \ of the grid must now be deployed.  Existing, or legacy, systems \nmust be pressed\
    \ into service to support applications they were not originally designed to support.\
    \  These \ndevices and systems must support information gathering and automation\
    \ in a manner that is much more \nflexible than has been needed for operating\
    \ the traditional grid.  Specifically, features such as \nasynchronous information\
    \ exchange, staged data filtering and pruning, and layered and loosely decoupled\
    \ \nsystem interactions are needed to enhance flexibility. \nThe integration of\
    \ information technology and telecommunications with the traditional electric\
    \ delivery \ninfrastructure can introduce new vulnerabilities that must be addressed.\
    \  Information security standards \nand methodologies have made tremendous progress\
    \ in the past 10 to 15 years, but they require adaptation \nto meet the unique\
    \ requirements of the electric power industry and the continuing evolution of\
    \ hacking \ncapabilities.  Because security weaknesses can potentially be exploited\
    \ to disrupt service over a wide \nportion of the grid, the costs of disruption\
    \ can be high. \nPage 31 \n \nThe Transactive Energy Framework is a work of the\
    \ GridWise® Architecture Council \nTransactive Energy Framework \n \nVer. 1.0\
    \ \n \nSecurity relates to both intentional attacks on the system as well as weaknesses\
    \ and vulnerabilities that \nlead to unintentional failures, errors, and sub-optimal\
    \ performance of system components and operations. \nTo make the grid work the\
    \ way it needs to over time, new sensors, from relays and line sensors on the\
    \ \ndistribution system, to meters at the customer premises and updated sensors\
    \ on the transmission grid are \nrequired.  Initially TE systems will be overlaid\
    \ on the existing system, using what is available to “make \ndo.”  But as things\
    \ evolve, and sensors and other equipment are deployed, the system will become\
    \ more \nrobust and will be able to benefit from the newly introduced capabilities.\
    \   \nToday’s demand response programs (distributed generation, storage, and other\
    \ possible energy elastic \nitems connected to the grid) are a hodge-podge run\
    \ by separate and disparate organizations, including \nISOs, distribution utilities,\
    \ aggregators, and retailers.  While these work reasonably well, each operates\
    \ \nindependently of the others, and most require one or more operators in the\
    \ loop to activate and monitor \nthe demand response event.   \nOne of the integrating\
    \ roles of TE is to provide a translation and communications capability between\
    \ \ndemand response programs.  This will allow an operator at the highest level\
    \ in the system to send signals \nto the various operators and entities that run\
    \ the grid, all the way to customer premises where the \ncustomer-programmed devices\
    \ or the customer themselves can make a decision about whether to respond \nto\
    \ the signal or not.   \nThese multiple levels of control differ greatly from\
    \ what exist today in that they require end-to-end \ncommunications, with interoperability\
    \ between systems.  Also, multiple parties influence the decision \ncriteria at\
    \ the various levels.  Transactive energy solutions may be well suited to support\
    \ these \nrequirements, and should include the following design considerations:\
    \ \n• asynchronous information exchange \n• disengaged data \n• staged data filtering\
    \ and pruning \n• layered and loosely coupled system interactions \n• customer\
    \ device-based decision making (or the customer themselves directly) \n• distributed\
    \ control and control programming. \n4.4.1 Hierarchy of Node Levels  \nThere is\
    \ a hierarchy of physical and logical levels in the current power grid across\
    \ which TE systems and \nmechanisms would operate.  The characteristics of the\
    \ nodes within these different levels are relevant to \nTE.  For purposes of discussion\
    \ in this section messages originate at the top and flow down to lower \nnodes.\
    \  It should be noted that this is just one example and that in the future one\
    \ should expect messages \nto originate at any point in the system and flow from\
    \ there as we move to more distributed systems. \n4.4.1.1 Regional Nodes \nAt\
    \ the highest level is a regional node, which is responsible for balancing a region.\
    \  This regional node is \nresponsible for millions of possible customers and\
    \ a large number of energy sources, for instance, the \nMidwest ISO (MISO) is\
    \ responsible for more than 130,000 MW of generation, 526 TWh of energy billed,\
    \ \nand 48 million people served.  This regional node is an example of the highest\
    \ level of operational \ncoordination that exists today and probably would be\
    \ the highest level of node in an initial TE system.  \nPage 32 \n \nThe Transactive\
    \ Energy Framework is a work of the GridWise® Architecture Council \nTransactive\
    \ Energy Framework \n \nVer. 1.0 \n \nApproximately a dozen of this type of node\
    \ exist in North America.  Each of these nodes already has a \nwholesale market\
    \ with its own transaction architecture for energy, ancillary services, and hedging.\
    \  Each \nregional node would be the origination point for wide-area TE messages,\
    \ as well as more targeted \nmessages that might focus on a single geographic\
    \ area in the region (e.g., the MISO might focus a TE \nmessage on the Chicago\
    \ area to reduce transmission congestion).  \n4.4.1.2 Control Area Nodes \nThe\
    \ next level down would be a legacy control area containing a control center and\
    \ its AGC system.  \nThese control areas tend to be much smaller than regional\
    \ nodes, but all of New York City is in a single \ncontrol area.  The largest\
    \ control areas cover more than 10 million people.  When it comes to TE \ntransactions\
    \ a control area would receive TE transactions from a regional node, and translate\
    \ that \ntransaction into transactions to be sent onward to the generation units\
    \ in its AGC and potentially to large \ncustomers who have either generation or\
    \ demand response contracts, as well as on to distribution \noperators.   \n4.4.1.3\
    \ Distribution Nodes  \nControl areas can be made up of one or more legacy distribution\
    \ systems, and each distribution system \ntypically has a unique way of communicating\
    \ with connected customers.  It might be through an \nautomated metering system,\
    \ via text message, or via a radio station.  The variety of methods means that\
    \ \neach distribution node has to translate TE transactions that it participates\
    \ in with other nodes into \nmessages that are supported by its local systems.\
    \   \nDistribution nodes typically support less than 1 million customers, but\
    \ a few can be as large as 10 million \ncustomers.  There are more than 4,000\
    \ legacy distribution systems across the country, many of which \nhave been aggregated\
    \ into larger distribution networks, while retaining many of their unique \ncharacteristics.\
    \   \nAt the conceptual level there are no differences between distribution nodes\
    \ and control area nodes.   \n4.4.1.4 Market Participation Nodes \nMarket participation\
    \ nodes serve a single market participant.  In the case of MISO there are \napproximately\
    \ 100 market participants.  Many market participants are active in two or more\
    \ regions.   \n4.4.1.5 Supply Nodes \nSupply nodes cover any location that can\
    \ provide additional generation from any source, whether  it is a \ngenerator,\
    \ a large manufacturing site that can switch to its own generation, or another\
    \ site that can provide \nassured supply on a verifiable basis and at a known\
    \ ramp rate.  Supply nodes can be as large as 3,000 \nMW or as small as 1 W (though\
    \ realistically supply nodes will probably be larger).  By definition these \n\
    nodes are registered with the regional node, or the control area node, and have\
    \ a contract for services with \nthat node.   \n4.4.1.6 Building Nodes \nBuilding\
    \ nodes represent any premises or loads that are connected to the overall system.\
    \  This includes all \ncustomers of the distribution system.  In some cases, the\
    \ “building” is actually an equipment cabinet or \neven an electric vehicle and\
    \ its charging equipment, potentially capable of supplying electricity to the\
    \ \nPage 33 \n \nThe Transactive Energy Framework is a work of the GridWise® Architecture\
    \ Council \nTransactive Energy Framework \n \nVer. 1.0 \n \ndistribution system.\
    \  Ninety-nine percent of building nodes that are available are less than 5,000\
    \ square \nfeet in size and on average draw less than 20 KW of power.   \n4.4.2\
    \ Transaction Train \nAt each level in the transaction chain shown in Figure 14\
    \ not only is a pure translation being done, but \nadditional constraints or local\
    \ parameters are added to the mix.  For example, if a premises has a \nlimitation\
    \ of not raising the building temperature above 78 degrees and it is 77 degrees\
    \ now, the premises \nmay provide less in the way of response than if it either\
    \ did not have the constraint or the current \ntemperature were 72 degrees.  \
    \ \n \nFigure 14:  Transaction train model. \nThis example shown in Figure 14\
    \ is a logical view of one way to create a TE system.  The message flow \ndoes\
    \ not have to follow a hierarchy.  It might be peer-to-peer, or it might jump\
    \ from the regional node \ndirectly to the premises, which may respond very differently\
    \ than it would have the day before.  At the \npremises node level in residential\
    \ premises appliances, lighting circuits, and consumer electronics will get \n\
    smarter.  These improvements in consumer products will be developed, not because\
    \ of TE or the needs of \nthe grid, but because the consumers will demand better\
    \ control of their devices and controls that are easier \nto use [20].  As these\
    \ references show, consumer electronics companies may find profitable business\
    \ \nopportunities in supported smart grids including TE.  Transactive energy features\
    \ might be embedded in \nconsumer products or in an energy management agent (as\
    \ specified, for example, in the international \nstandard for energy management\
    \ [21]), so that transactions occur automatically according to parameters \nset\
    \ by the customer. \nTransactive energy can ride on these customer desires and\
    \ provide yet another function for residential \ncustomers to use as they choose.\
    \  Monitoring equipment at the breaker panel or at the meter for \nconsumption\
    \ and other power characteristics will eventually be available and be installed,\
    \ either by the \nutility, by builders who want to be seen as leading edge, or\
    \ by customers who want the neat new shiny \ntoys.  How it gets done does not\
    \ matter, nor does the speed of the evolution, because as each node adds \ndevices,\
    \ these devices can, with the customer’s consent, be added to the overall TE system.\
    \ \nDone early enough, and supporting the translation between enough existing\
    \ protocols, TE can tie the \ndifferent levels of the electrical system together\
    \ into one interoperable whole.  Providing customers with \nmore choices and control,\
    \ while reducing wasted energy and maximizing the value of new investments in\
    \ \nthe overall electrical system.   \nPage 34 \n \nThe Transactive Energy Framework\

    \ systems used to control geographically dispersed assets, \noften scattered over\
    \ thousands of square kilometers, where centralized data acquisition and \ncontrol\
    \ are critical to system operation [25]. \n \nsmart grid \nThe term adopted by\

    \ \nAn exchange or transfer of exchangeable products, services, rights, or funds.\
    \ \n \nvalue \nValue is defined broadly to include both quantitative economic\
    \ value stated, for example, in terms \nsuch as $/kWh, and non-quantitative values\
    \ such as comfort, savings, or other expressions of \nvalue that may come from\
    \ a consumer.  One of the challenges in implementing TE systems is to \ndefine\

    \ \nVer. 1.0 \n \nAppendix A:  Case Studies \nThe case studies provided in this\
    \ appendix make use of the following standardized template.  Use of this \ntemplate\
    \ by others in describing transactive energy (TE) case studies is encouraged.\
    \ \nTitle of the Case Study \n \nCase study characteristics and objectives \n\
    (Provide a description of the overall case study.  Who sponsored it?  What were\
    \ the \nprimary objectives?  When was it implemented?  What was the size and scope\
    \ of \ndeployment?  What were relevant results and findings?)  \n \nTransactive\
    \ Energy Attributes \n \na) Architecture  \nAll TE tools and methodologies are\
    \ described as constituents or subsystems of a system \narchitecture.  A key distinction\
    \ is whether the architecture is centralized, distributed, or a \ncombination\
    \ of the two.  \n(Describe the basic architecture.  Is it distributed vs. centralized?\
    \ ...hierarchical?...) \nb) Extent \nAn implementation of TE technology will typically\
    \ apply within some geographic, \norganizational, political, or other measure\
    \ of extent.  A geographic extent, for example, \nmight be within a region and\
    \ apply across multiple participating entities.  An extent may \nbe described\
    \ organizationally, for example, if an implementation is intended for use \nwithin\
    \ a single utility, building, or campus.  Likewise, a transactive technique may\
    \ apply \nacross political boundaries with different regulatory or policy constraints.\
    \  Extent may \nalso be considered relative to the topology of an electrical infrastructure\
    \ including end-\nusers.  Thus, a transactive technique may apply in transmission,\
    \ distribution, or both; it \nmay also be useful for managing energy within buildings\
    \ or by end-users of electrical \nenergy.  \n(How do the transactive activities\
    \ extend across geographic, organizational, political \ndomains?) \n \nc) Transacting\
    \ parties  \nFundamentally, TE involves transacting parties.  In most cases these\
    \ will be automated \nsystems, possibly acting as surrogates for human parties.\
    \  In some cases humans may be \nin the loop.  A TE mechanism must be explicitly\
    \ describable by the entities that are \nparties to transactions.  Because a TE\
    \ system will provide services to different parties, its \nsuccess in delivering\
    \ these services will depend in part on the expectations and needs of \neach group\
    \ and in part on the qualities of the delivered service.  \n(Describe the parties\
    \ taking part in the transactions.  These may be intelligent systems \nand nodes,\
    \ or human participants.) \n \nd) Transaction \nA transaction is simply a negotiated\
    \ exchange of things.  This also applies in TE where it \nis a communicative activity\
    \ involving two or more parties that reciprocally affect or \ninfluence each other\
    \ through a formal mechanism in order to reach an agreement.  These \nagreements\
    \ must not be one-time agreements but must be subject to continuous review, \n\
    Page A.1 \n \nThe Transactive Energy Framework is a work of the GridWise® Architecture\
    \ Council \nTransactive Energy Framework \n \nVer. 1.0 \n \nand multiple agreements\
    \ that may take place as frequently as sub-second timing.  Rules \nneed to be\
    \ specified for every transactive system such that interdependent operations on\
    \ \nthe system are either all completed successfully or all canceled successfully.\
    \ \n(Identify the economic signals involved and their sources.  What is the definition\
    \ of a \n“transaction” within the system?  Describe the purpose and form of transactions.\
    \  What \nvalues are exchanged between participants?...Automated, or human interactive?\
    \ …) \n \ne) Transacted commodities  \nWhat is transferred or exchanged between\
    \ the transacting parties?  This will typically be \nenergy but could be derivative\
    \ products.  \n(Describe the commodity or commodities exchanged in the transactions.)\
    \ \n \nf) Temporal variability: \nTransactive elements interact across multiple\
    \ time scales.  For example, transactions \nwithin a single system may range from\
    \ sub-second to five minutes or to some longer \nperiodicity.  It is also possible\
    \ for transactions to be event-driven.  In characterizing a \ngiven transactive\
    \ approach the time scale(s) of transactive interactions need to be \nspecified\
    \ and analyzed for compatibility. \n(Describe the time scales involved in the\
    \ transactions.  Are they event-driven \ntransactions?) \n \ng) Interoperability\
    \ \nTransactions are enabled through the exchange of information between transacting\
    \ \nparties.  There are two elements to consider here:  technical interoperability\
    \ and \ncognitive (semantic) interoperability.  The systems have to be able to\
    \ connect and \nexchange information (emphasizing format and syntax), and they\
    \ have to understand the \nexchanges in the context that was intended in order\
    \ to support workflows and constraints.  \nFor any given transaction, the information\
    \ exchanged during a transaction must be \nexplicitly identified.  Furthermore,\
    \ one should be able to explain how interoperability has \nbeen addressed in support\
    \ of the information exchanges. specified and analyzed for \ncompatibility. \n\
    (Describe the level of interoperability between transacting parties.  Is there\
    \ technical \ninteroperability present?  Is there cognitive or semantic interoperability\
    \ present?) \n \nh) Value discovery mechanisms  \nA value discovery mechanism\
    \ is a means of establishing the economic or engineering \nvalue that is associated\
    \ with a transaction.  The value discovery mechanism is a key \nelement of value-driven\
    \ multi-objective optimization.  Value realization may take place \nthrough a\
    \ variety of approaches including an organized market, procurement, a tariff,\
    \ an \nover-the-counter bilateral contract, or a customer’s or other entity’s\
    \ self-optimization \nanalysis.  Value discovery mechanisms should include considerations\
    \ of economic \nincentive compatibility and acceptable behavior. \n(Describe how\
    \ the operative economic or engineering values of completed transactions \nare\
    \ determined.  Is it pulled from an organized market?  Or tariff?  Or is it negotiated\
    \ bi-\nlaterally?) \n \ni) Value assignment \nAssignment of value is fundamental\
    \ to value discovery.  For sub-elements of a TE \nmechanism, a means may be needed\
    \ to assign value for the objectives that cannot be \naddressed through a discovery\
    \ mechanism, values that are needed by the discovery \nPage A.2 \n \nThe Transactive\
    \ Energy Framework is a work of the GridWise® Architecture Council \nTransactive\
    \ Energy Framework \n \nVer. 1.0 \n \nmechanism, or for values that do not have\
    \ a common dimension that can be used for \nvaluation. \n(Describe how the participating\
    \ parties determine subjective value.  This is the value \nthat they assign to\
    \ their particular objectives, and by which they would determine the \nacceptability\
    \ of a proposed transaction.)  \nj) Alignment of objectives \nA key principle\
    \ in TE is the continuous alignment of multiple objectives to achieve \noptimum\
    \ results as the system operates.  This alignment enhances the economic and \n\
    engineering impacts of the dynamic balance(s) achieved by TE.  Note that optimal\
    \ relates \nto the balance of the entire transactive system, and to achieve an\
    \ optimum balance it is \nnecessary to optimize objectives, variables, and constraints.\
    \  It is important to \nunderstand that optimization does not simply add intelligence\
    \ to existing business \nprocesses.  It changes business practices. \n(How are\
    \ the objectives of each participant advanced by the transaction, as well as the\
    \ \nobjectives of other stakeholders not directly participating in the transaction?\
    \  Do the \ntransactions result in win-win-wins—such that not only the directly\
    \ participating parties \nbenefit from the transaction, but the objectives or\
    \ other parties are also advanced or at \nleast not eroded as a side effect of\
    \ the transactions?) \n \nk) Stability assurance \nTransactive energy systems\
    \ through their integration of both engineering and economic \noperational objectives\
    \ are a form of control system.  As such, the stability of a specific TE \nsystem\
    \ much be considered. The stability of grid control and economic mechanisms is\
    \ \nrequired and must be assured.  Considerations of stability must be included\
    \ in the \nformulation of TE techniques and should be demonstrable. Unfortunately,\
    \ there are no \npublic benchmarks for stability and during numerical optimization\
    \ minor errors can \nbuild on each other, and sometimes spiral out of control.\
    \ It is important to mitigate \noptimization instabilities because grid stability\
    \ may be compromised by poor value \noptimization techniques. \n(Has the system\
    \ been designed for, or otherwise analyzed for, the potential impact of the \n\
    transactions on the stability of both the physical grid and of associated markets?\
    \  Have \nspecific considerations or protections been included to assure that\
    \ the transactions, under \nunique situations or through aggregated behavior,\
    \ do not unintentionally introduce \ninstabilities?  Are there any recognized\
    \ mechanisms for intentional instabilities to be \nintroduced either for profit\
    \ [e.g., “gaming” the market] or for malicious intent [e.g., \nterrorist attack.])\
    \ \n \nParticipating agencies and organizations \n(List the participating agencies\
    \ and organizations.) \n \n \nReferences \n(List any relevant references such\
    \ as project reports or published papers that were cited in \nthe case study narrative.)\

    \ Architecture Council \nTransactive Energy Framework \n \nVer. 1.0 \n \nPacific\
    \ Northwest Smart Grid Demonstration (PNWSGD) \n \nProject characteristics and\
    \ objectives \nThe Pacific Northwest Smart Grid Demonstration Project (PNWSGD)\
    \ is developing a \ntransactive coordination and control system to continuously\
    \ coordinate the responses of \nsmart grid assets to meet a wide range of operational\
    \ objectives and achieve benefits both \nlocally and across the entire Pacific\
    \ Northwest.  \n \nThe project kicked off its five-year journey in February 2010.\
    \  The project is one of 16 \nregional smart grid demonstrations funded by the\
    \ American Reinvestment and Recovery \nAct (ARRA).  The budget is $178 million\
    \ total with $89 million from the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy and the remainder\
    \ from project participants (meeting a minimum \nof 50% cost share).  The participants\
    \ include 11 utilities and 5 technology providers.  The \nscope of the project\
    \ includes about 60,000-metered customers across five states (Idaho, \nMontana,\
    \ Oregon, Washington, Wyoming).  The PNWSGD is the largest of the ARRA-\nfunded\
    \ smart grid demonstration projects in the nation.  \n \nThe primary objectives\
    \ of the project are as follows:  \n• Develop a communication and controls infrastructure\
    \ using incentive signals to \nengage responsive assets including distributed\
    \ generation, storage, and demand \nassets. \n• Facilitate the integration of\
    \ renewable resources.  \n• Validate new smart grid technologies and business\
    \ models.  \n• Quantify smart grid costs and benefits.  \n• Advance standards\
    \ for interoperability and cyber security.  \n \nOver 60 MW of total assets are\
    \ engaged in the project.  Assets are organized into asset \nsystems and grouped\
    \ into three categories of smart grid test cases:  transactive control, \nconservation\
    \ and efficiency, and reliability.  The project has 33 transactive control test\
    \ \ncases involving 8 different types of asset systems (conservation voltage reduction,\
    \ \nbuilding and commercial demand response, in-home displays, programmable thermostats,\
    \ \ndistributed generation, battery storage, residential demand response, and\
    \ plug-in hybrid \nelectric vehicle charging.) \n \nThe project is implementing\
    \ transactive control at the interface between transmission and \ndistribution\
    \ (T&D) to test the ability of responsive asset systems to respond to changes\
    \ in \nan incentive signal representing the operational needs of the bulk power\
    \ system.  Though \nthe demonstration project is focused at this interface between\
    \ T&D, the technique is a \ngeneral technique intended for application throughout\
    \ the system from generation \nthrough intermediate control or constraint points\
    \ in T&D, to end-uses.  The incentive \nsignal represents a forecast cost of power\
    \ delivered at any given point in the system.  A \ncorresponding feedback signal\
    \ provides a forecast of net load to be served from any given \npoint in the system.\
    \ \n \nPage A.4 \n \nThe Transactive Energy Framework is a work of the GridWise®\
    \ Architecture Council \nTransactive Energy Framework \n \nVer. 1.0 \n \nTransactive\
    \ Energy Attributes \n \na) Architecture  \nTransactive control is a distributed\
    \ architecture matching the topology of the power \nsystem.  In general, transactive\
    \ control nodes, the name for the distributed control points, \nwill have a mesh\
    \ architecture in the bulk power system and a hierarchical architecture \ncorresponding\
    \ to the typical radial topology of distribution systems below that.  For more\
    \ \ncomplex distribution systems, including micro-grids, the architecture will\
    \ \ncorrespondingly be a form of mesh network. \n \nb) Extent \nThe transactive\
    \ control technology is designed for implementation across any extent from \n\
    use by a local utility, even just on a single feeder, to regional deployment across\
    \ multiple \nutilities.  The technology may be applied to end-to-end spanning\
    \ generation, \ntransmission, distribution, and end-use.  It may be applied in\
    \ both structured and \nunstructured markets and in markets with unbundled service\
    \ providers. \n \nWithin the PNWSGD, 27 transactive nodes are implemented, 14\
    \ of which are \ntransmission zones representing large regions of the Northwest\
    \ transmission system, \nwhile the remaining 13 are utility-site nodes.  Any two\
    \ transmission zone nodes, \nconnected by transmission lines, are obligated to\
    \ exchange transactive signals that \ndescribe the predicted exchange of energy\
    \ between the nodes. \n \nc) Transacting parties  \nThe transacting parties in\
    \ this approach are the transactive control nodes.  For the PNW-\nSGDP, the utility-site\
    \ nodes create at least one transactive node, which includes \ninformation about\
    \ the included circuits, and the responsive assets to be managed by the \nutility.\
    \  Transactive signals at present are not sent to actual distributed assets in\
    \ most \ncases, and hence, the utilities are free to devise control mechanisms\
    \ for these assets.  In \nprinciple however, transactive nodes may be disaggregated\
    \ so that transactive signals are \npotentially exchanged between distributed\
    \ assets directly, enabling more local \ninformation to be part of the transactive\
    \ control system. \n \nd) Transaction \nPNWSGD’s transactive control system (TCS)\
    \ uses an engineering-economic value-based \ntransactive signal, the transactive\
    \ incentive signal (TIS) and a corresponding transactive \nfeedback signal (TFS)—as\
    \ the primary basis for the coordination of supply and demand \nin a distributed\
    \ manner.  The TIS is a price-like signal that represents the unit cost of \n\
    power delivered to any given point in the system, taking into account factors\
    \ including, \nfor example, location, time, transmission congestion, and the transmission\
    \ losses.  The \nTFS represents the plan for consumption of power desired by nodes\
    \ served from the node \nreceiving the TFS.  To clarify this last aspect:  each\
    \ transactive control node sends and \nreceived both TIS and TFS with all immediately\
    \ neighboring nodes. \n \nAll TFSs are forecasts of future local power needs at\
    \ the transactive nodes, expressed in \nkilowatts or megawatts.  Together with\
    \ bulk power-generation projections, renewable \nenergy forecasts and other values,\
    \ the TFS then allows for computation of an incentive \nsignal at the neighboring\
    \ transactive nodes, which is sent back to the nodes.  This TIS is \nexpressed\
    \ in cents per kilowatt-hour and informs the transactive nodes about the cost\
    \ of \ndelivering power to that node. \nPage A.5 \n \nThe Transactive Energy Framework\
    \ is a work of the GridWise® Architecture Council \nTransactive Energy Framework\
    \ \n \nVer. 1.0 \n \nThis approach maintains fidelity to the actual value/cost\
    \ of grid operations, while also \nproviding transparency and a level playing\
    \ field.  By using such a signal, the information \nexchange is simplified, can\
    \ be made able to integrate more resources at different \noperating levels of\
    \ the system, and provides a higher level of robustness by allowing \nhealthy\
    \ parts of the system to adapt in response to system component constraints or\
    \ \nfailures.  The PNWSGD is testing transactive control with more than 20 types\
    \ of \nresponsive smart grid assets applied to residential, commercial, industrial,\
    \ and irrigation \ncustomers. \n \ne) Transacted commodities  \nThe commodity\
    \ transacted in the PNWSGD is energy. \n \nf) Temporal variability \nTransactive\
    \ signals (TISs and TFSs) are exchanged with immediate neighbors at least \nevery\
    \ five minutes.  The signals themselves cover a 72-hour forecast period with variable\
    \ \ngranularity.  For the first 12 intervals values are forecast for every 5-minute\
    \ interval, for \nthe next 20 intervals they are forecast every 15 minutes, for\
    \ the next 18 intervals every \nhour, for the next 4 every 6 hours and for the\
    \ last 2 every day.  This is a total of 56 \nintervals.  A formal model of this\
    \ interval structure is defined.  A formal transactive node \nobject model is\
    \ defined including temporal behavior. \n \ng) Interoperability \nInteroperability\
    \ is supported at multiple levels.  A reference implementation of the TCS \nhas\
    \ been created using the IBM Internet Scale Control System (iCS) tool compliant\
    \ with \nthe International Organization for Standardization/ International Electrotechnical\
    \ \nCommission (ISO/IEC) 18012 interoperability standard [26].  This reference\
    \ \nimplementation addresses basic physical and logical connectivity. \n \nInformation\
    \ interoperability is addressed through the formal definition of the structure\
    \ of \nTIS and TFS using Extensible Markup Language schemas.  A test harness and\
    \ tools have \nbeen implemented for interoperability testing of transactive control\
    \ nodes for proper \nformation and exchange of transactive signals. \n \nh) Value\
    \ discovery mechanisms \nValue discovery is achieved through a negotiation process\
    \ involving the exchange of \nTISs and TFSs between neighboring nodes.  As a simple\
    \ example involving two nodes—\na supply node and a consumer node—the supply node\
    \ sends a TIS with its forward \nforecast of the cost of power.  The consumer\
    \ node sends a TFS with its forward forecast \nof planned consumption.  The supply\
    \ node analyzes the TFS and responds with a new \nTIS representing changes in\
    \ the cost of power delivered given the forecast of \nconsumption.  This change\
    \ would be driven by changes in cost due, for example, to a \nconstraint in ability\
    \ to meet the forecast of consumption.  The consuming node in turn \nresponds\
    \ to the change in TIS forecast by updating its consumption plan if the new \n\
    forecast of cost is not acceptable.  The algorithms for updating the TIS and TFS\
    \ must be \nconstructed to drive to convergence, otherwise oscillations may occur\
    \ in this series of \ninteractions. \n \nAs implemented in the PNWSGD, the technique\
    \ is applied at the interface between T&D.  \nFurther, the TIS for the transmission\
    \ system is based on a synthetic result.  The utility \nnodes are implemented\
    \ at the boundary of the utility and the transmission system.  A \nPage A.6 \n\
    \ \nThe Transactive Energy Framework is a work of the GridWise® Architecture Council\
    \ \nTransactive Energy Framework \n \nVer. 1.0 \n \nlimited set of nodes is associated\
    \ with avoiding demand charges that have the \n“negotiation” interaction with\
    \ interaction between the TIS and TFS within the transactive \ncontrol node. \n\
    \ \nIn summary, the TCS employs an implicit control mechanism, where the actual\
    \ control of \nthe grid is attained by continuous negotiations between neighboring\
    \ transactive nodes.  \nThe transactive signals (TISs and TFSs) are continuously\
    \ updated and exchanged \nbetween neighboring transactive nodes until a settlement\
    \ is reached.  The emergent TIS \nand TFS represent delivered cost of energy,\
    \ and average rate of energy flow between the \ntwo transactive nodes, respectively.\
    \  The mechanism allows for dispatch of grid assets to \noccur in a distributed\
    \ manner while respecting the physical grid constraints and \nmaintaining supply-demand\
    \ balance. \n \ni) Value assignment \nValue assignment is the translation of engineering\
    \ state into economic terms representing \nthe cost of power.  For example, if\
    \ a distribution transformer is overloaded, algorithms \nregarding transformer\
    \ service life can be used to calculate the cost of the overloaded \nstate. \n\
    In the PNWSGD, value assignment is implemented for a variety of conditions modeled\
    \ \nwithin the bulk power system and for the implementation of demand charge avoidance.\
    \  \nValue assignment is implemented in a class of transactive control node functions\
    \ referred \nto as “resource” functions. \nj) Alignment of objectives \nTransactive\
    \ control aligns objectives through correspondence of the transactive control\
    \ \nnode topology with the electric power system topology.  Owners of system elements\
    \ \n(assets) are enabled to affect the cost of power (TIS) or consumption of power\
    \ (TFS) \nthrough the transactive control nodes deployed at the points in the\
    \ topology \ncorresponding to their ownership of assets.  The term “asset” is\
    \ used broadly here to \nrepresent any generation, transmission, distribution,\
    \ or consumption element.  The focus \nof action is local—at each transactive\
    \ control node the objective is to achieve local \noptimization through action\
    \ based on a combination of global information in the TIS and \nTFS and local\
    \ information from that location’s assets. \n \nIn the PNWSGD, for example, the\
    \ TIS associated with the transmission system \nrepresents the needs of the bulk\
    \ power system, for example, supporting wind integration, \nto the local utility.\
    \  The local utility then introduces its own needs, for example, avoiding \ndemand\
    \ charges, and the resulting TIS drives asset system responses. \n \nk) Stability\
    \ assurance \nAt this stage in the research, specific analysis aimed at the impact\
    \ on overall grid or \nmarket stability has not been performed.  The TCS is expected\
    \ to be stable through the \nincorporation of the two signals—TIS and TFS.  The\
    \ use of the two together represents a \nform of closed-loop control.  There is\
    \ still, however, a requirement that the decision-\nmaking algorithms be designed\
    \ to include functionality equivalent to damping to help \nassure system stability.\

    \ and objectives \nThe American Electric Power (AEP) gridSMART demonstration is\
    \ developing a \ntransactive coordination and control system to continuously coordinate\
    \ the responses of \nsmart grid assets to meet a wide range of operational objectives\
    \ and achieve benefits, \nsuch as distribution feeder congestion management, peak\
    \ load management, and \nprovision of ancillary services.  Several hundred residential\
    \ customers in the northeast \nColumbus, Ohio, area have been recruited to examine\
    \ how real-time pricing (RTP) \nmechanisms can be used to engage the heating,\
    \ ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) \nloads to earn incentives for the\
    \ customers by changing their energy use-patterns.  The \ndemonstration uses automated\
    \ home energy management systems to control HVAC \nthermostat settings depending\
    \ on customer preferences and real-time energy prices.  \nPreliminary commissioning\
    \ of the residential systems occurred during spring and early \nsummer of 2013\
    \ and the preliminary tests started in early June 2013. \n \nTransactive Energy\
    \ Attributes \n \na) Architecture  \nThe system implements a distributed architecture\
    \ with transactional participants spread across \nnumerous residences beyond distribution\
    \ feeders in Ohio operated by AEP.   \n \nb) Extent \nThe RTP system runs retail\
    \ electricity markets on four distribution feeders operated by \nAEP in northeast\
    \ Ohio.  For the demonstration, four markets run simultaneously, \nengaging residential\
    \ HVAC loads to provide demand response service based on RTP \ntariff (RTPs) derived\
    \ from PJM’s real-time wholesale energy markets.  There are over \n250 participating\
    \ households distributed over the four feeders. \n \nc) Transacting parties  \n\
    The end-use loads in participating households are HVAC systems controlled by HVAC\
    \ \nEnergy Management Systems (HEMSs), which are enabled to 1) change their energy\
    \ \nconsumption based on the cleared market price, 2) determine the price they\
    \ are willing to \npay for electricity, and 3) bid their desired demand.  The\
    \ residential customers are \nrequired to only enter 1) their desired temperature\
    \ set-points and 2) comfort/economy \nsettings.  The participating households\
    \ transact with the distribution utility by providing \ndemand response based\
    \ services.  The incentives for providing these services are based \non real-time\
    \ market prices. \n \nd) Transactions \nWithin each home is a programmable thermostat\
    \ communicating with an HVAC unit.  \nThe thermostat runs an agent that monitors\
    \ the market price of electricity and converts \nthe residents’ desired temperature\
    \ set-point and their preference setting for more comfort \nor more savings into\
    \ an amount it is willing to bid for the next 5 minutes of electricity.  It \n\
    sends this price along with the amount of electricity needed to a residential\
    \ energy \nmanagement system.  That system assembles all bids in the home (in\
    \ this case the one \nfrom the HVAC thermostat) and communicates the information\
    \ via a cellular connection \nto the dispatch system located in the operations\
    \ center. \nPage A.9 \n \nThe Transactive Energy Framework is a work of the GridWise®\
    \ Architecture Council \nTransactive Energy Framework \n \nVer. 1.0 \n \nThe dispatch\
    \ system assembles the bids from all households on the feeder along with the \n\
    market price for supplying electricity as determined by the RTP tariff (based\
    \ on the \nlocational marginal prices [LMP] at the local PJM load bus) for electricity\
    \ in the feeder’s \nservice area.  The dispatch system clears the market based\
    \ on where supply and demand \nbid curves intersect.  The clearing price is broadcast\
    \ to all homes, where the smart \nthermostat adjusts the HVAC thermostat’s temperature\
    \ set-point.  The clearing price is \nalso sent to the service provider’s operations\
    \ system for billing.  The billing system \nexchanges information with the smart\
    \ meter at the home to obtain the energy used during \nthe 5-minute interval so\
    \ the bill can be calculated.  The consumer display is part of the \nsmart thermostat.\
    \  It displays the estimated billing price for energy so the consumers can \n\
    participate with other energy-saving actions, if they are monitoring the system.\
    \ \n \ne) Transacted commodities  \nThe commodity transacted in the system is\
    \ energy. \n \nf) Temporal variability \nThe participating households’ HVAC systems\
    \ submit demand bids every 5 minutes \nthrough the HEMSs.  The bid is in the form\
    \ of a price-quantity pair, expressing a \nhousehold’s willingness to consume\
    \ a given quantity if the market price is below its bid \nprice.  Real-time retail\
    \ price (base price, the formula for which has been approved by the \nPublic Utilities\
    \ Commission [PUC] of Ohio) that results from market clearing is \ncalculated\
    \ as a function of PJM’s wholesale energy price.  If the distribution feeder \n\
    becomes capacity constrained, i.e., experiences periods of feeder congestion,\
    \ the cleared \nretail price can deviate from the base price.  When the resources\
    \ are engaged to respond \nto feeder capacity constraints or to provide ancillary\
    \ services, any corresponding increase \nin price due to the imposed constraint\
    \ is rebated back to the customer.  If a household \nresponds to an imposed constraint,\
    \ it will also be provided an incentive payment \ncalculated in proportion to\
    \ its level of participation and the amount of energy shifted. \n \ng) Interoperability\
    \ \nThe HEMSs transact with the utility, i.e., AEP, by submitting price-quantity\
    \ bids into the \nreal-time double auction markets.  The smart thermostats connected\
    \ to HEMSs convert \nresidents’ comfort/economy settings and desired temperature\
    \ set-points into price-\nquantity bids.  The communication between HEMSs and\
    \ the utility has a standardized \nform, allowing various vendors to provide products\
    \ that enable customer participation.   \n \nh) Value discovery mechanisms  \n\
    The demonstration’s transactive control and coordination mechanism uses a double\
    \ \nauction market as the means of coordinating the demand and supply in a distributed\
    \ \nmanner.  Multiple households are on each feeder that in turn has its own double\
    \ auction \nmarket, which clears every 5 minutes.  In each market, the households\
    \ (through their \nHEMSs and programmable thermostats) submit demand bids into\
    \ the double auction \nmarket, and upon market clearing, receive a real-time price\
    \ based upon which they adjust \ntheir energy consumption.  A demand bid submitted\
    \ by an HEMS consists of a price-\nquantity pair, expressing its willingness to\
    \ consume.  The real-time prices received by the \nHEMSs are a function of the\
    \ PJM’s wholesale energy prices (LMPs), and the real-time \nelectricity tariff\
    \ (adders to real-time prices) was approved by the PUC of Ohio. \n \nWith this\
    \ market-based mechanism, “control” objectives are achieved by engaging \nhousehold\
    \ resources that respond to fluctuations in the real-time electricity market prices,\
    \ \nPage A.10 \n \nThe Transactive Energy Framework is a work of the GridWise®\
    \ Architecture Council \nTransactive Energy Framework \n \nVer. 1.0 \n \nas opposed\
    \ to direct load control.  Each participating household contains resources, such\
    \ \nas HVAC units and electric water heaters, which bid their willingness to consume\
    \ \nelectricity in the form of price/quantity pairs.  The market aggregates the\
    \ information \nfrom all parties and determines the clearing point of price and\
    \ quantity where the supply \nand demand curves intersect.  \n \nThe double auction\
    \ is a market mechanism that can be described as a two-way market, \nwhere both\
    \ suppliers and end-use loads submit offers and bids, to sell and buy energy \n\
    respectively, into a single energy market.  The auction resolves the supply and\
    \ demand \nbids into a common cleared market price and quantity, and delivers\
    \ this information back \nto the participants.  This approach is highly scalable\
    \ and allows all parties to participate \nand achieve their objectives in a distributed\
    \ manner. \n \ni) Value assignment \nWithin each household, the HEMS uses the\
    \ occupant’s configuration of \ncomfort/economy level and desired temperature\
    \ set-point to determine the price that the \noccupant is willing to pay as a\
    \ function of energy consumption, and this is bid into the \ndouble auction. \
    \ Cleared price in the double auction determines whether a HVAC unit \nconsumes\
    \ energy or not.  In case the cleared price is greater than the bid price, the\
    \ HVAC \nunit turns (or stays) off.  If the HVAC unit turns off due to high prices\
    \ that result from \nfeeder capacity constraints, the households are provided\
    \ incentives for the provision of \ndemand response service to the system.  \n\
    j) Alignment of objectives \nThe RTP system provides incentives to shift the end-use\
    \ resources, thus allowing these \nresources to participate in the balancing of\
    \ supply and demand.  The added flexibility in \noperations generates shared value\
    \ streams for the utility and RTP customers.  These \ninclude energy purchase\
    \ benefits (reducing wholesale purchases in PJM’s real-time \nmarket5), capacity\
    \ cost benefits due to deferment of capital investments, and the potential \n\
    for additional ancillary services.  The transmission system and the system operator\
    \ (PJM) \nbenefit from provision of energy balance and ancillary services from\
    \ demand-side \nresources that cost less than traditional generation resources.\
    \ \n \nk) Stability assurance \nAutomated response to real-time prices from HVAC\
    \ systems ensures system stability as \nlong as the markets clear and the signals\
    \ are transmitted to HEMSs without delay.  In a \nsystem with large amount of\
    \ participating loads, occasional non-compliance of HVAC \nunits to price signals\
    \ (either due to loss of communication or manual intervention) may \nnot cause\
    \ system-wide disturbances. \n \nParticipating agencies and organizations \nAmerican\
    \ Electric Power Ohio is leading the demonstration project.  Pacific Northwest\
    \ \nNational Laboratory is designed the double auction market and real-time rate\
    \ tariff and \nsupported data analysis.   Battelle Memorial Institute supported\
    \ the project \n5 Most utilities purchase bulk of their energy in long-term bilateral\
    \ trades, and only about 5% of energy is procured \nin real-time markets.  Hence,\
    \ reduction in consumer demand only affects a small fraction of utility’s energy\
    \ \npurchase cost.  On the other hand, utilities would see a drop in revenues\
    \ because of lower energy consumption. \nPage A.11 \n \nThe Transactive Energy\

    vii\nAbstract\nI\nndustrial growth has brought unforeseen technological advances\
    \ to our so-\nciety. Unfortunately, the price to pay for these advances has been\
    \ an increase\nof the air pollution levels worldwide, aﬀecting both urban and\
    \ countryside areas.\nIt means that air quality monitoring becomes relevant not\
    \ only in cities, but also\nin rural environments because it directly aﬀects citizens,\
    \ crops, and the life of\nvarious animals/insects. Thus, diﬀerent solutions for\
    \ measuring air quality should\nbe sought for such heterogeneous environments.\n\
    Typically, air pollution monitoring relies on ﬁxed monitoring stations to carry\n\
    out the pollution control. However, this method is too expensive, not scalable,\
    \ and\nhard to implement in any city. So, the Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS) approach,\
    \ by\nallowing to embed a small sensor in any sort of vehicle, becomes one of\
    \ the most\npractical strategies due to its relatively easy and fast deployment\
    \ in any place.\nConcerning the widespread use of small pollution monitoring sensors\
    \ embedded\nin mobile vehicles, the possible scenarios can be divided into two:\
    \ urban scenarios,\nwhere a wide set of vehicles are available, and rural and\
    \ industrial areas, where\nvehicular traﬃc is scarce and limited to the main transportation\
    \ arteries.\nConsidering these two scenarios, in this thesis we propose an architecture,\n\
    called EcoSensor, to monitor the air pollution using small sensors installed in\n\
    vehicles, such as bicycles, private cars, or the public transportation system,\
    \ ap-\nplicable to urban scenarios, and the use of an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS)\
    \ in\nrural scenarios.\nThree main components compose our architecture: a low-cost\
    \ sensor to capture\npollution data, a smartphone to preprocess the pollution\
    \ information and transmit\nthe data towards a central server, and the central\
    \ server, to store and process\npollution information.\nFor urban scenarios, we\
    \ analyze diﬀerent alternatives regarding the design of\na low-cost sensing unit\
    \ based on commercial prototyping platforms such as Rasp-\nberry Pi or Arduino,\
    \ and Commercial Oﬀ-the-shelf (COTS) air quality sensors.\nix\nMoreover, we analyze\
    \ and propose a process to perform pollution monitoring\nusing our architecture.\n\
    This process encompasses four basic operations: data\nreading, unit conversion,\
    \ time variability reduction, and spatial interpolation.\nFor rural scenarios,\
    \ we propose the use of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)\nas a mobile sensor.\n\
    Speciﬁcally, we equip the UAV with sensing capabilities\nthrough a Raspberry Pi\
    \ microcomputer and low-cost air quality sensors.\nFinally, we propose an algorithm,\
    \ called Pollution-driven UAV Control (PdUC),\nto control the UAV ﬂight for monitoring\
    \ tasks by focusing on the most polluted\nareas, and thereby attempting to improve\
    \ the overall accuracy while minimizing\nﬂight time. We then propose an improvement\
    \ to this algorithm, called Discretized\nPollution-driven UAV Control (PdUC-D),\
    \ where we discretize the target area by\nsplitting it into small tiles, where\
    \ each tile is monitored only once, thereby avoiding\nredundant sampling.\nOverall,\
    \ we found that mobile sensing is a good approach for monitoring air pol-\nlution\
    \ in any environment, either by using vehicles or bicycles in urban scenarios,\n\
    or an UAVs in rural scenarios. We validate our proposal by comparing obtained\n\
    values by our mobile sensors against typical values reported by monitoring stations\n\
    at the same time and location, showing that the results are right, matching the\n\
    expected values with a low error. Moreover, we proved that PdUC-D, our protocol\n\
    for the autonomous guidance of UAVs performing air monitoring tasks, has bet-\n\
    ter performance than typical mobility models in terms of reducing the prediction\n\
    errors and reducing the time to cover the whole area.\nx\nResumen\nE\nl crecimiento\
    \ industrial ha acarreado grandes avances tecnológicos para\nnuestra sociedad.\
    \ Lamentablemente, el precio a pagar por estos avances ha\nsido un aumento signiﬁcativo\
    \ de los niveles de contaminación del aire en todo\nel mundo, afectando tanto\
    \ a zonas urbanas como a las zonas rurales. Hoy en\ndía, la monitorización de\
    \ la calidad del aire se ha convertido en un aspecto muy\nrelevante no solo en\
    \ las ciudades, sino también en los entornos rurales ya que afecta\ndirectamente\
    \ a las personas, a los cultivos, y en general a ecosistemas y vida de\ndiversos\
    \ animales. Para abordar con éxito el problema de la contaminación se\ndeben buscar\
    \ diferentes soluciones que permitan medir la calidad del aire en todos\nestos\
    \ entornos.\nPor lo general, la monitorización de la calidad aire se realiza mediante\
    \ esta-\nciones de monitorización ﬁjas. Sin embargo, este método es demasiado\
    \ costoso,\npoco escalable y difícil de implementar en nuestras ciudades, las\
    \ cuales están ca-\nda vez más pobladas. El uso de Mobile CrowdSensing (MCS),\
    \ paradigma en el\ncual la monitorización se realiza por los propios usuarios,\
    \ se convierte en una de\nlas estrategias más prácticas en la actualidad debido\
    \ a que se puede desplegar de\nmanera relativamente rápida, sencilla y eﬁciente\
    \ en cualquier lugar, simplemente\ninstalando un pequeño sensor en cualquier tipo\
    \ de vehículo.\nEn cuanto al uso generalizado de sensores móviles de contaminación\
    \ ambiental\nintegrados en vehículos, los posibles escenarios se pueden dividir\
    \ en dos: entornos\nurbanos, donde hay un amplio conjunto de vehículos disponibles,\
    \ y entornos rurales\no industriales, donde el tráﬁco vehicular es escaso y está\
    \ limitado a las principales\narterias de transporte.\nTeniendo en cuenta estos\
    \ dos escenarios, esta tesis propone una arquitectura,\nllamada EcoSensor, que\
    \ permite monitorizar la contaminación del aire utilizando\npequeños sensores\
    \ de bajo coste instalados en diferentes tipos de vehículos, tales\ncomo bicicletas,\
    \ automóviles o autobuses del sistema de transporte público, en el\ncaso de entornos\
    \ urbanos, y en drones o UAS (Unmanned Aircraft Systems) en\nxi\nentornos rurales.\n\
    La arquitectura propuesta está compuesta por tres componentes: un sensor de\n\
    bajo coste para capturar datos de contaminación, un smartphone para realizar un\n\
    preprocesamiento de la información y para transmitir los datos hacia un servidor\n\
    central, y el servidor central, encargado de almacenar y procesar la información\n\
    de contaminación ambiental.\nPara entornos urbanos, analizamos diferentes alternativas\
    \ con respecto al di-\nseño de una unidad de monitorización (sensor móvil) de\
    \ bajo coste basada en\nplataformas de prototipado comerciales como Raspberry\
    \ Pi o Arduino, junto con\nsensores también de precio reducido.\nEn la tesis realizamos\
    \ un análisis, y proponemos un proceso, para llevar a\ncabo la monitorización\
    \ ambiental utilizando la arquitectura propuesta. Este pro-\nceso abarca cuatro\
    \ operaciones básicas: captura de datos, conversión de unidades,\nreducción de\
    \ la variabilidad temporal, e interpolación espacial.\nPara entornos rurales,\
    \ proponemos el uso de drones (UAV) como unidades de\nsensorización móviles. Especíﬁcamente,\
    \ equipamos el drone con capacidades de\nmonitorización a través de un microordenador\
    \ Raspberry Pi y sensores de calidad\ndel aire de bajo coste.\nFinalmente, se\
    \ propone un algoritmo llamado PdUC (Pollution-driven UAV\nControl) para controlar\
    \ el vuelo del UAV con el objetivo de realizar monitorización\nambiental, identiﬁcando\
    \ las áreas más contaminadas, y tratando de ese modo de\nmejorar la precisión\
    \ general y la velocidad de monitorización. Además, proponemos\nuna mejora a este\
    \ algoritmo, denominada PdUC-D, basada en la discretización\ndel área a monitorizar\
    \ dividiéndola en pequeñas áreas (tiles), donde cada tile se\nmonitoriza una sola\
    \ vez, evitando así realizar muestreos redundantes.\nEn general, veriﬁcamos que\
    \ la monitorización móvil es una aproximación eﬁ-\nciente y ﬁable para monitorizar\
    \ la contaminación del aire en cualquier entorno,\nya sea usando vehículos o bicicletas\
    \ en entornos urbanos, o UAVs en entornos\nrurales. Con respecto al proceso de\
    \ monitorización ambiental, validamos nuestra\npropuesta comparando los valores\
    \ obtenidos por nuestros sensores móviles de bajo\ncoste con respecto a los valores\
    \ típicos de referencia ofrecidos por las estaciones\nde monitorización ﬁjas para\
    \ el mismo período y ubicación, comprobando que los\nresultados son semejantes,\
    \ y están acuerdo a lo esperado. Además, demostramos\nque PdUC-D, permite guiar\
    \ autónomamente un UAV en tareas de monitorización\ndel aire, ofreciendo un mejor\
    \ rendimiento que los modelos de movilidad típicos,\nreduciendo tanto los errores\
    \ de predicción como el tiempo para cubrir el área\ncompleta, y logrando una mayor\
    \ precisión dentro de las áreas más contaminadas.\nxii\nResum\nE\nl creixement\
    \ industrial ha implicat grans avanços tecnològics per a la nos-\ntra societat.\
    \ Lamentablement, el preu que cal pagar per aquests avanços ha\nsigut un augment\
    \ signiﬁcatiu dels nivells de contaminació de l’aire a tot el món,\nque afecta\
    \ tant zones urbanes com zones rurals. Avui dia, el monitoratge de la\nqualitat\
    \ de l’aire s’ha convertit en un aspecte molt rellevant no solament a les ciu-\n\
    tats, sinó també en els entorns rurals, ja que afecta directament les persones,\
    \ els\ncultius i, en general, els ecosistemes i la vida de diversos animals. Per\
    \ a abordar\namb èxit el problema de la contaminació s’han de cercar diverses\
    \ solucions que\npermeten mesurar la qualitat de l’aire en tots aquests entorns.\n\
    En general, el monitoratge de la qualitat aire es fa mitjançant estacions de\n\
    monitoratge ﬁxes. No obstant això, aquest mètode és massa costós, poc escalable\n\
    i difícil d’implementar a les nostres ciutats, les quals estan cada vegada més\
    \ pobla-\ndes. L’ús de Mobile CrowdSensing (MCS), paradigma en el qual el monitoratge\n\
    el duen a terme els mateixos usuaris, es converteix en una de les estratègies\
    \ més\npràctiques en l’actualitat a causa que es pot desplegar de manera relativament\n\
    ràpida, senzilla i eﬁcient en qualsevol lloc, simplement instal·lant un petit\
    \ sensor\nen qualsevol tipus de vehicle.\nPel que fa a l’ús generalitzat de sensors\
    \ mòbils de contaminació ambiental in-\ntegrats en vehicles, els possibles escenaris\
    \ es poden dividir en dos: entorns urbans,\non hi ha un ampli conjunt de vehicles\
    \ disponibles, i entorns rurals o industrials,\non el trànsit vehicular és escàs\
    \ i està limitat a les principals artèries de transport.\nTenint en compte aquests\
    \ dos escenaris, aquesta tesi proposa una arquitectura,\nanomenada EcoSensor,\
    \ que permet monitorar la contaminació de l’aire utilitzant\npetits sensors de\
    \ baix cost instal·lats en diferents tipus de vehicles, com ara bici-\ncletes,\
    \ automòbils o autobusos del sistema de transport públic, en el cas d’entorns\n\
    urbans, i en UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) en entorns rurals.\nL’arquitectura\
    \ proposada està composta per tres components: un sensor de\nbaix cost per a capturar\
    \ dades de contaminació, un smartphone per a realitzar un\nxiii\npreprocessament\
    \ de la informació i per a transmetre les dades cap a un servidor\ncentral, i\
    \ el servidor central, encarregat d’emmagatzemar i processar la informació\nde\
    \ contaminació ambiental.\nPer a entorns urbans, analitzem diferents alternatives\
    \ pel que fa al disseny\nd’una unitat de monitoratge (sensor mòbil) de baix cost\
    \ basada en plataformes\nde prototipatge comercials com Raspberry Pi o Arduino,\
    \ juntament amb sensors\ntambé de preu reduït.\nEn la tesi fem una anàlisi, i\
    \ proposem un procés, per a dur a terme el monito-\nratge ambiental utilitzant\
    \ l’arquitectura proposada. Aquest procés abasta quatre\noperacions bàsiques:\
    \ captura de dades, conversió d’unitats, reducció de la varia-\nbilitat temporal,\
    \ i interpolació espacial.\nPer a entorns rurals, proposem l’ús de drons o Unmanned\
    \ Aerial Vehicles\n(UAVs) com a unitats de sensorització mòbils. Especíﬁcament,\
    \ equipem el dron\namb capacitats de monitoratge a través d’un microordinador\
    \ Raspberry Pi i sen-\nsors de qualitat de l’aire de baix cost.\nFinalment, es\
    \ proposa un algorisme anomenat PdUC (Pollution-driven UAV\nControl) per a controlar\
    \ el vol del UAV amb l’objectiu de realitzar monitoratge\nambiental, que identiﬁca\
    \ les àrees més contaminades i que, d’aquesta manera, trac-\nta de millorar la\
    \ precisió general i la velocitat de monitoratge. A més, proposem\nuna millora\
    \ a aquest algorisme, denominada PdUC-D, basada en la discretització\nde l’àrea\
    \ a monitorar dividint-la en xicotetes àrees (tiles), on cada tile es monitora\n\
    una sola vegada, fet que evita dur a terme mostrejos redundants.\nEn general,\
    \ veriﬁquem que el monitoratge mòbil és una aproximació eﬁcient i\nﬁable per a\
    \ monitorar la contaminació de l’aire en qualsevol entorn, ja siga usant\nvehicles\
    \ o bicicletes en entorns urbans, o UAVs en entorns rurals. Pel que fa al\nprocés\
    \ de monitoratge ambiental, validem la nostra proposta comparant els valors\n\
    obtinguts pels nostres sensors mòbils de baix cost pel que fa als valors típics\
    \ de\nreferència oferits per les estacions de monitoratge ﬁxes per al mateix període\
    \ i\nubicació, i es comprova que els resultats són semblants, i estan d’acord\
    \ amb el\nresultat esperat. A més, es demostra que PdUC-D permet guiar autònomament\n\
    un UAV en tasques de monitoratge de l’aire, oferint un millor rendiment que els\n\
    models de mobilitat típics, reduint tant els errors de predicció com el temps\
    \ per\na cobrir l’àrea completa, i aconseguint una major precisió dins de les\
    \ àrees més\ncontaminades.\nxiv\nContents\nAcknowledgements\nvii\nAbstract\nix\n\

    Part I\nIntroduction and Context\n1\nChapter 1\nIntroduction\nIn the world we\
    \ live in, the continuous growth of cities, industries, automotive\nparks, etc.,\
    \ are causing air pollution to become one of the most important issues\naﬀecting\
    \ people’s lives. In fact, poor air quality is associated with several problems\n\
    aﬀecting people life including health issues (mainly in the respiratory tracts),\n\
    climate changes, and reduced agriculture production, among others.\nAir pollution\
    \ mainly consists of the emission of gases or particles into the atmo-\nsphere,\
    \ producing changes in its composition. It thereby aﬀects not only humans,\nbut\
    \ life in general. In addition, such eﬀects take place not only in industrial\
    \ areas,\nbut also in residential areas and in the countryside, meaning that lifestyle\
    \ and\nhealth of people is at stake, as well as the crops, the natural cycles\
    \ of animals and\nplants, the pollination cycle of bees, etc.\nWith these considerations\
    \ in mind, air pollution monitoring becomes an issue\nof utmost importance for\
    \ governments, private entities, and people in general.\nIn fact, it is necessary\
    \ to maintain pollution levels under control in any place,\nworldwide.\nTraditionally,\
    \ the air quality control is carried out by using ﬁxed monitoring\nstations, which\
    \ are placed throughout our cities to control pollution levels. Even\nthough these\
    \ stations have sophisticated sensors of very high accuracy, they only\nmeasure\
    \ representative data for the area near to their location.\nIn general, it\nbecomes\
    \ too hard to deploy enough stations so as to maintain a good control over\nan\
    \ entire city, or in regions with poor accessibility such as forests, large countryside\n\
    areas, or catastrophic areas. Thus, alternative solutions must be sought to ﬁll-in\n\
    for this gap.\nMoreover, there are other methods to monitor air pollution such\
    \ as Remote\n3\n1.\nIntroduction\nSensing using mainly satellites or aircrafts\
    \ to capture data or, Wireless Sensor\nNetworks. However, these methods also need\
    \ an expensive infrastructure to carry\nout their job.\nAn alternative for measuring\
    \ environmental pollution in a relatively cheap\nway is relying on mobile crowdsensing.\
    \ Speciﬁcally, small low-cost devices can\nbe installed in diﬀerent types of vehicles\
    \ to monitor diﬀerent parts of the city at\ndiﬀerent times while moving.\nThe\
    \ main problem of low-end mobile sensors is that they have less accuracy\nthan\
    \ sophisticated sensors, and so they need to be regularly calibrated, among\n\
    other problems that must be analyzed.\nOn the other hand, crowdsensing approaches\
    \ are, so far, mostly applicable to\nurban areas where diﬀerent mobility alternatives\
    \ are available. However, in rural\nand industrial zones, deployment options are\
    \ quite more limited.\nIn the case of large rural or industrial areas, a ﬂeet\
    \ of autonomous vehicles could\nbe eﬃciently used to cover the vast distances\
    \ associated with them. Furthermore,\nthe use of autonomous sensor carriers is\
    \ even more encouraged in this case due to\nthe following considerations: (i)\
    \ the relative absence of civilian population to be\ntaken care of during robotic\
    \ operations; (ii) stable and expectable obstacle loca-\ntions; (iii) less constraints\
    \ in terms of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) ﬂight laws;\nand ﬁnally (iv) safety\
    \ and security concerns, as some areas could be dangerous to\naccess for human\
    \ operators. Since, in these environments, ground access is usually\nhindered\
    \ and full of obstacles, the most feasible way to implement a ﬂeet of mobile\n\
    pollution-monitoring robots is via Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).\n1.1\nObjectives\n\
    The main objective of this thesis is to propose and implement an architecture\
    \ for\nair pollution monitoring able to oﬀer ﬁne-grained resolution data, and\
    \ applicable\nin both urban and rural scenarios. To this aim the mobile sensors\
    \ developed shall\nbe installed in diﬀerent types of vehicles, such as bicycles\
    \ or the public transport\nsystem when operating in urban areas, or in UAVs when\
    \ operating in areas with\npoor accessibility, like the countryside or catastrophic\
    \ zones.\nTo achieve this main objective it becomes necessary to accomplish several\n\
    speciﬁc objectives for both crowdsensing in urban areas, and UAV-based sensing\n\
    in rural areas.\nCrowdsensing:\n• Analyze the data sampling process using mobile\
    \ sensors.\n• Analyze and Design a low-cost prototype sensor for air pollution\
    \ monitoring\nadapted to mobile sensing.\n4\n1.2.\nStructure of the Thesis\n•\
    \ Design a sensing architecture, along with its diﬀerent elements.\n• Analyze\
    \ the data transmission to the central server for data processing.\n• Use the\
    \ appropriate statistical tools for data interpolation tasks.\n• Deploy a system\
    \ to process the monitored data, and to show the air pollution\ndistribution in\
    \ a target region.\nUAV-based sensing:\n• Design a low-cost UAV able to perform\
    \ air pollution monitoring tasks.\n• Develop an algorithm for autonomous UAV guidance\
    \ considering both air\npollution aspects and UAV restrictions/capabilities.\n\
    1.2\nStructure of the Thesis\nThe thesis dissertation follows a methodology encompassing\
    \ both theoretical and\npractical issues.\nThus, on the one hand, we do a fundamental\
    \ research study\n(theoretical), analyzing the sensor behaviour and the air pollution\
    \ measurement\nissue, deﬁning the diﬀerent architectural elements for air pollution\
    \ monitoring\nbased on a mobile sensing approach. On the other hand, we do applied\
    \ research,\ndeveloping a mobile sensor prototype, and deploying a system to monitor\
    \ the air\npollution in the city of Valencia.\nThis dissertation is organized\
    \ in 10 chapters. Below, we brieﬂy describe the\ncontents of each part:\n• Chapter\

    process: an overview\nEnvironmental pollution consists of a degradation of the\
    \ natural habitats such as\nforests, rivers, lakes, seas, and so on, by the introduction\
    \ of waste or dangerous\nelements in the composition of soil, water and air. These\
    \ elements could be in the\nform of physical components, biological material,\
    \ chemical components, or even\nenergy such as noise, heat, radioactivity or light,\
    \ altering the normal environment\nbehavior in a faster way than it can adapt\
    \ to, thereby aﬀecting humans and other\nliving organisms.\nUsually, the environment\
    \ adjusts itself to pollution through\ndispersion, breakdown, recycling, or storage\
    \ in some harmless form, but when the\npollution levels become too high, it is\
    \ almost impossible for these processes to\ncomplete in a short period of time.\n\
    Despite environmental pollution can be caused by diﬀerent natural sources,\nsuch\
    \ as hurricanes, sandstorms, twisters, volcano eruptions, and so forth, its main\n\
    source is related to human activities. Notice that, even though humans always\
    \ have\nhad an impact on nature in their day-to-day activities, in the past nature\
    \ could\nhandle their impact because the pollution levels were relatively low.\
    \ However,\nsince the industrial revolution, the number of factories increased\
    \ rapidly, shifting\nto full-scale industries and manufacturing units that produce\
    \ more pollution, and\ndiﬀerent pollutants types, becoming an overwhelming problem\
    \ for the planet.\n7\n2.\nAir pollution and its monitoring process: an overview\n\
    2.1\nEnvironmental Pollution Classiﬁcation\nThere are several types of pollution\
    \ depending on its source, and their impact\non our lives and the environment\
    \ diﬀers accordingly. Currently, we can classify\npollution in eight basic types:\
    \ (i) Air pollution, (ii) Water pollution, (iii) Soil\npollution, (iv) Noise pollution,\
    \ (v) Radioactive pollution, (vi) Thermal pollution,\n(vii) Light pollution, and\
    \ (viii) Visual pollution.\nAir pollution is the contamination of the atmosphere\
    \ by changing the com-\nposition and chemistry of the air. It can be the excessive\
    \ presence of gases, such\nas carbon dioxide, which cannot be removed naturally,\
    \ or small particles ﬂoating\nsuspended in the air, such as dust, PM10, or PM2.5.\n\
    Air pollution can be produced by natural sources such as volcanic eruptions,\n\
    forest ﬁres, dry soil erosion, dust storms, etc. However, nowadays, the principal\n\
    cause of air pollution is human activity, being vehicular contamination, building\n\
    construction, agricultural spraying, and industry very representative examples.\n\
    Depending on the air pollutant levels, several eﬀects can be noticed in nature\n\
    or the human health. For instance, they can cause an increase in smog, a higher\n\
    rain acidity, crop depletion due to lack of oxygen, and higher rates of asthma\
    \ for\npeople exposed to it. Figure 2.1 illustrates an example of air pollution\
    \ in urban\nareas.\nFigure 2.1: Example of air pollution in urban areas1\nWater\
    \ pollution refers to the contamination of some water body, such as\nrivers, lakes,\
    \ oceans, or underground reservoirs, from bacterial matter, chemicals\nor particles\
    \ that change their composition, degrading water quality or purity.\n1Source:\
    \ Wikipedia::Pollution\n8\n2.1.\nEnvironmental Pollution Classiﬁcation\nWater\
    \ pollution can be produced by increased sediment caused by soil erosion,\nimproper\
    \ waste disposal, and littering, leaching of soil pollution or organic material\n\
    into water supplies, among others.\nThe main eﬀects of water pollution could be:\
    \ decreasing the amount of drink-\nable water available, lowering water supplies\
    \ for crop irrigation, and impacting\nﬁsh and wildlife populations that require\
    \ good quality water. Figure 2.2 shows an\nexample of water pollution in a port.\n\
    Figure 2.2: Example of water pollution in a port.2\nSoil pollution refers to contamination\
    \ of the land caused by some external\nmaterial, such as toxins or chemicals,\
    \ degrading the quality of the land surface,\nand thereby aﬀecting its intended\
    \ use.\nSoil pollution could cause land desertiﬁcation or soil erosion, reducing\
    \ crop\nyields, loss of wildlife habitats, and so on.\nThe primary soil pollution\
    \ sources are non-sustainable farming practices, such\nas the massive use of pesticides,\
    \ hazardous waste and sewage spills, strip mining,\ndeforestation, household dumping\
    \ and littering, and other destructive practices.\nFigure 2.3 shows a example\
    \ of soil pollution.\n2Source: Wikipedia::Pollution\n9\n2.\nAir pollution and\
    \ its monitoring process: an overview\nFigure 2.3: Example of polluted soil area\
    \ (Source: Wikipedia::Pollution).\nNoise pollution refers to the high levels of\
    \ sound caused by human activities\nwhich aﬀect life quality in a speciﬁc area.\n\
    It could aﬀect people both physiologically and psychologically, including hear-\n\
    ing loss in some extreme cases, and, more important, it can also interfere with\n\
    basic activities such as sleep, rest, study, communication and socializing. On\
    \ the\nother hand, it could aﬀect wildlife, causing some disruption in the habit\
    \ of the\nanimals, thereby deteriorating their activities.\nNoise pollution is\
    \ caused mainly by traﬃc, railroads, airports, concerts, indus-\ntrial activities,\
    \ etc. Figure 2.4 shows an example of noise pollution caused by a\nplane in a\
    \ residential area.\nFigure 2.4: Example of noise pollution caused by an airplane\
    \ (Source:\nWikipedia::Pollution).\n10\n2.1.\nEnvironmental Pollution Classiﬁcation\n\
    Light pollution refers to the over-illumination of an area that disrupts natural\n\
    cycles, therefore being considered obtrusive. A good examples is the light caused\n\
    by activities in large cities like New York, which almost never sleep.\nFigure\
    \ 2.5: Example of light pollution in urban areas (Source:\nWikipedia::Pollution).\n\
    Some particular examples of light pollution could be billboards and advertising,\n\
    night time sporting events, and other nighttime entertainment.\nThe light pollution\
    \ could aﬀect the sleep cycles in the human life, or the natural\ncycles in the\
    \ wildlife. Figure 2.5 shows an example of light pollution caused by\nthe illumination\
    \ of the buildings in a city.\nThermal pollution refers to an artiﬁcial increase\
    \ of the temperature in a\nparticular ecosystem over long periods, altering the\
    \ natural thermal cycles, and\ntherefore causing undesirable eﬀects.\nPower plants,\
    \ urban sprawl, deforestation, etc., could cause thermal pollution\nby aﬀecting\
    \ a speciﬁc area, but if there are a lot of similar sources, it can become\na\
    \ serious concern for the whole world. For instance, nowadays, global warming\
    \ is\none of the most signiﬁcant problems humanity has to face. Figure 2.6 shows\
    \ an\nexample of thermal pollution caused by an industrial process.\n11\n2.\n\
    Air pollution and its monitoring process: an overview\nFigure 2.6: Example of\
    \ thermal pollution caused by industrial process (Source:\nWikipedia::Pollution).\n\
    Radioactive pollution refers to the exposition of some region to radioactiv-\n\
    ity. It is rare, but extremely dangerous, possibly becoming deadly if levels are\n\
    high. Thus, governments usually have a strict regulation to control or prevent\n\
    radioactive pollution.\nThe sources of radioactivity pollution can be nuclear\
    \ power plants, nuclear\nwaste, uranium mining operations, etc.\nRadioactive pollution\
    \ can cause many illnesses such as congenital disabilities,\ncancer, sterilization,\
    \ and other health problems for human and wildlife popula-\ntions, becoming critical\
    \ in some extreme cases such as Chernobyl or Fukushima.\nFigure 2.7 shows an example\
    \ of radioactive pollution waste.\n12\n2.2.\nAir Pollution\nFigure 2.7: Example\
    \ of radioactive pollution waste (Source: Wikipedia::Pollution).\n2.2\nAir Pollution\n\
    Industrial growth has brought unforeseen technological advances to our societies.\n\
    Unfortunately, the price to pay for these advances has been an increase of air\n\
    pollution worldwide associated to the diﬀerent production stages.\nAs introduced\
    \ in the previous section, air pollution basically consists in the\nemission of\
    \ gases or particles into the atmosphere, producing changes in its com-\nposition\
    \ that aﬀect the environment, degrading people’s life quality as well as\nwildlife,\
    \ and agriculture.\nAir pollution could be classiﬁed into two categories depending\
    \ on the emitted\npollutants:\nPrimary pollutants are gases or particles emitted\
    \ directly into the atmo-\nsphere, such as CO or CO2, which are emitted into the\
    \ atmosphere by vehicles or\nindustrial processes.\nSecondary pollutants are gases\
    \ produced by a chemical reaction between\nprimary pollutants and some other element;\
    \ in this second category we have for\ninstance Ozone (O3), which is produced\
    \ by the combination of Nitrogen Oxides\n(NOx), Oxygen (O2), Volatic Organic Compound\
    \ (VOC), and sunlight.\nEven though determining the level of primary pollutants\
    \ could be achieved by\ntaking into account their sources, the level of secondary\
    \ pollutants is much more\n13\n2.\nAir pollution and its monitoring process: an\
    \ overview\ndiﬃcult to determine, as its emission and creation involves diﬀerent\
    \ sources.\n2.2.1\nMain air pollutants\nAccording to the U.S. Environment Protection\
    \ Agency (EPA), in current mega\ncities there are six main air pollutants:\nOzone\
    \ (O3) is a gas composed by three atoms of oxygen, which is produced\nin the Earth’s\
    \ upper atmosphere (good ozone), and at ground level (Pollutant -\nbad ozone).\n\
    The good ozone, called stratospheric ozone, is produced in the upper atmo-\nsphere,\
    \ creating a protective layer that shields us from the sun’s harmful ultravi-\n\
    olet rays. It has been partially destroyed by manmade chemicals, causing what\
    \ is\nsometimes called a \"ozone hole\".\nThe bad ozone, or tropospheric ozone,\
    \ is that which occurs at ground level,\nand that is produced by the chemical\
    \ reaction between Nitrogen Oxides (NOx),\nOxygen (O2), Volatic Organic Compound\
    \ (VOC), and sunlight. The major con-\ncentrations of tropospheric ozone are near\
    \ to high-density traﬃc, power plants,\nindustrial boilers, reﬁneries, or other\
    \ chemical sources. Since it is produced by\nthe reaction with sunlight, the tropospheric\
    \ ozone levels are higher in sunny days\nduring summer or spring.\nIt is worth\
    \ mentioning that tropospheric ozone is the main ingredient of the\n\"smog\",\
    \ aﬀecting both human health and the natural environment.\nParticle Matter (PM)\
    \ is the presence of small solid particles ﬂoating in the\nair that are much smaller\
    \ than dust, dirt, soot, or smoke, as the latter are large\nand dark enough to\
    \ be seen with the human eye. In general PM particles can be\ndetected using an\
    \ electron microscope.\nThey can be classiﬁed in two subcategories depending on\
    \ their size:\nPM10: Particle matter smaller than 10 micrometers.\nPM2.5: Particle\
    \ matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers.\nThese particles are harmful because they\
    \ are too small, and can easily be\ninhaled, causing diﬀerent illness including\
    \ asthma attacks, heart attacks, strokes\nand early death. They can be made up\
    \ of hundreds of diﬀerent chemicals emitted\ndirectly from sources such as construction\
    \ sites, unpaved roads, ﬁelds, smokestacks\nor ﬁres.\nCarbon Monoxide (CO) is\
    \ a gas composed by an atom of Carbon and an\natom of Oxygen. It is a colorless,\
    \ odorless gas that can be harmful when inhaled\nin large amounts. CO is produced\
    \ by burning processes taking place both indoors\nand outdoors. When outdoors,\
    \ it is mainly produced by the burning of fossil fuel\nby cars, trucks and other\
    \ vehicles or machinery, and inside a home, it is produced\nby a variety of items\
    \ such as kerosene and gas heaters, leaking chimneys, and\nfurnaces.\nBreathing\
    \ air contaminated with Carbon Monoxide reduces the amount of\noxygen that can\
    \ be transported by the bloodstream to critical organs such as the\n14\n2.3.\n\
    Air Pollution Monitoring worldwide\nheart and the brain, causing several illnesses.\
    \ Inhaling very high levels of these\ngases can cause dizziness, confusion, unconsciousness,\
    \ and even death.\nLead (Pb) is a mineral which can be emitted onto the air by\
    \ diﬀerent sources.\nThe major sources of lead are ore and metals processing,\
    \ and piston-engine air-\ncraft operating on leaded aviation fuel. Other sources\
    \ include waste incinerators,\nutilities, and lead-acid battery manufacturers.\n\
    Exposition to lead can aﬀect human health (nervous system, kidney function,\n\
    immune system, reproductive and developmental systems, and the cardiovascular\n\
    system), as well as the natural ecosystem, decreasing growth and reproductive\n\
    rates in plants and animals, and having neurological eﬀects in vertebrates.\n\
    Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) is a gas composed by an atom of sulfur and two atoms\nof\
    \ oxygen.\nDespite the fact that the entire group of Sulfur Oxides (SOx) are\n\
    dangerous, SO2 is the component of most signiﬁcant concern, being used as the\n\
    indicator for the entire group. The most extensive sources of SO2 emissions are\n\
    fossil fuel combustion at power plants and other industrial facilities.\nThis\
    \ gas can aﬀect both human health and the environment. Short-term ex-\nposures\
    \ to SO2 can harm the human respiratory system. It is more dangerous for\nsensitive\

    \ to the creation of small Sulfur particles (PM10 or PM2.5)\nNitrogen Dioxide\
    \ (NO2) is a gas composed by an atom of Nitrogen and\ntwo atoms of oxygen, and\
    \ it belongs to a group of highly reactive gases known as\nNitrogen Oxides (NOx).\
    \ Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) is used as the indicator for the\nlarger group of nitrogen\
    \ oxides.\nNitrogen Dioxide (NO2) primarily gets in the air from the burning of\
    \ fuel by\ncars, trucks and buses, power plants, and oﬀ-road equipment.\nThis\
    \ gas can react with water, oxygen and other chemicals in the atmosphere,\ncreating\
    \ acid rain.\n2.3\nAir Pollution Monitoring worldwide\nAir pollution monitoring\
    \ is a critical issue, being nowadays a great concern of ma-\njor cities since\
    \ it has severe consequences on human health. Thus, modern cities,\nespecially\
    \ megacities, should address Air Pollution Monitoring as a prominent\nservice.\n\
    In recent decades, air pollution monitoring has gained worldwide relevance.\n\
    There are many research works that study the eﬀects of pollution on our health.\n\
    Among them we can ﬁnd the contributions of Chen at al. [33, 32], who analyzed\n\
    the eﬀects of ozone and particle matter on human health. Brook et al. [30] also\n\
    contributed to this ﬁeld by studying the relationship between the exposure to\
    \ air\npollution (including ozone) and cardiovascular events.\nDue to these reasons,\
    \ diﬀerent agencies have been created worldwide. So, the\nUnited States of America\
    \ has created the EPA [114], which is responsible for\n15\n2.\nAir pollution and\
    \ its monitoring process: an overview\ntracking the evolution of environmental\
    \ pollution in the whole country. Similarly,\nthroughout Europe, about one thousand\
    \ ﬁve hundred air monitoring stations have\nbeen deployed to control air pollution\
    \ on a large scale, providing coarse-granularity\npollution levels for most relevant\
    \ cities. These stations are able to measure pollu-\ntants like O3s, ﬁne PMs,\
    \ Carbon Dioxides (CO2s), and COs, among others.\n(a) Air pollution monitoring\

    \ and enforcement activities to ensure environmental protection\nmainly in the\
    \ USA.\nThe European Environment Agency (EEA) is an agency of the European\nUnion\
    \ whose task is to provide information on the environment. The EEA aims to\nsupport\
    \ sustainable development by helping to achieve signiﬁcant and measurable\nimprovement\
    \ in Europe’s environment, through the provision of timely, targeted,\nrelevant\
    \ and reliable information to policy-making agents and the public.\nThe European\
    \ environment information and observation network (Eionet) is a\npartnership network\
    \ of the European Environment Agency and its member and\ncooperating countries.\
    \ Through Eionet, the EEA brings together environmental\ninformation from individual\
    \ countries, concentrating on the delivery of timely,\nnationally validated, high-quality\
    \ data.\nFigure 2.8 shows the distribution of the monitoring stations (a) in Europe\
    \ and\n(b) in the city of Valencia, Spain.\n2.3.1\nAir Quality Index\nTaking into\
    \ account the eﬀects of air pollution in human health, the Environmental\nProtection\
    \ Agency has created an index to report the air quality called Air Quality\nIndex\
    \ (AQI) [2]. It deﬁnes some categories related to the amount of pollutants,\n\
    and the risks for human health.\nAQI deﬁnes an index between 0 to 500, where higher\
    \ index values represent\nhigher pollutant levels and, obviously, higher human\
    \ health risks. There are six\nranges established in this index: (i) 0 - 50, there\
    \ are no risks. (ii) 51 - 100, moderate\nrisk, (iii) 101 - 150, unhealthy for\
    \ sensitive groups, (iv) 151 - 200, Unhealthy for all\npeople, (v) 201 - 300,\
    \ very high risk, very unhealthy, and (vi) over 300, hazardous.\nTable 2.1 shows\

    \ for ﬁve major air pollutants: Ozone\n(O3), Particle Matter (PM) (both PM10 and\
    \ PM2.5), Carbon Monoxide (CO),\nSulfur Dioxide (SO2), and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2).\
    \ For each of these pollutants,\nEPA has established national air quality standards\
    \ to protect public health. Table\n2.2 shows a summary of indexes related to the\

    \ Monitoring technologies\nCurrently, controlling pollution levels is an on-going\
    \ eﬀort undertaken by most\nEuropean cities, which invest a considerable amount\
    \ of money in controlling the\ndiﬀerent hazards produced by poor air quality.\
    \ This process mainly relies on ﬁxed\nmonitoring stations distributed along the\
    \ cities, which is the traditional method\nto monitor the air pollution [70].\
    \ Alternatively, thanks to the last technological\nadvances, there are other methods\
    \ to monitor air pollution such as Remote Sens-\ning, Wireless Sensors Networks,\
    \ or Crowdsensing. All of these alternatives try to\nsolve some inconvenient of\
    \ the ﬁxed stations.\nFixed base stations rely on sophisticated sensors, which\
    \ are very accurate,\nand introduce minimum uncertainty levels in the data capture\
    \ process (e.g. Dob-\nson spectrophotometers are used for monitoring ozone levels\
    \ [15]). However, they\nare very expensive and hard to manage. Due to their size,\
    \ they must be installed\non a speciﬁc location, and the monitored value is only\
    \ representative in a small\nsurrounding area.\nRemote Sensing (RS) refers to\
    \ the methods to acquire the information\nfrom some phenomenon such as pollution\
    \ without making human contact with\nthe object.\nCommonly, remote sensing is\
    \ associated to the use of satellites or\naircraft-based sensors to monitor diﬀerent\
    \ phenomena in inaccessible or poorly\naccessible areas like oceans, forest, catastrophic\
    \ areas, etc.\n18\n2.4.\nAir Pollution Monitoring technologies\nFigure 2.9: Air\

    \ Network (WSN) is a group of sensors which collaborate\nto measure some phenomenon,\
    \ and transmit the sampled data wirelessly toward\na main location, where data\
    \ is processed.\nIn the same way than remote sensing, the WSN began with military\
    \ purposes,\nbut currently it is used in many industrial and consumer applications,\
    \ such as\nindustrial process monitoring and control, machine health monitoring,\
    \ and so on.\nNodes\nSink\nCLOUD\nFigure 2.11: Wireless Sensor Networks example.\n\
    Crowdsensing refers to the collaborative sensing by the end users.\nSo, a\nsigniﬁcant\
    \ number of users perform collaborative sensing tasks, thereby collecting\ndata\
    \ from diﬀerent populated locations while doing their daily activities.\nThe\n\
    collected data is periodically transmitted to a central server (Cloud) for data\n\
    storage and processing.\nAn alternative for measuring environmental pollution\
    \ relies on mobile sensing.\nSpeciﬁcally, small low-cost devices can be installed\
    \ in various types of vehicles to\nmonitor diﬀerent parts of the city at diﬀerent\
    \ times.\n20\n2.5.\nSummary\nCLOUD\nFigure 2.12: Crowdsensing approach.\n2.5\n\
    Summary\nIn this chapter, we analyzed the most important concepts related to Air\
    \ Pollution\nand Air Pollution Monitoring.\nFirst of all, we described the pollution\
    \ types,\nfocusing next on the Air Pollution, speciﬁcally on those components\
    \ considered\nby the EPAs as that main air pollutants. Afterward, we analyzed\
    \ how air pollution\nmonitoring is currently carried out through ﬁxed stations.\
    \ Also, we presented the\nAir Quality Index related to each pollutant described\
    \ by the EPA. Finally, we\nanalyzed the diﬀerent alternatives to ﬁxed stations\
    \ for carrying out air pollution\nmonitoring, including Wireless Sensor Network\
    \ (WSN), Remote Sensing (RS), and\nCrowdsensing.\n21\nChapter 3\nMobile Sensing\
    \ technologies for Air\nPollution Monitoring\nSmart cities are revolutionizing\
    \ our view of the world, and their functioning\nachieves a very high level of\
    \ integration, coordination, and cooperation between\nordinary objects, providing\
    \ them with some degree of intelligence.\nThis novel\nparadigm provides a plethora\
    \ of systems and technological tools aimed at increas-\ning our life quality,\
    \ minimizing the environmental impact of everyday activities,\nand optimizing\
    \ resource usage. Such eﬀects are more noticeable in urban areas\nwith millions\
    \ of citizens, the so called mega cities, which in the near future will\nbe more\
    \ and more common [53]. The main concept behind a Smart City is the\nintegration\
    \ of the physical world with the virtual world [22].\nThis is achieved\nby providing\
    \ additional capabilities such as environmental sensing and automatic\nbehaviour\
    \ to common objects, allowing to capture and to analyze data from the\nreal world\
    \ to ensure a better operation of the virtual one.\nAs shown by Gartner in its\
    \ analysis of 2016 (see Figure 3.1), currently there are\nseveral emerging technologies\
    \ to implement the concept of a Smart City. Focusing\nspeciﬁcally in the monitoring\
    \ ﬁeld, diﬀerent smart sensing solutions have emerged.\nFigure 3.2 provides a\
    \ global overview of available technologies from diverse per-\nspectives, which\
    \ cover diﬀerent aspects that allow creating a Smart City. Thus, in\na Smart City,\
    \ all daily objects, called things, are equipped with extra capabilities,\nusually\
    \ sensing and/or acting capabilities, along with communication capabilities,\n\
    to share information, and to optimize their functional operation. This way, and\n\
    from a communications perspective, the Internet of Things (IoT) [55] focuses on\n\
    the intercommunication between all things, as well as on the communication be-\n\

    \ On the other hand, from an\noperational perspective, Cyber Physical Systems\
    \ (CPSs) focus on the integration\nof these physical things with the computational\
    \ process [76, 120, 13] to improve its\nfunctionally. Finally, from a service\
    \ perspective, Cloud Computing [98, 112] and\nEdge/Fog [42, 3, 126] Computing\
    \ focus on the data processing, and on the struc-\nture of the Central servers\
    \ or Local devices. In the remainder of this chapter, we\nwill focus on the Internet\
    \ of Things perspective, analyzing available technologies,\nand their adequacy\
    \ in terms of implementation.\nAny city has several areas of concern to the authorities.\
    \ In a smart city, all of\nthese areas must have some level of intelligence to\
    \ minimize management eﬀorts.\nThus, there are various subareas of interest including\
    \ Smart Governance, Smart\nMobility, Smart Utilities, Smart Buildings, and Smart\
    \ Environment, where the\nadoption of this paradigm can have a clear impact, being\
    \ highly beneﬁcial [31,\n122].\nSmart sensing refers to smart sensor devices monitoring\
    \ some phenomenon,\nthat are connected to a central server or to the Internet\
    \ when trying to optimize\nthe monitoring process.\nThe sensor side, commonly\
    \ called \"edge computing\",\ncarries out the sensing and transmission information\
    \ tasks, and the central server\ncarries out the processing and presentation tasks.\
    \ Moreover, the Internet of Things\napproach studies the intercommunication between\
    \ smart devices.\nFor optimizing the monitoring tasks, we could consider the mobile\

    \ and it moves around an area to\nmonitor some phenomenon.\nWith respect to the\
    \ widespread use of small monitoring sensors embedded in\nmobile vehicles, the\
    \ possible scenarios can be divided into two main classes:\n• Urban environments,\
    \ where it is possible to embed the sensors on a wide\nset of vehicles like bicycles\
    \ [45, 10] or cars [94];\n• Rural and industrial areas, where vehicular traﬃc\
    \ is scarce and limited\nto the main transportation arteries.\nIn the latter case,\
    \ crowdsensing often fails to provide enough data to obtain real-\nistic measurements\
    \ having the required granularity.\nFigure 3.3 shows a scheme of a Smart sensing\
    \ approach focusing on mobile\nsensing environments.\nIn the next sections, we\
    \ will analyze the diﬀerent Internet of Things (IoT)\nscenarios, mobile crowdsensing\
    \ in smart cities, and UAV-based sensing in rural\nareas.\n25\n3.\nMobile Sensing\

    3.0.1\nOverview of IoT Protocols\nIn recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT)\
    \ has become one of the most chal-\nlenging research topics, oﬀering a wide range\
    \ of novel solutions for Smart Cities\n[55, 72]. These proposals mainly analyze\
    \ the intercommunication between devices,\nand involve a large variety of domains\
    \ like home-based solutions [97], intelligent\ntransportation systems [77], healthcare\
    \ [41], safety and security [52, 62], indus-\ntrial control [82], and environmental\
    \ monitoring. Thus, the analysis of the sensor\ndesign must be able to cope with\
    \ IoT protocols, which will be described in this\nsection.\nThe main principle\
    \ underlying the IoT paradigm is that all “things” are, or must\nbe, connected\
    \ to the Internet, and interact with each other to create developed\nareas that\
    \ promote sustainability and enhancing life quality in multiple key areas\n[122,\
    \ 12].\nThe main characteristic of these things is that they are constrained devices\n\
    such as small sensors, hav ing restricted processing/storage capacity, restricted\n\
    battery, restricted communication characteristics, i.e., Low Bandwidth, Low Data\n\
    Rate, Low Coverage, etc. With this in mind, the Internet of Things has created\
    \ a\nsubset of protocols divided into various layers, similar to the traditional\
    \ Internet\nstack, but taking into account the restrictions of the Internet of\
    \ Things in terms of\nprocessing, battery capacity, and communication capabilities\
    \ of embedded devices.\nFigure 3.4 summarizes the diﬀerent layers deﬁned for IoT,\
    \ and the diﬀerences\n26\ntowards the traditional Internet: (i) the Infrastructure\
    \ Layer typically relies on\nwireless technologies, like ZigBee, Long Range Network\
    \ (LoRa), or Bluetooth Low\nEnergy (BLE); (ii) the Addressing Layer focuses on\
    \ the analysis of the addressing\nissues to achieve compatibility with Internet\
    \ protocols; (iii) the Transport Layer\nis the same than for the Internet Prototol\
    \ Stack (TCP/IP), so either Transport\nControl Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram\
    \ Protocol (UDP) are available, although\nUDP is typically used; (iv) the Messaging\
    \ Layer deﬁnes protocols to transmit data\ntowards the servers; (v) the Message\
    \ Format Layer deﬁnes encoding types to store\nand transmit data; and (vi) the\
    \ Semantic Layer deﬁnes the structure of the data.\nBelow, we describe the most\
    \ important protocols involved in the Internet of\nThings at these diﬀerent layers.\n\

    Figure 3.4: IoT protocols.\nInfrastructure Layer\nCurrently, there are several\
    \ communication technologies for the Internet of Things.\nNotice that, while any\
    \ communications technology would allow us to create a net-\nwork for IoT, not\
    \ all of them take device restrictions into account. Theoretically,\n5G allows\
    \ a lot of possibilities to be oﬀered in the context of the Internet of Things\n\
    [46]. Similarly, new technologies such as LoRa or SIGFOX allow network sensors\n\
    to remain connected due to their large coverage.\nBelow, we make a brief analysis\
    \ of the possible wireless technologies for IoT.\nFifth Generation Network (5G)\
    \ Network [57] is the ﬁfth generation cel-\nlular network architecture, designed\
    \ to support great amounts of data, high speed,\n27\n3.\nMobile Sensing technologies\
    \ for Air Pollution Monitoring\nconﬁgurability, etc. from new emerging technologies\
    \ such as Internet of Things.\nCurrently, it is in the ﬁrst phase, where new standards\
    \ and services will be deﬁned,\nbut soon it shall become the default cellular\
    \ network technology.\nZigBee [14] is based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, and\
    \ it was designed\nfor Wireless Sensor Networks. Its main characteristics are\
    \ its small size and low\npower consumption. Usually, the transmission range can\
    \ vary from 10 to 100 m,\ndepending on the output power. The main drawback of\
    \ this technology, though,\nis that current smartphones are not equipped with\
    \ ZigBee interfaces.\nWireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) [11] is based on the IEEE 802.11\
    \ standard, and it\nwas designed for Wireless Local Area Networks. The evolution\
    \ of this technology\nprovides several variants operating in the 2.4 GHz or in\
    \ the 5 GHz band, being\ncurrently the 802.11n version the most widespread option.\
    \ The transmission range\nfor standard interfaces is about 100 m.\nLong Range\
    \ Network (LoRa) [107] is a Low Power Wide-Area Network\n(LPWAN) technology designed\
    \ to optimize diﬀerent aspects such as communica-\ntion range, battery lifetime,\
    \ and costs, supporting thousands of devices headed\nfor the Internet of Things\
    \ in several domains including sensing, metering, and\nMachine to Machine (M2M)\
    \ communications.\nTheoretically, LoRa achieves a transmission range of more than\
    \ 15 km in rural\nenvironments, and of more than 2 km in dense urban areas. Its\
    \ bandwidth ranges\nbetween 250 bps and 50 Kbps in diﬀerent frequencies: 169 MHz,\
    \ 433 MHz, and\n868 MHz in Europe, and 915 MHz in North America.\nSIGFOX [106]\
    \ is an emerging technology that oﬀers a proprietary telecom-\nmunications network\
    \ to support Internet of Things solutions. It was designed for\nLow Power Wide\
    \ Area (LPWA) networks operating in the ISM 868 MHz band,\nreaching distances\
    \ greater than 1 km. Since the selected Industrial, Scientiﬁc and\nMedical (ISM)\
    \ band is restricted, the communications could be of up to 12 bytes\nper message,\
    \ and up to 140 messages per day.\nNear Field Communications (NFC) [60] was designed\
    \ for communications\nbetween two nearby devices (closer than 4 cm). Its main\
    \ target applications are\nsmartphone-based payments and IoT solutions such as\
    \ access control, or inventory\nsystems. However, its distance requirements and\
    \ intermittent connectivity features\nmake it a poor option for the main purpose\
    \ of this thesis.\nBluetooth [21] was designed for Personal Area Networks (PANs),\
    \ purposely\nhaving a maximum coverage range of 10 meters by default. Currently,\
    \ it is used for\ntransmitting information between personal devices, such as smartphones,\
    \ smart-\nwatches, and headsets.\nBluetooth Low Energy (BLE) [54], or Bluetooth\
    \ Smart, is the name\nunder which Bluetooth version 4 is known. Its main advantage,\
    \ when compared\nto previous versions, is using very low power, being nowadays\
    \ one of the best\noptions for IoT applications. Similarly to previous Bluetooth\
    \ speciﬁcations, the\ncoverage range is of 10 m.\n28\nAddressing Layer\nThe addressing\
    \ layer deﬁnes the logic address of the packets by assigning a speciﬁc\naddress\
    \ to all possible nodes. These protocols deal with the packet forwarding\nproblem,\
    \ which in the TCP/IP model is handled by Internet Protocol version\n4 (IPv4),\
    \ and/or Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6).\nIPv4/IPv6 [91, 40] are basic enabling\
    \ protocols for the current Internet. The\nInternet Protocol (IP) is responsible\
    \ for the per-hop relaying of datagrams, be-\ning in charge of addressing tasks\
    \ (deﬁning device addresses), being routing tasks\n(search/deﬁne routes to reach\
    \ a destination) handled by other protocols.\nThere are two versions of this protocol:\
    \ (i) Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4),\nwhich uses 32 bits to specify a device\
    \ address, failing to provide a pool of addresses\nthat can serve all current\
    \ and future devices, and (ii) Internet Protocol version\n6 (IPv6), which uses\
    \ 128 bits to specify a device address, allowing to address\nbillions of devices.\
    \ Both standards deﬁne the datagram structure, where the origin\nand destination\
    \ are deﬁned along with control data.\nIPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area\
    \ Network (6lowPAN)\n[87] allows to use IPv6 over networks based mainly in the\
    \ IEEE 802.15.4 standard.\nIt is designed for resource-constrained devices by\
    \ reducing the size of the ad-\ndress to 64 or 16 bits, depending on whether it\
    \ is for a Local Network or a Personal\nArea Network, respectively; it uses default\
    \ values for specifying the network.\nTransport Layer\nThe transport layer, which\
    \ is also one of the base protocols in the current Internet,\nis in charge of\
    \ the end-to-end connection. This layer is composed by two protocols:\n(i) TCP,\
    \ for persistent connections deﬁning a reliable transmission channel, and\n(ii)\
    \ UDP, for connection-less datagram delivery.\nTransport Control Protocol (TCP)\
    \ [93] provides reliable, ordered, and\nerror-checked data delivery in a link\
    \ based on an IP network by establishing, ﬁrst\nat all, a transmission path, and,\
    \ next, enforcing retransmission in the case of\nerrors.\nUser Datagram Protocol\
    \ (UDP) [92] allows sending messages (datagrams)\non an IP-based link without\
    \ requiring connection establishment, thereby avoiding\nretransmission mechanisms\
    \ and reducing complexity. It is useful for applications\nwith real-time constraints,\
    \ such as most of the applications running on IoT devices.\nMessaging Layer\n\
    The messaging layer deﬁnes protocols for data transmission systems considering\n\
    IoT restrictions.\nRepresentational state transfer (RESTful) [48] is a Web-based\
    \ architec-\nture to exchange or to manipulate Web resources through a textual\
    \ representation\n29\n3.\nMobile Sensing technologies for Air Pollution Monitoring\n\
    using preset stateless operations; it means that each message must have all the\
    \ re-\nquired information to complete the request. It follows a client/server\
    \ model based\non the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and relies on its functions:\
    \ (i)\nGET, to retrieve a resource; (ii) POST, to create a resource; (iii) PUT,\
    \ to change\nthe state of a resource; and (iv) DELETE, to delete a resource. The\
    \ data repre-\nsentation typically adopts the eXtendible Markup Language (XML)\
    \ or JavaScript\nObject Notation (JSON) formats.\nFigure 3.5 presents a basic\
    \ overview of a RESTful Architecture under the\nclient/server model.\nClient\n\
    Server\n(1) HTTP request\n(2) HTTP response\nFigure 3.5: Basic RESTful architecture.\n\
    There is a speciﬁcation [104] for constrained nodes and networks called Constrained\n\
    RESTful Environments (CoRE) Link Format. It speciﬁes a set of links to discover\n\
    resources, and to access these resources in a M2M environment.\nMessage Queue\
    \ Telemetry Transport (MQTT) [80] is a lightweight mes-\nsaging protocol based\
    \ on the publisher/subscriber scheme that runs on top of the\nTCP/IP protocol.\
    \ It is also designed for constrained networks with limited band-\nwidth.\nMQTT\
    \ is composed by three elements: publishers, subscribers, and a message\nbroker.\
    \ A subscriber wanting to receive a message related to a speciﬁc topic, must\n\
    subscribe to the message broker; next, when a publisher sends/publishes a message\n\
    related to a certain topic, it is transmitted to all subscribers subscribed to\
    \ this\ntopic.\nMQTT has three transmission Quality of Service (QoS) levels: (i)\
    \ QoS 0: At\nmost once. The message is sent once, but it does not check for ACKs\
    \ to conﬁrm\nmessage reception. (ii) QoS 1: At least once. The message could be\
    \ sent more\nthan once to each subscriber. (iii) QoS 2: Exactly once. The message\
    \ is sent\nexactly once using four-way handshaking.\nMQTT Sensor Network (MQTT-SN)\
    \ [65] has been designed to be similar to\nMQTT, but considering the restrictions\
    \ of wireless communication environments,\nsuch as limited bandwidth, short message\
    \ length, etc., running over UDP or on\nNon-IP environments.\nFor interoperating\
    \ with standard MQTT environments,\nit needs an MQTT-SN Gateway which connects\
    \ MQTT-SN nodes, such as con-\nstrained sensors, to the MQTT network. Figure 3.6\
    \ shows a basic MQTT archi-\ntecture.\n30\nBroker\nSusbcriber\n(1) sub(topic)\n\

    \ architecture.\nConstrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [105] is a generic web\
    \ protocol\ndesigned for constrained environments with restricted network capacities\
    \ and re-\nstricted devices, allowing these devices to communicate with the Internet\
    \ or other\nconstrained devices. It implements a compressed subset of the RESTful\
    \ model\nimplementing GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE operations over UDP.\nCoAP reduces\
    \ the message header and restricts message exchange, reducing\nthe network overhead.\
    \ It is very useful for Machine to Machine (M2M) communi-\ncation, and for the\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT).\nCoAP can be easily translated to HTTP for seamless\
    \ integration with existing\nWeb systems, while reducing network requirements.\n\
    eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) [99] is a message-\noriented\
    \ communications protocol based on XML. Initially, it was called Jabber,\nand\
    \ it was designed for Instant Messaging (IM). It allows federations among var-\n\
    ious XMPP servers, and even communication with diﬀerent technologies using\nXMPP\
    \ gateways. Currently, it is also used for Voice over IP (VoIP), video, gam-\n\
    ing, or even for IoT applications. Figure 3.7 shows the basic architecture of\
    \ an\nXMPP-based system.\n31\n3.\nMobile Sensing technologies for Air Pollution\

    \ Internet of Things—Sensor Data [115],\nwhich provides the architecture, basic\
    \ operations, and data structures for sensor\ndata communication, including a\
    \ hardware abstraction model for the interconnec-\ntion of constrained devices.\n\
    Simple Measuring and Actuation Proﬁle (sMAP) [39] is an example of\nhow RESTful\
    \ web services can be simpliﬁed, while still allowing instruments and\nother producers\
    \ of physical information to directly publish their data in a central\nserver.\n\
    Message Format Layer\nThe Message Format layer presents all data encoding types\
    \ to store and transmit\nstructured data for IoT applications.\neXtendible Markup\
    \ Language (XML) [27] is a markup language for en-\ncoding documents in a text\
    \ format that is understandable by both human and\nmachines.\nXML is designed\
    \ to store data units called entities, where all data\nstructures and document\
    \ descriptions are achieved through markups. Using these\nmarkups, it is possible\
    \ to create any logical data structure in an easy way.\nJavaScript Object Notation\
    \ (JSON) [26] is a format notation to encode\nstructured data (attribute-value\
    \ pair or array) using human-readable text. It was\ndesigned to replace XML by\
    \ reducing its complexity. It is very common in web\nsystems, especially in AJAX-style\
    \ ones. It uses pairs (object_id:object_value) and\nbrackets to provide complex\
    \ object structuring for ﬁtting data in a text document.\nEﬃcient XML Interchange\
    \ (EXI) [100] is a binary and compact repre-\nsentation of XML or JSON documents.\
    \ It aims at resource-constrained devices\n32\nand networks, attempting to reduce\
    \ the size of the data and the computational\nrequirements when compared to other\
    \ compressors such as gzip. The EXI coder\nis based on events, and it follows\
    \ a simpliﬁed Huﬀman coding to create a binary\ndocument.\nMessagePack [50] is\
    \ a binary serialization format that encodes messages\nfaster, and in a more compact\
    \ manner, than traditional methods such as JSON or\nXML. This is possible since\
    \ small integer values are encoded in a single byte, while\nstrings require only\
    \ an extra byte to identify them. This characteristics simpliﬁes\nthe encoding\
    \ process, but it has some limitations, such as the size of strings or\nnumbers,\
    \ the number of the key/value association map, etc.\nTable 3.1 shows a representation\
    \ of sensor data using XML and JSON encoding,\nand Table 3.2 shows a representation\
    \ of sensor data using EXI and MessagePack\nencoding, respectively. We can observe\
    \ that the EXI and the MessagePack encod-\ning are much smaller (163 and 186 bytes)\
    \ than the encoding achieved using XML\n(474 bytes) or JSON (357 bytes).\nTable\

    39\nSemantic Layer\nThe Semantic layer presents all approaches that describe a\
    \ logical representation\nof things in the IoT context. Therefore, in sensing\
    \ approaches, we can ﬁnd several\nrepresentative examples:\nSensorML [23] is an\
    \ standard model based on XML encoding for describ-\ning sensors and measurement\
    \ processes. It is developed by the Open Geospatial\nConsortium, Inc. (OGC), describing\
    \ a wide range of sensors for diﬀerent types\nof architectures, including remote\
    \ sensors, in-situ sensors and dynamic sensors,\namong others.\nSemantic Sensor\
    \ Net Ontology [36] describes sensors and observations,\navoiding to describe\
    \ domain concepts, location, time, etc. It is developed by the\nW3C Semantic Sensor\
    \ Networks Incubator Group (SSN-XG).\nWeb of Things (WoT) [68] speciﬁes a data\
    \ model to describe physical devices\nconnected to the Web (Internet) using JSON\
    \ encoding. It was created for the\nMozilla project, and it was formally submitted\
    \ to the World Wide Web Consortium\n(W3C) for discussion.\nNotice that any sensor\
    \ device must be able to cope with a subset of the previ-\nously described protocols\
    \ to allow the exchange of data between these sensors and\na central server.\n\
    3.1\nCrowdsensing in Smart cities\nSensing processes are one of the most important\
    \ tasks in a smart city because\nthey allow retrieving the diﬀerent parameters\
    \ involved in diﬀerent control pro-\n34\n3.1.\nCrowdsensing in Smart cities\n\
    cesses. Examples of such processes include transportation, energy management,\n\
    air conditioning, etc. However, controlling air pollution in smart cities stands\
    \ out\nas a key issue, as it has severe consequences on human health, thereby\
    \ making\nenvironment sensing a critical task and a prominent service.\nBy embracing\
    \ the Smart City paradigm, crowdsensing becomes a solution able\nto cope with\
    \ air pollution monitoring since it assumes that a signiﬁcant number\nof users\
    \ perform collaborative sensing tasks, thereby collecting data from diﬀerent\n\
    populated locations while doing their daily activities. The collected data is\
    \ peri-\nodically transmitted to a central server (Cloud) for data storage and\
    \ processing.\nOverall, this strategy implies that the sensors used must be cheap\
    \ and tiny enough\nfor comfortable management and easy transportation. Otherwise,\
    \ it becomes hard\nto achieve a widespread distribution and adoption. Besides,\
    \ there must be a com-\nmunications link for transmitting the acquired data to\
    \ a cloud-based server, where\ndata are constantly being stored and processed.\n\
    3.1.1\nMobile crowdsensing\nFollowing the Smart City paradigm, and focusing on\
    \ the data collection domain,\nthe concept of crowdsourcing has been introduced\
    \ to refer to scenarios where a\nlarge group of people, through diﬀerent devices\
    \ and technologies, actively partici-\npate in the data acquisition process [56].\
    \ Once data are collected, they are sent to\na central server for analysis, and\
    \ feedback will eventually be returned to citizens\nthrough actions and services\
    \ aimed at improving their life quality.\nCrowdsensing is a subtype of crowdsourcing\
    \ where sensors are the actual\nsources of the data gathered [51]. If air quality\
    \ sensors are used, crowdsensing\nbecomes a good alternative to traditional stationary\
    \ air quality stations whereby\nsmall sensors are distributed to a large group\
    \ of people that seamlessly contribute\nto the system while doing their everyday\
    \ tasks [81].\nBefore the mobile crowdsensing became a viable option due to the\
    \ availability\nof small sensors, the sensing process was made through a Wireless\
    \ Sensor Network\n(WSN) [121, 4], which is composed by a set of nodes or sensors\
    \ that collect data\nand send this data towards a central sink or gateway.\nThe\
    \ latter carries out\nprocessing tasks, or merely forwards collected data to a\
    \ server for storage and\nprocessing. Usually, all sensors are resource-constrained\
    \ devices, and the central\nsink or gateway has fewer restrictions, often being\
    \ connected to the power network.\nCurrently, most of the Wireless Sensor Networks\
    \ are based on the IoT architecture\nsince it allows us to work with constrained\
    \ devices and restricted networks.\nFigure 3.8 shows the basic structure of a\
    \ Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). We\ncan see that the communications link between\
    \ the sensors and the sink/gateway\nis wireless, typically relying on Zigbee,\
    \ and that the communications link between\nthe sink/gateway and the central server\
    \ is typically a more robust link, either\nwired (e.g. Ethernet) or wireless (e.g.\
    \ Wi-Fi or Cellular).\n35\n3.\nMobile Sensing technologies for Air Pollution Monitoring\n\

    \ in a Wireless Sensor Network [88, 110] can be achieved\nthrough diﬀerent strategies,\
    \ including sensor mobility, as shown in Figure 3.9a, or\nby having mobility on\
    \ both sensors and gateway, as shown in Figure 3.9b. Finally,\nwe have crowdsensing\
    \ architectures where the gateway and the sensor are the same,\nor are packed\
    \ together. Commonly, the best way to implement crowdsensing is\nthrough smartphones,\
    \ since nearly all people carry one with them nowadays, and\nthey are endowed\
    \ with several sensors and communication interfaces. Figure 3.10\nshows an example\
    \ of a crowdsensing architecture where a smartphone is used as\nthe gateway between\
    \ the sensor and the Central Server.\nProcess\nStorage\nBLE Man.\nRest API\nSmartphone\n\

    \ architecture overview.\nCrowdsensing solutions need to be widely disseminated\
    \ and adopted by users\nto be successful. In addition, to achieve such widespread\
    \ acceptance, the impact on\nusers’ everyday activities must be low. This means\
    \ that any deployed application\nmust operate in background, and they should avoid\
    \ consuming excessive resources,\nwhile requiring only a minimal user intervention.\
    \ Concerning the sensor itself, if\nexternal to the smartphone, it should be cheap,\
    \ small, easy to use, and comfortable\nto carry.\nCrowdsensing approaches have\
    \ two basic architectural components [7]: a mo-\nbile component for the data acquisition\
    \ process, and a central server for data\nstorage and processing.\nThe mobile\
    \ component must be able to collect environmental parameters,\ntransmitting them\
    \ towards the central server.\nThe data acquisition process is\nbased on smartphone\
    \ sensors, or on small external sensors accessible via smart-\nphone, and the\
    \ transmission process usually relies on smartphone connectivity\ntowards the\
    \ Internet. Despite delegating transmission tasks on smartphones, ex-\nternal\
    \ sensing devices must still be endowed with communication capabilities to\ntransfer\
    \ the collected data to the smartphone. So, the sensing device should be\nequipped\
    \ with a wireless communications interface, being technologies like Wi-Fi,\nBluetooth,\
    \ Radio Frequency ID (RFID), NFC, and ZigBee good candidate solu-\ntions.\nThe\
    \ central processing server must be able to receive the transmitted data from\n\
    the sensors, store and process the data, as well as properly oﬀer the obtained\
    \ results\n37\n3.\nMobile Sensing technologies for Air Pollution Monitoring\n\
    to system managers. Also, in some cases, they perform remote communication\nwith\
    \ the mobile devices for conﬁguration tasks, thereby allowing to dynamically\n\
    change the sensing behaviour.\nTaking the aforementioned considerations into account,\
    \ Figure 3.10 shows a\nbasic hardware architecture applicable to air quality sensing\
    \ applications that\nshould include: (i) a mobile sensor, (ii) a smartphone, and\
    \ (iii) a central server;\nthe proposed architecture resembles various approaches\
    \ from diﬀerent authors [61,\n124, 34, 7]. Moreover, as shown in Figure 3.11,\
    \ the crowdsensing process basically\nincludes ﬁve diﬀerent tasks: (i) sampling\
    \ process, (ii) ﬁltering process, (iii) data\ntransfer, (iv) data processing,\
    \ and (v) results presentation. Notice that all these\ntasks could be done by\
    \ diﬀerent hardware components; for instance, the ﬁltering\nprocess could be done\
    \ by the sensor, the smartphone, or even the central server,\ndepending on the\
    \ system characteristics. Moreover, characteristics associated to\nsensing, ﬁltering,\
    \ and transmission tasks could be deﬁned based on parameters\nobtained from the\

    ments, including the calibration process, where electrical signals are translated\
    \ to\npollution units, ﬁlters, fault detection and diagnosis, etc.\nSensor calibration\
    \ for Commercial Oﬀ-the-shelf (COTS) sensors, such as elec-\ntrochemical ones,\
    \ is a process that depends on the physical sensor characteristics,\nthe temperature,\
    \ etc. Basically, electrical outputs must be translated to pollution\nunits, and\
    \ often there is no lineal relation. The calibration is commonly made\nin advanced\
    \ laboratories, taking into account samples taken with diﬀerent pol-\nlution levels,\
    \ and for diﬀerent temperatures and humidity conditions [113, 69].\nHowever, in\
    \ urban scenarios, the auto calibration procedure is too complicated\nbecause\
    \ all sensors are distributed among diﬀerent users. Alvear et al. [6] pro-\nposed\
    \ a method to calibrate oﬀ-the-shell sensors using mathematical regressions\n\
    based on high-accuracy samples obtained through ﬁxed stations deployed in a city.\n\
    Once a mobile sensor is near to these stations, these samples are used to adjust\n\
    the translation equation (electrical signal to pollution values).\nUsing COTS\
    \ sensors, the sampling error and its diagnostics can be a problem\n[6]. Nevertheless,\

    method is the kriging interpolation technique, where a semivariogram is calculated\n\
    to create a complete pollution map.\nResults presentation: refers to presenting\
    \ the obtained results to the system\nadministrator in an understandable way.\n\
    The most useful representation is a\ngraphical map for the target region.\nFigure\
    \ 3.12 presents the data handling process, as the authors described in [7],\n\
    showing the four processes for handling pollution information in order to recreate\n\
    a complete pollution map for a certain target area.\n3.2\nUAV-base monitoring\
    \ in rural areas\nRegarding crowdsensing approaches, projects like [29, 63, 34]\
    \ relied on crowdsens-\ning solutions to monitor pollution in urban areas. However,\
    \ in rural and industrial\nzones, available options are quite more limited. In\
    \ the particular case of large rural\nor industrial areas, a ﬂeet of mobile vehicles\
    \ could be eﬃciently used to cover the\nvast distances associated with them. Furthermore,\
    \ the use of autonomous sensor\ncarriers is even more encouraged in this case\
    \ due to the following considerations:\n• The relative absence of civilian population\
    \ to be taken care of during robotic\noperations.\n• Stable and regulated positioning\
    \ of obstacles.\n• Fewer constraints concerning UAV ﬂight laws.\n• Safety and\
    \ security concerns, as some areas could be dangerous to access for\nhuman operators.\n\
    Since, in these environments, ground access is usually hindered and full of obsta-\n\
    cles, the most feasible way to implement a ﬂeet of mobile pollution-monitoring\n\
    robots is via Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) [43].\nNowadays we can ﬁnd several\
    \ types of UAVs having variable size, ﬂight time,\nload capacity, and price. Figure\
    \ 3.13 shows an example of the conﬁguration of\ndiﬀerent UAVs.\nFigure 3.13 presents\
    \ a classiﬁcation of UAVs depending on their size, payload\ncapacity and endurance\
    \ [58, 19, 38]:\n• Micro/Mini Aerial Vehicles (MAV) are the smallest, cheapest\
    \ and most\nrestricted devices. They were created mainly for entertainment purposes,\n\
    and have been recently adopted for diﬀerent research ﬁelds. They ﬂy at a\n40\n\

    UAV-based solutions have experienced a very substantial increase in the last\n\
    decade, especially in the past ﬁve years. Back in 2004, NASA experts deﬁned a\n\
    wide set of civil applications for UAVs [37], highlighting their potential in\
    \ areas\nsuch as commercial, Earth Sciences, national security, and land management.\
    \ This\npreliminary report was ratiﬁed years later by authors such as Hugenholtz\
    \ et al.\n[64], who explained how the use of UAVs could revolutionize research\
    \ methods in\nthe ﬁelds of Earth Sciences and remote sensing. In [90], authors\
    \ display the results\nof a detailed study on diﬀerent UAVs aspects, showing their\
    \ applicability in Agri-\nculture and Forestry, Disaster Monitoring, Localization\
    \ and Rescue, Surveillance,\nEnvironmental Monitoring, Vegetation Monitoring,\
    \ Photogrammetry, and so on.\nIf we focus speciﬁcally on research using quadrotor\
    \ multicopters, authors like\nGupte et al. [59], and Colomina and Molina [35]\
    \ consider that, given their high\nmaneuverability, compactness, and ease of use,\
    \ diﬀerent applications for these de-\nvices are being found in areas including\
    \ Civil Engineering, Search and Rescue,\nEmergency Response, National Security,\
    \ Military Surveillance, Border Patrol and\nSurveillance, as well as in other\
    \ areas such as Earth Sciences, where they can be\nused to study climate change,\
    \ glacier dynamics, volcanic activity, or for atmo-\nspheric sampling, among others.\n\
    In our case, we are more interested in atmospheric sampling to measure air\npollution\
    \ levels.\nIn this research area, Anderson and Gaston [9] highlight the\n42\n\
    3.3.\nSummary\napplicability of UAVs in the ﬁeld of ecology, emphasizing that\
    \ the spatial and\ntemporal resolutions of the data obtained by traditional methods\
    \ often fail to adapt\nwell to the requirements of local ecology-oriented research.\
    \ Furthermore, the use\nof UAVs, when ﬂying at low altitudes and speeds, oﬀers\
    \ new opportunities in terms\nof ecological phenomena measurements, enabling the\
    \ delivery of data with a ﬁner\nspatial resolution. In fact, Zhang and Kovacs\
    \ [123] explain how the images taken\nby small UAVs are becoming an alternative\
    \ to high-resolution satellite images,\nwhich are much more expensive, to study\
    \ the variations in crop and soil conditions.\nSpeciﬁcally, the use of UAVs is\
    \ considered a good alternative given its low cost of\noperation in environmental\
    \ monitoring, its high spatial and temporal resolution,\nand its high ﬂexibility\
    \ in the scheduling of image acquisitions. A good example of\nthis use can be\
    \ found in the work by Bellvert et al. [17], which shows how, by using\na multicopter\
    \ equipped with a thermal camera, it was possible to obtain a very\nprecise map\
    \ of water levels in a vineyard, thereby achieving signiﬁcant advances\nin the\
    \ ﬁeld of precision agriculture.\n3.3\nSummary\nIn this chapter, we analyze the\
    \ diﬀerent available technologies for create a mobile\nsensing solution considering\
    \ urban and rural monitoring in Smart Cities. In urban\nscenarios, a good option\
    \ is a crowdsensing approach using small sensors installed\nin some vehicle and\
    \ smartphones to monitor a certain city region. Moreover, in\nrural scenarios\
    \ due to limited number of user or vehicles, a good approach is using\nUAVs.\n\
    Respecting to Crowdsensing monitoring, we make an overview of the Internet\nof\
    \ Things protocols, which allow to deploy a Smart city solution. Next, we analyze\n\
    the crowdsensing approach using mobile sensors and how to integrate smartphones\n\
    to the solution, considering the diﬀerent steps from capture until process and\n\
    present data.\nFinally, we make a brief overview of the diﬀerent types of UAV\
    \ and their use\nin diﬀerent ﬁelds, next focusing in air pollution monitoring.\n\
    43\nPart II\nCrowdsensing in Smartcities\n45\nChapter 4\nEcoSensor Platform\n\
    Taking the crowdsensing approach as reference, in this chapter we propose an\n\
    architecture oﬀering mobile pollution sensing with high spatial resolution that\n\
    uses a smartphone as the gateway between the mobile sensor and the central\nserver.\
    \ Our architecture includes three independent modules: a mobile sensor for\nmonitoring\
    \ environment pollutants, an Android-based device for transferring the\ngathered\
    \ data to a central server, and a central processing server for analyzing\nthe\
    \ pollution distribution using the collected data through spatial interpolation\n\
    techniques. Throughout our analysis, we will focus on ozone sensing since it is\n\
    more complex to estimate that other pollutants.\n4.1\nArchitecture\nOur proposed\
    \ architecture deﬁnes a set of elements that allow monitoring air pol-\nlution\
    \ in a cheap and easy, but eﬀective way, being specially useful in very crowded\n\
    cities. It combines information from existing air quality monitoring stations\
    \ with\nthe data collected by mobile sensors to generate ﬁne-grained reports about\
    \ spatial\npollution distribution throughout a city. These mobile sensors can\
    \ be installed in\nbicycles or the public transportation system to monitor the\
    \ whole city in a simple\nand eﬀective way. All collected information is stored\
    \ on a central server for data\nprocessing, generating detailed reports afterward.\n\
    The architecture integrates several hardware and software components. These\n\
    components are either mobile sensing elements, or the central processing server\n\
    that analyzes collected data, and presents detailed information.\nMobile sens-\n\
    ing elements are composed by two diﬀerent components: (i) a mobile sensor for\n\

    \ status, storing the data, and transferring it to the Cloud server when\nnetwork\
    \ connectivity is available. Figure 4.1 provides an overview of the proposed\n\
    architecture.\nThe mobile sensor could be based on an Arduino, a Raspberry Pi,\
    \ or similar\nplatforms, as discussed in chapter 5. It measures environment parameters\
    \ through\nvarious sensors (Ozone (O3), Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Air Pollution, or\
    \ tempera-\nture). Once data is ready, it can be made available to the Android\
    \ device via a\n48\n4.2.\nCentral processing server\nBluetooth Low Energy connection.\n\
    4.2\nCentral processing server\nThe central server stores and processes all the\
    \ information captured by mobile\nsensors. It is a web-enabled system that handles\
    \ the information received from\nthe Android device. In general terms, the central\
    \ server is responsible for the\nfollowing tasks:\n• Receive and decode data sent\
    \ by the mobile sensor.\n• Store data in a database for future processing and\
    \ presenting tasks.\n• Process the information using diﬀerent statistical procedures.\n\
    • Present detailed information to the system administrator through a web\nfront-end.\n\

    The cloud server was built in a PHP server using a Word-press CRM as the\nweb\
    \ interface, and MySQL as the database to store data related to the Word-press\n\
    CRM and to pollution readings. In addition, the R Graph software is used both\n\
    as a data processing tool, to interpolate data using kriging, and also a graphic\n\

    \ of the proposed solution,\nand the diﬀerent elements integration.\nTo process\
    \ the data, the following steps take place:\n• First, the data is uploaded to\
    \ the server in JSON format through an HTTP\nPOST command issued by the smartphone\
    \ application, and using the fol-\nlowing format:\n1\n{\n2\n\"trace\": {\n3\n\"\

    50\n4.2.\nCentral processing server\n• In the server, the data is decoded and\
    \ stored in a MySQL database, as shown\nFigure 4.3. There are three sections:\
    \ (i) the data from the sensor (Sensor\nReading), (ii) the data from ﬁxed stations\
    \ (Infrastructure Data), and, (iii)\nthe data generated, namely, the data ﬁltered\
    \ and calibrated (Results).\nFigure 4.3: Data structure of Ecosensor platform.\n\
    • Once the data is in the database, kriging interpolation can be done using\n\
    the R Graph tool through a PHP system call.\n1\n<?php\n2\nexec(’ Generate_trace\
    \ .R $trace ’);\n3\n?>\n• For processing the data, the R Graph tool ﬁrst retrieves\
    \ the data from the\ndatabase, and then interpolates the pollution in the target\
    \ area using krig-\ning techniques, available as part of the \"automap\" package,\
    \ so generating\ndiﬀerent graphs afterwards to be shown to the user via the web\
    \ interface.\n51\n4.\nEcoSensor Platform\nFor each trace, the system can generate\
    \ diﬀerent graphics such as heatmaps,\nboxplots, time series, and the conﬁdence\
    \ associated to the spatial interpolation\nprocess, as shown in Figure 4.4.\n\
    Figure 4.4: Example of the cloud application web page showing some monitoring\n\
    sessions, and the output analysis for two air pollutants.\nThe website, available\
    \ at http://www.ecosensor.net, has two access types: (i)\nadministrators, who\
    \ have full access to the information in terms of trace handling,\nprocessing\
    \ and visualization. Once logged in, the administrator views all uploaded\ntraces,\
    \ being able to choose diﬀerent statistical analyses for the diﬀerent datasets\n\
    (e.g. CO2, Ozone, Air Pollution and temperature). And (ii) normal user, who\n\
    52\n4.3.\nAndroid-based Application\nonly can access to previously generated information.\n\
    4.3\nAndroid-based Application\nConcerning smartphones, they are devices widely\
    \ used nowadays for nearly all\ntasks. They are characterized by powerful computing\
    \ capabilities, large amounts\nof memory, and several embedded sensors and communication\
    \ interfaces [75]. We\nconsider smartphones as the best gateway option for connecting\
    \ mobile sensors\nwith a central server. In addition, they can perform CPU-intensive\
    \ tasks such as\ndata ﬁltering or data fusion, simplifying sensor requirements\
    \ and design to mere\ndata acquisition and data relaying towards the smartphone.\n\
    Since the smartphone must act as a gateway between sensors and the cloud\nserver,\
    \ it must manage at least two network interfaces: one to collect data from\nthe\
    \ sensors (Sensing middleware), and another one to upload data to a central\n\
    server (Cloud middleware).\nAlthough both tasks must run independently, the\n\
    data uploading process is often not made in real time, contrarily to the sensor\
    \ data\ncollection process, which is a task that should be done periodically,\
    \ especially if\nwe aim at a simpliﬁed sensor design, as shown in Figure 4.5.\
    \ Moreover, modules\nto process and store the collected data are also needed.\n\

    \ view captured data in real-\ntime, upload data to the server, and perform other\
    \ management tasks.\nInternally, the application has two parts: (i) a service\
    \ that continually receives\nthe data sent by the sensor, and that saves it in\
    \ an internal database. The service\nopens a Bluetooth serial communications channel\
    \ with the sensor for the data\ntransfer. And (ii) a user interface that allows\
    \ starting or stopping a trace data\ncapture from the sensor, and that also provides\
    \ real-time feedback about pollu-\ntion levels at the current location according\
    \ to the Air Quality Index (AQI) [2].\n53\n4.\nEcoSensor Platform\nFigure 4.6:\
    \ Android-based application developed: monitoring screen (back), and\npath followed\
    \ during a monitoring session (front).\nMoreover, the full trace can be represented\
    \ on a map showing pollution variations\nthrough diﬀerent color identiﬁers. Once\
    \ the trace is completed, the data can be\nsent to the server via an HTTP connection.\n\
    4.4\nMonitoring Process\nAfter deﬁning the proposed architecture, we now focus\
    \ on the most relevant issues\nregarding the reliability of the pollution monitoring\
    \ process. Our target pollutant\nwas ozone due to its well known negative impact\
    \ on health, and also because it is\nmore complex to measure accurately than other\
    \ pollutants due to its dependency\non temperature and time of day.\n54\n4.4.\n\

    \ into account to perform accurate ozone mea-\nsurements are the following:\n\
    • Sensor output data measurements are highly variable in ranges close to the\n\
    real values, and so such variability should be reduced.\n• Sensor outputs should\
    \ be transformed into the respective units for each pol-\nlutant. In most cases,\
    \ the measured resistance value must be converted into\nparticle per billion (ppb).\n\
    • In order to use mobile sensors, time-dependent variability must be removed\n\
    since diﬀerent samples are obtained at diﬀerent times.\n• Using the adjusted measurements,\
    \ the next phase is to apply spatial inter-\npolation techniques for creating\
    \ detailed pollution maps.\nFigure 4.7 shows the diﬀerent steps taken when transforming\
    \ the raw sensor\nreadings into detailed air pollution maps. Also, next we detail\

    \ between consecutive measure-\nments (absolute values for inter-sample diﬀerences\
    \ have ¯x=6.15, σ=5.73), so data\nretrieval processes should eliminate these oscillations\
    \ associated to noise in the\nsensor readings.\nFor this purpose, we performed\
    \ the following steps: ﬁrst, we\ncalculated the average value of 25 samples (n\
    \ = 25), with an interval of 10ms\nbetween each consecutive sample, as shown in\
    \ equation 4.1:\nOs =\nnP\ni=1\nOi\nn\n(4.1)\nIn this equation, Os represents\
    \ the estimated ozone level, Oi represents the\nozone level sample i obtained\
    \ from the sensor, and n represents the number of\nmeasurements. In this step,\
    \ we slightly reduce the absolute variability (¯x=5.39,\nσ=5.01). Afterward, and\
    \ taking into account that the variability was still very\nhigh, we used a low-pass\
    \ ﬁlter for the data analysis process with α equal to 0.95\nto further reduce\
    \ this variability, as shown in equation 4.2:\nOi = Or + α· (Oi−1 − Or)\n(4.2)\n\
    Oi represents the current ozone level, Oi−1 represents the ozone level in the\n\
    previous measurement, Or represents the ﬁltered ozone value, and α represents\n\
    the ﬁltering coeﬃcient. In this step, we drastically reduce the absolute variability\n\
    (¯x=0.32, σ=0.30).\nFigure 4.8 (a) shows the diﬀerence between the values of captured\
    \ ozone levels,\nand the values of ozone levels after applying the low-pass ﬁlter,\
    \ and ﬁgure 4.8 (b)\n56\n4.4.\nMonitoring Process\nshows the variability after\
    \ applying the mean and the low-pass ﬁlter. It shows\nthat data variability is\
    \ signiﬁcantly reduced while maintaining the correct trend.\nAt the end of this\
    \ process, we have measurements without the variability as-\nsociated to noisy\
    \ sampling.\n4.4.2\nUnit conversion\nSensors provide an electrical signal output.\
    \ It needs to be transformed to a pollu-\ntion level value. Speciﬁcally, the Ozone\
    \ sensor probe (MiC-2610) has an internal\nresistance, which varies proportionally\
    \ to ozone concentrations. The sensor can\nmeasure ozone variations between 10ppb\
    \ and 1000ppb, being that resistance varies\nbetween 11kΩ and 2MΩ with a quasi-linear\
    \ behavior.\nSensor speciﬁcations were made at a constant temperature of 25 degrees\
    \ centi-\ngrade, and vary depending on weather conditions.\nFor calibrating the\
    \ sensor we have done several measurements at diﬀerent days,\nand under diﬀerent\
    \ weather conditions, to get a broad range of values. These data\nhave been compared\
    \ against the data obtained from the oﬃcial monitoring station\nlocated at the\
    \ Technical University of Valencia (UPV), Spain.\nData obtained\nare shown in\
    \ Table 4.1. Considering that the measurements have a dependency\non both ozone\
    \ levels and temperature, we obtained through regression a second\ndegree polynomial\
    \ (see equation 4.3) that takes the temperature and the resistance\nobtained by\
    \ the sensor into account to determine the actual ozone values.\nTable 4.1: Relationship\

    \ result is better in terms of R2.\nCompared against a 3th order regression (R2\
    \ = 0.86), the improvement in R2 is\nminimum, and so diﬀerences are reduced.\n\

    \ O has both time △Ot and spatial △Oe\ndependencies. Since our main goal is to\
    \ determine diﬀerences between ozone levels\nin a particular area, it is necessary\
    \ to eliminate the time variation when attempting\nto calculate the pollution\
    \ value in the same instant time.\n△O = △Ot + △Oe\n(4.5)\n△Oe = △O − △Ot\n(4.6)\n\
    Concerning the pollution variation throughout time, speciﬁcally the Ozone\n(O3),\
    \ we must know the typical behaviour during the day of this pollutant consid-\n\
    ering the known given environment conditions (instant time, temperature, season,\n\
    etc.). For these purposes, we analyzed the historical data from the monitoring\n\
    station located at the Technical University of Valencia in the period between\
    \ 2008\nto 2014.\nIn the historical data analysis, we analyzed the ozone evolution\
    \ focusing on\naverage monthly measurements between 2008 and 2014. It is noted\
    \ that the values\nare higher from April to September, and lower for the remaining\
    \ months. Figure\n4.9 shows the mean values and standard deviation in the shaded\
    \ area, and the\nline on top represents the maximum values. The variation in ozone\
    \ levels during\na representative June day was also analyzed. As shown in Figure\
    \ 4.9(left), ozone\nlevels reach their lowest value at the end of the night, at\
    \ about 6 am, and rise\nto reach maximum values at 2 or 3 pm, beginning to decline\
    \ gradually afterward.\nThe behavior for the other months of the year is analogous\
    \ to the month shown.\nAs a result of the analysis of these data, we observe that\
    \ ozone has a diﬀerent\nbehavior in summer (speciﬁcally, from April to September)\
    \ compared to the rest of\nthe year. During day time, the behavior is very similar\
    \ to the parabolic logarithmic\ndistribution, with an onset of rapid growth followed\
    \ by a less pronounced decline.\nBased on the previous data regarding monthly\
    \ average values between 2008\nand 2014, taken at the monitoring station of the\
    \ Technical University of Valencia,\n58\n4.4.\nMonitoring Process\n50\n100\n0\n\

    \ in June (left) and throughout the year (right).\nozone level prediction relies\
    \ on a parabolic logarithmic regression inﬂuenced by\ntemperature and season of\
    \ the year, one for summer, and one for winter. The\nexpression used (in linear\
    \ format) was the following:\nln(Ot) = α + β1s + β2t + β3 ln(h) + β4 ln(h)2\n\
    (4.7)\nwhere h is time of day, s is the season, t is the temperature, and the\
    \ remaining\nα and βi values are regression coeﬃcients (β1- season coeﬃcient,\
    \ β2- temperature\ncoeﬃcient, β3- coeﬃcient for the logarithm of the time of day,\
    \ β4- coeﬃcient for\nthe logarithm of the time of day squared).\nln(Ot) = −7.70\
    \ + 0.03s − 0.01t + 9.23 ln(h) − 1.77 ln(h)2\n(4.8)\nln(Ot) = −15.43 + 0.12s +\
    \ 0.03t + 14.42 ln(h) − 2.83 ln(h)2\n(4.9)\nThe values of\n\r\rR2\r\r are 0.91\
    \ and 0.82 for summer and winter, respectively,\nshowing a behavior very similar\
    \ to the actual one.\nHaving a idea of how ozone levels typically evolve throughout\
    \ the day in the city\nof Valencia, we proceed to reduce the time-related ozone\
    \ variation corresponding\nto the time evolution observed. We could adjust the\
    \ referential time to any time\ninstant in the trace. Speciﬁcally, for our analysis,\
    \ we consider the starting point\nas our reference.\nThe procedure followed to\
    \ correct time-dependent variability was the following:\n(i) ozone values are\
    \ calculated at two time instants (Starting time and Sampling\ntime) using equation\
    \ 4.7; (ii) next, the diﬀerence between the calculated values\n(Sampling time\
    \ value minus the Starting time value) is calculated obtaining the\ntypical ozone\
    \ variation in these environmental conditions; (iii) using the previously\n59\n\
    4.\nEcoSensor Platform\ncalculated variation, the actual readings are corrected\
    \ (sampled value minus the\ntypical variation).\n4.4.4\nInterpolation data\nThe\
    \ adjusted data is the input for creating detailed pollution maps. In the scope\n\
    of this work, this is achieved by using the R graph tool. Speciﬁcally, we rely\
    \ on\nspatial interpolation techniques known as ordinary kriging. First, a semivariogram\n\
    is calculated for a speciﬁc area, and kriging parameters are determined. Next,\
    \ a\ndetailed pollution distribution is created using the obtained parameters.\
    \ To easily\nvisualize the pollution levels distribution in space, diﬀerent maps\
    \ are created, as\nshown in Figure 4.10.\nGG GGGGGGGG GG G G GG G G GG G G GG\

    \ architecture for environmental monitoring\nthat combines low-end sensors, smartphones,\
    \ and cloud services to measure pol-\nlution levels with high spatial granularity.\
    \ In detail, we used a mobile sensor to\nprovide pollution measurements, a smartphone\
    \ providing real-time feedback about\nair quality conditions, and also acting\
    \ as a gateway by uploading gathered data to\nthe cloud server, in addition to\
    \ the cloud server itself, required for data processing\nand visualization.\n\
    61\n4.\nEcoSensor Platform\nOnce the architecture was deﬁned, we analyzed diﬀerent\
    \ issues related to the\nmonitoring process: (i) Filtering captured data to reduce\
    \ the variability of consec-\nutive measurements; (ii) Converting the sensor output\
    \ to actual pollution levels;\n(iii) Reducing the temporal variations produced\
    \ by the mobile sensing process;\nand (iv) Applying interpolation techniques for\
    \ creating detailed pollution maps.\n62\nChapter 5\nMobile Sensor Design\nIn the\
    \ scope of Air Pollution monitoring, Mobile sensing solutions require the\nuse\
    \ of sensors able to capture the pollution level, as well as the location an the\n\
    time associated to the diﬀerent measurements. Using the captured data, diﬀerent\n\
    processes then take place to ﬁlter and process the information retrieved.\nIn\
    \ our architecture, called EcoSensor, we deﬁne two main components: a cen-\ntral\
    \ server to store and process the data, and a mobile node that carries out the\n\
    capture process; the latter is based mainly on a smartphone as the processing\n\
    element, thereby assuming an edge computing function.\n5.1\nMobile sensing requirements\n\
    Despite relying on smartphones for providing system intelligence, basic mobile\n\
    sensor requirements still involve:\nProcessing: The sensor must be able to process\
    \ the measured data, perform\nbasic ﬁltering tasks, and transfer data to an external\
    \ device. Anyway, in terms of\nprocessing power, requirements are low.\nStorage:\
    \ By assuming that a links towards a smartphone or a similar device\nis available,\
    \ the sensor does not need to actually store large amounts of collected\ndata.\
    \ In fact, since data can be seamlessly relayed to the smartphone in real time,\n\
    the sensor can limit its internal storage to only a few samples.\nCommunication:\
    \ Sensors do not need to have a direct connection to the\ncloud server via Internet,\
    \ but they still need to transfer the collected data to the\nsmartphone. Thus,\
    \ sensors require a communications link compatible with current\nsmartphone technologies\
    \ like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or NFC.\n63\n5.\nMobile Sensor Design\nAutonomy: Sensors\
    \ must be able to operate for long periods using a small\npower supply.\nThus,\
    \ energy optimization becomes a key requirement to take\nadvantage of small batteries.\n\
    Size: Sensors need to be transported by users, or to be quickly installed in\n\
    vehicles (e.g., bicycle, motorcycles, and cars). Thus, they must be small enough\n\
    for the sake of aesthetics and comfort.\nPrice: To be attractive to users, and\
    \ to provide scalability, sensors must be as\ncheap as possible. Otherwise, it\
    \ becomes diﬃcult to meet the broad dissemination\nrequirements of crowdsensing\
    \ approaches.\nTo fulﬁll the technical requirements, a basic mobile sensor should\
    \ be composed\nof a sensor device able to monitor the diﬀerences between diﬀerent\
    \ pollutant lev-\nels, a communications module for transferring the data collected,\
    \ and a microcon-\ntroller/microcomputer acting as a central element for managing\
    \ all tasks.\nFigure 5.1 shows a basic mobile sensor design, and the main characteristics\
    \ to\nconsider. As shown, the sensor hardware module must be able to connect to\
    \ a mi-\ncrocontroller/microcomputer, a connection that typically relies on an\
    \ analog/dig-\nital port. Similarly, the communications module must also be connected\
    \ to the\nmicrocontroller via an UART or USB port. Thus, the microcontroller becomes\
    \ a\ncentral element in the sensing module, being responsible for managing the\
    \ inter-\nactions between all the elements.\nCommunica\n\x01on\nModule\nSensor\n\

    \ diﬀerent analog ports,\nUART/USB ports, a processor, and ﬂash memory (ROM or\
    \ RAM).\n5.2\nOverview of Available Hardware and Software\nIn recent years, the\
    \ appearance of diﬀerent embedded prototyping platforms, such\nas Raspberry Pi\
    \ or Arduino, which are complemented by a large variety of compat-\nible electronic\
    \ components, paved the way for the creation of diverse applications\nrelated\
    \ to IoT. When speciﬁcally focusing on environmental monitoring require-\n64\n\
    5.2.\nOverview of Available Hardware and Software\nments, we ﬁnd that there are\
    \ diﬀerent development options, including diﬀerent\ntypes of sensor, and various\
    \ communication interfaces.\nCommercially, several companies oﬀer small and yet\
    \ powerful boards, along\nwith a large variety of electronic components for personalizing\
    \ them according to\nthe user needs. In addition, there are various companies\
    \ oﬀering extra modules\nor add-ons such as Seeedstudio [102], which oﬀers their\
    \ own sensors for develop-\ning personalized frameworks based on Grove technologies.\
    \ Similarly, Adafruit [1]\nprovides diﬀerent embedded platforms, as well as all\
    \ kinds of electronic compo-\nnents, including personalized add-ons for batteries,\
    \ communication modules, and\nsensor boards compatible with the most widely extended\
    \ platforms: Raspberry\nPi, Arduino, BeagleBone, Intel Edison, or Intel Galileo.\n\
    Focusing on ﬁnal solutions, TST [109] oﬀers products in the ﬁeld of Smart\nCities\
    \ (Waste Management, Industrial Control, Light Control, etc.), basing their\n\
    solutions on their own hardware platform. Likewise, Libelium [78] is a company\n\
    providing various products in the ﬁeld of monitoring (Environment monitoring,\n\
    Agriculture, Water monitoring, etc.); most of the components, and the program-\n\
    ming tool used, are based on the Arduino platform. However, from a crowdsensing\n\
    perspective, the solutions oﬀered are inadequate due to the relatively large sizes\n\
    of the devices, being mostly oriented for public infrastructure deployment.\n\
    Based on the state of the art, we now provide an in-depth analysis of the\ndiﬀerent\
    \ hardware and software components applicable to our mobile air quality\nsensing\
    \ context.\nIn fact, to enable air quality data acquisition, specialized pollution\
    \ sensors\nmust be connected to a microcontroller or microcomputer via an analog\
    \ or digi-\ntal port. Moreover, for communication tasks, the microcontroller/microcomputer\n\
    must be connected to the communications module via an USB port or UART\ninterface.\n\
    In this sense, available options will depend on the microcontroller/\nmicrocomputer\
    \ characteristics.\n5.2.1\nMicrocontroller/Microcomputer-Based Embedded\nSystems\n\
    Despite the lightweight processing constraints, there are several options available\n\
    for embedded systems acting as central elements in the sensor design. In fact,\
    \ it is\npossible to use microcomputers such as Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, or Intel\
    \ Edison,\nwhich use a standard operating system, and that allow developing applications\
    \ for\nsensing tasks in a straightforward manner. Alternatively, it is possible\
    \ to use a\nmicrocontroller board such as Arduino, and develop application-speciﬁc\
    \ ﬁrmware\ninstead.\nRaspberry Pi is nowadays one of the most popular microcomputers\
    \ world-\nwide. It is a low-cost and small-sized computer that allows connecting\
    \ standard\nPC peripherals including a monitor, a keyboard, and a mouse. It was\
    \ designed to\nexplore computing, and it supports diﬀerent Operating Systems:\
    \ Raspbian, which\n65\n5.\nMobile Sensor Design\nis based on Debian, and also\
    \ Ubuntu Mate or Windows 10 IoT Core, thereby\nallowing to use several programming\
    \ languages.\nIn addition, all Raspberry Pi\nversions beneﬁt from several input/output\
    \ ports operating at 5 Volts, thus being\nideal for all sorts of IoT projects.\n\
    There are diﬀerent versions of the Raspberry Pi, as shown Figure 5.2, being\n\
    model A and type 2 the most commonly used. They have diﬀerent characteris-\ntics,\
    \ e.g., Type B oﬀers better performance in terms of memory and processing,\nbut\
    \ Model A consumes much less power. Recently, Raspberry Pi 3 has appeared,\noﬀering\
    \ better features than previous versions, being the major diﬀerence the inte-\n\
    gration in the main board of a Bluetooth and a Wi-Fi module, thereby facilitating\n\
    communication tasks in the scope of IoT projects.\nFigure 5.2: Overview of diﬀerent\
    \ Raspberry Pi models.\nBeagleBone is a small computer running a Linux Operating\
    \ System called\nAngstrom, and supporting various software distributions such\
    \ as Android or Ubuntu.\nIt has an USB port for connecting distinct peripherals,\
    \ along with an HDMI port\nfor video connection, allowing to use it as a regular\
    \ computer. It has two 46 pin\nheaders which operate at 3.3 V, allowing to augment\
    \ the available functionalities\n66\n5.2.\nOverview of Available Hardware and\

    Commercially, we can ﬁnd several Beaglebone versions, being Beaglebone Black\n\
    the most commonly used (see Figure 5.3).\nFigure 5.3: Beaglebone Black microcomputer\
    \ overview.\nIntel Edison is a tiny but powerful computer developed by Intel.\
    \ It is designed\nfor IoT applications, targeting at both prototypes and commercial\

    \ 4.0 interfaces. In\naddition, it can beneﬁt from two types of expansion board:\
    \ an Arduino Expansion\nboard, and a mini breakout board (see Figure 5.4).\nFigure\

    5.2.2\nAir Pollution Sensors\nNowadays, we can ﬁnd a wide variety of sensing technologies\
    \ (see Figure 5.7) for\ngas detection (Metal oxide semiconductor, polymer, carbon\
    \ nanotubes, moisture\nabsorbing materials, Optics, Acoustics, etc.) as shown\
    \ in [79]. Each technology\nhas diﬀerent properties, calibration processes, costs,\
    \ among other characteristics,\nand so a comparison between these diﬀerent technologies\
    \ is required.\nTo evaluate the diﬀerent sensing technologies, we must consider\
    \ some char-\nacteristics, especially when focusing on the design of small mobile\
    \ sensors: (i)\nsensibility, which refers to the range of values that the sensor\
    \ can measure; (ii)\nselectivity, which is the capability of reacting only to\
    \ the target gas; (iii) linear-\nity, which is the rate of change with respect\
    \ to gas variations; (iv) response time,\n71\n5.\nMobile Sensor Design\nFigure\
    \ 5.7: Diﬀerent types of air pollution sensors.\nwhich is the time required to\
    \ start measuring correctly; (v) power consumption;\nand (vi) price.\nIn the market,\
    \ we can easily ﬁnd various gas sensors for air pollution monitor-\ning, being\
    \ the three following types of sensors the most common: electrochemical,\nsemiconductor,\
    \ and infrared. These sensors have a wide range of prices and char-\nacteristics.\
    \ Below we provide more details about each of these sensor types:\nElectrochemical\
    \ gas sensors measure the concentration of some air pollu-\ntant by oxidizing\
    \ or reducing its internal porous membrane, thereby producing\ncurrent changes.\
    \ Usually these sensors behave quite linearly, allowing to make\naccurate measurements.\
    \ They typically operate at 5 V, having a power consump-\ntion of about 600 mW;\
    \ most pollution sensors in this category cost between $100\nand $400.\nSemiconductor\
    \ gas sensors are the most common gas sensors because of\ntheir low cost and high\
    \ sensitivity. They have an internal conductive material that\nincreases their\
    \ conductivity level in the presence of a speciﬁc air pollutant. These\nsensors\
    \ are nonlinear and have a low selectivity, adding diﬃculty to the monitoring\n\
    process. Usually they operate at 5V, having a power consumption in the 500–900\n\
    mW range, and their cost varies between $10 and $35.\nMoisture absorbing material\
    \ sensors are used for measuring temperature\nand humidity. Their dielectric constant\
    \ varies according to the water content in\nthe environment. They operate at 5V,\
    \ having a power consumption of about 0.5W.\nIn addition, they are very cheap,\
    \ with a price of about $5.\nInfrared sensors measure gas/element variations by\
    \ detecting interferences\nin an infrared laser. They are specially adequate for\
    \ monitoring pollutants such as\nﬁne particulate matter sized less than 10 micrometers\
    \ (PM10), or ﬁne particulate\nmatter sized less than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5).\n\
    They usually operate at 5V,\n72\n5.2.\nOverview of Available Hardware and Software\n\
    having a power consumption of about 1W, and their cost is about $40.\nTable 5.3\
    \ provides a brief summary of the most signiﬁcant aspects of these\ndiﬀerent types\
    \ of sensors for comparison purposes.\nTable 5.3: Comparison of diﬀerent sensing\

    \ the RFID [74] standard was developed for IoT solutions, there are cur-\nrently\
    \ several options available for providing communications between the sensors\n\
    and the mobile terminal (usually a smartphone), as analyzed in Chapter 3. Figure\n\
    5.8 shows some communication modules examples. We now proceed to analyze\nthe\
    \ technical characteristics associated to the diﬀerent available options.\nThe\
    \ main characteristics to consider are: (i) distance, that is, the wireless\n\
    coverage range; (ii) communication type, which refers to the characteristics of\
    \ the\nchannel over which messages are transmitted—usually two types are considered,\n\
    i.e. serial-based, when a communications channel is open to transmit a stream\n\
    of data, or message-based, when the data are transmitted via a unique message;\n\
    (iii) message size, which refers to the maximum size of the message when the\n\
    communication is message-based; (iv) power consumption; and (v) price.\n73\n5.\n\

    \ cheap, with prices in the range\nfrom $40–$50, but the most widely used in the\
    \ market, i.e., Wi-Fi and both\nBluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy, are the cheapest\
    \ ones, with prices in the\nrange $10–$15.\nIn terms of power consumption, the\
    \ best option is Bluetooth\nLow Energy (0.05 W), although ZigBee, LoRA, and NFC\
    \ also exhibit low power\nconsumption levels. In terms of bitrate, the best performing\
    \ technology is Wi-\nFi, being that typical wireless sensing technologies, such\
    \ as LoRA, ZigBee, or\nSIGFOX, have a low bitrate. Regarding the communications\
    \ type, there are two\noptions: (i) Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, which open a serial communications\
    \ channel for\n74\n5.3.\nMobile Air Pollution Sensor Design\ntransmitting a stream\
    \ of bytes; and (ii) Bluetooth Low Energy, ZigBee, Sigfox,\nLoRA, and NFC, which\
    \ transmit a message per iteration.\n5.3\nMobile Air Pollution Sensor Design\n\
    The design of a small and cheap mobile sensor is a basic requirement for air\n\
    pollution monitoring. After analyzing the main technical characteristics of hard-\n\
    ware components available in the market, it quickly becomes evident that there\n\
    are many options for creating a mobile air quality sensor for crowdsensing in\
    \ the\nInternet of Things context.\nIf focusing on the mobile sensor/smartphone\
    \ wireless connection, the best op-\ntion is using Bluetooth Low Energy since\
    \ it is able to fulﬁll all requirements (low\npower consumption, low price, and\
    \ small-sized modules), whereas all other options\nhave diﬀerent drawbacks. For\
    \ instance, the ZigBee technology, despite being the\nmost extended technology\
    \ for wireless sensor networks due to its low power con-\nsumption, it is not\
    \ supported by current smartphones. The SIGFOX technology\nhas very strict restrictions\
    \ regarding the number of messages that it is possible\nto generate per time slot,\
    \ thus having little applicability to our aims. The Wi-Fi\ntechnology, although\
    \ being widely used and having a large coverage range, con-\nsumes more power,\
    \ and it is typically used for Internet connectivity. Finally, the\nmajor problem\
    \ of the NFC technology is its coverage range (only about 4 cm).\nIn terms of\
    \ sensor device prototyping, the best option for creating a small\nand cheap mobile\
    \ sensor for air pollution monitoring is the Semiconductor gas\noption. Notice\
    \ that it is cheaper than the electrocavailable.hemical sensor and,\neven though\
    \ the latter is more accurate, the error introduced can be mitigated by\ncombining\
    \ information from other nearby users. Concerning infrared sensors, they\nare\
    \ only applicable to a speciﬁc type of pollutant (ﬁne particulate), while moisture\n\
    absorbing sensors are mostly used to measure temperature and humidity.\nNext,\
    \ we propose and evaluate some possible conﬁgurations for the diﬀerent\nstudied\
    \ boards using a semiconductor gas sensor for pollution monitoring, and\na Bluetooth\
    \ Low Energy interface as the transmission technology.\nFor all the\nproposed\
    \ hardware conﬁgurations, it is possible to use an external USB charger as\na\
    \ power supply to oﬀer more autonomy, while maintaining the support for mobility.\n\
    Figure 5.9 shows the four solutions we have developed to evaluate the diﬀer-\n\
    ent hardware options, and Table 5.5 shows a comparison between these proposed\n\
    solutions.\n75\n5.\nMobile Sensor Design\nFigure 5.9: Proposed mobile sensing\

    The ﬁrst hardware option we propose is based on the Raspberry Pi (RPi) model\n\
    3 platform (see Figure 5.9a). Since it has no analog ports, it has to be provided\n\
    with an analog/digital converter.\nFor this purpose, we propose using GrovePi\n\
    [101], which is an extension board that allows connecting several analog/digital\n\
    grove ports to a Raspberry Pi in an easy way. Furthermore, since the Raspberry\n\
    Pi has several USB ports, we propose using a standard USB Bluetooth module\nfor\
    \ Raspberry Pi 2, or the built-in Bluetooth module for Raspberry Pi 3. With\n\
    this solution, it becomes possible to run several programming languages, as it\
    \ is\npossible to install a Linux or a Windows 10 IoT operating system, and there\
    \ are a\nlot of development eﬀorts around it. This conﬁguration has a power consumption\n\
    76\n5.3.\nMobile Air Pollution Sensor Design\nof about 2000 mW, a total weight\
    \ of 200 g, and it costs about $90. Overall, it\nis the most power-hungry solution\
    \ among the four proposed, but it becomes the\nbest option for quick prototyping\
    \ due to its ﬂexibility and large community of\ndevelopers.\nThe second hardware\
    \ approach relies on the BeagleBone board (see Figure\n5.9b). It has several analog\
    \ ports, allowing us to connect the sensor directly to\nthis board without any\
    \ intermediate device. In addition, since the BeagleBone has\nan USB port, it\
    \ is possible to use a standard USB Bluetooth module. It runs a\nLinux-based operating\
    \ system, allowing to use diﬀerent programming languages,\nbut there are not too\
    \ many developments or projects focusing on this solution.\nThis conﬁguration\
    \ has a power consumption of about 1500 mW, a total weight of\n150 g, and it costs\
    \ about $110, thus being one of the most expensive options. It is\nnot a very\
    \ useful prototyping platform since it has characteristics that are similar\n\
    to the Raspberry Pi, but it has a smaller developer community and less support.\n\
    The third hardware solution we propose is based on the Intel Edison platform\n\
    (see Figure 5.9c). It has an embedded Bluetooth interface, but it does not provide\n\
    an analog port to directly connect the sensor. For this purpose, it is possible\
    \ to use:\n(i) the Arduino expansion board; or (ii) the Breakout board [67]. The\
    \ ﬁrst sensor\nconnection option is very simple; however, the sensor becomes excessively\
    \ large.\nRegarding the second option, the overall size remains small, but it\
    \ is necessary\nto make an ad hoc circuit to connect the sensor. The Edison board\
    \ supports a\nLinux-based operating system (Yocto) including the possibility to\
    \ run Arduino-\nbased scripts.\nFor this last conﬁguration, the power consumption\
    \ is of about\n1000 mW, the total weight is 200 g, and it costs about $130, making\
    \ it the most\nexpensive option. It is mostly useful for end solutions due to\
    \ its price.\nThe last embedded solution we propose is based on the Arduino platform\n\
    (see Figure 5.9d). Since it was designed for these types of solutions, it becomes\n\
    easy to connect a sensor via the existing analog ports; nevertheless, USB ports\n\
    are not available, and so a Bluetooth module must be connected via an UART\nport\
    \ for both Arduino Uno and Arduino Nano boards. This solution only runs\nArduino-based\
    \ scripts, reducing the programming ﬂexibility, but we can ﬁnd a lot\nof developments\
    \ using this platform.\nFor the Arduino Uno solution, the power consumption is\
    \ about 600 mW, the\ntotal weight is 150 g, and it costs about $55. This option\
    \ is improved by the\nArduino Nano solution, which has a power consumption of\
    \ about 600mW, a total\nweight of 60g, and it costs about $50. The latter option\
    \ is better than all others in\nterms of consumption, weight, and price, having\
    \ as its only drawback the limited\nmemory/CPU resources. It is also useful for\
    \ restricted environments where the\npower consumption is very limited.\n77\n\
    5.\nMobile Sensor Design\n5.4\nSummary\nIn this chapter, we have analyzed the\
    \ requirements of an embedded mobile sensor\nplatform from a crowdsensing perspective,\
    \ identifying the basic tasks the sensor\nmust be able to perform. Besides, an\
    \ analysis of the hardware architecture require-\nments has been done, and candidate\
    \ oﬀ-the-shelf hardware components have been\nanalyzed. Finally, several complete\
    \ hardware conﬁgurations meeting all the design\nrequirements have been developed\
    \ and compared in terms of power consumption,\nweight, and cost. Overall, we have\
    \ found that the Arduino Nano platform, despite\nhaving very limited resources,\
    \ is able to fulﬁll the established requirements, thus\nbeing the most recommendable\
    \ alternative in terms of price, weight, and power\nconsumption features.\nRegarding\
    \ other hardware alternatives, microcomputers like Raspberry Pi,\nBeagleBone,\
    \ or Intel Edison are more powerful and ﬂexible by supporting a stan-\ndard Operating\
    \ System, thereby allowing to quickly deploy any application. We\nbelieve that\
    \ the Raspberry Pi solution can be the best option for quick prototyp-\ning. For\
    \ more professional solutions, requiring higher processing capacity, the Intel\n\
    Edison becomes a better option, although imposing a higher overhead in terms of\n\
    development time. Finally, Arduino becomes an option for very restricted envi-\n\
    ronments.\nOverall, we ﬁnd that a hardware solution applicable to all IoT contexts,\
    \ and\nmeeting low size and low power requirements, along with adequate communication\n\
    interfaces and battery capacity, is still missing, although in years to come many\n\
    more products are expected.\n78\nChapter 6\nFinding the optimal measurement\n\
    strategy\nAfter designing the sensor hardware design, deﬁning the overall architecture\
    \ and\nthe monitoring approach, we now proceed to determine the optimal strategy\
    \ for\nair pollution data collection using mobile sensors.\nWith this purpose,\
    \ we ﬁrst analyze the impact of mobility on sensor readings by\ncomparing static\
    \ against mobile measurements. Also, we determine the inﬂuence\nof sensor orientation\
    \ in the mobile sensing process. Afterward, we analyze the\nimpact of reducing\
    \ the sampling frequency on the kriging process accuracy under\nmobile scenarios.\n\
    Similarly, we analyze the impact of reducing the number of\nspatial samples on\
    \ the kriging process accuracy. This was achieved by skipping\nselected streets\
    \ when capturing data, progressively reducing the overall path.\n6.1\nOptimal\
    \ sensor positioning\nTo analyze the impact of mobility on the data capture process,\
    \ we performed dif-\nferent tests, collecting ozone levels in a speciﬁc area either\
    \ statically, or using a\nbike moving at a speed of about 20km/h. For mobility\
    \ tests, we collected measure-\nments with diﬀerent sensor orientations: (i) facing\
    \ forward, (ii) facing backward,\nand (ii) facing up. Statistics for the \"mobile\"\
    \ case combine measurements with\ndiﬀerent sensor orientations.\nTo have further\
    \ insight on how these results are distributed, Figure 6.1 shows\nthat mobility,\
    \ at least at the speed used for testing, i.e., up to 20Km/h, does not\nhave a\
    \ signiﬁcant impact on sensor measurements.\n79\n6.\nFinding the optimal measurement\

    \ relevant diﬀerence between the static sensor (¯x= 27.39, σ =\n0.85), and the\
    \ mobile sensor (¯x= 27.34, σ = 1.03), obtaining a p-value = 0.25\nwith an α =\

    \ = 0.38).\nFigure 6.2 shows that the actual sensor orientation has little impact\
    \ on the\ndata capture process, being the diﬀerences between diﬀerent orientations\
    \ minimal.\nAnyway, the backwards orientation option shows greater resemblance\
    \ with the\nstatic measurements, and it was adopted for the tests that follow.\n\

    \ predictions\nIn this section we analyze the impact of time sampling on the predicted\
    \ pollution\nmap. In particular, we want to determine if reducing the number of\
    \ samples allows\nmaking similar predictions or if, on the contrary, there is\
    \ a signiﬁcant prediction\nerror when generating the pollution map. For this purpose,\
    \ we monitored the\nTechnical University of Valencia campus with a mobile ozone\
    \ sensor installed on\na bike.\nTo obtain an accurate distribution of ozone levels,\
    \ we monitored the entire\ncampus by setting the sampling period to the lowest\
    \ value allowed by the sensor\n(5 seconds). Next, we reduced the sampling frequency\
    \ by setting the inter-sample\nperiod to 10, 20, 30, 40, and 80 seconds. This\
    \ experiment was achieved by ﬁltering\nthe full trace, and retrieving datasets\
    \ with 1/2, 1/4, 1/6, 1/8, and 1/16 of the total\ndata, respectively.\nNext, we\
    \ performed spatial interpolation through kriging for each trace, ob-\ntaining\
    \ a detailed pollution distribution. We used the full trace (samples every\n5\
    \ seconds) as reference, and compared it against the results obtained using the\n\
    other datasets.\nTable 6.2 summarizes the statistical analysis for the diﬀerent\
    \ datasets in terms\nof mean, standard deviation, and relative prediction error,\

    experiences a degradation. In particular we ﬁnd that, although the pollution maps\n\
    for inter-sample times of 5 seconds and 20 seconds are quite similar, signiﬁcant\n\
    diﬀerences are also observed when the sampling period grows to 80 seconds; for\n\
    the latter case, the ozone distribution achieved is quite diﬀerent from the one\
    \ used\nas reference (5 seconds). Based on these maps, it becomes quite clear\
    \ that little\ndiﬀerences in terms of basic statistical analysis can represent\
    \ huge diﬀerences in\nterms of the spatial distribution of those values.\n82\n\

    \ on geostatistical predictions\nIn this section we analyze the impact of spatial\
    \ sampling on the predicted pollution\nmap. In particular, we want to determine\
    \ to which degree taking a shorter, less\nexhaustive path throughout the target\
    \ area (reducing the trip time and the number\nof samples accordingly) aﬀects\
    \ the accuracy of the predictions made.\nTo ﬁnd the optimal spatial sampling strategy\
    \ we produce diﬀerent datasets\nby deleting path fragments from the initial trace.\n\
    In detail, starting from the\nfull trace (100% of the data), we deleted selected\
    \ paths so as to produce shorter\nbut yet valid trips, maintaining start and end\
    \ locations. As a result, we obtained\ntraces with 72%, 54%, 50%, 46% and 42%,\
    \ of the total data.\nSimilarly to the previous section we perform, for each dataset,\
    \ a statistical\nanalysis of the resulting data, also obtaining the pollution\
    \ heatmap generated\n83\n6.\nFinding the optimal measurement strategy\nTable 6.3:\

    \ pollution throughout\nthe target area.\nOverall, we can conclude that the spatial\
    \ sampling granularity is the most\nrelevant factor to take into account, being\
    \ time sampling granularity less but\nyet somehow important, and sensor orientation\
    \ the factor having less impact on\nobtained results.\n6.4\nValidation of the\
    \ proposed approach\nAs stated at the beginning of the paper, current infrastructure\
    \ elements allow\nmeasuring pollution levels in cities with high accuracy, although\
    \ with a low spa-\ntial resolution. On the contrary, our proposed mobile sensing\
    \ approach is able to\nachieve a much higher spatial resolution using cheap sensors.\
    \ Thus, in this section,\nwe validate our approach by ﬁrst comparing captured\
    \ values with the range of typ-\nical values concerning to the time of year, and\
    \ then by comparing the ozone maps\ngenerated when relying on either infrastructure-based\
    \ or mobile-based sensing.\nWe started by gathering data in diﬀerent areas of\
    \ Valencia using the proposed\nmobile sensors. Diﬀerent experiments have been\
    \ conducted at diﬀerent times, al-\nlowing to compare the data captured with the\
    \ data from the existing public infras-\ntructure. In particular, for each route\
    \ taken, we ﬁrst reduced the data variability\nusing the proposed low-pass ﬁlter\
    \ (see Equation 4.2). Next, the measurements\nwere adjusted through Equation 4.3.\
    \ Finally, the temporal dependencies of data\nwere reduced according to Equation\
    \ 4.7.\nFigure 6.7 shows data for a particular route, and the common values at\
    \ the\ndate of the capture (February 16, 2015). We can see that the measured ozone\n\
    levels are within the range of historical values for the monitored time, being\
    \ quite\nclose to the expected value (mean). This indicates that, using our methodology,\n\

    \ to compare the actual heat maps for a speciﬁc date and\ntime of day using only\
    \ infrastructure data, and only data obtained by our mobile\nsensor. We can see\
    \ that, by relying on our proposed architecture (see Figure 6.9)\nit becomes possible\
    \ to observe in detail even small pollution variations, while using\nonly infrastructure-based\
    \ data (see Figure 6.8), the observed variations are much\nsmoother, experiencing\
    \ a linear increase or decay from one air quality station to\nthe other.\nOverall,\
    \ it becomes clear that, despite having up to 5 diﬀerent stationary air\nquality\
    \ stations in the city of Valencia, they fail to capture signiﬁcant details\n\
    that are related to areas with more traﬃc congestion (high pollution values) or\n\
    green/windy spaces (low pollution values), thereby leading to some wrong conclu-\n\
    sions. In contrast, our approach is able to provide a greater richness since even\n\
    small variations can be perceived with great detail, thereby meeting the proposed\n\
    goal.\n87\n6.\nFinding the optimal measurement strategy\n6.5\nSummary\nBased on\
    \ the architecture deﬁned, and having developed the diﬀerent system el-\nements,\
    \ in this chapter we analyzed the optimal strategy for air pollution data\ncollection\
    \ using mobile sensors.\nTo address the challenges associated with taking mobile\
    \ measurements in a\ntarget area, we analyzed the inﬂuence of the sensor orientation\
    \ in the data capture\nprocess, as well as the impact of time and spatial sampling.\
    \ In particular, we varied\nthe sampling period and the overall path length to\
    \ determine the most eﬀective\nmonitoring strategy. Experimental results showed\
    \ that the sensor orientation and\nthe sampling period, within certain bounds,\
    \ have very little inﬂuence on the data\ncaptured, while the actual path taken\
    \ had a greater impact on results, especially\nwhen estimating the distribution\
    \ of pollutants throughout the target area.\nFinally, we validated our proposal\
    \ by comparing the values obtained by our\nmobile sensor platform with typical\
    \ values from monitoring stations at the same\ndates and location. Furthermore,\
    \ we compared the resulting heat maps gener-\nated using data from monitoring\
    \ stations against ours, showing that the proposed\nmobile-sensing approach is\
    \ able to provide a much higher data granularity.\n88\nPart III\nUAV-based sensing\
    \ in rural areas\n89\nChapter 7\nUsing UAV-based systems to\nmonitor air pollution\
    \ in areas with\npoor accessibility\nAir quality monitoring is relevant not only\
    \ for the people living in urban areas,\nbut also in rural environments because\
    \ it directly aﬀects crops and diﬀerent an-\nimals/insects [83]. Thus, diﬀerent\
    \ solutions for measuring air quality should be\nsought for such environments.\n\
    Regarding mobile sensing, the crowdsensing approach can deal with air pollu-\n\
    tion monitoring in urban areas, as analyzed in previous chapters using the EcoSen-\n\
    sor platforms (Chapter 4), by installing small sensors in bicycles or the public\n\
    transport system. However, in the countryside, or in areas with poor accessibility,\n\
    the usage of ground vehicles can be quite limited.\nIn this chapter we propose\
    \ the use of UAVs, speciﬁcally of the multicopter\ntype, as an eﬃcient solution\
    \ for quickly and easily monitoring air quality in any\nregion where ground mobility\
    \ is a poor option. To meet the proposed goal, we\nplan mounting a computing unit\
    \ endowed with pollution sensors on the UAV to\ncreate a ﬂying air quality station.\
    \ Our solution allows programming the UAV\ndirectly from a smartphone by deﬁning\
    \ the target region to monitor. The UAV\nthen ﬂies autonomously throughout the\
    \ target area and returns with the desired\ndata. Again using a smartphone, data\
    \ is retrieved from the UAV and uploaded\nto a server for storage and analysis,\
    \ similarly to the approach adopted in the\nEcoSensor platform.\n91\n7.\nUsing\
    \ UAV-based systems to monitor air pollution in areas with\npoor accessibility\n\
    7.1\nMethodology and Proposed Architecture\nTo achieve the desired solution, the\
    \ proposed methodology consists of: (i) clearly\ndeﬁning the design requirements\
    \ of the target solution; (ii) proposing a high-level\noverview of the global\
    \ system architecture; (iii) deﬁning the desired information\nﬂow in the scope\
    \ of the proposed architecture; and (iv) developing an initial pro-\ntotype meeting\
    \ all previous requirements and conditions.\n7.1.1\nDesign requirements\nWe have\
    \ deﬁned ﬁve basic requirements in order to properly fulﬁll our objective\nof\
    \ developing an UAV able to monitor the air pollution in a target area.\nRequirement\
    \ 1: Open multicopter design\nRegarding the multicopter de-\nsign, we seek an\
    \ open platform that is easily scalable and reusable by other re-\nsearchers,\
    \ and whose cost is reduced.\nTo achieve this objective, the diﬀerent\ncomponents\
    \ used to manufacture the multicopter should be standard components\neasily found\
    \ in the market, and that are consistent with the \"open-source\" phi-\nlosophy.\
    \ This will allow any researcher to modify or replace any multicopter com-\nponent\
    \ without a negative impact on the overall performance of the device. To\nachieve\
    \ this goal, the following strategy is proposed: (i) Basic multicopter compo-\n\
    nents, such as the frame, engines, propellers, Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs)\n\
    and batteries, shall be chosen among models available in the market, easily acces-\n\
    sible, and avoiding expensive elements. (ii) The ﬂight controller should be open\n\
    to enable possible modiﬁcations, and shall have a serial communications interface\n\
    following a well-known protocol. (iii) An element oﬀering high-accuracy Global\n\
    Positioning System (GPS) and compass is required for navigation, and it should\
    \ be\nfully compatible with the ﬂight controller. These elements are particularly\
    \ impor-\ntant to allow the controller to know the location, speed and altitude\
    \ of the device\nat any time, and also to ﬂy to predeﬁned positions autonomously.\
    \ (iv) The remote\ncontrol used should be universal to allow adapting it to any\
    \ type of multicopter,\nprogrammable to associate diﬀerent functions to each of\
    \ the controls on demand,\nwhile integrating aspects such as telemetry on the\
    \ same radio frequency link.\nRequirement 2: Integration of an embedded system\
    \ to provide intel-\nligence to the multicopter\nIn order to perform additional\
    \ tasks not related\nto ﬂight and navigation, the existing multicopter hardware\
    \ should be extended\nthrough an embedded, low-power device that is able to operate\
    \ as a fully-featured\ncomputer in practical terms. Preferably, it should support\
    \ the Linux operating\nsystem, along with all associated tools to provide a platform\
    \ that is well known\nand widely used by the open source research community. This\
    \ embedded system\nshould be linked to the ﬂight controller to manage ﬂights.\n\
    92\n7.2.\nOverview of the proposed solution\nRequirement 3: Integration of a complete\
    \ communications system\nThe\ncommunications system of an UAV is especially critical\
    \ considering that any failure\ncan cause losing the control of the device, usually\
    \ resulting in it being crashed or\nbecome lost.\nFor this reason, the communications\
    \ systems adopted should be\nresilient against attacks, and so its design should\
    \ target security and robustness.\nTo allow the UAV to be controlled by mobile\
    \ devices such as smartphones or\ntablets, it should act as a wireless access\
    \ point, creating a secure wireless network\nto which these mobile devices can\
    \ connect to in order to control the UAV remotely.\nThis network will be complemented\
    \ by the UAV’s native communications system,\nincluding remote control and wireless\
    \ telemetry.\nRequirement 4: Integration of pollution monitoring sensors\nThe\
    \ multi-\ncopter should include diﬀerent types of sensors, including temperature,\
    \ humidity,\nand diﬀerent pollutants such as ozone, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen\
    \ oxides,\namong others. These sensors should preferably be connected to the embedded\n\
    system integrated in the multicopter.\nRequirement 5: Cloud-based storage, processing\
    \ and display of data\nThe data collected by the UAV should be retrieved by a\
    \ mobile terminal and\nuploaded to the cloud, where they will be stored along\
    \ with temporal and geo-\ngraphical information. The server is responsible for\
    \ data processing tasks such\nas performing linear unbiased estimations, statistical\
    \ processes commonly referred\nto as ordinary Kriging, and cartographic visualization\
    \ of the data through color\nmaps. This cloud system will allow us, for example,\
    \ to study the pollutant levels\nin a given area at diﬀerent times, on diﬀerent\
    \ days, and at diﬀerent altitudes.\n7.2\nOverview of the proposed solution\nTo\
    \ implement a solution for air pollution monitoring using UAVs we have to\nconsider,\
    \ like in any cyber-physical system, two main aspects: (i) the hardware\nconﬁguration,\
    \ and (ii) the control process for controlling the system behavior.\nBy following\
    \ these guides, our proposal can also be split into two parts: (i)\nthe physical\
    \ conﬁguration of the UAV and the environmental sensors, which are\nanalyzed in\
    \ this chapter, and (ii) the algorithm used to control the UAV for auto-\nmatically\
    \ monitoring a speciﬁc area (PdUC), analyzed in chapter 8.\n7.2.1\nPhysical UAV\
    \ Conﬁguration\nWe have designed a scheme to dynamically drive the UAV by connecting\
    \ the UAV\ncontrol module to a Raspberry Pi [49], and connecting the latter to\
    \ the set of\npollution sensors via an analog converter. The scheme is shown in\
    \ ﬁgure 7.1.\n93\n7.\nUsing UAV-based systems to monitor air pollution in areas\
    \ with\npoor accessibility\nFigure 7.1: Proposed UAV with air pollution sensors.\n\
    The UAV is driven using a Pixhawk Autopilot [84, 85], which controls its\nphysical\
    \ functioning. The Raspberry Pi is mounted over the UAV chassis, and\nit is connected\
    \ to the Pixhawk through a serial port. The sensors are connected\nto the Raspberry\
    \ Pi using a Grove Raspberry Hat (GrovePi) [66], which allows\nconnecting diﬀerent\
    \ kinds of COTS sensors easily. Speciﬁcally, we are using:\n• Pixhawk Autopilot:\
    \ a high-performance ﬂight control module suitable\nfor several types of autonomous\
    \ vehicles including multi-rotors, helicopters,\ncars, boats, and ﬁxed-wind aircrafts.\
    \ It is developed under the independent,\nopen hardware Pixhawk project, and it\
    \ has two main components: (i) an\nAutopilot hardware that provides an industry\
    \ standard autopilot module\ndesigned as a 168 MHz Cortex M4F CPU with 3D ACC/Gyro/MAG/Baro\n\
    sensors, microSD slot, 5 UARTs, CAN, I2C, SPI, ADC, etc.; (ii) an Autopi-\nlot\
    \ software that includes a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) with a\nPOXIS-style\
    \ environment to control the drone.\n• Raspberry Pi: one of the most popular Single\
    \ Board Computers (SBCs)\nworldwide. It is a low-cost and small-sized piece of\
    \ hardware that allows\nexploring computing, and that supports diﬀerent Operating\
    \ Systems. The\nmost popular of them is Raspbian, which is based on Debian, although\n\
    Ubuntu Mate or Windows 10 IoT Core can also be installed, thereby allowing\ndevelopers\
    \ to use diﬀerent programming languages. Besides, all Raspberry\nPi versions beneﬁt\
    \ from several input/output ports operating at 5V, thus\nbeing ideal for all sorts\
    \ of IoT projects.\n94\n7.2.\nOverview of the proposed solution\n• GrovePi: extension\
    \ board that allows to connect several analog/digital\ngrove ports to a Raspberry\
    \ Pi in an easy way. It has several Grove ports:\nseven digital ports, three analog\
    \ ports, three I2C ports, one serial port to\nthe GrovePi, and a serial connector\
    \ to the Raspberry Pi.\n• Grove Sensors: sensors which use a grove-standardized\

    In this chapter, we propose equipping UAVs with pollution sensors to create a\n\
    low-cost mobile air monitoring station that is especially useful in environments\n\
    with poor ground accessibility.\nSpeciﬁcally, we propose a physical conﬁguration\
    \ for the UAV-based sensing\nunit, which integrates a Pixhawk-based controller\
    \ that is connected to a Raspberry\nPi. This way, the Rasberry Pi can act as the\
    \ brain of the device, being equipped\nwith both sensing and controlling capabilities,\
    \ thereby allowing to deploy a wide\nset of applications related with UAV-based\
    \ sensing.\n97\nChapter 8\nPDUC: Pollution-driven UAV\nControl\nIn chapter 5 we\
    \ proposed a physical architecture to enhance an UAV by endowing\nit with sensing\
    \ capabilities. In this chapter, we propose PdUC, a Pollution-driven\nUAV Control\
    \ algorithm that allows to automatically monitor a speciﬁc area by\ncombining\
    \ a Chemotaxis metaheuristic with Particle Swarm Optimization and\nAdaptive Spiral\
    \ mobility.\nWe show that, by using our approach applied to UAV path control,\
    \ it is pos-\nsible to achieve faster and more accurate estimations about the\
    \ location of the\nmost polluted areas with respect to classical area-search approaches.\
    \ Our analysis\nalso takes into account uncertainty-based considerations in the\
    \ sensor sampling\noperations.\n8.1\nUAV mobility control analysis\nFocusing on\
    \ our topic, despite the presence of several works related to air pollution\n\
    monitoring using Unmanned Aerial System (UAS), the majority of these works\ninvolve,\
    \ mainly, swarm creation or communication interaction between them. An\nexample\
    \ of such work is [125], where authors propose a mobility model for a\ngroup of\
    \ nodes following \"Virtual Tracks\" (highways, valley, etc.) operating in a\n\
    predeﬁned \"Switch Station\" mode, where nodes can split or merge with another\n\
    group of nodes.\nIf we analyze works related to mobility models for UAS mobility\
    \ control that\ncould be used for air pollution monitoring tasks, we observe that,\
    \ basically, no\n99\n8.\nPDUC: Pollution-driven UAV Control\nprevious work focuses\
    \ on the coverage improvement for a certain area.\nFor instance, in [20], authors\
    \ propose a mobility model based on the Enhanced\nGauss-Markov model to eliminate\
    \ or limit the sudden stops and sharp turns that\nthe random waypoint mobility\
    \ model typically creates. Also, in [117], authors\npresent a semi-random circular\
    \ movement (SRCM) based model. They analyze\nthe coverage and network connectivity\
    \ by comparing results against a random\nwaypoint mobility model.\nThe authors\
    \ of [89] compare their models against random waypoint-based,\nMarkov-based, and\
    \ Brownian-motion-based algorithms to cover a speciﬁc area, an-\nalyzing the inﬂuence\
    \ of the use of collision avoidance systems in the time to achieve\na full area\
    \ coverage. The work in [73] compares the results of using the \"Random\nMobility\
    \ Model\" and the \"Distributed Pheromone Repel Mobility Model\" as di-\nrection\
    \ decision engines (next waypoint) in UAV environments. The authors of\n[116]\
    \ propose an algorithm to cover a speciﬁc area; it selects a point in space along\n\
    with the line perpendicular to its heading direction, and then it drives the UAV\n\
    based on geometric considerations.\nThere are works focusing on using UAVs for\
    \ speciﬁc tasks involving autonomous\nmovements. An example is [111], where authors\
    \ present a mobility model for the\nself-deployment of an Aerial Ad Hoc Network\
    \ in a disaster scenario in order to\ncreate a ﬂexible aerial communications infrastructure\
    \ that victims can rely upon\nfor communication. The mobility model proposed is\
    \ mainly based on the Jaccard\ndissimilarity metric to control the deployment\
    \ of UAVs that create the network.\nA similar work is presented in [28], where\
    \ instead an in-network density analysis\nis used to select the physical areas\
    \ that need to be visited by a ﬂying robot.\nFocusing solely on existing proposals\
    \ addressing mobility models, we can ﬁnd\nworks such as [24] where authors propose\
    \ the Paparazzi Mobility Model (PPRZM)\nby deﬁning ﬁve types of movements - Stay-On,\
    \ Way-Point, Eight, Scan, and Oval\n- following a deﬁned state machine with diﬀerent\
    \ probabilities to change between\nstates. There are even studies following animal-based\
    \ navigation patterns. An\nexample of such work is [16], where authors investigate\
    \ the UAV placement and\nnavigation strategies with the end goal of improving\
    \ network connectivity, and\nusing local ﬂocking rules that aerial living beings\
    \ like birds and insects typically\nfollow.\nThe use of UAVs for air pollution\
    \ monitoring in a speciﬁc area using multi-\nrotor drones is, however, still not\
    \ present in scientiﬁc literature, and this work\ncan be seen as one of the ﬁrst\
    \ approaches in this direction. Our contribution in\nthis chapter is the deployment\
    \ of a protocol called PdUC (Pollution-driven UAV\nControl) to automatically track\
    \ a target area by focusing on the most polluted\nregions.\n100\n8.2.\nAutonomous\
    \ Driving approach\n8.2\nAutonomous Driving approach\nTo deploy an algorithm for\
    \ automatically monitoring a speciﬁc area we ﬁrst ana-\nlyzed the diﬀerent existing\
    \ possibilities that could be useful to our goals.\nSo, to elaborate the proposed\
    \ PdUC solution, we have used speciﬁc techniques\nsuch as the metaheuristics and\
    \ optimization algorithms described below.\nChemotaxis meta-heuristic\nThe use\
    \ of rotary-wing UAVs, equipped with chemical sensors and tasked to sur-\nvey\
    \ large areas, could follow chemotactic [25] mobility patterns, since their ﬂight\n\
    behavior could easily implement the following two-phase algorithm: ﬁrst, read\
    \ a\npollution concentration while hovering; next, follow a chemotactic step.\n\
    Chemotaxis meta-heuristics are based on bacteria movement. In this model,\nthe\
    \ microorganisms react to a chemical stimulus by moving towards areas with a\n\
    higher concentration of some components (e.g. food) or moving away from others\n\
    (e.g. poison). In our system, we have considered the following adaptation of the\n\
    chemotaxis. Let us consider an agent i moving on a Euclidean plane, located at\n\
    position −→\nP i\nj from an absolute reference axis, and moving along time in\
    \ sequential\nsteps j. For every chemotactic step, a new position −→\nP i\nj is\
    \ calculated based on\nthe previous one, deﬁned by xi\nj−1 and yi\nj−1, plus a\
    \ step size di applying a random\ndirection θi\nj, as speciﬁed in equation 8.1.\n\
    −→\nP i\nj =\n\x12xi\nj−1\nyi\nj−1\n\x13\n+\n\x12di × cos(θi\nj)\ndi × sin(θi\n\
    j)\n\x13\n(8.1)\nθi\nj =\n(\nθi\nj−1 + αi\nj\npi\nj ≥ pi\nj−1\n−θi\nj−1 + βi\n\
    j\npi\nj < pi\nj−1\n(8.2)\nThe direction θi\nj, as shown in equation 8.2, is calculated\
    \ on the basis of the\nconcentration value of a certain chemical component, sampled\
    \ by an agent i at\nstep j: pi\nj. With respect to the previously sampled value\
    \ pi\nj−1, the following two\ntypes of movements are contemplated: Run and Tumble.\
    \ In the former, Run, when\nthe component concentration is increased with respect\
    \ to the previous sample, the\nmovement continues to follow the same direction\
    \ as before (θi\nj−1), plus a random\nangle αi\nj. Regarding the latter, Tumble,\
    \ when the concentration is decreasing, the\nmovement takes a turn in the opposite\
    \ direction −θi\nj−1, plus a random angle βi\nj.\nNotice that both αi\nj and βi\n\
    j are used to introduce variability and to maximize the\ngradient, allowing to\
    \ reach the most polluted areas faster.\n101\n8.\nPDUC: Pollution-driven UAV Control\n\
    Particle Swarm Optimization\nParticle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a technique\
    \ introduced in [44] where a so-\nlution to a problem is represented as a particle\
    \ pi moving in a D-dimensional space\nat a time t; each particle pi maintains\
    \ its position pi\nt, and its best performance\nposition pi\nb. To determine the\
    \ next position pi\nt+1, PSO calculates the stochastic\nadjustment in the direction\
    \ of the previous best local position of i’s pi\nb element,\nalong with the general\
    \ best position of any element pg\nb, as shown in equation 8.3:\npi\nt+1 = α ·\
    \ pi\nt + U(0, β) · (pi\nb − pi\nt) + U(0, β) · (pg\nb − pi\nt)\n(8.3)\nwhere\
    \ α and β are constants used to calibrate the algorithm, and U(0, β) is a\nrandom\
    \ number in the range [0, β].\n8.3\nProposed Autonomic Solution\nTo consistently\
    \ drive the UAVs, so as to achieve the desired area coverage goals, we\nhave devised\

    \ 8.3: PdUC algorithm: exploration phase.\nIn this context, we have developed\
    \ an algorithm called Pollution-driven UAV\nControl (PdUC), based on the chemotaxis\
    \ metaheuristic concept, to search an\narea for the highest pollution concentration\
    \ levels. Once this pollution hotspot\nis found, the ﬂying drone covers the whole\
    \ area by following a spiral movement,\nstarting from the most polluted location.\n\
    Our algorithm is composed of two phases: (i) A search phase, in which the UAV\n\
    searches for a globally maximum pollution value, and (ii) An exploration phase,\n\
    where the UAV explores the surrounding area, following a spiral movement, until\n\
    one of the following conditions occurs: it covers the whole area, the allowed\
    \ ﬂight\ntime ends, or it ﬁnds another maximum value, in which case it returns\
    \ to the\n103\n8.\nPDUC: Pollution-driven UAV Control\nsearch phase, as shown\
    \ in Figure 8.1.\nThe exploration phase is mainly based on two previously described\
    \ techniques:\na chemotaxis metaheuristic, and a local Particle Swarm Optimization\
    \ algorithm.\nAs detailed in Algorithm 1, initially, before the UAV starts its\
    \ ﬁrst movement, it\nsamples the pollution value and inserts it in a buﬀer. For\
    \ each chemotactic step,\nit starts to hover, collects another sample, and compares\
    \ it with the previous one.\nIf the sampling variation is positive (increasing),\
    \ the UAV follows a \"Run\" chemo-\ntaxis direction, with a random αi\nj of [−30,\
    \ 30] degrees. Otherwise, if the sampling\nvariation is decreasing, the UAV calculates\
    \ the \"Tumble\" chemotaxis direction in\nthe reverse orientation with a random\
    \ βi\nj of [−150, 150] degrees, although modiﬁed\nby the actual maximum value\
    \ reached (mdi), as shown in ﬁgure 8.2. Equation 8.4\ndenotes the formula to calculate\
    \ the new direction, and γ speciﬁes the weight of\nthe mdi, which must be between\
    \ 0 and 1.\nAlgorithm 1 PdUC Search Phase.\n1: while isSearching do\n2:\nppollution\n\

    20: end\nTo determine when our PdUC has found a maximum local value, we use a\n\
    TTL (Time-to-live) counter. When PdUC ﬁnds a maximum value, the TTL is\nreset\
    \ and then it starts increasing until a new maximum pollution value is found\n\
    again, or until the maximum TTL value is reached. In this case, PdUC reverts to\n\
    the exploration phase since it considers that a new local maximum value has been\n\
    104\n8.3.\nProposed Autonomic Solution\nfound.\nθi\nj =\n(\nθi\nj−1 + αi\nj\n\
    Run\n(1 − γ)(−θi\nj−1 + βi\nj) + γmdi\nTumble\n(8.4)\nOnce a maximum value is\
    \ reached, the next phase is to explore the surrounding\narea. As shown in algorithm\
    \ 2, this is achieved by following an Archimedean spiral\nsimilar to the one depicted\
    \ in Figure 8.3. Starting from the maximum value, it\ncovers the surrounding area\
    \ by applying a basic step size di\nj, and changing it\ndepending on the detected\
    \ pollution variations, a procedure that is similar to the\nfinding phase. If\
    \ the variation is less than a preset value ci, the step size increases\nuntil\
    \ reaching 3 × di\nj; otherwise, it decreases until di\nj is reached. If a maximum\n\
    pollution value is found, PdUC automatically returns to the exploration phase.\n\
    Finally, once the whole area is covered, the UAV changes to a return-to-base\n\
    (RTB) mode to ﬁnish the exploration.\n8.3.2\nAlgorithm optimization\nNext, analyzing\
    \ the overall behavior, we have introduced some modiﬁcations to\noptimize the\
    \ performance of the proposed PdUC algorithm.\nSpiralling with alternating directions\n\
    As shown in Figure 8.4, to avoid large steps in the exploration phase when the\n\
    spiral center is next to a border, the direction of the spiral will alternate\
    \ for each\nround to allow minimizing the length of some of the steps. To this\
    \ purpose, for each\nspiral round, we calculate the direction adopted as being\
    \ the opposite direction\nwith reference to the previously used one. The system\
    \ can get the general size\nof the area to search, as well as its borders, before\
    \ starting the mission. This\nprocedure takes place in line 4 of Algorithm 2.\n\
    In detail, it basically follows\nequations 8.5 and 8.6:\nθs,r =\n(\nα + βs,c\n\
    if r is even\nα − βs,c\nif r is odd\n(8.5)\nps,r =\n\x12xs\nys\n\x13\n=\n\x12\

    \ s. Using the angle θs,r, the next point ps is calculated using\nas reference\
    \ the coordinates for the spiral center (xc and yc) and radius Rs.\n105\n8.\n\

    As shown in Figure 8.5, to avoid monitoring the same area multiple times, all\
    \ sam-\nples, which were taken within the monitored area during the exploration\
    \ phase, are\ninternally stored. For this purpose, PdUC maintains a list containing\
    \ the location\nof the central position of all spirals with their respective radius\
    \ to determine the\nmonitored areas (as a circumference determined by a center\
    \ and a radius). Next,\nin the exploration phase, all points inside these circles\
    \ are omitted for the sake of\ncelerity, as shown in line 9 of Algorithm 2.\n\

    over a randomly generated pollution map.\nTo prepare a suitable data environment,\
    \ we have created various synthetic pol-\nlution distribution maps representing\
    \ ozone levels to be used as inputs for testing.\nThese pollution maps were generated\
    \ using the R Graph tool [96], and following a\nKriging-based interpolation [108].\
    \ In particular, a Gaussian distribution is used to\nadjust the parameters coming\
    \ from random data sources of ozone concentration.\nThe actual values range between\
    \ 40 and 180 ppb, thereby providing a realistic\nozone distribution.\nFigure 8.7\
    \ shows some samples of the created maps, which have the highest\npollution concentration\
    \ (areas in red) located at completely diﬀerent positions due\nto the stochastic\
    \ scenario generation procedure adopted.\nUsing the previously created data as\
    \ input, we have run several simulations\n108\n8.4.\nValidation & Simulation\n\

    \ deﬁned for the test.\nFigure 8.8 shows an example of the path followed by an\
    \ UAV using the PdUC\nalgorithm as a guidance system. As expected, the UAV starts\
    \ a search process\nthroughout the scenario until it locates a position with the\
    \ highest degree of pol-\nlution (local maximum). Afterward, it follows a spiral\
    \ pattern to gain awareness\nof the surrounding gradients. If, while following\
    \ the spiral-shaped scan path, it\nﬁnds a higher pollution value, the algorithm\
    \ again switches to the search phase.\nFinally, when the entire target area has\
    \ been sampled, the algorithm ﬁnishes.\nTo compare the three options under study,\
    \ we recreate, using the R Graph\ntool, the pollution distribution maps using\
    \ the simulation output as the input for\nthe Kriging-based interpolation. In\

    \ Example of an UAV path when adopting the PdUC mobility model.\nrelies on synthetic\
    \ maps that are generated by combining a random Kriging inter-\npolation following\
    \ a Gaussian model, with values between 40 and 180 units, based\non the Air Quality\
    \ Index (AQI) [2]. Since samples are taken using oﬀ-the-shelf\nsensors, which\
    \ are not precise, we introduce a random sampling error of ±10 ppb\nbased on real\
    \ tests using the MQ131 (Ozone) sensor. In our simulation, we set the\nmaximum\
    \ UAV speed to 20 m/s, a value achievable by many commercial UAVs.\nThe step distance\
    \ deﬁned between consecutive samples is 100 meters. Once a new\nsampling location\
    \ is reached, the monitoring time per sample is deﬁned equal to\n4 seconds.\n\
    The mobility models used are Billiard, Spiral, and PdUC. These models have\ndiﬀerent\
    \ assumptions regarding the initial UAV position. In the Billiard model,\nthe\
    \ UAV starts in a corner of the target area, and it then covers the whole area\n\
    by \"bouncing\" when reaching the borders. The Spiral model starts at the center\n\
    of the area to cover, and it then gradually moves to the periphery of the scenario\n\
    following a spiral pattern. Finally, PdUC is set to start at a random position\n\
    110\n8.4.\nValidation & Simulation\nwithin the target area.\nWe now proceed by\
    \ analyzing the time required to cover the entire area using\neach of the approaches\
    \ being tested. For this purpose, we deﬁned 100 simulations\nfor each model (Billiard,\
    \ Spiral, and PdUC), and calculated the required time to\ncover the whole area,\
    \ estimating the pollution map afterward.\nFor each run, the starting position\
    \ of the UAV is randomly set on the map, as\nshown in Figure 8.6.\nFigure 8.9\
    \ shows the Cumulative Distribution Function relative to the time\nrequired to\
    \ cover the whole area for the three mobility models. It can be seen that\nthe\
    \ Billiard and Spiral models do not depend on the start position, spending a\n\
    nearly constant time (5600 and 2600 seconds, respectively) for each conﬁguration\n\
    deﬁned. In the case of the PdUC mobility model, since it reacts to air pollution,\n\
    the time required to cover the complete area varies between 1800 and 4300 seconds,\n\
    depending on the start position.\nFigure 8.9: Cumulative Distribution Function\
    \ of the time spent at covering the\ncomplete area for the Billiard, Spiral and\

    \ how fast each mobility\n111\n8.\nPDUC: Pollution-driven UAV Control\nmodel discovers\
    \ the most polluted areas, and how accurately does it recreate the\npollution\
    \ distribution. For this purpose, we analyze the relative error for the three\n\
    mobility models at diﬀerent time instants (600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 3000 and 6000\n\
    seconds); this error is deﬁned by equation 8.7:\net =\nPm\ni=1\nPn\nj=1| sx,y,t−bx,y\n\

    \ shows the temporal evolution of the relative error between the\nthree mobility\
    \ models (Billiard, Spiral, and PdUC) and the original one. We can\nobserve that\
    \ all mobility models have roughly the same behavior: they start with\na high\
    \ relative error, which is foreseeable since we are using Kriging interpolation\n\
    112\n8.4.\nValidation & Simulation\nto recreate the pollution distribution, and\
    \ it tends to the mean value when the\nnumber of samples is not enough. Then,\
    \ as more samples become available, the\nspatial interpolation process quickly\
    \ becomes more precise.\nAlthough the three mobility models are similar, the spiral\
    \ approach achieves\na better performance in terms of relative error reduction.\
    \ However, if we analyze\nonly the most polluted regions, that is, regions characterized\
    \ by values higher than\na certain threshold (120 and 150 ppm in our case, based\
    \ on AQI [2]), we ﬁnd that\nPdUC clearly provides better results.\nFigure 8.11:\

    \ than doubling the error values in the same\nscenarios. In particular, the Billiard\
    \ mobility pattern requires about 6000 seconds\nto achieve a similar degree of\
    \ accuracy (120 ppb case), while the Spiral approach is\nnot able to achieve values\
    \ as low as PdUC in any of the cases. This occurs because\nPdUC focuses on the\
    \ highest values in the chemotaxis-based phase. PdUC always\nprioritizes the most\
    \ polluted areas in detriment of less polluted ones, thus allowing\nto obtain,\
    \ at least, details about the region with the highest pollution values.\nTo complete\

    \ We can observe that PdUC is able to quickly ﬁnd the most polluted\nareas, while\

    \ proposed PdUC (Pollution-driven UAV Control), an algorithm\nto guide an UAV\
    \ monitoring a speciﬁc area by focusing on the most polluted zones.\nPdUC is based\
    \ on a Chemotaxis metaheuristic, a local Particle Swarm Op-\ntimization (PSO),\
    \ and Adaptive Spiral concepts, creating an algorithm able to\nquickly ﬁnd areas\
    \ with high pollution values, and to cover the surrounding area\nas well, thereby\
    \ obtaining a complete and detailed pollution map.\nTo validate our proposal,\
    \ we compared our approach against the Billiard and\nSpiral mobility models through\
    \ simulations implemented in OMNeT++.\nSim-\nulation experiments show that PdUC\
    \ oﬀers signiﬁcantly better performance at\nreducing prediction errors, especially\
    \ concerning high-value pollution range.\n116\nChapter 9\nPdUC-D: Discretized\n\
    Pollution-driven UAV Control\nWhen focusing on UAV control systems for air pollution\
    \ monitoring tasks, we have\nfound that there are no systems optimized for such\
    \ purposes. So, in chapter 8 we\nproposed PdUC, a solution that puts the focus\
    \ on the most polluted regions by\ncombining a chemotaxis metaheuristic with adaptive\
    \ spiral mobility patterns to\nautomatically track pollution sources and surrounding\
    \ pollution values in a given\ntarget area. We showed that PdUC achieves better\
    \ performance than standard\nmobility approaches, like the Spiral and the Billiard\
    \ patterns, in terms of discov-\nering the most polluted areas in a shorter time\
    \ span. In this chapter, we extend\nPdUC by proposing an optimized algorithm,\
    \ called PdUC-D, that applies space\ndiscretization to substantially reduce the\
    \ convergence time while achieving levels\nof accuracy similar to those of PdUC.\n\
    9.1\nPdUC-D: Optimizing the PdUC protocol through\ndiscretization\nDespite PdUC\
    \ is more eﬀective than other mobility patterns (Spiral and Billiard)\nin terms\
    \ of polluted area monitoring times, ﬁnding the most highly polluted loca-\ntions\
    \ earlier, as shown in chapter8, PdUC still spends too much time focusing on\n\
    small variations (e.g. produced by sensor errors, or minimal pollution variations)\n\
    in nearby areas, which are not useful when obtaining the global pollution map;\n\
    on the contrary, the Spiral and Billiard models present simpler mobility patterns\n\
    that, by themselves, avoid such redundant sampling. So, in this work, we attempt\n\
    117\n9.\nPdUC-D: Discretized Pollution-driven UAV Control\nFigure 9.1: Example\
    \ of a discretized area, calculating the tiles and their center\nto restrict movements.\n\
    to avoid redundant movements (sampling) by discretizing the target area, dividing\n\
    it into small tiles.\nThe main idea is to optimize PdUC by discretizing the whole\
    \ target area.\nSpeciﬁcally, we will create a grid composed of small tiles. Notice\
    \ that discretization\nis one of the most eﬃcient mathematical approaches to optimize\
    \ a system by\ntransforming a continuous domain into its discrete counterpart\
    \ [47], as shown in\nFigure 9.1. This way, the UAV can only move to the center\
    \ of each tile, and each\ntile can only be monitored once, thereby reducing redundant\
    \ sampling, which in\nturn reduces the full coverage time signiﬁcantly.\nPdUC-D,\
    \ just like PdUC, combines a chemotaxis metaheuristic with an adap-\ntive spiral,\
    \ the diﬀerence being that both these mechanisms are adapted to operate\nwithin\
    \ discretized space environments. Therefore, PdUC-D starts by ﬁrst search-\n118\n\

    ing the tile with the highest pollution level (Search phase). Next, it covers\
    \ the\nsurrounding area by following an adaptive spiral until all the area is\
    \ covered, or\nuntil it can ﬁnd another tile with a higher pollution value (Explore\
    \ phase), thereby\nswitching back to the Search phase.\nWe modify the PdUC phases\
    \ by adapting its functionality to a discretized\nspace, as shown in Figure 9.2.\
    \ So, the ﬁrst step involves splitting the target area\ninto small tiles and calculating\
    \ the center positions of these tiles (actual locations\nwhere monitoring takes\
    \ place). Next, the search and the explore phase are modiﬁed\nto operate in the\
    \ discretized space as well.\nThe search phase is based on a chemotaxis mobility\
    \ pattern and an adaptation\nof the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) [71] algorithm.\

    \ two tiles, and following a speciﬁc direction, moves towards the next tile\n\
    in the same direction (Run move) if the pollution variation is increasing along\n\
    its path. Otherwise, if the pollution variation is decreasing, it moves around\
    \ the\ntile with higher previously monitored pollution values, assigning higher\
    \ priority\nto nearer tiles (Tumble move); namely, it chooses the nearest tile.\
    \ The procedure\nof moving around the maximum monitored value is an adaptation\
    \ of the PSO,\n120\n9.2.\nValidation\nwhich takes the maximum value into account.\
    \ If all tiles around the one with the\nhighest detected value have already been\
    \ monitored, the algorithm switches to the\nExplore phase, just like PdUC does.\n\
    The Explore phase is based on an adaptive spiral modiﬁed to a discretized\nspace\
    \ environment, as shown in ﬁgure 9.4. The three main types of movements in-\n\
    volved are: ﬁrst (see ﬁgure 9.4, top), starting at the tile with the highest monitored\n\
    pollution value, it follows a square spiral. For each round in the spiral, it\
    \ skips an\nincreasing number of tiles. Namely, in the ﬁrst round, it has a radius\
    \ of 3 tiles and\nit skips 1 tile; in the second round, it has a radius of 5 tiles\
    \ and skips 2 tiles, and\nso on. Next, to avoid excessively long steps, if the\
    \ spiral radius reaches a scenario\nborder, or previously monitored areas, the\
    \ direction of the spiral is changed by\nalternating the movement direction so\
    \ as to rotate in the opposite direction, as\nshown ﬁgure 9.4 (middle). Finally,\
    \ for controlling previously monitored areas (see\nﬁgure 9.4, bottom), we consider\
    \ as an already monitored area the whole square\ncreated at the end of each spiral\
    \ round.\nWith regard to movement control, and to avoid re-visiting previously\
    \ monitored\nareas, we use two matrixes - Pm,n and Bm,n - to store the sampled\
    \ values and the\nmonitored tiles, respectively. Notice that n × m represents\
    \ the size of the grid\n(rows and columns, respectively).\nPm,n =\n\n\n\n\n\

    \ In\nthe search phase, when monitoring a tile ti,j (i and j are the row and the\
    \ column\nposition, respectively), the pollution values are stored in Pi,j, and\
    \ Bi,j values are\nset to 1. When monitoring a tile either in the explore phase\
    \ or in the search\nphase, both P and B values are stored. However, when completing\
    \ a spiral round,\nall tiles inside the square are set as visited in B, thereby\
    \ avoiding to monitor the\nsame area again in the future.\n9.2\nValidation\nWe\

    \ Pollution-driven UAV Control\ntesting. These pollution maps were also generated\
    \ using the R Graph tool following\nKriging-based interpolation [108]. In particular,\
    \ a Gaussian distribution is used to\nadjust the parameters coming from random\
    \ data sources of ozone concentration.\nThe actual values range between 40 and\
    \ 180 ppb, thereby providing a realistic\nozone distribution.\nObtained data using\
    \ PdUC-D was compared against previous results obtained\nusing PdUC [5]. Figure\
    \ 9.6 shows an example of the path followed by an UAV\nusing (a) PdUC and (b)\
    \ PdUC-D as a guidance system. As expected, both al-\ngorithms have, in general,\
    \ a similar behaviour: the UAV starts a search process\nthroughout the scenario\
    \ until it locates a position with the highest degree of pollu-\ntion (local maximum).\
    \ Afterward, it follows a spiral pattern to gain awareness of\nthe surrounding\
    \ gradients. If, while following the spiral-shaped scan path, it ﬁnds\na higher\
    \ pollution value, the algorithm again switches to the search phase. Fi-\nnally,\
    \ when the entire target area has been sampled, the algorithm ﬁnishes. When\n\
    adopting PdUC-D, though, we can clearly see that it achieves better performance\n\
    by reducing the monitoring time while avoiding redundant sampling.\nTo analyze\
    \ PdUC-D, we used the same simulation parameters as the ones\nadopted for validating\
    \ PdUC [8]. Table 9.1 summarizes the parameters used in\nthe simulations.\nTable\

    First of all, we analyze the impact of varying the tile size between 50m and\n\
    400m. Our goal is to determine which is the best size considering our restrictions.\n\
    Figure 9.7 shows the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) relative to the\n\
    ﬂight time required to cover the whole area for four tile sizes (50m, 100m, 200m,\n\

    the coverage time, reaching values that range from 2400 to 4600 seconds for a\n\
    tile size of 50m, while for tiles size of 200m and 400m these coverage times are\
    \ in\nthe range from 800 to 1500 seconds. For a tile size of 100m, the coverage\

    \ but it can be considered too high (almost 10%) when compared with\nthe other\
    \ cases. In the 100m case, although the ﬁnal relative error is only a bit\n127\n\

    \ the 50m case (4.8%), the time to reach this error is still\nmanageable. For\
    \ these reasons, we consider that the tile size oﬀering the best\ntrade-oﬀ between\

    \ We can observe that all mobility models roughly show the same\nbehavior: they\
    \ start with a high relative error, which is foreseeable since we are\nusing Kriging\

    \ towards the mean error value as the number of samples increases. Then,\nas more\
    \ and more samples become available, the spatial interpolation process\nquickly\

    \ the most polluted areas, creating pollution maps for the surrounding area\n\
    afterward. PdUC-D is based in the Chemotaxis and Adaptive Spiral principles, but\n\

    \ Work\nA\nir Pollution monitoring has become a fundamental requirement for cities\n\
    worldwide, and there are many studies related to it. Commonly, air pollution\n\
    monitoring relies on ﬁxed monitoring stations to carry out the pollution control.\n\
    However, this method is too expensive and hard to implement in any city. On the\n\
    other hand, the fast growth of Smart Cities has brought a set of technologies\
    \ to\nimprove diﬀerent aspects of urban environments.\nBased on Smart City technologies,\
    \ in this thesis we have proposed an inte-\ngral solution to monitor air pollution\
    \ in both rural and urban areas considering\ntheir diﬀerences, using a Mobile\
    \ Crowdsensing (MCS) approach focusing on smart-\nphones as the fundamental piece\
    \ of our architecture.\nIn urban areas, we deploy a platform to monitor the city\
    \ using a mobile sensor\ninstalled on common vehicles such as bicycles or the\
    \ public transport system,\nintegrated with a smartphone to accelerate the retrieval\
    \ of samples and their\nuploading to the cloud, and a cloud-based system for data\
    \ processing.\nMoreover, analyzing the requirements of the rural areas, we consider\
    \ the use\nof UAVs to monitor the air pollution in a speciﬁc area. Speciﬁcally,\
    \ we proposed\na physical architecture to embed the desired air quality sensor\
    \ on the UAV and\nmonitor the air pollution. Afterward, we proposed an algorithm\
    \ to control the\nUAV, and monitor a certain area in an autonomous manner by focusing\
    \ on the\nmost polluted areas.\nBelow we brieﬂy summarize the most relevant contributions\
    \ of this thesis:\n• EcoSensor Platform. We proposed a complete architecture for\
    \ environ-\nmental monitoring that combines low-end sensors, smartphones and cloud\n\
    services to measure pollution levels with a high spatial granularity. In detail,\n\
    we used a mobile sensor to provide pollution measurements, a smartphone\n133\n\
    9.\nPdUC-D: Discretized Pollution-driven UAV Control\nproviding real-time feedback\
    \ about air quality conditions, and also acting as\na gateway by uploading gathered\
    \ data to the cloud server, in addition to the\ncloud server itself, required\
    \ for data processing and visualization.\nOnce the architecture was deﬁned, we\
    \ analyzed diﬀerent issues related to\nthe monitoring process: (i) Filtering captured\
    \ data to reduce the variability\nof consecutive measurements; (ii) Converting\
    \ the sensor output to actual\npollution levels; (iii) Reducing the temporal variations\
    \ produced by the mo-\nbile sensing process; and (iv) Applying interpolation techniques\
    \ for creating\ndetailed pollution maps.\nTo address the challenges associated\
    \ with taking mobile measurements in\na target area, we analyzed the inﬂuence\
    \ of the sensor orientation in the\ndata capture process, as well as the impact\
    \ of time and spatial sampling.\nIn particular, we varied the sampling period\
    \ and the overall path length to\ndetermine the most eﬀective monitoring strategy.\
    \ Experimental results show\nthat the sensor orientation and the sampling period,\
    \ within certain bounds,\nhave very little inﬂuence on the data captured, while\
    \ the actual path taken\nhas a greater impact on results, especially when estimating\
    \ the distribution\nof pollutants throughout the target area.\nFinally, we validated\
    \ our proposal by comparing values obtained by our\nmobile sensor with typical\
    \ values from monitoring stations at the same dates\nand location. Furthermore,\
    \ we compared the resulting heat maps generated\nusing data from monitoring stations\
    \ against ours, showing that our mobile-\nsensing approach is able to provide\
    \ a much better data granularity.\n• Low Cost Sensor Design. We presented the\
    \ general design of an oﬀ-the-\nshelf mobile environmental sensor able to cope\
    \ with air quality monitoring\nrequirements; we explore diﬀerent hardware options\
    \ to develop the desired\nsensing unit using readily available devices, discussing\
    \ the main technical\nissues associated with each option.\nRegarding other hardware\
    \ alternatives, microcomputers like Raspberry Pi,\nBeagleBone, or Intel Edison\
    \ are more powerful and ﬂexible by supporting a\nstandard Operating System, thereby\
    \ allowing to quickly deploy any applica-\ntion. We believe that the Raspberry\
    \ Pi solution can be the best option for\nquick prototyping. For more professional\
    \ solutions, requiring higher process-\ning capacity, the Intel Edison becomes\
    \ a better option, although imposing\na higher overhead in terms of development\
    \ time. Finally, Arduino becomes\nan option for very restricted environments.\n\
    Overall, we ﬁnd that a hardware solution applicable to all IoT contexts, and\n\
    meeting low size and low power requirements, along with adequate commu-\nnication\
    \ interfaces and battery capacity, is still missing, although in years to\ncome\
    \ many more products are expected.\n134\n9.3.\nSummary\n• UAV design for Air Pollution\
    \ Monitoring tasks. We proposed a solu-\ntion where we equip an UAV with COTS\
    \ sensors for monitoring tasks, using\na Pixhawk Autopilot for UAV control, and\
    \ a Raspberry Pi for the sensing\nand storage of environmental pollution data.\n\
    • Pollution-driven UAV Control (PdUC). To automatically analyze pol-\nlution values\
    \ within a target area, we proposed an adaptive algorithm for\nautonomous navigation\
    \ called PdUC. This algorithm allows an UAV to au-\ntonomously monitor a speciﬁc\
    \ area by prioritizing the most polluted zones.\nIn particular, PdUC combines\
    \ diﬀerent concepts including a Chemotaxis\nmetaheuristic, a local Particle Swarm\
    \ Optimization (PSO), and an Adap-\ntive Spiralling technique, to create an algorithm\
    \ able to quickly search for\nhotspots having high pollution values, and to cover\
    \ the surrounding area as\nwell, thereby obtaining a complete and detailed pollution\
    \ map of the target\nregion.\nTo validate our proposal, we compared the proposed\
    \ PdUC solution against\nthe Billiard and Spiral mobility models through simulations\
    \ implemented in\nOMNeT++. Simulation experiments show that PdUC oﬀers signiﬁcantly\n\
    better performance at reducing prediction errors, especially regarding the\naccuracy\
    \ achieved for the high-values range.\n• Discretized Pollution-driven UAV Control\
    \ (PdUC-D). We improved\nthe PdUC algorithm by proposing a discretized version\
    \ called PdUC-D (Dis-\ncretized Pollution-driven UAV Control). PdUC-D has the\
    \ same phases as\nthe original PdUC proposal (Search and Explore), and it is based\
    \ on the\nsame principles (Chemotaxis and Adaptive Spiral), but its functionality\
    \ was\nmodiﬁed to work in a space-discretized area, avoiding redundant sampling,\n\
    thereby making it much more optimal.\nWe have compared PdUC-D against PdUC using\
    \ the R Tool, and compar-\ning these results with the previously obtained ones.\
    \ Experimental results\nshow that PdUC-D has much better performance than PdUC\
    \ in all aspects,\nreducing the time to cover a same area, and reducing the estimation\
    \ error.\nHaving accomplished all our objectives, the original goal of this thesis\
    \ has\nbeen achieved, and so this dissertation can now be concluded. The next\
    \ section\nenumerates the publications related to this thesis. The last section\
    \ of this chapter,\nrefers to some open issues for the future.\nPublications\n\
    This section lists the publications that have been produced as a result of this\n\
    thesis, as well as some other collaborations and related publications we published\n\

    Future Work\nIn this thesis we proposed relying on the mobile crowdsensing paradigm\
    \ to monitor\nair pollution monitoring by focusing on Ozone, evaluating all work\
    \ phases asso-\nciated to the monitoring of this pollutant. As future work, we\
    \ could analyze in\nmore detail other pollutants such as Particle Matter, Carbon\
    \ Monoxide, Carbon\nDioxide, and Lead.\nMoreover, we used a smartphone as the\
    \ gateway between the sensor (Edge) and\nthe central server (Cloud). As future\
    \ work we could analyze the use of LPWAN\ntechnologies, such as LoRa, to transmit\
    \ the data to the central server.\nSince technologies such as LoRa are restricted\
    \ in terms of message size and\ntransmission speed, we could analyze the best\
    \ option to encode the data, the best\ntransmission frequency, etc.\nConcerning\
    \ to rural pollution monitoring, in the thesis we have only considered\noperations\
    \ limited to a single UAV. The next step in our research could be to\nintroduce\
    \ multiple UAV operations, and the associated cooperation schemes. The\nfollowing\
    \ aspects need to be addressed when following this research line:\n• Cooperation:\
    \ to maximize the eﬀectiveness, and to reduce mapping times,\nit is advisable\
    \ to have several UAVs that cooperate with each other to achieve\na same task,\
    \ thereby accelerating the whole process, and avoiding battery\nexhaustion before\
    \ completing the monitoring process.\n•\nCollision Avoidance: since the diﬀerent\
    \ UAVs are expected to have some\ndegree of autonomy regarding their mobility\
    \ pattern, a correct coordination\nbetween nearby UAVs is required to avoid collisions\
    \ when ﬂying at a close\nrange.\n• Communications: to achieve the aforementioned\
    \ goals of cooperation and\ncollision avoidance, communications between UAVs,\
    \ and between UAVs and\na central management unit, are required.\nOn the other\
    \ hand, using mobile sensors installed on UAVs introduces new\nissues to the sensing\
    \ process that should also be addressed:\n•\nAltitude: despite currently most\
    \ pollution studies are made at a ground\nlevel, the use of UAVs allows us to\
    \ determine the concentration of pollu-\ntants at diﬀerent heights, thus allowing\
    \ to determine if there are layers of\npollutants that can cause health problems\
    \ in rugged mountain sides.\n•\nInﬂuence of the wind: the sampling procedure includes\
    \ sensors that\nare sensitive to the wind conditions. In addition, wind causes\
    \ the overall\npollution map to be more dynamic.\nIn this context, both issues\
    \ deserve\nmore scrutiny.\n138\nPart V\nAcronyms and References\n139\nAcronyms\n\

    \ for a class of discrete-time nonlinear systems via a wireless neural\ncontrol\
    \ network (WNCN) is presented in this paper. A unified Lurie-type model termed\
    \ delayed standard neural network model\n(DSNNM) is used to describe these nonlinear\
    \ systems. We assume that all neuron nodes in WNCN which have limited energy,\n\
    storage space, and computing ability can be regarded as a subcontroller, then\
    \ the whole WNCN is characterized by a mesh-like\nstructure with partially connected\
    \ neurons distributed over a wide geographical area, which can be considered as\
    \ a fully distributed\nnonlinear output feedback dynamic controller. The unreliable\
    \ wireless communication links within WNCN are modeled by fading\nchannels. Based\
    \ on the Lyapunov functional and the S-procedure, the WNCN is solved and configured\
    \ for the DSNNM to absolutely\nstabilize the whole closed-loop system in the sense\
    \ of mean square with a \U0001D43B∞ disturbance attenuation index using LMI approach.\n\
    A numerical example shows the effectiveness of the proposed design approaches.\n\
    1. Introduction\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs) are one of the effective\n\
    technologies in modeling and controlling complex non-\nlinear systems due to the\
    \ universal nonlinear function\napproximation property of ANNs. Because all biological\n\
    neural networks (BNNs) have the recursive properties and\nmost industrial processes\
    \ are nonlinear dynamic system,\nthe recurrent neural networks (RNNs) which have\
    \ inter-\nnal feedback loops and are suitable for dynamic mapping\nhave attracted\
    \ increasing attention in the control field [1].\nMany researchers have extensively\
    \ investigated RNNs-based\ndesign methods for nonlinear control systems. For example,\n\
    in [2], diagonal recurrent neural networks (DRNNs) are\nconstructed to identify\
    \ and control, respectively, for both\nBIBO and non-BIBO nonlinear plants. Lin\
    \ et al. [3] studied\nan FPGA-based computed force control system based on\nthe\
    \ Elman neural network (ENN) considered as a particular\nclass of RNN to achieve\
    \ the high-accuracy position con-\ntrol of linear ultrasonic motor. A neural controller\
    \ using\nrecurrent learning (RTRL) network updating algorithm for\nnonlinear plants\
    \ with unknown dynamics is presented in [4].\nGuaranteed cost control for exponential\
    \ synchronization of\ncellular neural networks (CNNs) with various activation\n\
    functions and mixed time-varying delays is investigated in\n[5]. As a dynamic\
    \ system, the stability analysis of RNNs and\nstabilization synthesis of RNNs-based\
    \ control systems are a\nprimary consideration. One of the main characteristics\
    \ of\nRNNs is that the nonlinear activation functions in RNNs are\nof the sigmoidal\
    \ type. Since the various sigmoidal functions\nin RNNs belong to a subset of nonlinear\
    \ functions of Lurie-\ntype system [6], during the past two decades, there have\n\
    been a large number of research contributions concerning the\nabsolute stability\
    \ of RNNs such as [7–14]. It is worth noting\nthat a new neural network model\
    \ termed by the standard\nneural network model (SNNM) is proposed in [12]. Most\n\
    nonlinear control systems based on delayed (or nondelayed)\nRNNs can be converted\
    \ into the SNNMs, the absolute\nstability of which can be analyzed using a unified\
    \ approach\nin the sense of Lurie [6, 13, 14]. However, the traditional\nstatic\
    \ and dynamic control methods [12–14] for SNNMs are\ncentralized and do not apply\
    \ to distributed networked control\nsystems.\nBoosted by advances in computing,\

    \ Problems in Engineering\nwhich computational and physical components are closely\n\
    conjoined and coordinated are becoming increasingly ubiq-\nuitous [15, 16]. A\
    \ large number of embedded devices (such\nas sensors, actuators, and controllers)\
    \ distributed over a vast\ngeographical area in CPSs will depend more and more\
    \ on\ncommunications networks to achieve information interac-\ntion and manipulate\
    \ physical entities; therefore, wireless net-\nworked control systems (WNCSs)\
    \ represent a new research\nfrontier of CPSs and have recently received a great\
    \ deal of\nattention [17]. Employing wireless networks for CPSs will\nenhance\
    \ the flexibility and expandability of system (e.g.,\nnetwork nodes are easy to\
    \ move or be deployed in scenes\nwhich have difficulties in wiring) whilst reducing\
    \ installation,\nmaintenance, debugging, and labour costs. However, the\nunreliable\
    \ communication channels, resource constraints,\nand limited bandwidth that characterize\
    \ the wireless tech-\nnology require special care and raise new challenges to\n\
    communication, signal processing, closed-loop control, and\nso forth. Recently,\
    \ many researchers have investigated these\nissues and some significant results\
    \ were obtained and many\nare in progress. Shi and Zhang [18] investigate the\
    \ remote\nstate estimation and optimal schedule for two sensors under\nbandwidth\
    \ constraint. Guo et al. [19] consider the control\nand actuators/sensors scheduling\
    \ problem for linear system\nand then propose a novel stability criterion based\
    \ on the\nmodes of Markov chains and the transmission delays. The\nproblem of\
    \ joint design of an output feedback controller and\nthe medium access scheduling\
    \ policy are investigated for\nnetworked control systems in [20, 21]. The analysis\
    \ and design\nof state feedback controllers for linear systems where there\nare\
    \ limitations on the number of active actuators and trans-\nmission delays are\
    \ studied in [22]. A decentralized event-\ntriggered control method over wireless\
    \ sensor and actuator\nnetwork (WSAN) of centralized controllers is discussed\
    \ in\n[23]. Furthermore, with network scale unceasingly expand-\ning, any of the\
    \ sensing/actuating nodes cannot access/act to\nthe full state of the physical\
    \ plant, so development and design\nof distributed control methods for a large-scale\
    \ WNCSs are\nstill hotspot issues in both engineering and academic fields\n[24].\n\
    At present, the wireless network (WN) is considered\nprimarily as a communication\
    \ medium in most of the\nresearch results [17, 23–26] for WNCSs. It means that\
    \ the\nnodes in WN will only achieve the data communication and\ntransmission\
    \ tasks among sensing/actuating nodes and one\nor more dedicated controllers.\
    \ However, these works have\npotential drawbacks such as that the WNCS is susceptible\n\
    to the failures of those dedicated controllers and the packet\nlosses and delays\
    \ over unreliable wireless communication\nlinks among nodes. Pajic et al. [27]\
    \ propose the basic concept\nof wireless control network (WCN), a new fully distributed\n\
    control method for WNCSs, in which the control function is\nachieved over a multihop\
    \ WN. For WCN, the entire multihop\nnetwork fulfills itself as a distributed controller\
    \ where every\nnode can be regarded as a local (small) linear dynamical\ncontroller\
    \ for linear physical plants [28].\nIn this paper, we focus on the distributed\
    \ networked \U0001D43B∞\ncontrol and absolute stability analysis of delayed standard\n\
    neural network model (DSNNM) based on a wireless neuron\ncontrol network (WNCN)\
    \ introduced in [29], which is an\nimproved nonlinear WCN. In summary, the aim\
    \ for intro-\nducing WNCN stems from the need of a distributed control\napproach\
    \ for WNCSs. There are many practical application\nrequirements that also motivate\
    \ this study. Typical examples\ninclude industrial humidity, ventilation, air\
    \ conditioning\n(HVAC) control systems in [24], the networked process\ncontrol\
    \ for the distillation column in [30], the drip irrigation\ncontrol for agriculture\
    \ using wireless sensor and actuator\nnetwork (WSAN) [31], and so forth.\nCompared\
    \ with normal RNN being the fully connected\namong neurons and having a layered\
    \ architecture as shown\nin Figure 1(a), the WNCN, as a special kind of control-\n\
    oriented RNN, is characterized by a mesh-like structure\nwith partially connected\
    \ neurons distributed over a wide\ngeographical area. Consider a scenario where\
    \ several neu-\nral nodes forming with limited computation and wireless\ncommunication\
    \ capabilities are deployed around an indus-\ntrial plant and can exchange information\
    \ with immediate\nneighbor neuron nodes to form a wireless mesh network,\nsome\
    \ of which can also receive state values of the plant\nfrom neighbor sensors or\
    \ send control signals to neighbor\nactuators, respectively, as shown in Figure\
    \ 1(b). Compared\nwith WCN behaving as a linear dynamical system, WNCN\nis essentially\
    \ a nonlinear wireless mesh RNN system. To\nthe best of our knowledge, the problem\
    \ formulation is\nnovel.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.\
    \ In\nSection 2, we first briefly cover the delayed standard neural\nnetwork model\
    \ (DSNNM) and then describe the nonlinear\ndynamic behaviors of WNCN. Section\
    \ 3 investigates the\nabsolute stability and the \U0001D43B∞ performance of the\
    \ closed-loop\nsystem. The criteria to synthesis of the optimal \U0001D43B∞ controller\n\
    based on WNCN without stochastic packet dropping are\nfirst presented in Section\
    \ 4, and then the result is extended\nto study the robust case based on stochastic\
    \ WNCN with\nfading communication channels in Section 5. In Section 6, a\nnumerical\
    \ example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the derived results. And\

    \ Neural Control Network. The traditional design\napproaches of dynamic controllers\

    \ in Engineering\n13\nFigure 4 shows the simulation results of the state trajec-\n\
    tories of controlled discrete-time DSNNM, where state \U0001D465(\U0001D458)\n\
    is initialized arbitrarily in interval [−0.5, 0.5] at \U0001D458 = 0 and\n\U0001D458\
    \ = 40, respectively, and the disturbance input is nonlinear\nload 1/\U0001D458\
    2. It is easily seen that the WNSN with a distributed\narchitecture solved by\
    \ Algorithm 4 using CVX toolbox can\nensure the absolute stability of the closed-loop\
    \ system in the\nmean-square sense with optimal \U0001D43B∞ performance.\n7. Conclusions\n\
    A novel wireless networked \U0001D43B∞ control approach based\non WNCN has been\
    \ considered for a class of Lurie-type\nnonlinear systems named DSNNM. The WNCN\
    \ which can\nabsolutely stabilize the closed-loop system in mean-square\nwith\
    \ a desired \U0001D43B∞ disturbance rejection level can be obtained\nby solving\
    \ LMIs using a CVX toolbox (release 2.0 (beta)).\nSimulation results have illustrated\
    \ the feasibility of the dis-\ntributed control methods presented in this paper.\n\

    \ Experimentation and Testing\nAbstract\nThe IoT European Large-Scale Pilots Programme\
    \ includes the innovation\nconsortia that are collaborating to foster the deployment\
    \ of IoT solutions\nin Europe through the integration of advanced IoT technologies\
    \ across the\nvalue chain, demonstration of multiple IoT applications at scale\
    \ and in a usage\ncontext, and as close as possible to operational conditions.\n\
    The programme projects are targeted, goal-driven initiatives that propose\nIoT\
    \ approaches to speciﬁc real-life industrial/societal challenges. They are\nautonomous\
    \ entities that involve stakeholders from the supply side to the\ndemand side,\
    \ and contain all the technological and innovation elements,\nthe tasks related\
    \ to the use, application and deployment as well as the\ndevelopment, testing\
    \ and integration activities.\nThis chapter describes the IoT Large Scale Pilot\
    \ Programme initiative\ntogether with all involved actors. These actors include\
    \ the coordination and\nsupport actions CREATE-IoT and U4IoT, being them drivers\
    \ of the pro-\ngramme, and all ﬁve IoT Large-Scale Pilot projects, namely ACTIVAGE,\n\
    IoF2020, MONICA, SynchroniCity and AUTOPILOT.\n8.1 IoT European Large-Scale Pilots\
    \ Programme\nThe scope of the IoT European Large-Scale Pilots Programme is to\
    \ foster the\ndeployment of IoT solutions in Europe through the integration of\
    \ advanced\nIoT technologies across the value chain, demonstration of multiple\
    \ IoT appli-\ncations at scale and in a usage context, and as close as possible\
    \ to operational\nconditions. Speciﬁc pilot considerations include:\n• Mapping\
    \ of pilot architecture approaches with validated IoT reference\narchitectures\
    \ such as IoT-A enabling interoperability across use cases.\n• Contribution to\
    \ strategic activity groups that were deﬁned during the\nLSP kick-off meeting\
    \ to foster coherent implementation of the different\nIoT Large-Scale Pilots.\n\
    • Contribution to clustering their results of horizontal nature (interoper-\n\
    ability approach, standards, security and privacy approaches, business\nvalidation\
    \ and sustainability, methodologies, metrics, etc.).\nThe IoT European Large-Scale\
    \ Pilots Programme includes projects address-\ning the IoT applications based\
    \ on European relevance, technology readiness\nand socio-economic interest in\
    \ Europe. The IoT Large-Scale Pilot projects\noverview is illustrated in Figure\
    \ 8.1, and the areas addressed by the projects\nare listed below.\n8.1 IoT European\
    \ Large-Scale Pilots Programme\n223\nFigure 8.1\nIoT European Large-Scale Pilots\
    \ Programme Projects Overview.\nResearch and innovation effort in speciﬁc IoT\
    \ topics ensure the longer-\nterm evolution of Internet of Things and the IoT\
    \ European Large-Scale Pilots\nProgramme projects are addressing:\n• The integration\
    \ and further research and development, where needed,\nof the most advanced technologies\
    \ across the value chain (components,\ndevices, networks, middleware, service\
    \ platforms, application functions)\nand their operation at large scale to respond\
    \ to real needs of end-users\n(public authorities, citizens and business), based\
    \ on underlying open\ntechnologies and architectures that may be reused across\
    \ multiple use\ncases and enable interoperability across those.\n• The validation\
    \ of user acceptability by addressing, in particular, issues\nof trust, attention,\
    \ security and privacy through pre-deﬁned privacy and\nsecurity impact assessments,\
    \ liability and coverage of user needs in the\nspeciﬁc real-life scenarios of\
    \ the pilot.\n• The validation of the related business models to guarantee the\
    \ sustain-\nability of the approach beyond the project.\nThe IoT Large-Scale Pilots\
    \ make use of the rich portfolio of technologies\nand tools so far developed and\
    \ demonstrated in reduced and controlled\nenvironments and extend them to real-life\
    \ use case scenarios with the goal of\nvalidating advanced IoT solutions across\
    \ complete value chains with actual\nusers and proving its socio-economic potential.\n\
    Support actions provide consistency and linkages between the pilots and\ncomplement\
    \ them by addressing horizontal challenges critically important\nfor the take-up\
    \ of IoT at the anticipated scale. These include ethics and\nprivacy, trust and\
    \ security, respect for the scarcity and vulnerability of human\n224\nIoT European\
    \ Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing\nattention, validation\
    \ and certiﬁcation, standards and interoperability, user\nacceptability and control,\
    \ liability and sustainability.\nThe projects together form the IoT European Large-Scale\
    \ Pilots Pro-\ngramme and a coordination body ensures an efﬁcient interplay of\
    \ the various\nelements of the IoT Focus Area and liaises with relevant initiatives\
    \ at EU,\nMember States and international levels. The coordination is implemented\
    \ by\nthe creation of Activity Groups that are addressing topics of common interest\n\
    across the Large-Scale Pilots.\n8.2 ACTIVAGE – Activating Innovative IoT Smart\
    \ Living\nEnvironments for Ageing Well\nACTIVAGE is a European Multi Centric Large-Scale\
    \ Pilot on Smart Liv-\ning Environments. The main objective is to build the ﬁrst\
    \ European IoT\necosystem across 9 Deployment Sites (DS) in seven European countries\
    \ (see\nFigure 8.2), reusing and scaling up underlying open and proprietary IoT\
    \ plat-\nforms, technologies and standards, and integrating new interfaces needed\
    \ to\nprovide interoperability across these heterogeneous platforms. This ecosys-\n\
    tem will enable the deployment and operation at large scale of Active and\nHealthy\
    \ Ageing IoT based solutions and services, supporting and extending\nthe independent\
    \ living of older adults in their environments, and responding\nto real needs\
    \ of caregivers, service providers and public authorities.\n8.2.1 Introduction\n\
    Throughout Europe and all around the world, mortality rates have fallen\nsigniﬁcantly\
    \ over the past decades [1] leading to considerable changes in the\nage distribution\
    \ of societies [2, 3]. In this context, people aged 60 are now\nexpected to survive\
    \ an additional 18.5 to 21.6 years and soon the world will\nhave a higher number\
    \ of older adults than children. This transformation is\nexpected to continue,\
    \ with the age group of elders (65+) growing from 18%\nto 28% of the EU population\
    \ by the year 2060. Furthermore, according to\nthe 2015 Ageing Report [4], one\
    \ in three Europeans will be over 65 with a\nratio of “working” to “inactive”\
    \ population of 2 to 1, this representing a heavy\nimpact on health and social\
    \ care systems. Indeed, population ageing creates\na common challenge for European\
    \ countries as they must ﬁnd ways to do\nmore with less. Citizen empowerment and\
    \ incitation to self-equip is one of\nthe explored options.\n8.2 ACTIVAGE – Activating\
    \ Innovative IoT Smart Living Environments\n225\nFigure 8.2\nACTIVAGE Deployment\
    \ Sites in 7 EU countries.\nAll of the aforementioned ﬁndings, highlighted the\
    \ Active ageing and\nindependent living activities (such as the EIP Action Group\
    \ C2 – action plan)\nas the ﬁnal goals for EU initiatives related to older adults\
    \ [5].\nThus, legislation, technology, and reimbursement charges, enforce the\n\
    health and social care systems to improve the way they are providing ser-\nvices\
    \ to the European citizens. The “Active and Healthy Ageing” (AHA)\ncommunity is\
    \ wide and heterogeneous in terms of needs, demands and\nliving environments [6].\
    \ AHA services based on the Internet-of-Things are\npromising to be a strategic\
    \ component to support the creation of ecosystem\nable to dynamically answer and\
    \ prevent the challenges faced by the health\nand social care systems [7] (H&SCS):\
    \ the “always-connected” paradigm is\nbecoming a way of life, and this could result\
    \ in a positive transformation for\nH&SCS who are looking for new ways to reorient\
    \ the provision of care and\nkeep older people active and independent for longer.\n\
    226\nIoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing\n\
    8.2.2 Project Description\n8.2.2.1 Main concepts in ACTIVAGE\nACTIVAGE is designed\
    \ as ONE multi-centric Large-Scale Pilot across\nEurope. ACTIVAGE brings UNITY\
    \ of objectives, evaluation methodologies,\nco-operation to achieve critical mass,\
    \ and a single European platform to\ncreate and share evidence. Deployment Sites\
    \ (DS) join clusters of stake-\nholders in the Active and Healthy Living value\
    \ network, working together\nwithin a geographical space (a city or a region).\
    \ These clusters or AHA-\nBusiness Ecosystems are mainly composed by a cohort\
    \ of users (older\nadults, formal and informal caregivers), service providers;\
    \ health care/social\ncare administration; technological infrastructures and technology\
    \ providers\n(infrastructure, sensors, applications, etc.).\nDSs will deploy Reference\
    \ Use Cases (UC) (see Figure 8.3) that address\nspeciﬁc end-user needs, to improve\
    \ their quality of life and autonomy. A\nsingle common interoperable ACTIVAGE\
    \ IoT Ecosystem Suite (AIOTES)\nwill be built up that provides every DS with the\
    \ capacity to develop stan-\ndard and interoperable IoT ecosystems on top of legacy\
    \ IoT platforms, or\ncommunication and data management infrastructures. GLOCAL\
    \ Evaluation\nFramework (Local KPIs and global KPIs) will be designed and implemented\n\
    to demonstrate and evaluate health & social outcomes and socio-economic\nFigure\
    \ 8.3\nACTIVAGE uses cases distribution.\n8.2 ACTIVAGE – Activating Innovative\
    \ IoT Smart Living Environments\n227\nimpact from local up to a European scale,\
    \ enabling effective exchange of\nexperiences and cooperation among peers (e.g.\
    \ users, providers, policy mak-\ners). 9 DS rolled out in 7 countries to constitute\
    \ a major breakthrough to\nsustain open innovation in AHA ﬁeld.\n8.2.2.2 Targeted\
    \ users and user needs\nWithin ACTIVAGE, “Ageing Well with IoT” is considered\
    \ as the goal\nto extend healthy living years of older adults living independently\
    \ and\nautonomously in their preferred environments by the massive adoption of\
    \ IoT\nsolutions. One of the most accepted measurement scales in different studies\n\
    in Europe and World Wide is the Clinical Frailty Scale [8]: ACTIVAGE will\nconcentrate\
    \ on IoT solutions for older people classiﬁed under categories 1\nto 5: “Very\
    \ ﬁt”, “Well, Managing well”, “Vulnerable” and “Mildly frail”.\nACTIVAGE will\
    \ focus on deploying IoT solutions that work towards keeping\nolder people away\
    \ from category 6 and beyond, which already represents\na signiﬁcant cost in care\
    \ for informal carers and for the formal healthcare\nsystems.\nACTIVAGE focusses\
    \ on “domains of needs” for the support of the older\npopulation and in order\
    \ to create a demand-driven experience on the basis of\nFigure 8.4\nMapping of\
    \ needs and use cases.\n228\nIoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation\
    \ and Testing\nthe reference Ageing Well initiatives around the world. Figure\
    \ 8.4 shows the\ndomains of needs (on circles) and the Use Cases (UC) that will\
    \ be deployed\nin the 9 DS involving up to 7,000 users.\n8.2.3 The ACTIVAGE Model\
    \ of IoT Ecosystem for Active\nand Healthy Ageing\nACTIVAGE is committed to build\
    \ the ﬁrst European AHA-IoT Ecosystem\nwhich is modelled as a technological infrastructure\
    \ of hardware-software-\nservices and standard protocols i.e. the “ACTIVAGE AIOTES”,\
    \ and a con-\nstellation of stakeholders interacting with each other within a\
    \ governance\nframework towards the achievement of common goals.\nFigure 8.5 shows\
    \ this conceptual scheme. Data is the core asset of the\necosystem. Private Data\
    \ is produced by wearable and medical devices and\nsmart sensors and devices in\
    \ their living environments (e.g. home, car, public\nspaces, etc.). Public data\
    \ might come from different sources, not necessary\nlinked to user interactions\
    \ (e.g. weather, public services time tables, etc.).\nPersonal/private data might\
    \ be processed at the edge and at cloud level. If\nappropiate, interoperability\
    \ interfaces are provided, enabling the delivery of\na huge amount of data to\
    \ be channeled across the pipeline and eventually\nfeed hundreds or thousands\
    \ of services for senior people, providers and\npayors.\nThe realization of this\
    \ model is accomplished in ACIVAGE by the\nAIOTES: this is comprised of two layers\
    \ that form all the necessary\nFigure 8.5\nModel of AHA-IoT ecosystem.\n8.2 ACTIVAGE\
    \ – Activating Innovative IoT Smart Living Environments\n229\ncomponents for:\
    \ a) the support of a universal interoperability framework for\nthe integration\
    \ of the widest possible spectrum of platforms in the area of\nActive and Health\
    \ Living and b) the formation of the diverse application\nmarketplace and a set\
    \ of application tools for the support of creators in\nthe development and deployment\
    \ phases of new applications. Figure 8.6\nsummarizes the envisioned architecture.\
    \ The ﬁnal architecture will be in\ncompliance with standardisation projects such\
    \ as IoT-A. The ACTIVAGE\nsystem will be separated into two distinct layers.\n\
    The IoT Interoperability Layer is aiming to efﬁciently and effectively\nintegrate\
    \ a wide spectrum of open and commercial platforms and IoT devices,\nhaving as\
    \ a starting point the platforms provided for the ACTIVAGE and the\nIoT devices\
    \ used in the Deployment Sites as shown in Figure 8.6. This layer\nwill be further\
    \ separated into two frameworks that will create standardized\ninterfaces for\
    \ a) the sharing of data with sensors and devices and b) the\ninteroperability\
    \ of their offered services. The Services Layer will include\na number of functionalities\
    \ to support efﬁcient integration and effective\ndeployment of new services to\
    \ the envisioned ecosystem: the Applications\nSupport Tools and the Marketplace.\n\
    8.2.4 Expected Project Impacts\nThe ACTIVAGE project has established a set of\
    \ strategic impacts aligned\nwith the vision of the project and designed to drive\
    \ the activities across the\nproject:\n• Societal impact: ACTIVAGE may create\
    \ evidence that support how\nAHA services based on IoT improve the quality of\
    \ life of older adults,\nsupporting the long-term sustainability and efﬁciency\
    \ of health and\nsocial care systems. Aligned with this impact, ACTIVAGE may give\n\
    answer to users’ empowerment with the control of their data, safety\nand wellness,\
    \ promoting healthy and active ageing, while enhancing\nthe competitiveness of\
    \ EU industry through new business models and\nexpansion in new markets.\n• Innovation\
    \ impact: ACTIVAGE may ignite the economic growth by\ninﬂuencing the strategic\
    \ decisions of the different stakeholders, offering\na value based proposal built\
    \ by the co-creation of the different stake-\nholders’ views and interest. Only\
    \ a valuable proposal with an integral\nmulti-stakeholders commitment will assure\
    \ the following key aspects:\na) public and private investment by health and social\
    \ care makers,\n230\nIoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation\
    \ and Testing\nFigure 8.6\nConceptual architecture of AIOTES.\n8.3 IoF2020 – Internet\
    \ of Food and Farm 2020\n231\nb) service providers adoption of cost-effective\
    \ business models, c) senior\ncitizens involvement in the creation and adoption\
    \ of AHA services,\nd) to foster industrial innovation on IoT, wearables and sensor\
    \ tech-\nnologies and support standards for interoperability, and e) creation\
    \ of\nnew reliable and useful AHA solutions and services by SMEs and\nentrepreneurs.\n\
    • Economic impact: ACTIVAGE project may analyse the potential sav-\ning and contributions\
    \ to the sustainability of the health care and social\nsystems, and the readiness\
    \ and maturity of the IoT technologies and\necosystem to host local solutions\
    \ and to import and replicate solutions\nfrom other providers/location focused\
    \ on value-based criteria.\n8.2.5 Summary\nDuring its 42 months duration the project\
    \ will be aligned along a single\nﬁve phase innovation path. After evaluating\
    \ and demonstrating evidence\nand value to stakeholders in local Use Cases (UC),\
    \ DSs will cooperate bi-\nlaterally or tri-laterally, allowing coherent, complementary\
    \ replication of UC,\nto generate evidence on the value of interoperability and\
    \ standardisation at a\nEuropean scale. In the last phase, DSs will open to European\
    \ external actors\nto incubate new UCs, technologies, solutions and Business Cases.\
    \ Open calls\nwill attract entrepreneurs and start-ups to implement innovative\
    \ solutions\nusing the mature DS’s IoT ecosystem for testing, demonstration and\
    \ initial\nmarket take-up.\n8.3 IoF2020 – Internet of Food and Farm 2020\nThe\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to be a real game changer that will\ndrastically\
    \ improve productivity and sustainability in food and farming. How-\never, current\
    \ IoT applications in this domain are still fragmentary and mainly\nused by a\
    \ small group of early adopters. The Internet of Food and Farm 2020\nLarge-Scale\
    \ Pilot (IoF2020) addresses the organizational and technological\nchallenges to\
    \ overcome this situation by fostering a large-scale uptake of\nIoT in the European\
    \ food and farming domain. The heart of the project is\nformed by a balanced set\
    \ of multi-actor trials that reﬂect the diversity of\nthe food and farming domain.\
    \ Each trial is composed of well-delineated\nuse cases developing IoT solutions\
    \ for the most relevant challenges of the\nconcerned subsector. The project conducts\
    \ 5 trials with a total of 19 use cases\nin arable, dairy, fruits, vegetables\
    \ and meat production. IoF2020 embraces a\n232\nIoT European Large-Scale Pilots\
    \ – Integration, Experimentation and Testing\nlean multi-actor approach that combines\
    \ the development of Minimal Viable\nProducts (MVPs) in short iterations with\
    \ the active involvement of various\nstakeholders. The architectural approach\
    \ supports interoperability of multiple\nuse case systems and reuse of IoT components\
    \ across them. Use cases are\nalso supported in developing business and solving\
    \ governance issues. The\nIoF2020 ecosystem and collaboration space is established\
    \ to boost the uptake\nof IoT in Food and Farming and pave the way for new innovations.\n\
    8.3.1 Introduction\nIoT is a powerful driver that is expected to transform the\
    \ entire farming and\nfood domain into smart webs of connected objects that are\
    \ context-sensitive\nand can be identiﬁed, sensed and controlled remotely [9–11].\
    \ IoT will be a\nreal game changer in agriculture that drastically improves productivity\
    \ and\nsustainability. This vision is illustrated by the story in Figure 8.7,\
    \ which is an\nMarch 2020, a field somewhere in Europe \nThe morning mist soaks\
    \ into thick shreds across the country, above the sun rises and turns the horizon\
    \ red. From \nthe fog a soft humming sound, two tractors emerge. When he spots\
    \ me, the driver of the second tractor steps out, \nbut where is the driver of\
    \ the first tractor? There is none, says the farmer, I operate both machines.\
    \ How? Well, that \nstrange vehicle you saw here last week has mapped the whole\
    \ field and this map is now instructing the board \ncomputers of the two tractors\
    \ how to drive. The first tractor exactly follows pre-programmed lines and carries\
    \ out \nsoil cultivation, based on soil composition. My tractor with a sowing\
    \ machine automatically follows the same lines \nand automatically adjusts distance,\
    \ quantity and variety of potato seed. Incredible, isn’t it? \nTwo weeks later…\
    \ \nThe same field. An unmanned small tractor drives with a high speed along the\
    \ same invisible straight lines. With \nsurgical precision, a hoe eliminates every\
    \ weed in the field, the farmer says. This saves a lot of chemicals and \nlabour\
    \ in comparison to earlier days where we had to spray the full field with a heavy\
    \ tractor. So this is good for \nthe environment and I have much less costs! Within\
    \ a few weeks the fertilizer will follow the same lines again and \nby a pre-defined\
    \ task map it knows exactly where and what to put different types of fertilizer\
    \ for optimal growth of \nthe plants. That map was generated on the basis of big\
    \ data analysis and calculations in the cloud involving \nrelevant data from the\
    \ market, weather and public regulations. Additional cameras are checking the\
    \ crop and, if \nnecessary, make corrections. Again, the plants just get enough\
    \ nutrients to grow optimally and nothing is spoiled to \nthe environment. Wow,\
    \ amazing! Come, I’ll show you how it works in the office. Don’t you have to stay\
    \ with your \ntractor? Oh no, it knows what it is doing. \nAt the office with\
    \ a good old-fashioned cup of coffee… \nOf course we farmers are still in charge\
    \ of our own farm but most of the field operations are carried out \nautomatically\
    \ by autonomous objects. Now we can focus on the market choices and take care\
    \ of communication \nwith our customers and last but not least citizens who are\
    \ very much involved in farming nowadays. After \nexecution of the field work,\
    \ the measured data is automatically returned from the machine to the office through\
    \ the \ncloud. This is the basis for subsequent tasks. But I also provide it to\
    \ research institutes, which feed these data into \ncomputer models for further\
    \ improvement. The same holds for public legislation and certification bodies.\
    \ They use \nthe same data to check for compliance to their rules. Every organisation\
    \ has access to a specific set of our data in \nthe cloud. Of course, this is\
    \ subject to strict security and privacy rules. No, no, I don’t want leave my\
    \ data lying \naround. Oh yes, by the way, food safety and traceability is not\
    \ an issue anymore; it is highly guaranteed by all kind \nof sensors and in case\
    \ something might go wrong early warning systems alert me in time. \nFigure 8.7\n\
    Illustrative story of the vision on IoT in agriculture.\n8.3 IoF2020 – Internet\
    \ of Food and Farm 2020\n233\nexample for arable farming, but it is exemplary\
    \ for other subsectors such as\ndairy, meat, vegetables, and fruits including\
    \ wine and olives.\nTo make this vision come true much technology is already available,\n\
    although there are speciﬁc IoT challenges in this sector. Agri-Food ‘things’\n\
    are often living objects and attached devices have to work in harsh envi-\nronments,\
    \ while network connectivity in rural areas can be challenging. In\nfact, a large-scale\
    \ uptake of IoT in agriculture is in particular prevented by\na lack of interoperability,\
    \ user concerns about data ownership, privacy and\nsecurity, and by appropriate\
    \ business models that are also suitable for (very)\nsmall companies [12, 13].\
    \ Consequently, current IoT applications in farming\nand food are still fragmentary\
    \ and mainly used by a small group of early\nadopters, despite the great world-wide\
    \ interest of IoT technology providers\nand investors.\nIoF2020 is a European\
    \ Large-Scale Pilot (LSP) on IoT for Smart Farming\nand Food Security. Its main\
    \ objective is to foster a large-scale uptake of IoT\nin the European farming\
    \ and food domain. This will contribute to a next huge\ninnovation boost and consequently\
    \ to a drastically improved productivity and\nsustainability in the agri-food\
    \ domain. More speciﬁcally, IoF2020 aims to:\n• Demonstrate the business case\
    \ of IoT for a large number of application\nareas in farming and food;\n• Integrate\
    \ and reuse available IoT technologies by exploiting open\narchitectures and standards;\n\
    • Ensure user acceptability of IoT solutions in farming and food by\naddressing\
    \ user needs, including security, privacy and trust;\n• Ensure the sustainability\
    \ of IoT solutions beyond the project by vali-\ndating the related business models\
    \ and setting up an IoT Ecosystem for\nlarge scale uptake.\nThe IoF2020 consortium\
    \ consists of 71 public and private partners from 16\ndifferent countries and\
    \ has a total budget of 35 Me. The project started in\nJanuary 2017 and will last\
    \ for 4 years.\n8.3.2 Trials and Use cases\nThe heart of the project is formed\
    \ by a balanced set of multi-actor trials\nthat reﬂect the diversity of the food\
    \ and farming domain, including different\nagricultural sub sectors, conventional\
    \ and organic farming, early adopters and\nearly majority farmers, SMEs and large\
    \ industrial companies, and different\n234\nIoT European Large-Scale Pilots –\
    \ Integration, Experimentation and Testing\nsupply chain roles including logistics\
    \ and consumption. Each trial is com-\nposed of well-delineated use cases that\
    \ together address the most relevant\nchallenges for the concerned subsector.\
    \ The use cases follow a demand-driven\nphilosophy in which IoT solutions for\
    \ speciﬁc business needs are developed\nby a dedicated team of agri-food end users\
    \ and IoT companies (integra-\ntors, app/service developers, infrastructure/technology\
    \ providers) with a clear\ncommercial drive, supported by R&D organisations. IoF2020\
    \ conducts 5\ntrials with a total of 19 use cases in arable, dairy, fruits, vegetables\
    \ and meat\nproduction (Figure 8.8).\nThe Internet of Arable Farming (trial 1)\
    \ integrates operations\nacross the entire arable cropping cycle combining IoT\
    \ technolo-\ngies, data acquisition (soil, crop, climate) in growing and storage\n\
    of arable crops (potatoes, wheat and soya beans). These will be\nlinked to existing\
    \ sensor networks, earth observation systems, crop\ngrowth models and yield gap\
    \ analysis tools and external databases (e.g. eco-\nnomic/environmental impact)\
    \ and translated into farm management systems.\nThe trial will result in increasing\
    \ yields, less environmental impact, easier\ncross-compliance and product traceability\
    \ and more use of technology by\nfarmers. The trial consists of 4 use cases:\n\
    1.1 Within-ﬁeld management zoning: deﬁning speciﬁc ﬁeld management\nzones by developing\
    \ and linking sensing- and actuating devices with\nexternal data;\nFigure 8.8\n\
    Geographical coverage of the IoF2020 trials and use cases.\n8.3 IoF2020 – Internet\
    \ of Food and Farm 2020\n235\n1.2 Precision Crop Management: smart wheat crop\
    \ management by sensors\ndata embedded in a low-power, long-range network infrastructure;\n\
    1.3 Soya Protein Management: improving protein production by combining\nsensor\
    \ data and translate them into effective machine task operations;\n1.4 Farm Machine\
    \ Interoperability: data exchange between ﬁeld machinery\nand farm management\
    \ information systems for supporting cross-over\npilot machine communication.\n\
    The Internet of Dairy Farming (trial 2) implements, experi-\nences and demonstrates\
    \ the use of real-time sensor data (e.g. neck\ncollar) together with GPS location\
    \ data to create value in the chain\nfrom ‘grass to glass’, resulting in more\
    \ efﬁcient use of resources\nand production of quality foods, combined with a\
    \ better animal\nhealth, welfare and environment implementation. The trial focuses\
    \ on feeding\nand reproduction of cows through early warning systems and quality\
    \ data that\ncan be used for remote calibration and validation of sensors and\
    \ consists of 4\nuse cases:\n2.1 Grazing Cow Monitor: monitoring and managing\
    \ the outdoor graz-\ning of cows by GPS tracking within ultra-narrow band communication\n\
    networks;\n2.2 Happy Cow: improving dairy farm productivity through 3D cow activity\n\
    sensing and cloud machine learning technologies;\n2.3 Silent Herdsman: herd alert\
    \ management by a high node count distributed\nsensor network and a cloud-based\
    \ platform for decision-making;\n2.4 Remote Milk Quality: remote quality assurance\
    \ of accurate instruments\nand analysis & pro-active control in the dairy chain.\n\
    The Internet of Fruits (trial 3) demonstrates IoT technology\nthat is integrated\
    \ throughout the whole supply chain from the\nﬁeld, logistics, processing to the\
    \ retailer. Sensors in orchards and\nvineyards (incl. weather stations, multispectral/thermal\
    \ cameras)\nwill be connected through the cloud and used for monitoring,\nearly\
    \ warning of pests and diseases and control (e.g. variable rate spraying,\nselective\
    \ harvesting). Traceability devices (incl. RFID, multidimensional bar-\ncodes)\
    \ and smart packaging allows for condition monitoring during storage,\nprocessing,\
    \ transportation and on the shelves. Big data analyses will further\noptimize\
    \ all processes in the whole chain. This will result in reduced pre-\nand post-harvest\
    \ losses, less inputs, higher (fresh) quality and better traceable\nproducts (incl.\
    \ protected designation of origin, PDO). The trial consists of 4\ncoherent use\
    \ cases:\n236\nIoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation\
    \ and Testing\n3.1 Fresh table grapes chain: real-time monitoring and control\
    \ of water\nsupply and crop protection of table grapes and predicting shelf life;\n\
    3.2 Big wine optimization: optimizing cultivation and processing of wine by\n\
    sensor-actuator networks and big data analysis within a cloud framework;\n3.3\
    \ Automated olive chain: automated ﬁeld control, product segmentation,\nprocessing\
    \ and commercialisation of olives and olive oil;\n3.4 Intelligent fruit logistics:\
    \ fresh fruit logistics through virtualization of\nfruit products by intelligent\
    \ trays within a low-power long-range network\ninfrastructure.\nThe Internet of\
    \ Vegetables (trial 4) focuses on a combination of\nenvironmental control levels:\
    \ full-controlled indoor growing with\nan artiﬁcial lighting system, semi-controlled\
    \ greenhouse produc-\ntion and non-regulated ambient conditions in open-air cultivation\n\
    of vegetables. It demonstrates the automatic execution of growth\nrecipes by the\
    \ intelligent combination of sensors that measure crop conditions\nand control\
    \ processes (incl. lighting, climate, irrigation and logistics) and\nanalysis\
    \ of big data that is collected through these sensors and advanced\nvisioning\
    \ systems with location speciﬁcation. This will result in improved\nproduction\
    \ control and better communication throughout the supply chain\n(incl. harvest\
    \ prediction, consumer information). The trial consists of 4 use\ncases:\n4.1\
    \ City farming: value chain innovation for leafy vegetables in convenience\nfoods\
    \ by integrated indoor climate control and logistics;\n4.2 Chain-integrated greenhouse\
    \ production: integrating the value chain and\nquality innovation by developing\
    \ a full sensor-actuator-based system in\ntomato greenhouses;\n4.3 Added value\
    \ weeding data: boosting the value chain by harvesting\nweeding data of organic\
    \ vegetables obtained by advanced visioning\nsystems;\n4.4 Enhanced quality certiﬁcation\
    \ system: enhanced trust and simpliﬁca-\ntion of quality certiﬁcation systems\
    \ by use of sensors, RFID tags and\nintelligent chain analyses.\nThe Internet\
    \ of Meat (trial 5) demonstrates how the growth of\nanimals (individual and group\
    \ level) can be optimized and commu-\nnication throughout the whole supply chain\
    \ can be improved based\non automated monitoring and control of advanced sensor-actuator\n\
    systems. The data generated by events will also be used for early\nwarning (e.g.\
    \ on health status) and improve the transparency and traceability\n8.3 IoF2020\
    \ – Internet of Food and Farm 2020\n237\nof meat throughout the whole supply chain.\
    \ This will assure meat quality,\nreduce mortality, optimize labour and improve\
    \ animal health and welfare\nleading to reduction of antibiotics. The trial consists\
    \ of 3 use cases:\n5.1 Pig farm management: optimise pig production management\
    \ by interop-\nerable on-farm sensors and slaughter house data;\n5.2 Poultry chain\
    \ management: optimize production, transport and process-\ning of poultry meat\
    \ by automated ambient monitoring & control and data\nanalyses;\n5.3 Meat Transparency\
    \ and Traceability: enhancing transparency and trace-\nability of meat based on\
    \ an monitored chain event data in an EPCIS-\ninfrastructure.\n8.3.3 Technical\
    \ Architectural Approach\nEach use case will be an autonomous implementation of\
    \ an IoT system, which\nprovides a dedicated solution for a speciﬁc domain challenge.\
    \ However, for\na large scale uptake it is important to maximize synergies across\
    \ multiple\nuse case systems. Therefore, a core concept of IoF2020 is that the\
    \ use\ncase systems function as nodes in a software ecosystem [14]. As a conse-\n\
    quence, much attention is paid to ensuring the interoperability of multiple\n\
    use case systems and the reuse of IoT components across them. Figure 8.9\nshows\
    \ the architectural approach to achieve this during design, development,\nimplementation\

    \ Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing\nThe use case architectures\
    \ will be based on a common technical reference\narchitecture to create a shared\
    \ understanding and to maximize synergies\nacross multiple use case systems. Each\
    \ use case within a trial will design\na speciﬁc instance of the reference architecture\
    \ to address its speciﬁc user\nrequirements. The project will provide a catalogue\
    \ of reusable system com-\nponents, which can be integrated in the IoT systems\
    \ of multiple use cases\nto facilitate large-scale uptake. This repository goes\
    \ beyond a checklist and\nincludes practical guidelines and implementation tools.\
    \ The IoF2020 lab\nwill support the implementation of reusable IoT components\
    \ in a testbed\nenvironment. Finally, IoF2020 will provide a Collaboration Space\
    \ in which\nservices and data can be shared as a key enabler to facilitate the\
    \ interaction\nbetween the IoT systems of the use cases during deployment. As\
    \ indicated,\nthe project will reuse components and knowledge from previous projects\
    \ and\nexisting organizations and try to embed and sustain the project results\
    \ into the\nsame organizations.\n8.3.4 Lean Multi-Actor Approach\nIoF2020 embraces\
    \ a demand-driven methodology in which end-users from\nthe agri-food are actively\
    \ involved during the entire development process\naiming at cross-fertilisation,\
    \ co-creation and co-ownership of results (see\nFigure 8.10).\nThe approach for\
    \ the use cases is a combination of the lean start-up\nmethodology that focuses\
    \ on the development of Minimal Viable Products\nFigure 8.10\nIoF2020 Project\
    \ approach and structure.\n8.4 MONICA – Management of Networked IoT Wearables\
    \ – Very Large Scale\n239\n(MVPs) in short iterations and the multi-actor approach\
    \ that stresses the\nactive involvement of various stakeholders. The use cases\
    \ will actively be\nsupported by three other work packages (WPs). WP3 facilitates\
    \ sharing,\nreuse and ﬁnally integration of IoT components as described in the\
    \ previous\nsection. WP4 provides business support in terms of monitoring KPIs,\
    \ business\nmodels, market studies and governance aspects (incl. security, data\
    \ owner-\nship, privacy, liability and ethical issues). WP5 facilitates the development\n\
    and expansion of the various ecosystems on use case and project level\nand beyond\
    \ amongst others by communication, dissemination, organizing\nworkshops and events\
    \ and by active involvement of European and national\ncommunities from the demand-\
    \ and supply-side of IoT, including industry\nassociations and cooperatives, European\
    \ Innovation Partnerships, Technol-\nogy Platforms and ERAnets. A mid-term open\
    \ call of 6 Me will be used\nto further accelerate these developments. This approach\
    \ establishes a large\nIoF2020 ecosystem and collaboration space that is expected\
    \ to sustain after\nthe project.\n8.3.5 Conclusion and Outlook\nIoF2020 aims to\
    \ boost the uptake of IoT in European Food and Farming.\nThis will be realized\
    \ through a balanced set of multi-actor trials and use\ncases in several subsectors.\
    \ The use cases are developed in a scalable manner\nthrough an open technical\
    \ architecture and infrastructure with components\nthat can be shared and reused\
    \ by stakeholders outside the project. This devel-\nopment is leveraged by activities\
    \ that build-up and extend the total ecosystem,\ndeﬁning attractive and successful\
    \ business models and solving governance\nissues. In this way IoF2020 will pave\
    \ the way for data-driven farming,\nautonomous operations, virtual food chains\
    \ and personalized nutrition for\nEuropean citizens.\n8.4 MONICA – Management\

    Applications\nThe Large-Scale Pilot MONICA demonstrates how cities can use the\
    \ Internet\nof Things to deal with sound, noise and security challenges at big,\
    \ cultural,\nopen-air events. A range of applications will be demonstrated in\
    \ six major\nEuropean cities involving more than 100,000 users in total. The project\
    \ brings\ntogether 29 partners from 9 European countries with the objectives to\
    \ provide\n240\nIoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation\

    \ intelligent cameras deployed at city festivals\nwhich, while preserving privacy,\
    \ estimate crowd size and density in real time,\nnotifying security staff of any\
    \ unusual crowd behaviour. Or imagine smart\nwristbands and mobile apps, allowing\
    \ people to interact with each other and\nthe performers, informing people of\
    \ the best way out of the venue or guiding\nthem to the nearest exit in case of\
    \ an emergency.\nThese are some of the several applications which MONICA will\
    \ demon-\nstrate at minimum 16 cultural events, taking place all over Europe in\n\
    Copenhagen, Bonn, Hamburg, Leeds, Lyon and Torino. The broad list of\nevents includes\
    \ concerts, festivals, city and sport events and involve the\nuse of multiple,\
    \ wearable, mobile and ﬁxed devices with sensors, such as\n1Photo courtesy of\

    \ smart glasses, video cameras, loudspeakers, drones and mobile\nphones. The full\
    \ list of pilot events is shown in Table 8.1.\n8.4.1 Introduction\nThe deployment\
    \ of Internet of Things has also a major impact on society\nspeciﬁcally in urban\
    \ environments, where it helps to solve major societal\nchallenges. The rapidly\
    \ growing number of Smart City platforms enables\ncities to assemble all their\
    \ digital applications on uniform communication\nnetworks spanning entire cities\
    \ delivering diverse applications such as health,\nenergy and resource efﬁciency,\
    \ and trafﬁc management that help the city to\nbecome more environmentally sustainable\
    \ and citizens to have a better life.\nIn technology areas, standard IoT middleware,\
    \ architecture and technology\nenablers have mitigated the complexity of communication\
    \ and integration and\npaved the way for a wealth of innovative distributed applications\
    \ in many vital\nareas of our society. However, most of the IoT and Smart City\
    \ platforms are\nstill insufﬁciently developed to handle really large scale deployment.\
    \ Health\nand smart living may potentially involve thousands of users, but they\
    \ are\nrelatively scarcely distributed, even within a city, and the communication\
    \ load\nis limited.\nIn response, the MONICA platform will demonstrate a resilient\
    \ IoT\nplatform that addresses major issues of large scale deployments: Scaling,\n\
    costs of sensors, and intelligence. On this background, the MONICA project\n242\n\
    IoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing\nis\
    \ uniquely innovative since it will demonstrate an extremely large uptake\nof\
    \ a multitude of IoT applications (10,000+ simultaneous and more than\n100,000\
    \ different users) using low-costs wearables and apps running on\nexisting wearable\
    \ platforms such as smart watches and smart phones in\ncombination with wearable\
    \ sensors. Moreover, the platform will demonstrate\nheterogeneous interfaces for\
    \ both expensive, professional infrastructure com-\nponents and affordable, wearable,\
    \ and widely used consumer devices. Finally,\nthe demonstration will show closed\
    \ feedback loops to actuating networks\nand human interaction and intervention\
    \ based on situational awareness and\ndecision support.\n8.4.2 The MONICA Ecosystems\n\
    The MONICA IoT Platform will be demonstrated in the scope of three\necosystems:\n\
    8.4.2.1 The Security Ecosystem\nThe MONICA Security Ecosystem will demonstrate\
    \ how a multitude of\ninnovative applications for managing public security and\
    \ safety can be seam-\nlessly integrated with IoT sensors and actuators and used\
    \ in large scale. The\ncore security and safety challenges at large events, such\
    \ as those proposed\nin MONICA, are the handling and mitigation of unforeseen\
    \ incidents and\naccidents: personal violence, panic scenes, severe illness of\
    \ individuals in\nthe middle of a crowd, infrastructure catastrophes such as ﬁre\
    \ or structural\ncollapses. The aim of any security platform is to ensure the\
    \ monitoring,\nrecording, identiﬁcation, analysis of any part of the monitored\
    \ environment,\nand measures capable of predicting and, whenever possible, mitigate\
    \ the\ndanger of potential or imminent events. The modelling of incidents and\n\
    accidents is therefore necessary in order to be able to deal with episodes\nwhile\
    \ or before they unfold. The Security Ecosystem will consist of a series\nof large\
    \ and small applications that, in combination, can be used to monitor\nand manage\
    \ the security situation before, during and after an event. The\nmain objectives\
    \ of the applications are to demonstrate how the IoT platform\nwill seamlessly\
    \ support open and closed loop solutions that address real-\nlife safety challenges.\
    \ The traditional security tools used at an event are\nnormally a variety of perimeter\
    \ security as e.g. fences, supported by CCTV\ncameras, few entrances with guards\
    \ and guards working around the area.\nMONICA will implement additional security\
    \ and safety measures, e.g. by\n8.4 MONICA – Management of Networked IoT Wearables\
    \ – Very Large Scale\n243\ncombining information on the ﬂy for real-time operation\
    \ and to support\nthe work of security staff. MONICA hence will not change the\
    \ already\nexisting security concepts of events, rather it will complement extra\
    \ valuable\nreal-time information supporting the early detection of potentially\
    \ critical\nsituations.\n8.4.2.2 The Acoustics Ecosystem\nThe MONICA Acoustic\
    \ Ecosystem will demonstrate how a multitude of\ninnovative applications for managing\
    \ open air music performances in the\npublic space can be seamlessly integrated\
    \ with sensors and actuators using the\nMONICA platform. It will consist of a\
    \ series of large and small applications\nthat, in combination, can be used to\
    \ monitor and manage the sound before,\nduring and after a performance. The main\
    \ objectives of the applications are to\ndemonstrate how the IoT platform will\
    \ seamlessly support open and closed\nloop solutions that address real-life environmental\
    \ challenges e.g. noise in\npublic spaces. E.g. at inner city open air concerts,\
    \ sound ﬁelds will be\noptimised with respect for both the performers and the\
    \ concert audience in\nterms of loudness, directionality and quality. The sound\
    \ zone system and\nactuation layer of the MONICA platform allows for dynamic adjustment\
    \ of\nthe active sound ﬁeld control loudspeakers, thus, improving the sound quality\n\
    of visitors while at the same time reducing the noise for neighbours. Health\n\
    monitoring of sound level exposure can be offered to concerned concertgoers.\n\
    A cheap, wearable sound level meter in bracelets can be connected to a\nSmartphone\
    \ app and continuously measure the cumulative sound dose. The\nuser can thus seek\
    \ less loud sections of the concert arena.\n8.4.2.3 The Innovation Ecosystem\n\
    Communication to customers, crowds and citizens is improved by the use\nof mobile\
    \ apps and IoT wristbands with value-adding features, enabling\npeople to interact\
    \ with and locate each other, informing visitors of the best\nplace to park, the\
    \ best way out or the bars with the shortest queue, and\nguiding participants\
    \ to the nearest exit in case of an emergency. General\ndata such as on sound\
    \ levels are made accessible as open data on the\nhosting city’s websites for\
    \ citizen engagement and innovation. Applications\nfor user involvement with artists\
    \ at concerts or among citizens based on\ndifferent kinds of wearables will be\
    \ tested. Open APIs will be provided to\nfoster new businesses and start-up solutions\
    \ based on the MONICA IoT\nPlatform.\n244\nIoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration,\
    \ Experimentation and Testing\n8.4.3 User-Driven Pilots\nThe MONICA platform and\
    \ its components will be demonstrated in six\ndifferent pilot cities in different\
    \ ﬁve Member States across Europe and as\nclose as possible to real-life operational\
    \ conditions under typical load and\nconstraints associated with organising big\
    \ events. From the pilots, the project\nwill evaluate both qualitative and quantitative\
    \ success measures towards\nestablished KPI’s related to stakeholder satisfaction\
    \ and the improved efﬁ-\nciency in handling of large scale events. In this framework,\
    \ the following\nspeciﬁc activities will take place in the selected pilot sites:\n\
    • Integration, deployment and operation of commercially available ﬁxed\nand mobile\
    \ devices and development of new wearable devices in the\nMONICA IoT and relevant\
    \ Smart City infrastructures.\n• Integration, deployment and operation of commercially\
    \ available ﬁxed\nand mobile actuating devices and the relevant software applications\n\
    mentioned above.\n• Development and deployment of fully automated closed-loop\
    \ systems\nwhich uses sensing inputs from the IoT network layers to assist humans\n\
    in monitoring, situational awareness and decision making and provide\nthe resulting\
    \ control regimes for the actuating IoT infrastructure.\n• Validation of pre-deﬁned\
    \ impact Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\nrelated to each pilot site along with\
    \ the methodology and the relevant\nassessment procedures in order to obtain and\
    \ disseminate qualitative and\nquantitative date for replication.\n• Demonstration\
    \ of the generic applicability and interoperability of exper-\nimental testbeds\
    \ and open platforms in validation of IoT technologies\nand identiﬁcation of where\
    \ standards are missing and pre-normative\nactivities are needed.\n• Development\
    \ and validation of new markets and business models aiming\nat involving all actors\
    \ in the innovation value chain as well as assessing\nthe impact on Europe’s Cultural\
    \ and Creative Industries.\n• Active involvement of all actors in the validation\
    \ and dissemination in\norder to establish the best possible foundation for creating\
    \ maximum\nimpact and replication potential from the demonstrations.\nIn addition\
    \ to the planned demonstrations, the MONICA deployments\naddresses – in a smaller\
    \ scale – the solutions to more generic Smart City\nchallenges i.e. the deployment\
    \ of a common ICT infrastructure and compo-\nnents in city areas with very diverse\
    \ needs and context, to deliver services\nwith different business and technical\
    \ conﬁgurations. The speciﬁcation for the\n8.4 MONICA – Management of Networked\

    \ Germany’s biggest goose fair. It takes place three\ntimes a year in spring,\
    \ summer and winter and offers its attractions to 7–10 million visitors\nduring\
    \ the 91 DOM days2.\nMONICA pilots will be extracted from comprehensive use cases\
    \ and concrete\nbusiness cases deﬁned by demand-side stakeholders and users. Demand-side\n\
    representatives in the requirements process will be drawn from the ﬁelds of\n\
    concert organisers, artistic performers, spectators, public authorities, citizens,\n\
    civic engagement groups, and other relevant groups found inside and outside\n\
    the consortium. This methodology allows for maximum stakeholder input\ncaptured\
    \ in the analysis of the use cases, the business ecosystem, the value\nchain interactions\
    \ and the general societal and environmental realm.\nThe implementation and deployment\
    \ of the pilot sides will be based in\na mix of commercially available components\
    \ and solutions, open architec-\ntures and design approaches from previous the\
    \ portfolio of technologies and\ntools so far developed and demonstrated in reduced\
    \ and controlled environ-\nments as well as targeted research and development\
    \ of speciﬁc prototype\nsolutions where needed. Pilot work plans will include\
    \ feedback mecha-\nnisms to allow adaptation and optimisation of the technological\
    \ and business\napproach to the particular use case.\n2Photo courtesy of Hamburg.de\n\

    8.4.4 The MONICA Technical Concept\nThe MONICA platform features a cloud based\
    \ on advanced, open IoT\ntechnologies dynamically integrating ﬁxed and nomadic\
    \ devices and truly\nmobile wearables in the physical world with automated closed-loop\
    \ actuat-\ning functions. The platform will also integrate humans in the loop\
    \ where\nappropriate, by providing situational awareness and dynamic decision\
    \ support\ntools. A strong toolbox for security and trust management will complement\n\
    the platform.\nThe platform will be able to support multiple IoT applications\
    \ in a wide\nusage context focusing on the two most important challenges for organisers\n\
    of large scale concerts and cultural events in large cities: Unwanted noise in\n\
    the surroundings and security of the audience.\n8.4.4.1 The MONICA architecture\n\
    The MONICA platform is built on several IoT physical world network\ninfrastructures\
    \ and a closed loop control system for each application. The\ncomponents are connected\
    \ via dedicated communication network and data\nrepositories. The entire solution\
    \ is embedded in a MONICA Private Cloud\nstructure as visualised in Figure 8.13.\n\
    8.4.4.2 The MONICA IoT Infrastructure\nThe MONICA IoT Infrastructure, depicted\
    \ in Figure 8.14, must be capable of\nhandling three different types of IoT devices:\
    \ i) wearable devices, ii) nomadic\ndevices and iii) ﬁxed sensors and ﬁxed Cyber\
    \ Physical Systems.\nWearable devices include wristbands, glasses and mobile phones.\
    \ Wrist-\nbands are intended to be worn by the spectators and staff while glasses\
    \ are\nintended mainly for the security staff. Wristbands have connectivity based\n\
    on either Ultra-Wideband (UWB) or narrow-band radio (868/900 MHz)\ntechnologies.\
    \ Smart glasses instead will be used, based on the Android OS\nand equipped with\
    \ front-facing camera, inertial sensors, light sensor, GPS\nand pressure sensor.\
    \ The glasses have real see-through displays with a WVGA\nresolution and have\
    \ Wi-Fi b/g/n and BT4.0 connectivity. Nomadic devices are\nmobile devices conﬁned\
    \ to the event area, such as hand held sound dosimeters\nand other sensors (e.g.\
    \ sound meter, temperature sensor, wind sensor, camera,\netc.) mounted on controllable\
    \ airships. Fixed sensors and Cyber Physical\nSystems comprise devices mounted\
    \ on ﬁxed structures in and around the\nevent area, e.g. sound pressure gauges\
    \ and dosimeters, microphones, cameras,\nanemometers, etc.\n8.4 MONICA – Management\
    \ of Networked IoT Wearables – Very Large Scale\n247\nFigure 8.13\nThe overall\
    \ MONICA concept.\nFigure 8.14\nMONICA IoT Architecture.\nIn order to manage the\
    \ heterogeneity of a large amount of the above-\nmentioned devices, a proper IoT\
    \ architecture will be deﬁned following the\nAIOTI High-level Architecture (HLA)\
    \ and the AIOTI Domain Model pro-\nposed by the AIOTI WG03 – loT Standardisation.\
    \ The MONICA Distributed\n248\nIoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration,\
    \ Experimentation and Testing\nIoT Middleware will implement the IoT infrastructure\
    \ using existing IoT\ngateways and services, e.g. LinkSmart R⃝, FI-WARE, SCRAL,\
    \ and oneM2M.\nDe-facto standards such as MQTT for publish/subscribe and SAREF\
    \ (Smart\nAppliance Reference Ontology, ETSI TS 103 264 standard) and the W3C\n\
    Semantic Sensor Network Ontology for semantic modelling will be applied.\n8.4.5\
    \ Conclusion and Outlook\nThe MONICA project will carry out unique demonstrations\
    \ of large scale take\nup of IoT deployments at highly relevant inner city cultural\
    \ open-air events.\nIt will pave the way for innovative business opportunities\
    \ for technology and\nsoftware providers in the ﬁeld of IoT. Ultimately, the project\
    \ aims to improve\nthe quality of life in our cities for all citizens.\n8.5 SynchroniCity:\
    \ Delivering a Digital Single Market for\nIoT-enabled Urban Services in Europe\
    \ and Beyond\nSmart cities hold the potential to be a key driver and catalyst\
    \ in creating a\nlarge scale global IoT market of services and hardware. However,\
    \ the emerg-\ning smart city market faces speciﬁc challenges that act as barriers\
    \ to growth,\nimpeding rapid innovation and inhibiting widespread market adoption.\n\
    SynchroniCity is an ambitious initiative to deliver a digital single market\n\
    for Europe and beyond for IoT-enabled urban services by piloting its\nfoundations\
    \ at scale in reference zones across eight European cities and\ninvolving other\
    \ cities globally. It addresses how to incentivize and build\ntrust for companies\
    \ and citizens to actively participate and ﬁnd common\nco-created IoT solutions\
    \ for cities that meet citizen needs, and to create\nan environment of evidence-based\
    \ solutions that can easily be replicated in\nother regions. These reference zones\
    \ are based on cities at the forefront of\nsmart city development covering different\
    \ geographies, cultures and sizes\nand include Antwerp (BE), Carouge (CH), Eindhoven\
    \ (NL), Helsinki (FI),\nManchester (UK), Milano (IT), Porto (PT) and Santander\
    \ (ES). Globally,\nSynchroniCity adds committed replicating reference zones in\
    \ Mexico, Korea,\nUSA and Brazil.\n8.5.1 Introduction\nDigital technologies offer\
    \ an opportunity to profoundly change how our\nexisting society works. They can\
    \ enable a transformation of different industry\n8.5 SynchroniCity: Delivering\
    \ a Digital Single Market\n249\nFigure 8.15\nSynchroniCity cities and regions.\n\
    sectors improving existing business activities, processes, and competencies\n\
    within organizations and across their boundaries.\nData infrastructures and the\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT) form a critical part\nof the digital transformation\
    \ of cities and communities by creating adequate\nawareness of real-world processes\
    \ in order to drive more efﬁcient, partially\nautonomous, decision making, while\
    \ still maintaining a high level of data pro-\ntection, inclusivity and general\
    \ support for local priorities such as economic\ndevelopment and cultural heritage.\n\
    In terms of data infrastructures, cities have been at the forefront of\nembracing\
    \ the open data movement. The release of data sets to the public\nhas increased\
    \ transparency and provided early innovation potential for third\nparty stakeholders.\
    \ Services such as Citymapper3 show how open data can\nadd great beneﬁts to the\
    \ journey experiences of citizens.\nMany cities have invested in the setup of\
    \ open data portals and pro-\nactively encourage stakeholders across public departments\
    \ and the private\nsector to contribute data sets. At the same time, cities are\
    \ trying to engage\nentrepreneurs and communities to innovate around these data\
    \ stores. Early\nresults are promising, but static or sporadically changing data\
    \ sets have their\nlimitations.\n3https://citymapper.com/\n250\nIoT European Large-Scale\
    \ Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing\nFigure 8.16\nStreet light\
    \ in Santander.\nIoT infrastructures are increasingly becoming an important element\
    \ in\nproviding the underpinning digital layer of smart city services. They augment\n\
    the open data sets with rich real-time information about public infrastructure\n\
    conditions and city processes that can be exploited for a more responsive\ndelivery\
    \ of public services. Examples range from an improved mobility expe-\nrience through\
    \ adaptive trafﬁc management and multi-modal transportation to\nresource savings\
    \ achieved by smart street light control, waste collection and\nirrigation management.\n\
    Various demonstrations of such systems are emerging globally showing\nthe beneﬁts\
    \ of data-driven services based on IoT and data infrastructures.\nHowever, many\
    \ of these systems currently operate in silos both in terms\nof the technology\
    \ employed and the operating environments of the city.\nInteroperability issues\
    \ and lack of economies of scale make many potential\nbusiness cases still hard\
    \ to justify and result in a lack of conﬁdence in the\nmarket.\nSynchroniCity\
    \ aims to overcome the existing barriers in the market by\nfostering the emergence\
    \ of a digital single market for smart city services. It\n8.5 SynchroniCity: Delivering\
    \ a Digital Single Market\n251\nbrings eight European cities together to work\
    \ on a common blueprint for IoT\nand data infrastructures with standardized interfaces\
    \ and information models,\ncreating an environment that allows vendors and solution\
    \ providers to more\nopenly compete.\nOur vision is to move from disparate data\
    \ stores and city platforms\nto vibrant marketplaces for urban data and services\
    \ providing adequate\nincentives for a variety of stakeholders to participate.\
    \ For providers of IoT\ninfrastructure and other urban data sources, this should\
    \ provide a trusted\nenvironment to generate reliable revenue ﬂows. For application\
    \ and service\ndevelopers, it should allow frictionless access to reliable and\
    \ trusted urban\ndata streams to be used as assets underpinning the innovation\
    \ no matter\nwhat city is involved. We call this aspect “avoiding city lock-in”.\
    \ Cities\nand infrastructure providers can beneﬁt from an aligned environment\
    \ with\nstandardised interfaces to access a diverse pool of vendor solutions able\n\
    to compete fairly on price and performance. We call this aspect “avoiding\nvendor\
    \ lock-in”. Together, they form the robust underpinnings of a global\nmarket for\
    \ IoT-enabled urban services.\n8.5.2 Technical and Non-Technical Barriers of Creating\
    \ a Smart\nCity Eco-System\nSynchroniCity addresses a wide range of technological\
    \ and non-technological\nbarriers that need to be overcome to enable necessary\
    \ economies of scale and\nmarket conﬁdence to emerge.\nThe key technological barriers\
    \ include:\n• Lack of standardized multi-vendor ecosystem, leading to fear of\
    \ vendor\nlock-in for many cities;\n• Lack of common service provisioning environments\
    \ across cities, lead-\ning to fear of city lock-in for service developers as\
    \ they need to\n“redevelop” major parts of their apps and renegotiate access to\
    \ different\ndata sources for every city;\n• Close coupling of IoT infrastructure\
    \ and applications, leading to IoT\nsolution silos and limited infrastructure\
    \ reuse;\n• Lack of tools, license models and platforms to facilitate the incentivized\n\
    sharing of urban IoT data and other relevant data sets;\n• Lack of harmonized\
    \ business practice and legal frameworks across\ncities – making IoT infrastructure\
    \ roll out and launch of new services\ntedious across different geographies;\n\
    252\nIoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing\n\
    • Lack of understanding of privacy and personal data protection implica-\ntions\
    \ – making it difﬁcult to fully leverage data of citizens collected in\npublic\
    \ spaces in responsible way; and\n• Lack of conﬁdence in adopting emerging technologies\
    \ due to increasing\ntechnology ﬂuidity – rapid change and emergence of new standards\n\
    make it hard for cities to understand where sustainable investments can\nbe made.\n\
    Besides technological challenges, cities offer unique constraints and non-\ntechnological\
    \ barriers, which hamper the adoption of IoT technologies. They\ninclude:\n• Economical\
    \ costs and budget constraints make it difﬁcult to for cities to\nmake major investments\
    \ in newly emerging technologies;\n• Inﬂexible public tender processes and procurement\
    \ models complicate\nexperimental exploration with new technology solutions;\n\
    • Frequent political changes and reliance on election cycles leads often to\n\
    reprioritisation and lack of continuity to focus on longer term innovation\nprogrammes;\n\
    • Lack of a holistic smart city strategy leads to investments in fragmented\n\
    systems for different verticals, making it difﬁcult to capitalise across\nthese\
    \ and gain cost savings; and\n• Lack of involvement of citizens and support from\
    \ these can lead to smart\ncity solutions not addressing real citizen needs and\
    \ fuel the mistrust of\ncitizen in adopting new technology solutions.\n8.5.3 SynchroniCity\
    \ Technical Approach\nOvercoming the barriers identiﬁed above requires a common\
    \ approach\nacross the different reference zones. In the following we introduce\
    \ the key\nfoundations for our vision of the SynchroniCity digital single market.\n\
    Technical barriers 1–3 and in part 7 demand a common reference archi-\ntecture\
    \ for smart city platforms. A standardised reference architecture, which\nis widely\
    \ adopted among many cities with clearly deﬁned components and\ninterfaces is\
    \ fundamental to overcome vendor lock-in. It will boost market\nconﬁdence and\
    \ lay down the foundations for the required economies of scale.\nKey elements\
    \ in this reference architecture are common north- and south-\nbound interfaces.\
    \ Technical barrier 4 demands new market place enablers\nthat encourage sharing\
    \ of urban IoT data and other relevant data sets among\n8.5 SynchroniCity: Delivering\
    \ a Digital Single Market\n253\nFigure 8.17\nHigh level architectural view of\
    \ the SynchroniCity single digital market.\ndifferent stakeholders. Lastly, barriers\
    \ 5–6 relate to ﬁnding agreement on\ncommon principles of governance of a digital\
    \ single market.\nFigure 8.17 shows an overview of the proposed components of\
    \ the Syn-\nchroniCity single market place including common north- and southbound\n\
    interfaces. A further important feature is the market place enablers that\nunderpin\
    \ a thriving business eco-system around IoT data streams, actuation\ncapabilities\
    \ and other urban data sources. In the following we brieﬂy describe\neach of these.\n\
    A common reference architecture for smart city platforms. A standard-\nized reference\
    \ architecture, which is widely adopted among cities with clearly\ndeﬁned components\
    \ and interfaces, is fundamental to overcome vendor lock-\nin. It will boost market\
    \ conﬁdence and lay down the foundations for the\nrequired economies of scale.\n\
    Common northbound interfaces. Developers require a common, homoge-\nneous and\
    \ IoT independent way to access data from the devices infrastructure,\nbut also\
    \ from any other subsystem in the city that can provide valuable\ninformation\
    \ to develop smart services and applications. More speciﬁcally, this\nincludes\
    \ 1) a common standard API for context information management;\n2) a common set\
    \ of information models enabling actual interoperability of\napplications; and\
    \ 3) a set of common standards data publication platforms\n254\nIoT European Large-Scale\
    \ Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing\nhave to comply with, enabling\
    \ the harvesting of data coming from multiple\nfederated platforms as well as\
    \ the publication of real-time open data.\nCommon southbound interfaces. For IoT\
    \ device vendors and manufacturers\nit should become easier to offer suitable\
    \ device stacks for integrating hetero-\ngeneous IoT components into a common\
    \ environment, together with a market\nplace for compliant IoT products and solutions.\n\
    Market place enablers. These should encourage sharing of urban IoT data\nand other\
    \ relevant data sets among different stakeholders. By providing a mar-\nket place\
    \ as a one-stop-shop, it will become much easier for data consumers\nto discover\
    \ and access urban data sources. The availability of a trusted market\nplace with\
    \ monetization mechanisms will allow third parties to generate eas-\nier revenue\
    \ streams from their urban data sources. This will encourage more\nbusinesses\
    \ to share currently closed data sources or incentivize deployments\nof new IoT\
    \ infrastructure as secondary revenue streams can be generated,\nmaking more business\
    \ cases viable. Data consumers may not require lengthy\nnegotiations of license\
    \ terms as data license terms can be negotiated from\npre-conﬁgured options of\
    \ the provider on the ﬂy.\n8.5.4 SynchroniCity Applications\nBased on the shared\
    \ architecture, SynchroniCity will deliver IoT-enabled\nurban services in the\
    \ eight reference zone cities. The services will be\ndeveloped and delivered in\
    \ an ambitious two-stage approach.\nFirst phase consists of three initial applications,\
    \ based on the highest\npriorities among the members of the global Open & Agile\
    \ Smart Cities\ninitiative, a network of more than 100 cities worldwide which\
    \ includes the\nSynchroniCity reference zones:\n• Community Policy Suite\n• Context-adaptive\
    \ trafﬁc management\n• Multi-modal transportation\nThese applications are fairly\
    \ standard services nowadays. However, there\nare still signiﬁcant gaps when it\
    \ comes to actually delivering them at scale,\nbased on digital single market\
    \ principles. Not all the SynchroniCity cities are\ninvolved in the deployment\
    \ of all the initial applications.\nThe following phase is called “enrichment\
    \ of the eco-system”, and it adds\nanother wave of new applications to the SynchroniCity\
    \ portfolio, based on\nan open call where new companies and cities may propose\
    \ applications and\nservices built on top of the SynchroniCity architectural principles.\n\
    8.5 SynchroniCity: Delivering a Digital Single Market\n255\nFigure 8.18\nInteractive\
    \ light art in Eindhoven.\nA total of 3 million Euros has been allocated for the\
    \ new applications, and\nthe call for participation will launch in the spring\
    \ of 2018.\nTaken together, the applications developed and deployed at large scale\n\
    in SynchroniCity will form a substantial contribution to a global market for\n\
    IoT-enabled urban services.\n8.5.5 Impact Creation\nSynchroniCity consists of\
    \ eight core reference zones in as many cities, but\nthe ambition is to go well\
    \ beyond this starting point: beyond the reference\nzone to the entire city, beyond\
    \ a single silo to span multiple domains, and to\ngo beyond Europe.\nTo reach\
    \ this goal, the project was founded on a strong partnership basis\nwith existing\
    \ initiatives and communities, and has deﬁned a set of ambitious\nKPIs.\nAt the\
    \ core of SynchroniCity is the Open & Agile Smart Cities initiative\n(OASC)4 which\
    \ is a global network of national networks of more than\n4www.oascities.org\n\
    256\nIoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing\n\
    100 cities in 23 countries that are working together to contribute to the\nestablishment\
    \ of a simple set of mechanisms for technical interoperability and\ncomparability\
    \ based on the needs of cities, i.e. the demand-side in the market.\nBy adding\
    \ global partners in Mexico, USA, Korea and Brazil, SynchroniCity\nspans a large\
    \ diversity which is a characteristic of a global market. Potentially,\nthe entire\
    \ OASC network can easily adapt and deploy the SynchroniCity\napplications. Figure\
    \ 8.15 shows the European reference zones, the global\npartners and the OASC cities.\n\
    A key focus of SynchroniCity is to contribute to the development of\ncommon speciﬁcations\
    \ and ultimately standards. As shown in Figure 8.19\nbelow, SynchroniCity takes\
    \ input not only from OASC and the cities directly\ninvolved in the project, but\
    \ also from other large initiatives, including promi-\nnently the FIWARE5 initiative\
    \ and the European Innovation Partnership on\nSmart Cities and Communities (EIP-SCC)6.\
    \ Through targeted activities and\ndeliverables as well as participation directly\
    \ in the speciﬁcation and standards\ndevelopment, SynchroniCity is contributing\
    \ directly to a number of streams,\nincluding the ETSI Industry Speciﬁcation Group\
    \ on Context Information\nManagement (ETSI ISG CIM)7, the ITU-T Focus Group on\
    \ Data Process-\ning and Management for Smart Cities and Communities (FG-DPM)8,\
    \ and\nISO/TC 268 on Sustainable cities and communities9. The project actively\n\
    supports and contributes to the UN Sustainable Development Goals10.\nBy having\
    \ the open call where actors outside of the SynchroniCity project\nconsortium\
    \ are invited to enrich the eco-system, SynchroniCity actively seeks\nto facilitate\
    \ support and impact beyond the closed group of initial partners.\n8.5.6 Conclusions\
    \ and Outlook\nSynchroniCity has a clear ambition to deliver local value in cities\
    \ and commu-\nnities based on the global dynamics of digital connectivity, innovation\
    \ power\nand capital. So far, efforts to create a global multi-sided market based\
    \ on\ndemand-side needs have not been successful. With the approach described\n\
    above, the partners in the SynchroniCity consortium propose an approach\n5www.ﬁware.org\n\

    \ Automated Driving Progressed by\nInternet of Things\n“AUTOmated driving Progressed\
    \ by Internet Of Things” (AUTOPILOT) is\na three-year project that started in\
    \ January 2017, receiving funding from the\nEuropean Union’s Horizon 2020 research\
    \ and innovation programme. The\nAUTOPILOT consortium, consisting of 45 partners,\
    \ represents all relevant\nareas of the Internet of Things (IoT) eco-system. Its\
    \ overall objective to\nenable safer highly automated driving through smart and\
    \ connected objects –\nthe IoT11.\n11Fischer, F. & Corazza, F. (2017).\n258\n\
    IoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing\n8.6.1\
    \ Project Overview\nDuring the last decade, numerous IoT technologies have been\
    \ developed by\nthe research community, including IoT software engineering tools\
    \ and tech-\nniques, schemes for safeguarding security/privacy as well as infrastructures.\n\
    Built upon these recently ﬁnished or ongoing research and innovation activi-\n\
    ties, AUTOPILOT focuses on utilising the IoT potential for automated driving\n\
    and on making data from autonomous cars available to the IoT. In particular,\n\
    AUTOPILOT aims to bring together relevant knowledge and technology\nfrom automotive\
    \ and IoT value chains in order to develop IoT-architectures\nand platforms to\
    \ explore the growing market for mobility services. IoT-\nenabled autonomous cars\
    \ are tested, in real conditions, at six large-scale\nsites, whose test results\
    \ will allow multi-criteria evaluations (technical, user,\nbusiness, legal) of\
    \ the IoT impact on pushing the level of autonomous\ndriving.\n8.6.1.1 Objective\n\
    Connectivity and the ability to collect data from thousands of objects sur-\n\
    rounding vehicles are key enablers for highly automated driving. The IoT\nprovides\
    \ the mechanisms and tools to create virtual objects in the Cloud\nfrom real connected\
    \ objects, thereby allowing these objects to become more\nautomated in the not-so-distant\
    \ future.\nOverall, AUTOPILOT pursues ﬁve main objectives. First, it seeks to\n\
    enhance the vehicle’s understanding of its environment, utilising IoT sensors.\n\
    Second, the project sets out to foster innovation in automotive IoT and\nmobility\
    \ services. Third, it wants to use and evaluate advanced vehicle-\nto-everything\
    \ connectivity technologies. Fourth, AUTOPILOT is designed\nto involve users,\
    \ public services and businesses to assess the IoT’s socio-\neconomic beneﬁts.\
    \ Last, the project aims to contribute to the standardisation\nof IoT eco-systems\
    \ worldwide.\nMore concretely, AUTOPILOT proceeds in four steps (see Figure 8.20).\n\
    On large-scale test sites, data is collected in an IoT eco-system, deﬁned as\n\
    “objects in the physical world, which are capable of being identiﬁed and\nintegrated\
    \ into communication networks”. Next, this data is collated and\nFigure 8.20\n\
    Project ﬂow.\n8.6 AUTOPILOT – Automated Driving Progressed by Internet of Things\n\
    259\nanalysed in an IoT Platform, deﬁned as “interconnecting things based on\n\
    existing and evolving interoperable ICTs”, which is speciﬁcally dedicated\nto\
    \ Automated Driving (see Section 8.6.2.1). The IoT Platform is then used\nfor\
    \ four use cases to test applications on Automated Driving (see Section\n8.6.2.2).\
    \ Ultimately, AUTOPILOT suggests some services, which can serve\nas business models\
    \ for translating IoT Applications (see Section 8.6.2.3) into\ntangible offers\
    \ for end users of automated driving.\n8.6.1.2 Partners\nThe AUTOPILOT consortium\
    \ brings together 45 partners from multiple\ncountries and diverse backgrounds.\
    \ The consortium is a balanced mix of\norganisations working in IoT as well as\
    \ in Automation. This cooperation\nis an asset, because both industries have a\
    \ very different approach to data\nsharing and vehicle control. IoT devices are\
    \ by deﬁnition shared and open\nwhile automotive electronics are closed and safety-critical.\
    \ The partner con-\nstellation in AUTOPILOT helps to overcome this problem and\
    \ thus fosters\nimplementation of IoT solutions in future vehicle architecture.\
    \ The idea\nbehind the consortium is to combine a wide range of knowledge areas\n\
    to foster the project’s effectiveness in attaining its objectives. Lastly, the\n\
    AUTOPILOT consortium provides an avenue for authorities into the project.\nCity\
    \ authorities of the project sites are as much part of the consortium as are\n\
    road operators.\nOverall, the AUTOPILOT consortium can be characterised in four\
    \ clus-\nters: (1) those developing AD vehicles, (2) those developing IoT and\
    \ net-\nworks, (3) those collecting data to evaluate the systems and their potential\n\
    impacts, and, (4) those potentially developing innovative services based on\n\
    the results. This comprehensive mix of partners is a key to the project.\n8.6.2\
    \ Project Approach\nAUTOPILOT follows a two-track approach, composed of both pragmatic\
    \ and\nconceptual platform development. On the one hand, the pragmatic architec-\n\
    ture serves not only as starting point for the development of the conceptual\n\
    and uniﬁed platform but also as starting point for the use cases at the different\n\
    Pilot Sites. On the other hand, the conceptual architecture is deployed very\n\
    early and can be used by any new development. The conceptual architecture\nis\
    \ to be used as the reference for discussion and collaboration with other\nLarge\
    \ Scale Pilots. To swiftly achieve tangible results, AUTOPILOT utilises\npragmatically\
    \ existing systems or other available installations.\n260\nIoT European Large-Scale\
    \ Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing\nIn addition, AUTOPILOT adopts\
    \ an iterative approach for innovation\nactivities, known as Iterative and Incremental\
    \ Development (IDD). The main\nrationale for IID in the design phase is to allow\
    \ the project to better adapt to\nchanging contexts, requirements, technological\
    \ developments and boundary\nconditions. Therefore, the requirements are not frozen\
    \ at the early stage of\nthe project but will be reviewed based on preliminary\
    \ evaluation results.\nA maximum of three cycles is foreseen, whereas the need\
    \ for applying\nall cycles is likely to be different for the partners and Pilot\
    \ Sites, according\nto their level of maturity in IoT and automated driving at\
    \ the start of the\nproject. The multiple cycle approach offers all partners the\
    \ necessary level of\nﬂexibility concerning their participation in the project\
    \ as well as harmonising\ntheir contributions to the project.\nThe speciﬁc motivation\
    \ for this approach in AUTOPILOT is threefold:\nFirst, there is a technical justiﬁcation.\
    \ One needs to merge the need to\nintegrate many different components, with the\
    \ need to start from existing\nsolutions and adapt to users’ early feedbacks.\
    \ Second, there is an organisa-\ntional justiﬁcation, as Pilot Sites will learn\
    \ from each other between cycles.\nThird, there is a business justiﬁcation, as\
    \ initial solutions to show on the\ndemand side can pointedly visualise the demand\
    \ side to IoT solutions for\nautomated road transport.\n8.6.2.1 AUTOPILOT’s IOT\
    \ Platform\nAUTOPILOT’s IoT Platform is held responsible on six parameters of\
    \ design.\n• Standard-Based: Legacy or proprietary IoT systems can be integrated\n\
    into a common system;\n• Abstraction: Abstraction-based information model following\
    \ estab-\nlished High-Level IoT Architecture;\n• Federation: Private and public\
    \ IoT systems can co-exist and collaborate\non-demand;\n• Semantic: Based on formal\
    \ semantics to achieve automated processing\nof large variety of information;\n\
    • Functional Distribution: Architecture enabling functional elements to be\nallocated\
    \ into systems;\n• Security: Provision of security functions and implementation\
    \ of the\n“Privacy-by-Design” principles.\nToday’s IoT installations are mainly\
    \ Intranet-of-Things meaning closed sys-\ntems developed for a single commercial\
    \ purpose and all following the same\ndesign principles. But the vision of AUTOPILOT\
    \ is calling for an open IoT\n8.6 AUTOPILOT – Automated Driving Progressed by\
    \ Internet of Things\n261\nsystem, in which many participants are publishing and\
    \ consuming IoT data\nand services. This is alike the Internet in which many participants\
    \ can operate\ntheir own Web site. As shown with traditional Web-based systems,\
    \ there is a\nneed for aggregation and federation services, supporting developer\
    \ and end-\nuser with high-quality services (e.g. Google search, hotel booking\
    \ engines,\nnews aggregation services).\nThose services are especially needed\
    \ in the IoT for autonomous driving\nareas. Automated driving service operators\
    \ will prefer to use a single ser-\nvice, delivering high quality and reliable\
    \ information, rather than having to\ninterface with thousands of information\
    \ sources and service providers. This is\ncalled the IoT Federation, where autonomous\
    \ systems agreed to collaborate\nby exchanging data and providing services to\
    \ each other. The AUTOPILOT\nconceptual architecture provides such federation\
    \ mechanism following the\nfederation design principle. For example, for data\
    \ access the FIWARE IoT\nBroker provides a large-scale federation infrastructure.\
    \ Federation enables a\nﬁner grain control over IoT information compared to centralised\
    \ IoT clouds.\nFederation also enables privacy-by-design thanks to clear policies\
    \ and control\npoints for information access.\nToday’s autonomous driving applications\
    \ are relying on autonomous\nvehicle systems in which the needed information is\
    \ gathered, processed and\nanalysed on the vehicles themselves. As a consequence,\
    \ the vehicle platform\ncan base its driving and manoeuvring decisions solely\
    \ on local information\n(Autonomous Car Zone). In the past year, newer approaches\
    \ for cooperative\ndriving have emerged, where driving functions take information\
    \ gathered\nfrom other devices into account, e.g. using Car2Car or Car2Infra approaches\n\
    (Cooperation Zone). With the emergence of the IoT, autonomous driving\nservices\
    \ can utilise IoT devices from the surrounding as well as services from\nthe Cloud\n\
    8.6.2.2 Project Sites and Applications\nAUTOPILOT employs large numbers of vehicles\
    \ under normal trafﬁc con-\nditions, for which trials are being conducted at six\
    \ large-scale Pilot Sites\n(Table 8.2).\n• The Finnish Pilot Site, located in\
    \ Tampere provides different outdoor\nconditions, such as slippery intersection\
    \ in winter time, low visibility\nfor environment perception sensors due to fog.\n\
    • The French Pilot Site is located in downtown Versailles, close to the\ncastle.\
    \ Its goal is to provide mobility services for tourists, based on a\nsmall ﬂeet\
    \ of automated vehicles and dedicated to a car-sharing.\n262\nIoT European Large-Scale\
    \ Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing\n• The Italian Pilot Site,\
    \ is a testing infrastructure encompassing the\nFlorence-Livorno highway together\
    \ with road access to the settlement\naround the Livorno seaport.\n• The Korean\
    \ Pilot Site in Daejeon focuses on road situation information\nat an intersection,\
    \ which is challenging for automated vehicles because\nof the large number of\
    \ obstacles to be encountered there.\n• The Dutch Pilot consists of three different\
    \ test areas, including the\nEindhoven University campus, the automotive campus\
    \ parking, and a\n6 km stretch of the A270 motorway.\n• The Spanish Pilot Site\
    \ is located in Vigo, covering the city’s main street.\nIt provides an operational\
    \ test on cooperative systems between different\ntypes of vehicles and for underground\
    \ parking.\nAUTOPILOT deploys four different automated driving use cases: Automated\n\
    Valet Parking (AVP) is a driverless Automated Driving use case including\non-street\
    \ car drop-off, driving to and from a parking spot, forwards and back-\nwards\
    \ manoeuvring as well as on-street passenger pick-up. The IoT allows\nthis use\
    \ case to be a Level 4 scenario, since data and control from different\ninfrastructure\
    \ sensors is essential. IoT functions include routing (parking\navailability through\
    \ sensors), localisation of obstacles (parking cameras) and\neven control decision\
    \ making at the IoT Edge.\nTable 8.2\nAUTOPILOT project sites and applications\n\
    8.6 AUTOPILOT – Automated Driving Progressed by Internet of Things\n263\nHighway\
    \ Use is a use case focused on Automated Driving on motorways\nfrom entrance to\
    \ exit, on all lanes, incl. overtaking. The driver must deliber-\nately activate\
    \ the system, but does not have to monitor the system constantly.\nThere are no\
    \ requests from the system to the driver to take over when the\nsystems in normal\
    \ operation area (i.e. on the motorway). Depending on the\ndeployment of cooperative\
    \ systems ad-hoc convoys could also be created if\nV2V communication is available.\n\
    The use case for Platooning is an Automated Driving scenario where fully\nautomated\
    \ driving or driverless vehicles will join and drive in a platoon, with\na leading\
    \ vehicle in front. The driving mode is very similar to the Highway\nPilot, however\
    \ driving in a platoon requires the vehicle to use advanced V2V\ncommunications.\
    \ Two variants of platooning will be deployed and evaluated\nin AUTOPILOT, an\
    \ urban one and a highway one.\nThe Urban Driving use case is based on the ERTRAC\
    \ “Fully automated\nprivate vehicle” representing the SAE level 5, where “The\
    \ fully automated\nvehicle should be able to handle all driving from point A to\
    \ B, without any\ninput from the passenger.”\n8.6.2.3 Services the intersection\
    \ of IoT and automation\nAs stipulated in its acronym, AUTOPILOT seeks to foster\
    \ the progress of\nautomated driving. For this purpose, it makes use of the innovation\
    \ of IoT\ndevelopments in the ﬁeld. Throughout the project, members of the consor-\n\
    tium will work to develop eight speciﬁc services that draw on the use case\napplications\
    \ of IoT (see Table 8.3). These services fulﬁl a double function.\nOn the one\
    \ hand, they make the idea of automated driving progressed through\nthe IoT tangible\
    \ for end users. On the other hand, they suggest viable business\nmodels for stakeholders\
    \ that will carry on the ﬁndings of AUTOPILOT even\nafter it ended.\n8.6.3 Project\
    \ Impact\nTo provide quantitative and qualitative evidence of the added value\
    \ of IoT\ntechnology for automated driving, all large-scale Pilot tests are evaluated\n\
    using the established FESTA methodology. The added value is formulated\nin hypotheses\
    \ on objectives, ambitions and impact, and is measured in Key\nPerformance Indicators\
    \ (KPIs) or metrics from several perspectives. Data\nanalyses and (technical)\
    \ evaluation will be executed simultaneously with\npiloting to provide immediate\
    \ feedback on test executing and input for the\nnext iteration of development.\n\
    264\nIoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing\n\
    Table 8.3\nIoT based automated driving services\nAUTOPILOT will focus on using\
    \ standard-based IoT to ensure deploying\ninteroperable and replicable IoT platforms\
    \ and architectures. It will verify\nthe interoperability and functionality during\
    \ the development phase. Security\nand privacy by design will be a key impact\
    \ of AUTOPILOT. Additionally,\nAUTOPILOT will deploy and evaluate several business\
    \ services contributing\nor using automated driving. In this, the project will\
    \ have to assess possibly\n8.7 CREATE-IoT Cross Fertilisation through Alignment,\

    \ use cases in a real public and private\nenvironment, with the consent and strong\
    \ support of the City councils, some\nbeing in the consortium. Services like car\
    \ sharing, city chauffeur and auto-\nmated valet parking are expected to increase\
    \ citizens’ quality of life. The Pilot\nSites, with their different automated\
    \ driving use cases and business partners\nare an instrument to attract new entrepreneurs\
    \ for creating further business\nopportunities. AUTOPILOT will promote the IoT\
    \ as key enabler for automate\ndriving and the related new business models linked\
    \ with the IoT eco-system.\n8.7 CREATE-IoT Cross Fertilisation through Alignment,\n\

    \ action involving all IoT Euro-\npean Large-Scale Pilots innovation actions projects,\
    \ articulating altogether\nthe IoT European Large-Scale Pilots Programme that\
    \ is built around eight\nactivity groups. Through an active participation of these\
    \ activity groups, IoT\nLarge-Scale Pilot projects are able to contribute to the\
    \ consolidation and\ncoherence work that is implemented by the CREATE-IoT and\
    \ U4IOT. This\nis done by supporting the clustering activities deﬁned by the Programme\
    \ and\naddressing issues of common interest such as interoperability approach,\

    \ from 9 European countries. The\nproject objectives are to stimulate collaboration\
    \ between IoT initiatives, foster\nthe take up of IoT in Europe and support the\
    \ development and growth of\nIoT ecosystems based on open technologies and platforms.\
    \ This requires\nsynchronisation and alignment on strategic and operational terms\
    \ through\n268\nIoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation\
    \ and Testing\nFigure 8.22\nCREATE-IoT activities.\nfrequent, multi-directional\
    \ exchanges between the various activities under the\nIoT Focus Areas as depicted\
    \ in Figure 8.22. It addresses cross fertilisation of\nthe various IoT Large Scale\
    \ Pilots for technological and validation issues\nof common interest across the\
    \ various application domains and use cases.\nThe project fosters the exchange\
    \ on requirements for legal accompanying\nmeasures, development of common methodologies\
    \ and KPIs for design,\ntesting and validation and for success and impact measurement,\
    \ federation\nof pilot activities and transfer to other pilot areas, facilitating\
    \ the access for\nIoT entrepreneurs/API developers/makers, SMEs, including combination\
    \ of\nICT and art.\nCREATE-IoT takes a holistic approach in facilitating the exchange\n\
    between the different IoT Large-Scale Pilot projects and providing the appro-\n\
    priate platform and tools that will enable fruitful cross-fertilization between\n\
    IoT Large-Scale Pilots.\n8.7.2 Conceptual Approach\nCREATE-IoT aims to provide\
    \ support to the different activities covered\nby the IoT Focus Area through the\
    \ development of a coherent strategy\nfor open exchanges and collaboration between\
    \ the various actors involved.\nCREATE-IoT is focusing on promoting and discovering\
    \ synergies across the\ndifferent axes of the IoT Focus Area, as shown in Figure\
    \ 8.23. The horizontal\nnature of (personal) data protection, security, user acceptance,\
    \ standardisa-\ntion, interoperability, creativity, societal and ethical aspects,\
    \ legal issues and\ninternational cooperation are coordinated across the whole\
    \ IoT ecosystem.\nSpecial attention is paid to the Large-Scale Pilots, but also\
    \ to other initiatives\n8.7 CREATE-IoT Cross Fertilisation through Alignment,\

    \ Area, and other related initiatives at EU and global level\ninvolving different\
    \ IoT communities, technology and innovation platforms,\netc. The project boosts\
    \ synergies, experience and knowledge sharing towards\nthe creation of an inclusive\
    \ IoT ecosystem, by deﬁning a set of best practices\nand business models that\
    \ will facilitate the replication of results and, thus,\nimprove the overall impact\
    \ of the parallel on-going activities, in particular\nthe IoT Large-Scale Pilot\
    \ projects. In summary, CREATE-IoT is working on:\n• Ensuring coherent exchanges\
    \ between the various activities of the Focus\nArea, and cross fertilisation of\
    \ the various pilots for technological and\nvalidation issues of common interest\
    \ across the various use cases.\n• Supporting and assessing the current IoT Large-Scale\
    \ Pilot projects,\nsharing best practices and aligning horizontal issues.\n• Developing\
    \ a more inclusive ecosystem where innovation, art and\ncreativity take active\
    \ part on it.\n• Proposing a framework for the coherent integration of the EU\
    \ IoT value\nchain, strengthening the links between different on-going initiatives\
    \ in\nthe IoT domain.\n• Fostering interoperability of existing and future IoT\
    \ solutions.\n270\nIoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation\
    \ and Testing\n• Implementing and developing a policy framework in the IoT domain\n\
    addressing the current horizontal issues that prevent the from massive\ndeployment\
    \ of IoT solutions, with a special focus on the trust and legal\ndomains.\nThe\
    \ project methodology is based on a clear deﬁnition of the current IoT\necosystem.\
    \ The work provides the overall foundation for common inter-\nlinking and coordination\
    \ activities: all relevant stakeholders, technologies,\nreference architectures\
    \ and business models will be the base over which\nthe project will grow. The\
    \ support to the IoT Large-Scale Pilot projects,\nas addressed by the project,\
    \ fosters the sharing of experiences both from\ntechnical and non-technical perspectives.\
    \ On the technical side, CREATE-\nIoT is focusing mainly on the federation of\
    \ experiments and IoT reference\narchitectures, whilst the non-technical side\
    \ aims at sharing experiences,\nassessment methodologies and business models.\
    \ The project exploits the\nsynergies between arts and IoT and position creativity\
    \ and innovation as a key\ndriver and enabler for the progress of IoT. The methodology\
    \ resulting from\nthis work is tested in the different LSPs. The project addresses\
    \ the creation\nof a framework for an integrated European IoT Value Chain that\
    \ will grow\nthe links between communities of IoT users and providers, as well\
    \ as with\nMember States’ initiatives and other related initiatives in the IoT\
    \ domain.\nThe development of a Policy Framework will help addressing the multiple\n\
    existing challenges, especially in the security and privacy domain, which\nare\
    \ hindering the wide adoption of IoT solutions. The requirements for\na trusted\
    \ IoT label are under discussion. This label would better position\nEU IoT solutions\
    \ in the global markets, being applicable not only to the\nwhole IoT Focus Area,\
    \ but also to other IoT domains. CREATE-IoT works\non supporting industrial consensus\
    \ building for implementing pre-normative\nand standardisation, coordinating the\
    \ activities with Standard Developing\nOrganizations (i.e. ISO, ETSI, CEN/CENELEC,\
    \ W3C, IETF, ITU, IEEE,\nOGC, etc.) and other various IoT Global Alliances (AIOTI,\
    \ IIC, Thread,\nAllJoyn, Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF), etc.), thus aligning\
    \ activities\nat the national, European and global level.\n8.7.3 Impact\nCREATE-IoT\
    \ provides the framework for supporting and coordinating the\nIoT Focus Area,\
    \ in order to foster the take up of IoT in Europe and enable the\nemergence of\
    \ IoT ecosystems supported by open technologies and platforms.\n8.7 CREATE-IoT\
    \ Cross Fertilisation through Alignment, Synchronisation\n271\nThis is done through\
    \ the coordination of complementary activities structured\naround IoT Large-Scale\
    \ Pilots\nThe project ensures the framework environment and provides tools to\n\
    ensure consistency and linkages between the pilots, complementing them by\naddressing\
    \ ethics and privacy, trust and security, respect for the scarcity and\nvulnerability\
    \ of human attention, validation and certiﬁcation, standards and\ninteroperability,\
    \ user acceptability and control, liability and sustainability.\nThe project implements\
    \ a coordination body that ensures an efﬁcient interplay\nof the various elements\
    \ of the IoT Focus Area and liaises with relevant\ninitiatives at EU, Member States\
    \ and international levels.\nFor today’s and tomorrow’s IoT products, services,\
    \ applications, solutions\ninfrastructure and ecosystems, it is crucial that the\
    \ society, its citizens and\nother (potential) customers and users have trust\
    \ in what they use, buy, wish\nto enjoy or are connected to. In order to create\
    \ a workable level of such trust\nand therewith durable adoption, one will need\
    \ to have comfort, the offer will\nneed to be credible and usable. In that scope,\
    \ concepts such as ethics, safety,\naccountability, security and privacy by design\
    \ have to be widely spread from\nthe early stages of development for IoT products,\
    \ services, applications, solu-\ntions infrastructure and ecosystems. To enable\
    \ large scale deployments of IoT\nsystems ensuring massive and durable user adoption,\
    \ it will be essential that\nIoT and related IoT ecosystems are based on complementary\
    \ architectures\nbased on similar principles, enabling to leverage across multiple\
    \ use cases and\nto catch the extra value arising from information exchange across\
    \ multiple\nsectors/domains.\nThe goal of the CREATE-IoT project is to put in\
    \ place an approach that\ncan federate the IoT Large-Scale Pilots and, beyond\
    \ them, other IoT and\nrelated ecosystems that are deployed worldwide. Given that\
    \ IoT applications\nare meant to affect the living environment with minimum involvement\
    \ from\nthe human side, security breaches may have direct impact on human safety,\n\
    and the privacy may be compromised by communications that happen without\nbeing\
    \ noticed. Furthermore, security in IoT environment is more challenging\nto be\
    \ achieved than in the traditional Internet of computers, due to power,\nbandwidth\
    \ and computing constraints. Therefore, it tends to be neglected\nin early deployments\
    \ despite its high criticality. In addition, the privacy\nrisk requires speciﬁc\
    \ overall horizontal attention across initiatives, because\nexposure of multiple\
    \ anonymized data about the life, from home energy\nconsumption to public transport\
    \ infrastructure usage and ofﬁce activities,\nfacilitates link ability to individual\
    \ identity, eventually compromising the pri-\nvacy of each anonymous data. These\
    \ aspects deserve speciﬁc attention in the\n272\nIoT European Large-Scale Pilots\
    \ – Integration, Experimentation and Testing\nsupervision activities. There are\
    \ many new ethical, legal and related questions\nand queries that need to be structured,\
    \ addressed, clariﬁed and sometimes\nrethought. There are many layers in any IoT\
    \ vertical and horizontal matters\nsuch as for instance (personal) data protection,\
    \ data management, security,\nproduct liability and net neutrality rise not once,\
    \ but actually several times per\nlayer. There are quite some layers necessary\
    \ in order to build an IoT vertical,\nlet alone the many cross-vertical data value\
    \ chains and liabilities that need to\nbe addressed.\nCREATE-IoT has an important\
    \ and critical impact on potential barriers,\non providing the stakeholders with\
    \ multi-angle and sufﬁcient knowledge,\nwith a trusted environment for the development\
    \ of IoT, and with compre-\nhensive technical and non-technical practical landscaped\
    \ guidelines, mecha-\nnisms, best practices and other legal and related knowledge,\
    \ and on giving\nsupport to projects across the IoT Focus Area. The ultimate aim\
    \ is to create\nthe Trusted IoT concept.\nCREATE-IoT’s expected impact is in ensuring\
    \ that start-ups, developers\nand SMEs are able to play a role in the new IoT\
    \ paradigm. One of the\nrequirements is that the platforms deployed across the\
    \ IoT Focus Areas must\nbe open to enable sustainability and continued innovation\
    \ and development\nof new cases. By ensuring that there are appropriate support\
    \ mechanisms for\nSMEs and start-up participation, CREATE-IoT is working to:\n\
    • Enable start-ups and SMEs to engage with the IoT Large-Scale Pilot\nprojects\
    \ and build the skills and technology base they need to be part of\nthe IoT ecosystem.\n\
    • Provide clarity about legal considerations on privacy and other related\ntopics.\n\
    • Invite disruptive innovation from stakeholders who have no proprietary\ntechnology\
    \ or legacy considerations.\n• Ensure that the voice of smaller and new businesses\
    \ across Europe can\nbe heard in the debates on standards and interoperability.\n\
    • Lay the foundations for truly open (although not necessarily free of\ncharge)\
    \ platforms that withstand changes in any given ecosystem.\nThe longer-term impact\
    \ of the support to SMEs is seen in Europe’s ability to\ncompete on the world\
    \ stage with new companies that can contribute to the\ncreation of skilled jobs\
    \ and economic growth. CREATE-IoT creates impact\nthrough the development and\
    \ implementation of a methodology to integrate\nartistic practices and creation\
    \ in IoT innovation, adoption and market pen-\netration. The exploitation of the\
    \ combination of ICT and the arts has direct\n8.8 U4IoT – User Engagement for\
    \ Large Scale Pilots in the Internet of Things\n273\nimpact on IoT Large-Scale\
    \ Pilots and Focus Area by enhancing a bottom-\nup user adoption and introducing\
    \ a critical approach to technology in the\ndesign, development, dissemination\
    \ of new products, technologies, services\nand experiences in various IoT application\
    \ domains.\nThe expected impact resulting from the combination of ICT and the\
    \ arts\ncan be summarized in few points:\n• Increased user adoption and conﬁdence\
    \ in IoT systems and IoT Large-\nScale Pilots thanks to the consideration of user-centric\
    \ methodologies\nand consumer-citizens assessment while emerged in IoT systems\
    \ and\nexperiences.\n• Boost of socially driven innovation processes in IoT thanks\
    \ to co-\ncreation methodologies and a solid critical approach enabled by artists\n\
    attributing meanings to technologies.\n• Enhanced promptness to innovate and enhanced\
    \ EU ICT competitive-\nness driven by the emerging hybrid ﬁeld of ICT and the\
    \ Arts supported\nby the EU Digital Agenda STARTS initiative.\n• Consolidation\
    \ of an EU IoT Art-Science cluster of practitioners that can\nextend the impact\
    \ of CREATE-IoT beyond its time frame and scope.\n8.8 U4IoT – User Engagement\
    \ for Large Scale Pilots\nin the Internet of Things\nThis chapter presents the\
    \ U4IoT Coordination and Support Action which\naims at supporting end-user engagement\
    \ in the ﬁve European Large-Scale\nPilots. It comprises a short introduction of\
    \ the project objectives followed by\na review of the various strands of work\
    \ aimed at achieving those objectives\nincluding enshrining participants’ right\
    \ to privacy and the protection of their\npersonal data.\n8.8.1 Introduction\n\
    U4IoT will support the Large Scale Pilots (LSPs) funded by the European\nCommission\
    \ in the context of the Horizon 2020 research programme. It will\nenable a citizen-driven\
    \ process by combining multidisciplinary expertise and\ncomplementary mechanisms\
    \ from state-of-the-art European organisations.\nIt will also analyse societal,\
    \ ethical, and ecological issues related to the\npilots in order to develop recommendations\
    \ for tackling IoT adoption barriers\nincluding educational needs and skill-building.\n\
    274\nIoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing\n\
    U4IoT combines a wide range of knowledge and experience from a\nnumber of leading\
    \ European partners in end-user engagement through crowd-\nsourcing, Living Labs,\
    \ co-creative workshops, and meetups designed to\nsupport end-user engagement\
    \ in the Large Scale Pilots. Its strategy is built\non four main sets of activities.\
    \ It will:\n• Develop a toolkit to facilitate the LSPs’ end-user engagement and\
    \ adop-\ntion activities including: online resources and tools for end-user engage-\n\
    ment; privacy-compliant crowdsourcing & crowdsensing tools and\nsurveys to assess\
    \ end-users’ acceptance of the pilots; online resources\nand an innovative game\
    \ that will promote awareness of privacy and per-\nsonal data protection risks\
    \ with guidelines on personal data protection;\n• Support and mobilise: end-user\
    \ engagement through the training and\nsupporting of the LSP teams so that they\
    \ may organise their own co-\ncreative workshops; meetups; training on the use\
    \ of crowdsourcing &\ncrowdsensing tools in an efﬁcient and privacy-friendly way\
    \ in line with\nIoT Lab12 tools; the presentation and facilitation of Living Labs\
    \ support;\nan online pool of experts for end-user engagement; online training\n\
    modules.\n• Analyse societal, ethical, and ecological issues related to the pilots’\n\
    end-users and make recommendations based on the analysis of IoT\nadoption barriers\
    \ and how to tackle them including education and skill-\nbuilding. It will leverage\
    \ on end-user interactions to design participatory\nsustainability models that\
    \ can be replicated across LSPs and future IoT\npilots.\n• Support communication,\
    \ knowledge-sharing, and dissemination includ-\ning: the development of an interactive\
    \ website with an online toolkit as\nwell as online knowledge database on lessons\
    \ learned, FAQs, solutions,\nand end-user feedback. It will support the end-user\
    \ communication and\noutreach strategies for LSPs and will enable information-sharing\
    \ and\nretro-feed towards LSPs and their end-users.\n8.8.2 Engaging End-Users\
    \ throughout the Life of the LSPs\nOne of the key objectives of U4IoT is to support\
    \ and promote end-user\nengagement across the entire lifecycle of the Large Scale\
    \ Pilots from design,\nto implementation, through to assessment. More speciﬁcally,\
    \ the project will\nencourage and support:\n12www.iotlab.eu\n8.8 U4IoT – User\
    \ Engagement for Large Scale Pilots in the Internet of Things\n275\nEnd-user engagement\
    \ in the design phase of the LSPs\nU4IoT will provide methodologies, such as the\
    \ co-creative workshops, that\nwill enable pilots to involve the local end-users\
    \ from the beginning of the\nproject.\nEnd-user engagement in the implementation\
    \ phase of the LSPs\nU4IoT will provide a complete set of tools to actively engage\
    \ end-users in the\ndesign and implementation of the pilots’ products and services.\n\
    End-user engagement in the exploitation and assessment phase\nof the LSPs\nPrivacy-friendly\
    \ crowdsourcing and survey tools will enable the pilots to\nmonitor end-user perception\
    \ and acceptance of their projects during the\nimplementation phase. It will enable\
    \ the pilots to identify issues that need to\nbe addressed so that they may maximise\
    \ end-user acceptance and satisfaction.\nThis comprehensive approach is illustrated\
    \ in Figure 8.24 below.\n8.8.3 Embedding Personal Data Protection by Design\n\
    U4IoT will adopt a privacy-by-design approach. It will comply with the\nnew General\
    \ Data Protection Regulation as well as other complementary\nFigure 8.24\nU4IoT\
    \ overall concept.\n276\nIoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation\
    \ and Testing\ninternational (UN-, ITU-, and OECD-related norms) and European\
    \ standards.\nThese include the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU (arts.\
    \ 7 and 8), the\nTreaty of Lisbon (arts. 16, 39, 88, and 169), Directives 95/46/EC,\
    \ 97/66/EC,\n2002/58/EC, 2002/21/EC, 2009/140/EC, 2009/136/EC, and Regulation(EC)\n\
    N◦45/2001.\nU4IoT not only features expertise in personal data protection, but\
    \ also has\nexperts on gaming methodologies. One intended outcome will be the\
    \ creation\nof a game whose aim is to raise awareness on privacy in connection\
    \ with the\nInternet of Things. This will help to better connect with end-users\
    \ and raise\nawareness of personal data protection issues and challenges they\
    \ will face as\nthe technology achieves greater social penetration.\n8.8.4 Developing\
    \ an Ad Hoc Toolkit for End-User Engagement\nU4IoT is developing a customised\
    \ toolkit for end-user engagement in the\nLarge Scale Pilots, including:\nOnline\
    \ resources for pilots including tools for end-user uptake\nU4IoT will identify,\
    \ gather, and provide relevant tools and online resources\nfor end-user engagement\
    \ including strategic guidelines and steps for user\nengagement and a pool of\
    \ methodologies and tools to be used in different\nstates or steps in product\
    \ and service co-design and co-creation. U4IoT will\nprovide resources supporting\
    \ LSPs in engaging end-users in their pilots. The\nonline resources will be hosted\
    \ on the project website. In addition, U4IoT will\ncompile these resources and\
    \ advice into a practical handbook for the Internet\nof Things pilot deployments.\
    \ The handbook will also be designed to serve\nfuture Internet of Things pilots.\n\
    Crowdsourcing and survey tools\nU4IoT is leveraging and customising the crowdsourcing\
    \ and crowd-\nsensing tool developed by the European research project IoT Lab\n\
    (http://www.iotlab.eu). It enables researchers to collect fully anonymised\ninput\
    \ and feedback from end-users through a smart phone application in order\nto assess,\
    \ ﬁne-tune, and validate end-user acceptance of IoT deployments. It\nis particularly\
    \ well-suited for large-scale IoT deployments.\nGuidelines and an interactive\
    \ game for privacy and personal data\nprotection\nU4IoT will develop a game to\
    \ educate and raise awareness on IoT and\nprivacy issues among the LSPs’ stakeholders\
    \ and their end-users. Our goal\n8.8 U4IoT – User Engagement for Large Scale Pilots\
    \ in the Internet of Things\n277\nis to develop a game that fully integrates some\
    \ basic concepts of privacy\n(mainly online and IoT privacy) into a working and\
    \ enjoyable mechanism\nthrough which understanding such concepts becomes crucial\
    \ to succeeding\nin the game. Different versions of the game will be considered\
    \ and an\ninteractive game will be developed in close collaboration with the partners\
    \ of\nthe project and end-users. The game will highlight key concepts of personal\n\
    data protection such as: a priori informed consent, proﬁling, data processing,\n\
    anonymity, pseudonymity, etc. The game will focus on privacy issues related\n\
    to Smart Cities and the Internet of Things.\nU4IoT website and dissemination\n\
    All presentations, documents, online tools, knowledge database, etc. will\nbe\
    \ made available and maintained on the U4IoT website. Not only will it\ndocument\
    \ the activities of the project, but will also provide tools for interac-\ntion\
    \ with relevant projects and users. The website will be used as a source\nfor\
    \ other promotion and dissemination channels such as social networks,\nwhich will\
    \ complement end-user engagement activities done “out and about”.\nTo this end,\
    \ the “mood of the city” kiosk will be used as a means of attracting\ninterest\
    \ and spreading information about the project and related activities.\nOnline\
    \ knowledge database on lessons learned, solutions, and user\nfeedback\nAnother\
    \ important element of the project is the development of a knowledge\nbase on\
    \ lessons learned, solutions, and user feedback. It will be maintained\nand regularly\
    \ updated in order to capitalise on experiences and lessons\nlearned. At the end\
    \ of the project, the knowledge base and online platform\nwill be formally transferred\
    \ to the IoT Forum who has agreed to maintain it.\n8.8.5 Supporting and Mobilising\
    \ End-User Engagement\nBeyond the development of tools, U4IoT considers that direct\
    \ support to\nthe Large Scale Pilots is required as a complementary measure to\
    \ enable\neffective end-user engagement. A set of support actions and services\
    \ are being\ndeveloped:\nCo-creative workshops\nCo-creative workshops can support\
    \ end-user engagement in the early stages\nof the LSPs by co-designing solutions\
    \ in a multi-stakeholder setting. During\nthe workshop, collective knowledge of\
    \ end-users, local stakeholders, and\n278\nIoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration,\
    \ Experimentation and Testing\nexperts from LSPs is exchanged, combined, and captured.\
    \ The co-creative\nworkshop methodology and toolkit enables experts to empathise\
    \ with the\nneeds of end-users while end-users are empowered to communicate on\
    \ an\nexpert level. The workshop program results in one or more use cases that\
    \ are\nco-created by the participants.\nAnalysing and converting the qualitative\
    \ data gathered throughout the\nworkshop leads to a variety of functional requirements\
    \ that are based on\nend-user needs, however, designing, organising, facilitating,\
    \ analysing, and\nimplementing co-creative workshops in LSPs can be challenging.\
    \ U4IoT\ntherefore aims to offer a co-creative training program to increase end-user\n\
    engagement during the beginning of many LSPs in the IoT-1 call.\nIn this training\
    \ program, experts from different LSPs are invited to learn\nhow to implement\
    \ and utilise co-creative workshops in their projects. Experts\nwill interact\
    \ directly with end-users through the co-creative workshops, ide-\nally increasing\
    \ empathy and leading to more meaningful IoT-related solutions\nthat are based\
    \ on the needs of end-users. More LSPs adopting the co-creative\nworkshop methodology\
    \ will lower the threshold for involving end-users in\nfuture LSPs and improve\
    \ our knowledge on applying this methodology in\ndifferent contexts.\nLiving Labs\
    \ methodology support\nU4IoT will also provide the LSPs with Living Lab methodology\
    \ support.\nHere, the LSPs will get access to guidelines and services online regarding\n\
    how to apply Living Lab methodologies within the LSPs. Through this, the\nLSPs\
    \ get guidelines on how to develop open and user-driven innovation\necosystems\
    \ that support end-user engagement in the IoT pilots from the\nearly phases and\
    \ throughout the whole pilot. In relation to this, U4IoT will\nprovide dedicated\
    \ on-demand advisory support for the LSPs in Living Lab\napproaches. This methodology\
    \ support will mainly be provided as an online\ntool with webinars and online\
    \ supporting services.\nOnline pool of experts for end-user engagement\nThe U4IoT\
    \ online training programme will assist LSPs to set up and deploy\nan effective\
    \ end-user engagement strategy. The components of the pro-\ngramme consist of\
    \ an interactive ﬂow-diagram, e-courses, example materials,\nand an expert pool.\
    \ The online pool will be a list of experts with details of\ntheir speciﬁc expertise.\
    \ The pool will be available online and is part of a front-\ndesk that also contains\
    \ a list of end-user communities for open calls and a list\nof FAQs. The LSPs\
    \ can use the list to contact experts directly for questions\nand answers or for\
    \ custom advise and coaching on end-user engagement.\n8.8 U4IoT – User Engagement\
    \ for Large Scale Pilots in the Internet of Things\n279\n8.8.6 Recommendations\
    \ on IoT Adoption and the Sustainability\nof IoT Pilots\nTackling IoT adoption\
    \ barriers\nU4IoT will start by analysing societal, ethical, and ecological issues\
    \ related\nto the pilots with end-users and develop a set of corresponding recommen-\n\
    dations. This will be achieved by analysing IoT adoption barriers and pro-\nvide\
    \ guidelines for tackling these barriers, including educational needs and\nskill-building.\n\
    Sustainability models for IoT pilots\nU4IoT will design sustainability models\
    \ for the LSPs. These models are\nparticipatory and leverage on end-user interactions\
    \ by involving not only the\nLSPs themselves, but also their various stakeholders\
    \ and target audiences,\nfrom companies to public organisations to citizens. The\
    \ U4IoT sustainability\nmodels will be designed to help the LSPs and their stakeholders,\
    \ but can also\nbe replicated in future IoT pilot deployment throughout Europe.”\n\
    8.8.7 Collaboration, Outreach, and Dissemination\nA key factor of success for\
    \ the project resides in its capacity to outreach\ntowards the relevant stakeholder.\
    \ The collaboration, outreach and dissemina-\ntion strategy is threefold:\nCooperation\
    \ strategy with the LSPs\nU4IoT will work in close interaction with the LSPs and\
    \ will offer its sup-\nport to each LSP consortium from the beginning of the project.\
    \ U4IoT\nwill organise joint meetings and ad hoc training activities for all LSPs.\n\
    In parallel, U4IoT will collaborate closely with the other CSA and the\nEuropean\
    \ Commission.\nCooperation strategy with the IoT Ecosystem and the IoT Forum\n\
    U4IoT will work closely with the IoT ecosystem and will contribute to the\nvisibility\
    \ and outreach of the LSPs. U4IoT will also work closely with the\nIoT Forum (chaired\
    \ by MI), the AIOTI, the IERC, the ITU, and IEEE (more\ndetails in Section 8.2).\n\
    The IoT Forum will play an important role in supporting the interaction\nwith\
    \ the IoT research community, as well as in ensuring a long-term exploita-\ntion\
    \ and maintenance of the U4IoT online tools and platform.\n280\nIoT European Large-Scale\
    \ Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing\nEnd-users outreach, engagement,\
    \ and active involvement\nU4IoT’s main users are the consortia leading the Large\
    \ Scale Pilots imple-\nmentation. The prime focus of U4IoT is to enable active\
    \ participation and\nengagement of ﬁnal end-users in the pilots. Beyond the end-user\
    \ engagement\nmethodologies provided and developed in coordination with the pilots,\
    \ U4IoT\nwill also provide transparent information on its website with resources\
    \ made\navailable to ﬁnal end-users too.\n8.8.8 A Systemic and Cybernetic Approach\
    \ for End-User\nEngagement\nThrough its aforementioned activities, U4IoT is following\
    \ a fully integrated\nand systematic approach. It intends to follow and enable\
    \ a virtuous cycle by\ncollecting and internalising the feedback from the various\
    \ stakeholders. The\nmodel adopted by U4IoT is summarised in Figure 8.25.\nThe\
    \ analytical part is central and enables us to develop the knowledge,\nadapt and\
    \ improve the support, and ﬁne-tune the tools. These elements are\nthen applied\
    \ to the LSPs. The results are then monitored and analysed, closing\nthe loop.\n\
    Figure 8.25\nU4IoT General Methodology.\nReferences\n281\n8.8.9 Discussion\nU4IoT\
    \ stands as the primary support that the LSPs of the IoT-1 call will\nuse to engage\
    \ with their audiences and develop deep connections with their\nend-users. This\
    \ will be achieved largely due to the extensive experience and\nknowledge base\
    \ of the U4IoT partners, which they will provide to the LSPs\nboth ofﬂine and\
    \ online. Continuous support will be provided through our\nonline portal and via\
    \ an expert pool that will cover all the relevant topics and\nissues that the\
    \ LSPs are likely to face in the realm of end-user engagement.\nExpert knowledge\
    \ will be accompanied and underpinned by technical\ntools including state-of-the-art\
    \ crowdsourcing technology, by a robust legal\nframework, and by innovative engagement\
    \ methodologies such as the privacy\ngame and co-creative workshops. All of this\
    \ will be achieved while simulta-\nneously accounting for societal, ethical, and\
    \ ecological considerations.\nReferences\n[1] European Commission: The 2015 ageing\

    \ \nii \n \nAbstract \n \nThe objective of this professional doctorate research\
    \ was to contribute to solving a practice \norientated, real world problem through\
    \ a “research within practice” paradigm of engaged \nscholarship, while also producing\
    \ research contributions in the fields of supply chain \nmanagement and business\
    \ process management. The industrial sector selected was agri-\nfood supply chains,\
    \ critical to providing food and nutrition to an increasing global population,\
    \ \nfacing food security challenges, while itself facing exogeneous threats from\
    \ extreme weather \nevents, pests and diseases, political unrest as well as increasing\
    \ economic, environmental, \nand social sustainability challenges.  \nGuided by\
    \ the overarching research question “how can emerging process centric technologies\
    \ \nassist in solving complex agri-food supply chains?” four phases of research\
    \ were undertaken, \neach with a specific research question. The first phase of\
    \ research focused on the integration \nand interconnectivity of technologies\
    \ such as Industry 4.0 sensors and systems to provide \nmulti perspective supply\
    \ chain insights. The resultant conceptual framework, multi perspective \nsupply\
    \ chain analytics framework, and supporting IT Artifact were evaluated and validated\
    \ on \nan integrated cattle supply chain, providing the foundation for further\
    \ extension of the \nresearch. Influenced by insights obtained in this research,\
    \ which highlighted supply chain risk \nas a complex challenge, the framework\
    \ was extended in the phase 2 research, a digitally \nenabled supply chain risk\
    \ management framework, with the case study across a medium sized \ncattle business\
    \ as well as a banana farm and their respective supply chains. The successful\
    \ \nevaluation and validation of the framework and the increasing capability building\
    \ that was \noccurring in developing integrating process centric technologies,\
    \ led to the phase 3 research \nand the development of the process aware digital\
    \ twin framework for sustainable agri-food \nbusinesses, with naturalistic evaluation\
    \ on the cattle and banana farm and synthetic evaluation \nby several international\
    \ agri-food business managers and functional specialists. The final \nresearch\
    \ phase 4 investigated how a product platform could be architected to support\
    \ Industry \n4.0 technologies for the agri-food supply chain leading to the development\
    \ of an I4.0 platform \narchitecture and artifact. \nAction design research was\
    \ used which is well positioned to address industry challenges while \nfulfilling\
    \ academic contributions. The contributions from this research are categorised\
    \ into \nresearch outcomes and practice outcomes for each phase. Research outcomes\
    \ include the \nmodel-based methodologies for a) integrating and connecting several\
    \ process centric \ntechnologies to provide data-driven insights b) monitoring\
    \ and managing risk c) monitoring \nand managing sustainability outcomes d) an\
    \ I4.0 platform architecture, with design principles, \nall with a focus on agri-food\
    \ supply chains. Practice outcomes include novel applications of \n \n \n \n \n\
    iii \n \nprocess aware digital twins for decision support and the extensive use\
    \ of business process \nmanagement systems to configure and orchestrate applications,\
    \ including process aware \ndigital twins in a rapid, low code manner. In reflecting\
    \ on the research outcomes, including the \nIndustry 4.0 enabled platform architecture,\
    \ the opportunity to combine the methodologies into \na unified Agri-Food Supply\
    \ Chain Control Tower was proposed and would provide further \nresearch opportunities.\
    \ The generalisability of many of the research and practice outcomes to \nthe\
    \ broader supply chain discipline has also been identified. \n \n \n \n \n \n\

    \ the term cattle supply chain is used to \ndescribe the supply chain in which\
    \ cattle are raised, cared for \n(animal husbandry) and transported from breeding\
    \ farms to \nbackgrounding farms, feedlots, and processing plants. As most \n\
    of the research on cattle has focused on the live animal, this \ndefinition was\
    \ selected over the alternative - beef supply chain.  \nConformance Checking \n\
    Existing process models are compared with actual processes, \nfor example by extracting\

    Chapter 1: Introduction \n1.1 Background \n1.1.1 Agri-food supply chains \nAgriculture\
    \ food (agri-food) supply chains consist of all activities from farm to consumers\
    \ (farm \nto fork) (Yadav et al., 2022). An increasing global population requires\
    \ increasing food and \nnutrient availability. The United Nations Sustainability\
    \ Development Goal #2 (UN, 2022), is to \n“End hunger, achieve food security and\
    \ improved nutrition and promote sustainable \nagriculture” by 2030; however food\
    \ security remains a major global concern, with around 2.3 \nbillion people in\
    \ the world moderately or severely food insecure in 2021 and 11.7% of the \nglobal\
    \ population facing food insecurity at severe levels (I. FAO, UNICEF, WFP and\
    \ WHO, \n2022). Food security and food safety, are increasingly becoming matters\
    \ of concern for both \nconsumers as well as wholesalers and retailers (Liu et\
    \ al., 2021), and the agri-food sector \nfaces ongoing exogeneous threats, from\
    \ extreme weather events to pests and disease \noutbreaks, as well as increasing\
    \ economic, environmental, and social sustainability challenges \n(Hamid & Mir,\
    \ 2021), (Zhao et al., 2020), (Pereira et al., 2021). Agri-food supply chains\
    \ are \nalso becoming more complex and therefore more vulnerable to risk due to\
    \ their unique \ncharacteristic of perishability (Zhao et al., 2020). Solutions\
    \ are required for the agri-food \nindustry to improve productivity, profitability,\
    \ and environmental sustainability.  \nThe impact of Covid 19 on global supply\
    \ chains was unprecedented. In many industries supply \nchain managers faced total\
    \ disruption to their businesses, revealing a gap in supply chain \nstrategies\
    \ and solutions for identifying, quantifying, and mitigating supply chain risk\
    \ (Sheffi, \n2020). The food and agriculture sectors were some of the worst impacted,\
    \ especially when \nthe initial wave of lockdowns occurred across the globe (Hamid\
    \ & Mir, 2021). The research \nand practice gaps within the agri-food supply chain\
    \ domain, especially regarding lack of real-\ntime data and integration, was made\
    \ blatantly obvious across the globe during the recent \npandemic. \nConsumers\
    \ want to know where the produce they are purchasing was grown and be assured\
    \ \nthat food safety standards have been adhered to (Moazzam et al., 2018). They\
    \ also want \nassurances that the product that they are purchasing is the genuine\
    \ product as stated on the \nlabel and not a counterfeit or substituted product\
    \ (Frankish et al., 2021). Driven by consumer \ndemand, wholesalers and retailers\
    \ are increasingly placing the responsibility on the suppliers \nof produce to\
    \ prove their compliance, which is adding extra cost on a sector already facing\
    \ \nincreasing input costs such as labor, fertilizer, and logistics. In their\
    \ structured literature review \nof risk in the agri-food supply chain, Zhao et\
    \ al. (2020) revealed a lack of research on risk \ntypes, while Nakandala et al.\
    \ (2017) found research in agri-food supply chain risks is limited \n \n \n \n\
    \ \n2 \n \ncompared to the general supply chain. Similarly, Ali & Gurd (2020)\
    \ established that operational \nrisks significantly reduce the performance of\
    \ these supply chains.  \nAn increasing risk to the agri-food sector is sustainability.\
    \ Agri-food supply chains commonly \nface complex challenges in achieving sustainability\
    \ goals, from “farm to fork” as their \nprocesses interact with ecological and\
    \ socio-economic factors (Dania et al., 2018). Food \nsystems contribute 19% to\
    \ 29% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions with \nagricultural production\
    \ contributing 80% to 86% of these emissions (Vermeulen et al., 2012). \nCui et\
    \ al. (2020) highlighted that agriculture is the largest source of anthropogenic\
    \ emissions \nof methane and the development of “green”, environmentally friendly,\
    \ and sustainable agri-\nfood supply chains is critical. Increasingly, consumers\
    \ are becoming more concerned about \nagri-food environmental and sustainability\
    \ issues which is driving adoption of sustainability \npractices (S. Kumar et\
    \ al., 2021).  The potential use of data and process analytics- especially \n\
    for risk mitigation of agri-food supply chains, is still very much in its infancy.\
    \   But an area, this \nthesis argues, that has immense potential to enable us\
    \ to address the “wicked’” problem of \nfood supply – especially in volatile contexts.\
    \  \n1.1.2 Agri-food supply chains: current technical solutions and capabilities\
    \ \nSmart farming can only be achieved if it is supported by reliable data and\
    \ the automation of \nmonitoring and controlling activities (Faid et al., 2022).\
    \ These technologies require new \nplatform architectures with functionality that\
    \ includes the ability to ingest significant quantities \nof streaming data including\
    \ image and video data, integration with third party systems, and \nthe ability\
    \ to transform data from various sources into actionable insights through decision\
    \ \nmodels and algorithms (Antunes et al., 2021). They also require the ability\
    \ to rapidly configure \nuser interfaces as new technologies are introduced which\
    \ lead to new insights, reporting, and \nvisualisation requirements. Traditional\
    \ platforms for managing farming operations and \ntransactions do not have these\
    \ functionalities but are essential to running the businesses. \nApproximately\
    \ 75% of farm management systems are still personal computer based and do \nnot\
    \ have the ability to support automatic data acquisition, monitoring, and control\
    \ (Fountas et \nal., 2015). Most solutions are siloed into a single class and\
    \ only a few have been integrated \nfor continuum across a process-management\
    \ lifecycle. \n“Industry 4.0 deploys the tools provided by the advancements in\
    \ operational, communication, \nand information technology to increase the levels\
    \ of automation and digitization of production, \nin manufacturing and industrial\
    \ processes, with the goal being to manage the entire value \nchain process” (Gilchrist,\
    \ 2016). Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies are leading the ubiquitous \nconnectivity\
    \ of intelligent sensor-equipped objects (Ahmed et al., 2017). The adoption of\
    \ \nIndustry 4.0 principles and methodologies in the horticulture sector has been\
    \ slow Nakandala \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \net al. (2017), however significant opportunities\
    \ have been recognized. As connectivity further \nimproves with the roll out of\
    \ 5G cellular network, as well as low orbit satellite communication, \nthis will\
    \ continue to evolve at an accelerated pace. Together with advancements in sensor\
    \ \ntechnology, robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML),\
    \ there will be hardly \nany business processes not impacted by this digital disruption.\
    \ I4.0 brings together a series of \ntechnological advances such as Internet of\
    \ Things (IoT), digital twins, blockchain, and cloud \ncomputing (Viriyasitavat\
    \ et al., 2018). \nThe platforms required to integrate I4.0 technologies both\
    \ within businesses as well as across \nthe supply chain are evolving at a slower\
    \ pace. The platform requirements are complex, \nrequiring high flexibility in\
    \ volume of data as well as type of data ingestion, for example with \nincreasing\
    \ requirements for high frequency of time series data from sensors. The platforms\
    \ \nalso require rapidly configurable user interfaces as new I4.0 technologies\
    \ bring insights which \ncannot be communicated via traditional interfaces (Antunes\
    \ et al., 2021).  \nThere is a gap in the information systems available to the\
    \ agri-food supply chain sector \n(Fountas et al., 2015), (Faid et al., 2022),\
    \ and to leverage I4.0 technologies to become data \ndriven, and more productive\
    \ while reducing the environmental impact (Villa-Henriksen et al., \n2020). This\
    \ gap in process centric technologies capable of integrating data across the agri-\n\
    food supply chain as well as orchestrating and executing the required analytics\
    \ is a core focus \nof this research.  \n1.1.3 Advances in process centric technologies\
    \ applicable to the agri-food supply \nchains \nAutomated business process systems\
    \ that exploit knowledge about how different activities \nrelate to one another\
    \ are known as process aware information systems (PAIS). A business \nprocess\
    \ management system (BPMS) is a type of PAIS that has the ability to a) execute\
    \ a \nbusiness process, b) distribute work to process participants c) automatically\
    \ retrieve and store \ndata for the execution of processes or delegate automated\
    \ activities to software applications \n(Dumas et al., 2018). Existing business\
    \ process management tools and techniques are \nnumerous and continue to grow.\
    \ Process mining techniques are proliferating with new \napproaches to support\
    \ process discovery, conformance, and enhancement. Across these \nthree classes\
    \ of systems there has been a proliferation of solutions developed, both from\
    \ an \nacademic as well as a commercial base (Van der Aalst, 2013). Process mining\
    \ focuses on \nextracting knowledge from event logs of real processes, the event\
    \ logs that contain the exact \nsteps that the system underwent to complete a\
    \ task, and errors in an Industry 4.0 system can \nbe detected by analysing these\
    \ logs  (Singh et al., 2022). \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \nThere is also increasing use\
    \ of sensor-based tracking of components and products to mitigate \nrisks which\
    \ generates further platform requirements for integration with third party systems\
    \ \nand processing of significant quantities of time series data, often with the\
    \ requirement to \norchestrate this data through advanced analytical algorithms\
    \ for generating actionable insights \n(Ivanov & Dolgui, 2019). Industry 4.0 practices\
    \ applied to agri-food supply chains have shifted \nthe linear focus to circular\
    \ economy thinking by improving end to end connectivity, \ntransparency, and flexibility\
    \ (Abdul-Hamid et al., 2021).  \nIvanov & Dolgui, (2020) explored the ripple effect\
    \ of supply chain disruptions, noting that \nsupply chain risk can be mitigated\
    \ using advanced track and trace systems leading to real \ntime activation of\
    \ contingency policies (Ivanov & Dolgui, 2020). They posit that a combination\
    \ \nof simulation, optimization and data analytics will constitute the supply\
    \ chain digital twin of the \nfuture. Marmolejo-Saucedo (2020), reinforces the\
    \ increasing difficulty in controlling the \nvisibility of a product through the\
    \ supply chain, noting that each stage of the supply chain \nplans, executes,\
    \ and corrects its operation based on the awareness they have at their stage,\
    \ \nsuggesting that the use of digital twins in supply chain management could\
    \ well address the \ncurrent challenges (Marmolejo-Saucedo, 2020).  \n1.2 Research\
    \ Questions \nFollowing a deep and ongoing engagement with agri-food practitioners\
    \ detailed in the chapters \n3 onwards the following research questions were posed:\
    \  \nOverarching research question:  \n“How can emerging process centric technologies\
    \ assist in solving complex agri-food \nsupply chain challenges?” \nRQ1: How can\
    \ we leverage emerging process centric technologies to enhance the integration\
    \ \nand interconnectivity of agri-food supply chains? \nRQ2:   How can agri-food\
    \ supply chain risk be monitored and managed using emerging \nprocess centric\
    \ technologies? \nRQ3:  How can emerging process centric technologies enable the\
    \ achievement of \nsustainability development goals within agri-food supply chains?\
    \  \n1.3 Research Program and Candidate Profile \nThis study’s motivation, applied\
    \ focus, and unique access to real-time rich data has been \ninfluenced by the\
    \ candidate’s background and the nature of the study program. Further details\
    \ \nare provided below. \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \n1.3.1 Professional Doctorate program\
    \ – Queensland University of Technology \nThe research program is a Professional\
    \ Doctorate, which is a Doctor of Information \nTechnology, orientated towards\
    \ working professionals. It allows professionals with significant \nexperience\
    \ in their field to return to study for career development and to make a significant\
    \ \ncontribution to their profession. The degree gives flexibility to work on\
    \ projects that are \nmeaningful and practical to the researcher, industry, government,\
    \ or society in general. It is a \nresearch degree through work-based learning.\
    \ The degree is orientated towards the \nenhancement of professional practice\
    \ and designed to focus on applied investigation and \nproblem solving. \nThe\
    \ candidate has undertaken this research part-time over a six-year period while\
    \ in full-time \nemployment. During this period, he has also conducted projects\
    \ for agri-food customers. \nThere has been a clear demarcation between the commercial\
    \ projects and the research during \nthis period. Permission was explicitly obtained\
    \ for collecting data, including sensor data, \ninterviews, and survey data for\
    \ research purposes, and used only for these purposes. While \ndata from sensors\
    \ was obtained, with permission, from the commercial projects, the \nprocessing\
    \ of data occurred independent of the commercial projects on a completely different\
    \ \nplatform, configured in the research setting. The work presented in this thesis\
    \ is the \ncandidate’s own research contribution.  Any third-party support, for\
    \ example programming \nsupport, has been acknowledged in the relevant sections.\
    \ While the candidate has conducted \nthis research within the industrial setting\
    \ of the agri-food industry, the research has been \nconducted outside of the\
    \ candidate’s employment hours as independent, part time research. \n1.3.2 Candidate\
    \ Profile \nThe candidate commenced his career as a process and production engineer\
    \ in the pulp and \npaper industry including commissioning a new factory with\
    \ innovative recycling technologies. \nA consulting career in business process\
    \ improvement followed, with the candidate becoming \na subject matter expert\
    \ in supply chain best practice, a founding member, and later chairman, \nof the\
    \ Supply Chain Council’s Australian-New Zealand chapter, and also a global trainer\
    \ for \nthe council training hundreds of practitioners in using the SCOR (Supply\
    \ Chain Operations \nReference) model, as well as developing SCORWizard, a digitized\
    \ version of the SCOR \nmodel. \nCurrently, as Senior Director for a multinational\
    \ technology company, the candidate is \nresponsible for supply chain management\
    \ thought leadership as well as agri-food supply \nchains programs globally. He\
    \ has led the development of innovative supply chain solutions \nincluding several\
    \ projects for Meat and Livestock Australia and Hort Innovation, as well as \n\
    \ \n \n \n \n6 \n \nbusiness transformation programs for multi-national corporates\
    \ in the food and beverage \nsector.  \n1.4 Research Approach  \nThe motivation\
    \ for this research stemmed from the researcher’s personal interest in business\
    \ \nprocess management systems and agri-food supply chain management, his awareness\
    \ of \nchallenges facing the sector, and a belief that an applied study in this\
    \ field can lead to an \nenhancement of professional practice, while also contributing\
    \ to the research domains of \nbusiness process management and supply chain management.\
    \ \nThe overall study consisted of 4 phases (see Figure 1 below). The research\
    \ methodology \ncommenced with Design Science Research in phase 1 evolving to\
    \ Action Design Research \n(ADR) in the remaining phases as the benefits of integrating\
    \ review and evaluation cycles with \niterative framework and artifact development\
    \ cycles were realised. ADR was driven by a \n‘research with practice’ paradigm\
    \ of engaged scholarship (Rai, 2019), which encompassed in-\ndepth engagement\
    \ with industry throughout the study; to build and validate the artifacts \niteratively.\
    \ ADR is well positioned to address industry challenges, while fulfilling academic\
    \ \ncontributions (Sein et al., 2011). Sein et al.’s (2011) recommended ADR design\
    \ was adapted, \nand further complemented with Venable et al. (2016)’s FEDS (Framework\
    \ for Evaluation in \nDesign Science) guidelines. \nPhase 1 established the foundational\
    \ framework - Multi Perspective Supply Chain Analytics \nframework, which was\
    \ subsequently expanded in phases 2 and 3 for the different use cases, \nnamely\
    \ risk, (Digitally enabled Supply Chain Risk Management framework, detailed in\
    \ Chapter \n5) and sustainability (Process Aware Digital Twin – Sustainable Agri-Food,\
    \ detailed in Chapter \n6). Phase 4 brings together the secondary contributions\
    \ in relation to the development of an \nIT artifact that enabled the realisation\
    \ of the framework(s) from the first three phases and \nextends these to an overall\
    \ contribution for Industry 4.0 enabled data platforms that can be \nused for\
    \ multi-perspective multi-purposes. Each phase had three steps: (i) problem \n\
    formulation, (ii) conceptual framework development and artifact development and\
    \ (iii) research \noutcomes. Figure 1 below provides a detailed visual elaboration.\
    \ \n \n \n \n \n7 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8 \n \n \nFigure 1: Overall\
    \ Thesis Approach \nEach phase utilized case studies to support the research design\
    \ and the evaluation of the \nstudy outcomes. The case study for Phase 1 was a\
    \ large integrated cattle and beef business \nin Australia with 20 farms, three\
    \ feedlots, a processing facility, and a herd of approximately \n250 000 animals.\
    \ This case study included the operations from backgrounding farms to \nprocessing\
    \ plant. For Phase 2, the two case studies were a medium sized, family-owned cattle\
    \ \nfarm, in Gladstone, Queensland, where the business also run a cattle transport\
    \ operation, and \n \n \n \n \n9 \n \na family-owned banana farm supplying bananas\
    \ from Innisfail, Northern Queensland to \nBrisbane (1600km), Sydney (2500km)\
    \ and Adelaide (3000km) via multi modal transport. The \nfocus in phase 2 was\
    \ on the outbound supply chain from these respective farms, while in \nPhase 3,\
    \ the farming operations of the cattle farm and banana farm described in Phase\
    \ 2 were \nthe focus. In Phase 4 the extensive dataset from Phase 1, additional\
    \ tracking data from the \nbanana farm equipment, and the banana farm operational\
    \ data were used to evaluate the \nproposed IT Artifact designed for process orchestration\
    \ and analysis of the agri-food supply \nchains.  \nIn addition to the data and\
    \ expert advice gained from these case studies, additional data were \nobtained\
    \ via structured interviews and surveys from a range of subject matter experts\
    \ in \nvarious functional roles from farming, supply chain management, agronomy,\
    \ environmental \nscience, agri-food operations, and advisors from the agri-food\
    \ industry, including horticulture \nbusinesses, industry peak bodies and government\
    \ agencies. The details of these participants \nand their contributions have been\
    \ documented in Chapters 4 to 7 and more details of the \noverall study approach\
    \ and methodology are presented in Chapter 3. \n \n1.5 Research Contributions\
    \ \n1.5.1 Research Contribution 1 \nDesign of a conceptual framework integrating\
    \ and connecting several process centric \ntechnologies to provide data-driven\
    \ insights for improving agri-food supply chain \nperformance.  \nThe resulting\
    \ multi-perspective supply chain analytics framework was implemented and \nevaluated\
    \ using a combination of open-source technology solutions such as process \norchestration,\
    \ process discovery, compliance checking, data analytics and simplified \nsimulation\
    \ of a “digital cow”. Significant supply chain insights were obtained when the\
    \ \nframework and combined IT Artifacts were applied to the case study. The research\
    \ findings \nare presented in Chapter 4.  \nThe primary research contribution\
    \ is the novel application of integrated process technologies \nto extract insights\
    \ from complex agri-food supply chains. From the practice perspective, multi-\n\
    perspective analytics from individual animal data provide insights on how to optimize\
    \ the cattle \nsupply chain to optimize profitability.  \n \n \n \n \n \n10 \n\
    \ \n1.5.2 Research Contribution 2 \nConfiguration of an Industry 4.0 enabled platform\
    \ to support advanced applications \nwithin the agri-food supply chain.  \nThe\
    \ primary research contribution is the novel use of a model driven architecture\
    \ to configure \na software platform, enabled by a BPMS and powered by technologies\
    \ such as process \norchestration and process mining to delegate automated activities\
    \ to software applications. \nSeveral design principles for the platform have\
    \ been proposed to increase the generalizability \nof the proposed platform. The\
    \ research findings are presented in Chapter 7.  \nFrom the inception of the research\
    \ the development of this IT Artifact was planned to be a \nsecondary contribution\
    \ in each phase of the research. The IT Artifact was identified as \nessential\
    \ for the research participants to evaluate the methodological frameworks. However,\
    \ \nthe learnings from participant feedback and reflection on the future research\
    \ pathways led the \nresearcher to conclude that the supporting technology was\
    \ a much more significant \ncomponent of the overall research. This realization\
    \ led to the methodological frameworks of \nphases 2 and 3 designed with execution\
    \ via the IT Artifact, being considered as “action and \ndesign orientated design\
    \ principles” (Chandra Kruse et al., 2019).  \nThe novel contribution is the model\
    \ driven architecture, leveraging business process \nmanagement systems to rapidly\
    \ orchestrate configuration to enable customization for different \napplications.\
    \ \n1.5.3 Research Contribution 3 \nA conceptual framework for monitoring and\
    \ managing risk in agri-food supply chains.  \nThis framework, the Digitally enabled\
    \ Supply Chain Risk Management (DSCRM) framework, \nis an extension of the supply\
    \ chain analytics framework mentioned as research contribution 1. \nThe digital\
    \ supply chain management framework enables the monitoring and management of \n\
    agri-food supply chain risk through the novel application of process technologies\
    \ to semi-\nautonomously monitor event data and compliance check against a process\
    \ digital twin. From \na practice perspective the novel deployment of BPMS to\
    \ orchestrate the collection of data \nfrom Industry 4.0 systems and manage the\
    \ process analytic solution provides a rapidly \nconfigurable risk monitoring\
    \ and management system. Several design principles for the \nframework have also\
    \ been presented. The research findings are presented in Chapter 5. \nA generalizable,\
    \ supply chain domain, novel contribution is the combination of a process \naware\
    \ digital twin with a business process management system to rapidly configure\
    \ semi-\nautonomous, domain specific supply chain risk management solutions. \n\
    \ \n \n \n \n11 \n \n1.5.4 Research Contribution 4 \nA conceptual framework for\
    \ the monitoring, simulation, and management of \nsustainability outcomes for\
    \ agri-food businesses.  \nThis framework, Process Aware Digital Twin for Sustainable\
    \ Agri-Food, is an extension of the \nsupply chain analytics framework and is\
    \ an extensible, hierarchical, sustainability framework, \nconfigurable at farm\
    \ and country level, for global deployment by multi-national companies to \nenable\
    \ the semiautonomous monitoring and management of sustainability outcomes. The\
    \ \nframework, supported by the IT Artifact, (see 1.5.2) has extended the use\
    \ of process aware \ndigital twins which are managed through the BPMS allowing\
    \ for the dynamic workflows of new \nIndustry 4.0 technologies such as continuous\
    \ environment monitoring sensors to be rapidly \nintegrated and configured. From\
    \ a practice perspective the extended framework which is \ndesigned to be implemented\
    \ via a “low code” BPMS provides an accelerated pathway to \nmonitoring and managing\
    \ environmental outcomes in the agri-food supply chain. Several \ndesign principles\
    \ have been provided for both the framework and required platform. The \nresearch\
    \ findings are presented in Chapter 6.  \nA generalizable, novel contribution\
    \ is the process for configuring and applying process aware \ndigital twins to\
    \ semi autonomously monitor and manage sustainability outcomes in agri-food \n\
    supply chains. \nThe “research within practice” aspect of this engaged scholarship\
    \ enabled the researcher to \nextensively engage with the case study participants\
    \ which together with the researcher’s \ndomain expertise enabled a further level\
    \ of reflection as to the underpinning contributing \nfactors that have contributed\
    \ to the development of the above contributions. These \ncontributing factors\
    \ have been explained in the discussion sessions of chapters 4, 5, 6 and 7. \n\
    1.6 IT Artifact Development \n \nThe IT Artifacts that have been configured to\
    \ assess the frameworks of each phase of the \nresearch use various third-party\
    \ solutions, which are attributed in each chapter. In Phase 1, \n(Chapter 4),\
    \ process mining and conformance checking was conducted with ProM (ProM, \n2019)\
    \ and the Inductive Visual Miner Plug In via ProM (Leemans et al., 2018) under\
    \ GNU \nPublic Licence (GPL) open source licence and Lesser GNU Public Licence\
    \ (L-GPL) open \nsource licence as well as Microsoft Power BI (Microsoft, 2019).\
    \ The researcher conducted all \naspects of this research, with the exception\
    \ of third-party support in the configuration of Power \nBI, for the Data Perspective.\
    \  \n \n \n \n \n12 \n \nFor Phases 2, 3 and 4 the researcher adapted the HPIM\
    \ ( Hitachi Process Intelligence – \nManufacturing) solution. HPIM is a trial\
    \ solution developed by the researcher’s employer \nHitachi Vantara. The trial\
    \ solution has Camunda embedded (Camunda, 2019) as well as ProM \n(ProM, 2019)\
    \ and the Inductive Visual Miner Plug In via ProM (Leemans et al., 2018) under\
    \ \nGNU Public Licence (GPL) open source licence and Lesser GNU Public Licence\
    \ (L-GPL) open \nsource licence as well as further permission from Dr Sander Leemans.\
    \ In configuring the HPIM \nsolution to implement the various frameworks in this\
    \ research, the researcher designed and \nconfigured all processes and executed\
    \ the various process mining and conformance checking \nalgorithms. The researcher\
    \ obtained external support for the configuration of tasks requiring \nJava or\
    \ JavaScript such as the configuration of API’s as well as the configuration of\
    \ new \ninterfaces. \n \n1.7 Chapter Outline \nThe chapters of this thesis are\
    \ laid out as follows: Chapter 2 presents the literature review with \na focus\
    \ on the two core areas: agri-food supply chains and process centric technologies.\
    \ \nChapter 3 discusses the research methodology in depth, and details the phases\
    \ of research, \nthe case studies used in each phase, as well as the participants\
    \ and the sources of data. \nChapters 4 to 7 covers the four phases of the research.\
    \ Chapter 4 covers Phase 1, the process \ncentric integration research, examining\
    \ RQ1. Chapter 5 covers Phase 2, monitoring and \nmanaging risk, examining RQ2.\
    \ Chapter 6 covers Phase 3, monitoring and managing \nsustainability, examining\
    \ RQ3 while Chapter 7, covers Phase 4, designing an I4.0 enabled \nplatform, covering\
    \ RQ4 as well as the overall objectives of RQ1. In Chapter 8, discussion and \n\
    conclusions are presented together with research limitations and future work.\
    \ The Appendix \ncontains supplementary material from the evaluation process as\
    \ well as publications not \nincluded in the main body of the thesis. \n \n \n\
    \ \n \n \n \n13 \n \nChapter 2: Literature Review \n2.1 Introduction \nThis chapter\
    \ summarizes relevant research in the domains of agri-food supply chains, cattle,\
    \ \nbanana and horticulture supply chains, business process management, process\
    \ intelligence, \nIndustry 4.0 technologies relevant to the agri-food industry,\
    \ risk management, sustainability, \ndata platforms and the emerging field of\
    \ process aware digital twins. It also summarizes \nindustry practice challenges\
    \ and research gaps in these domains.  \n2.2 Agri-food supply chains \nAs discussed\
    \ in Chapter 1, agri-food supply chains were chosen for this research due to a)\
    \ \nthe access that the researcher had to the industry, b) the strategic importance\
    \ of efficient agri-\nfood supply chains to achieving several of the United Nations\
    \ Sustainability Development \nGoals (UN, 2022) c) the increasing supply chain\
    \ risks that the sector faces (Hamid & Mir, \n2021); (Pereira et al., 2021) (Zhao\
    \ et al., 2020) including increasing consumer demand for \ngreater transparency\
    \ of provenance, food security, and food safety (Liu et al., 2021). Agri-food\
    \ \nsupply chains cover the end-to-end process from raising or cultivating a product\
    \ through to \nthe product in the consumer’s hand (commonly referred to as “farm\
    \ to fork”) (Yadav et al., \n2022). Agri-food supply chains are also becoming\
    \ more complex (Zhao et al., 2020); they are \nalso becoming more integrated,\
    \ for example, feed supplements for cattle from grain supply \nchains and red\
    \ seaweed, asparagopsis taxiformis, for methane mitigation (Ridoutt et al., 2022)\
    \ \nextending all the way from marine farms to remote cattle farms. Consumer demand\
    \ is also \ncreating more complexity; for example, in an Australian supermarket\
    \ a new banana product is \nbeing offered, a smaller sized banana designed for\
    \ children’s school lunch (Coles, 2022), \ncreating the requirement for banana\
    \ farms to establish new supply chains. Such agri-food \nproduct innovation will\
    \ continue requiring farmers and agri-food businesses to ensure their \nsupply\
    \ chains are responsive, agile, secure, profitable, and sustainable.  \n2.3 Agri-food\
    \ supply chains of interest \nThe cattle and banana agri-food supply chains were\
    \ selected as case studies for this research \nas they are globally key food supply\
    \ chains (Smith et al., 2022), (Jedermann et al., 2014). With \nbeef a key global\
    \ food source, as explained in Section 2.3.1 below, cattle being responsible \n\
    for 15% of global annual anthropogenic methane emissions (Gerber et al., 2013),\
    \ as detailed \nin Section 2.4.3, and 94% of Australian banana production mostly\
    \ centred around the \nCassowary Coast region which falls into the UNESCO (UNESCO,\
    \ 2023) listed Great Barrier \nReef catchment area, these agri-food supply chains\
    \ are also facing several challenges. While \nAustralian bananas are grown only\
    \ for domestic consumption, bananas are the world’s most \nexported fresh fruit\
    \ both in terms of volume and value (Kema & Drenth, 2018). The operational \n\
    \ \n \n \n \n14 \n \nand environmental challenges faced by banana farmers are\
    \ like those faced by other \nhorticulture farmers globally who apply fertilisers\
    \ and chemicals for product quality and \nproductivity purposes and are required\
    \ to carefully monitor run off, soil quality and impacts on \nthe surrounding\
    \ ecosystems, especially when they are near environmentally sensitive areas \n\
    such as wetlands and rivers. Each horticulture product is also perishable. with\
    \ some products \nsuch as bananas requiring transport in temperature-controlled\
    \ vehicles or containers. The goal \nof horticulture businesses is to ensure a\
    \ quality product is delivered to their customers at the \nright time and price\
    \ and that post-harvest losses are minimised (Aung & Chang, 2014).  \n2.3.1 Cattle\
    \ Supply Chains \nLivestock production in Australia represents 51% of total agriculture\
    \ farm gate value (A$67 \nbillion 2019-2020), with cattle and calves comprising\
    \ 20% (ABARES, 2021).With little \nintegration across Australian cattle and beef\
    \ supply chains, the cost of meat production is \nsignificantly higher than in\
    \ many competitor countries which impacts export growth (Australian \nMeat Processor\
    \ Corporation, 2016). There is also a significant gap in profitability between\
    \ \ncattle farming businesses, for example in Northern Australia the gap between\
    \ the top 25% of \ncattle farming businesses and the rest represents double the\
    \ profitability per animal, with \nfarming practices being one of the root causes\
    \ for the difference (McLean et al., 2020). The \nchallenges experienced by Australian\
    \ cattle farmers are not unique and are faced by cattle \nfarmers globally.  \n\
    Of the total meat mass available as food in 2018 (approximately 333 million tons),\
    \ 23% was \nruminant meat. Meat provides 11% of global food energy availability,\
    \ 29% of dietary fat and \n21% of protein (Smith et al., 2022). These agri-food\
    \ supply chains are also vulnerable to \nexogenous risk, as observed during the\
    \ Covid pandemic with lack of labor impacting the \nhorticulture supply chain\
    \ from planting and harvesting to processing (Hamid & Mir, 2021). Beef \nprocessing\
    \ declined significantly with a 34.8% reduction in April 2020, year over year\
    \ in the \nUnited States, due to Covid related shutdowns (Peel, 2021). Literature\
    \ on cattle supply chain \nrisk factors indicates that supply management risks\
    \ also occur; for example cattle experience \nstress when transported between\
    \ farms and from farms to processing plants (Ferguson & \nWarner, 2008). Cattle\
    \ are exposed to several conditions during transport; increased handling \nand\
    \ human contact, confined space during transport, change in social structure,\
    \ changes in \nclimatic conditions and deprivation of food and water. While the\
    \ inter farm movements may \nlead to loss of condition and weight, requiring extra\
    \ grazing time to recover, the transport to \nprocessing plants leads to a loss\
    \ in meat quality (Jorquera-Chavez et al., 2019).  \n \n \n \n \n15 \n \n2.3.2\
    \ Banana Supply Chains \nAustralian horticulture production represented 18% of\
    \ total agriculture farm gate value in 2019-\n2020 ($15.1 billion), (ABARES, 2021).\
    \ Banana production was 381 676 tons with a wholesale \nvalue of $722 million\
    \ (HIA, 2021). Horticulture supply chains are more difficult to manage than \n\
    most supply chains since the produce is often both time and temperature sensitive.\
    \ In Australia \nhorticulture is the fastest growing agricultural sector with\
    \ production value increasing 27 \npercent over five years to 2020 (HIA, 2021).\
    \ Horticulture also represents 20% of the total \nagriculture production value\
    \ in Australia, making it the third largest agriculture sector (HIA, \n2021).\
    \ Post-harvest losses in horticulture crops are as high as 50% due to poor handling\
    \ and \ntemperature management (Aung & Chang, 2014). Bananas are purchased by\
    \ 96% of \nAustralian households with a per capita consumption of 16kg (ABGC,\
    \ 2022); however the \ncosts of inputs has increased significantly with chemicals\
    \ and fertilizers increasing 180% and \n120% respectively, and freight costs from\
    \ the major growing region increasing 27%, in the \n2021 to 2022 period (Pekin,\
    \ 2022). Bananas are traded in high volumes globally, and quality \nlosses while\
    \ low, represent significant economic opportunity for further reduction (Jedermann\
    \ \net al., 2014). \n2.4 Agri-Food Supply Chain Challenges \n2.4.1 Interoperability\
    \ \nSupply chain interoperability is important in improving the coordination of\
    \ the supply chain. \nThis requires effective sharing of information between food\
    \ regulatory bodies, suppliers, food \nprocessing organizations and farms (Yadav\
    \ et al., 2022), (Sheffi, 2020). Examples of the \ninteroperability challenges\
    \ are presented below for cattle and banana farms. Integration of the \ndata between\
    \ the various subsystems as well as from sensors is a key enabler to ensuring\
    \ \ninteroperability across the supply chain (Erboz et al., 2022), (Núñez-Merino\
    \ et al., 2022). \n2.4.1.1 Interoperability – cattle supply chains \nThe cattle\
    \ and beef supply chain consists of many breeding farms, backgrounding farms,\
    \ \nfeedlots, and often processing plants as illustrated in Figure 2. \n \n \n\
    \ \n \n \n16 \n \n \nFigure 2: Example of an integrated cattle and beef supply\
    \ chain \nAcross the supply chain, several business processes and practices are\
    \ required to manage a \ncattle business and numerous data driven decisions to\
    \ be made daily as illustrated in Table 1 \nand Figure 3. Meat and Livestock Australia\
    \ provide a repository of research and best practices \nfor cattle farmers seeking\
    \ to improve productivity (MLA, 2022b). In Chapter 4, these decisions \nwill be\
    \ configured into several use cases that will define the outcomes of the methodology.\
    \ \n \nRef to Fig 3 \n                  Decision Required \n1 \nHow many cattle\
    \ and species to stock on breeding properties to meet \nprojected future market\
    \ demand? \n2 \nHow many cattle and species to stock on backgrounding properties\
    \ \nto meet projected future market demand? \n3 \nHow many cattle to have on feedlots\
    \ and duration of grain feeding to \nmeet projected future market demand? \n4,5\
    \ \nHow many cattle in each paddock and duration in each paddock? \n6,7 \nIs supplementary\
    \ feed required? \n8 \nWill the weather change the date when the cattle should\
    \ be moved? \n9,10,11 When should cattle be moved? \n12 \nAre adjustments to management\
    \ practices required based on the \nmeat quality achieved? \nTable 1: Key decisions\
    \ required in managing a cattle supply chain. \n \n \n \n \n17 \n \n \n \nFigure\
    \ 3: Mapping decisions to the cattle and beef supply chain \nThere are often several\
    \ breeding and backgrounding farms as well as feedlots and processing \nplants,\
    \ with complex decisions having to be made on when to move animals from one part\
    \ of \nthe supply chain to the next. Even within a farm there are many processes\
    \ involved in \ndetermining which paddocks should be grazed, and for how long,\
    \ as well as which paddocks \nshould be rested or “spelled”. Current and forecasted\
    \ weather conditions, current and \npredicted availability of water and market\
    \ demand are all factors that are regularly analysed \nby farmers, and meat and\
    \ livestock business owners.  \n2.4.1.2 Interoperability banana supply chains\
    \ \nThe harvesting of bananas is closely coupled with customer demand. Once customer\
    \ \nrequirements are received a harvesting plan is developed with the collaboration\
    \ of logistics \nproviders who need to ensure that all phases of the supply chain\
    \ have been arranged. For \nmost of the Australian banana production this will\
    \ include coordination of vehicles that can \ntransport refrigerated containers\
    \ to the rail station where the containers are placed on train \ncarriages, all\
    \ the way through to vehicles arranged to collect the containers and transport\
    \ them \nto a specialized cooling and ripening room in a distribution centre,\
    \ as illustrated in Figure 4 \nbelow. Bananas are required to be transported to\
    \ retailers at a temperature of between 13C \nand 15C and require a minimum of\
    \ six days at this temperature for ripening (ABGC, 2015).  \n \n \n \n \n18 \n\
    \ \n \nFigure 4: Banana supply chain interoperability requirements \nSince banana\
    \ farmers have limited on farm cooling facilities, any disruption to the outbound\
    \ \nsupply chain has an impact on harvesting plan, as once the bananas are harvested,\
    \ they need \nto be prepared, sorted, and packed in temperature-controlled storage\
    \ as soon as possible.  \nIn addition to the interoperability challenges of coordinating\
    \ the supply chain, quality \nmanagement is a critical factor requiring effective\
    \ data sharing across the supply chain. Quality \ndeterioration in bananas is\
    \ progressive across the supply chain resulting in reduced quality at \nthe retail\
    \ stores. Wastage levels in Australia range from 5% to 8% of gross volume, (AU$46-\n\
    73million pa), which is higher than comparative international markets which are\
    \ less than 2%, \n(Indika et al., 2019; Kitchener, 2015).  \n2.4.2 Risk Management\
    \ \nRisk management consists of three dimensions 1) likelihood of occurrence 2)\
    \ outcome \nconsequences 3) causal pathways (Ritchie & Brindley, 2007). Supply\
    \ chain risk management \nentails managing risk that can hinder supply chain performance\
    \ (Bandaly et al., 2012). Risk \nmanagement is regarded as one of the top ten\
    \ emerging trends in supply chain management \nwith the focus switching from ‘reacting’\
    \ to ‘anticipating’ (Cooke, 2014). There are four steps to \nrisk handling: risk\
    \ classification, risk identification, risk calculation, and implementation of\
    \ \nmitigating actions (Diabat et al., 2012). (Trkman & McCormack, 2009) classify\
    \ exogenous \nsupply chain uncertainty into two areas: continuous risk and discrete\
    \ events. Continuous \nevents such as raw materials price increases are easier\
    \ to predict and mitigate, while discrete \nevents, for example, the spread of\
    \ disease or natural disasters are more difficult to predict and \ncan have significant\
    \ consequences. The main risk to agri-food supply chains is agri-food \nsafety,\
    \ and consequences can be significant, especially with perishable food products\
    \ where \nrecalls are not only costly but also damaging to a business’s reputation\
    \ (Moazzam et al., \n2018). In their structured literature review of risk analysis\
    \ of the agri-food supply chain, (Zhao \net al., 2020), highlight that agri-food\
    \ supply chains are becoming more complex and therefore \nmore vulnerable to risk\
    \ due to their unique characteristic of perishability. The review revealed \n\
    a lack of research on agri-food supply chain risk as well as the correlation between\
    \ several \n \n \n \n \n19 \n \ntypes of risk. Ali and Gurd (2020) in their study\
    \ of 225 businesses in the Australian horticulture \nsector found that operational\
    \ risks (e.g., inefficient internal processes, poor forecasting and \nplanning\
    \ and process failures) significantly reduce the performance of these supply chains.\
    \ \nDespite this business risk, research in agri-food supply chain risks is limited,\
    \ compared to the \ngeneral supply chain (Nakandala et al., 2017).  \nExposure\
    \ to supply chain risk in the agri-food sector is inevitable in rapidly changing\
    \ business \nenvironments and necessitates resilient supply chains based on best\
    \ practice and a risk \nmanagement culture (Ali et al., 2023). \n2.4.3 Sustainability\
    \ \nSustainability performance objectives emphasize the effective utilization\
    \ of natural resources \nto balance the ecological and socio-economic impacts\
    \ (Mangla et al., 2018). While \nsustainability goals are documented, targets\
    \ set and, in some cases, regulated, a key \nchallenge concerns the delivery of\
    \ the sustainability outcomes at a business level. Belaud et \nal. (2019) used\
    \ big data for sustainability analysis, finding that a key step to informing decision\
    \ \nmaking was sustainability visualisation. Food systems contribute 19% to 29%\
    \ of global \nanthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions with agricultural production\
    \ contributing 80% to \n86% of these emissions (Vermeulen et al., 2012). Livestock\
    \ contribute almost 15% of annual \nanthropogenic methane emissions with beef\
    \ and dairy cattle contributing the most (Gerber et \nal., 2013). Addressing methane\
    \ emissions from cattle is a challenging scientific and social \nproblem including\
    \ the roles of governments in supporting research and setting guidelines \n(McGregor\
    \ et al., 2021). \nA key sustainability factor for the sector is optimum fertilizer\
    \ application. Banana farming, \ncropping and general horticulture farming requires\
    \ the application of fertiliser to ensure optimal \nyield as well as pesticides\
    \ to prevent crop losses and quality issues (Chopin et al., 2016). \nFertiliser\
    \ application releases nitrous oxide into the atmosphere, which is a significant\
    \ \ngreenhouse gas, with a ton of nitrous oxide equivalent to 298 tons of carbon\
    \ dioxide (EPA, \n2023). Nitrates that are not absorbed by a plant may also leach\
    \ into water systems causing \nimbalances in river and coastal systems. In Australia,\
    \ 94% of bananas are grown in \nQueensland, mostly centred around the Cassowary\
    \ Coast region which falls into the UNESCO \nlisted Great Barrier Reef catchment\
    \ area (UNESCO, 2023). Farming in such ecology sensitive \nareas requires a high\
    \ level of sustainability monitoring as elevated nutrient loads into these \n\
    waterways can increase the population of crown-of-thorns starfish which are a\
    \ major cause of \ndeclining coral cover (De’ath et al., 2012). \n \n \n \n \n\
    20 \n \n2.5 Supply Chain Technologies \nSupply chain management research favours\
    \ theoretical relevance and there is a widening gap \nwith respect to practical\
    \ applications. (Stentoft & Rajkumar, 2018). The challenges are \ncompounded as\
    \ businesses expand their digital transformation to their supply chains, facing\
    \ \ndisruptive threats (Sheffi, 2020). Lapide (2015) reinforces that supply chains\
    \ are critical to \nmarket strategy, while Becker and Intoyoad (2017) note that\
    \ logistics can greatly benefit from \nprocess mining as the identification and\
    \ tracking of goods involves many IT systems. Their \nwork also focused on an\
    \ area important to the cattle and beef supply chain, namely, \ndocumentation.\
    \ They focused on automated mining for process documentation by adding \ncontext\
    \ information, including frequency of occurrence of process and the cycle time\
    \ of \nprocesses. Highlighting the increased complexity in supply chains, Jain\
    \ et al. (2008) concluded \nthat there are no generally accepted methods for evaluating\
    \ complex, agile supply chains.  \n2.5.1 Industry 4.0 and Internet of Things \n\
    Since the German federal government announced Industry 4.0 as one of the key initiatives\
    \ of \nits high-tech strategy in 2011 (Hermann et al., 2015), several systematic\
    \ literature reviews \nhave been carried out (Bartodziej, 2017), (Oztemel & Gursev,\
    \ 2020) examining the various \ndefinitions and perspectives that have evolved\
    \ from this original strategy. According to \nGilchrist (2016) a clear definition\
    \ of Industry 4.0 is quite elusive,  who states, “Industry 4.0 \ndeploys the tools\
    \ provided by the advancements in operational, communication, and \ninformation\
    \ technology to increase the levels of automation and digitization of production,\
    \ in \nmanufacturing and industrial processes, with the goal being to manage the\
    \ entire value chain \nprocess”. Hermann et al. (2015), expand this analysis further,\
    \ extracting six design principles \nfor Industry 4.0:  Interoperability, Virtualization,\
    \ Decentralization, Real-Time Capability, \nService Orientation and Modularity.\
    \ Jose Alejandro et al. (2021) conducted a literature review \non technologies\
    \ supporting logistics, identifying big data analytics, cloud services, wearable\
    \ \ntechnology and IoT among the disrupters. Neher (2021) examines IoT and logistics\
    \ \nmanagement highlighting the need to get descriptive, diagnostic, predictive\
    \ and prescriptive \ndecisions from sensor data that will drive new business models,\
    \ for example, alerting a driver \nto check the cooling function of a refrigerated\
    \ container.  \nThe significant expansion and development of cellular connectivity\
    \ and internet speeds and \ncapacity is driving the adoption of IoT and Industry\
    \ 4.0 in agriculture (Araujo et al., 2021). \nAcross manufacturing, supply chains,\
    \ health systems, and transportation and communication \nsystems, billions of\
    \ devices are being connected via the internet to provide data and insights. \n\
    Erboz et al. (2022), examined how Industry 4.0 affects supply chain integration\
    \ and supply \nchain performance, establishing a direct impact.  Dhamija et al.(2020)\
    \ conducted an extensive \nliterature review examining Industry 4.0 and supply\
    \ chain management, establishing positive \n \n \n \n \n21 \n \nrelationships\
    \ between Internet of Things (IoT), digitization, cyber physical systems, and\
    \ big \ndata analytics with supply chain management, also indicating that organizations\
    \ are adopting \nthese processes in practical implementations. The integration\
    \ of company and supply chain \nflows as well as the significant impacts of Industry\
    \ 4.0 on logistics is well documented in \nsystematic reviews (Núñez-Merino et\
    \ al., 2022), while Bag et al.(2020) determine that \nincluding a focus on human\
    \ capital development and change management supports improved \noutcomes (Bag\
    \ et al., 2021). In more mature systems closed loop control has been enabled,\
    \ \nfor example the automation of irrigation and fertigation systems. The agriculture\
    \ and \nhorticulture sectors, while identified as areas of significant potential\
    \ for digitization and \ndeployment of Industry 4.0 technologies have been described\
    \ as lagging adopters of the \ntechnology. Contributing factors include connectivity\
    \ and cost of sensors as well as technology \nsupport, as the sector consists\
    \ mainly of small and medium-sized businesses (Liu et al., 2021).  \nCertain sectors\
    \ in agriculture have made considerable progress in the adoption of Industry \n\
    4.0.  For example, broad acre cropping has become highly digitized, with spraying\
    \ and fertilizer \nequipment as well as harvesters’ precision guided by GPS with\
    \ onboard sensors providing \nreal-time feedback and controlling variable dosing\
    \ of chemicals according to conditions \n(Araujo et al., 2021). However, the horticulture\
    \ sector has lagged due to the nature of the \ncrops, ranging from vegetables\
    \ grown in rows to fruit picked from trees. Determining the \noptimum number of\
    \ sensors for automation of irrigation in an orchard of citrus trees or a \nplantation\
    \ of bananas is complex (Monteleone et al., 2020). Factors such as soil type,\
    \ drainage \nprofiles and irrigation system configuration need to be considered\
    \ and the cost of installation \nand maintenance of these systems can be high\
    \ (Araujo et al., 2021), (Trivelli et al., 2019). To \novercome this challenge\
    \ there has been increasing adoption of satellite technology in the \nsector (Trivelli\
    \ et al., 2019). Using satellite multi spectral imagery for example, water stress\
    \ in \ncertain crops can be detected (Monteleone et al., 2020). The satellite\
    \ imagery can be \ncalibrated using sensor data and where appropriate mobile sensor\
    \ data, to provide more \nextensive information and reduce the cost of sensor\
    \ installations, especially on the larger \nfarms. Similar multi-spectral imaging\
    \ can also be conducted by unmanned aircraft (UAV) or \ndrones and there is increasing\
    \ deployment of these “sensors” on a periodic basis for crop \nhealth assessments\
    \ as well as additional image analysis such as yield prediction (do Amaral \n\
    et al., 2020). As UAV technology improves and aviation regulations are amended\
    \ to allow for \nautonomous flight, adoption of the technology will increase.\
    \ The outputs of the above data are \npresented in geospatial formats for farmers\
    \ with the concept of geospatial overlays of data \nbecoming the accepted user\
    \ interface for farmers. \n \n \n \n \n22 \n \n2.5.2 Supply Chain Analytics \n\
    In a literature review of big data in agriculture, Wolfert et al. (2017) conclude\
    \ that data analytics \nis influencing the entire supply chain and will have a\
    \ major impact on efficiency as well as \nsupply chain design, as the relationship\
    \ between producer and consumer changes. Aramyan \net al. (2007) examine performance\
    \ measures in agriculture food supply chains and propose a \nframework influenced\
    \ by the SCOR model (ASCM, 2023), while Pham (2018)  presents \nexamples of how\
    \ data analytics is redefining the competitive dynamics of agriculture \nproduction\
    \ and supply. \n2.5.3 Digital Twins \nIvanov and Dolgui (2020) explored the ripple\
    \ effect of supply chain disruptions, noting that \nsupply chain risk can be mitigated\
    \ using advanced track and trace systems leading to real \ntime activation of\
    \ contingency policies. They posit that a combination of simulation, \noptimization\
    \ and data analytics will constitute the supply chain digital twin of the future.\
    \ \nMarmolejo-Saucedo (2020) reinforces the increasing difficulty in controlling\
    \ the visibility of a \nproduct through the supply chain noting that each stage\
    \ of the supply chain plans, executes, \nand corrects its operation based on the\
    \ awareness they have at their stage, suggesting the \nuse of digital twins in\
    \ supply chain management could well address the current challenges of \ninteroperability.\
    \ A systematic literature review into digital twining by Rathore et al. (2021)\
    \ \ndocuments the use of this technology in the field of smart manufacturing,\
    \ maintenance and \nprognostics management, power and energy, vehicles and transportation,\
    \ healthcare, \ncommunication, and networks as well as smart cities and highlights\
    \ the opportunity for further \nresearch in the agriculture sector.  \nKalaboukas\
    \ et al. (2021) explore the concept of cognitive digital twins in agile supply\
    \ networks, \nrecognizing that the focus of early adopters of digital twins has\
    \ been on manufacturing and \nmaintenance and not in supply chains and emphasizing\
    \ the importance of data sovereignty \nand governance. Tonelli et al. (2021) in\
    \ their qualitative literature review of Cyber Physical \nSystems (CPS) research\
    \ the advantages of these systems in the production planning, \ncontrolling, and\
    \ monitoring in manufacturing, logistics and planning. The specific technologies\
    \ \nbehind the architecture of CPS are provided as well as the recognition that\
    \ service \norchestration can be achieved through using a standard such as Business\
    \ Process Modeling \nNotation. They conclude that Cyber Physical Production Systems\
    \ are considered the next \nevolution of production and transport processes in\
    \ supply chains.  \nA further development in the emerging synergy between BPM\
    \ and I4.0 technologies is in the \nconfiguration of cyber-physical systems or\
    \ digital twins. The heterogenous nature of the \nintegrated components of a digital\
    \ twin make the application’s process complex and difficult \n \n \n \n \n23 \n\
    \ \nto design and verify. Graja et al. (2016) argue that Business Process Management\
    \ (BPM) \nprovides a standardized bridge for the gap between the design and implementation\
    \ of a digital \ntwin and introduce an extension to Business Process Modelling\
    \ Notation ( BPMN) 2.0, the \nBPMN4CPS to accurately model digital twin processes.\
    \ \nWhile the convergence of technologies such as artificial intelligence, big\
    \ data and I4.0 \ntechnologies has occurred in other industries and demonstrated\
    \ in digital twin applications, \ndigital twins are hardly used in agricultural\
    \ applications (Pylianidis et al., 2021), (Nasirahmadi \n& Hensel, 2022). Digital\
    \ Twins in the smart farming and agri-food industry offer transformative \npossibilities\
    \ in productivity optimization and sustainability, however there are challenges\
    \ in the \ncomplexities of the digital solutions and information technologies\
    \ required to drive them \n(Peladarinos et al., 2023). Implementing digital twins\
    \ in agri-food systems is challenging due \nto:  \n1) it is a dynamic environment\
    \ making it difficult to get access to object data especially in rural \nareas\
    \ with limited coverage and bandwidth,  \n2) agricultural products are living\
    \ products, characterized by complex behaviour, and  \n3) agri-food supply chains\
    \ are part of a dynamic network requiring interoperable data for \nspecific data\
    \ views in a secure and trusted manner (Verdouw et al., 2021). \n2.5.4 Supply\
    \ Chain Control Towers \nSupply chain management is transitioning towards flow\
    \ and process orientated thinking. \nOrganizations are adopting event driven architectures\
    \ as they try to connect data from device \nlevel and compare them with planning\
    \ information from the system level. To manage the \nincreasing complexity, including\
    \ the focus on consumer demand, a solution that integrates \ndata across various\
    \ businesses and nodes of a supply chain has been developed by several \nvendors.\
    \ Known as a supply chain control tower (SCCT), this solution has been around\
    \ for \nsome time; however, the development is still regarded as being in its\
    \ infancy, challenged by \nconnectivity with trading partners (Trzuskawska-Grzesińska,\
    \ 2017). Bentz (2014) notes that \nas businesses become more demand driven, management\
    \ of the end-to-end supply chain is \nmore critical, increasing the importance\
    \ of the role of SCCT’s. Patsavellas et al. (2021), \nobserved that digital twins\
    \ and supply chain control tower uses cases are still rare and in a \nnascent\
    \ phase of adoption. A survey of 69 businesses’ rated automation as the highest\
    \ \nrequirement for a supply chain control tower. \n2.6 Business Process Management\
    \ and Process Intelligence \nA key enabler to supply chain integration, especially\
    \ at the inter-organizational level, is \nbusiness process management (BPM). Dumas\
    \ et al. (2018) describe BPM as managing entire \n \n \n \n \n24 \n \nchains of\
    \ events, activities, and decisions in an organization. Pradabwong et al. (2017)\
    \ \nsurveyed 204 ISO accredited Thai manufacturing companies identifying a positive\
    \ correlation \nbetween business process management (BPM) and supply chain collaboration.\
    \ and \nidentifying BPM as a prerequisite for inter-organizational activities\
    \ in supply chain \ncollaboration. Trkman (2013) highlights the vital role that\
    \ process management plays in \nfacilitating business process orientation which\
    \ aligns with the demand-led, process focus \ndeveloping in the supply chain domain.\
    \ \n2.6.1 Business Process Management Systems \nThe development of BPMS has facilitated\
    \ the integration of business systems including supply \nchains (Bae & Seo, 2007).\
    \ BPMS is a specific class of process aware information system \nconsisting of\
    \ an execution engine, process modelling tool and repository, administration and\
    \ \nmonitoring tools as well as integrations to external services (Dumas et al.,\
    \ 2018). These \nsystems can be established using business process modelling protocols\
    \ such as BPMN 2.0 \nin a visual manner which is understandable to stakeholders\
    \ who are not IT skilled and then \nfurther configured to execute instructions\
    \ such as calling data from other systems via their \napplication programming\
    \ interfaces (APIs), coordinating the storage and retrieval of data from \ndatabases\
    \ and directing the input and output of data from algorithms and decision models\
    \ \n(Schönig et al., 2020). BPMS enable the rapid development of IT systems especially\
    \ in a \nresearch environment where cycles of feedback lead to ongoing change\
    \ and improvement to \nthe design. Workflow management systems such as BPMS are\
    \ able to manage different \noperational processes at multi-levels, which is a\
    \ key requirement for I4.0 technology \nimplementations (Kozma et al., 2019).\
    \ \n2.6.1.1 Process Modelling \nI4.0 solutions can be integrated with business\
    \ process management to achieve improved \noutcomes. The dynamic nature of business\
    \ environments, often disrupted by new I4.0 \ntechnologies, requires regular changes\
    \ to workflow models - which BPM systems can manage \n(Czvetkó et al., 2022).\
    \ Dynamic workflows deal with changes in process execution which \nrequire flexible\
    \ modeling and runtime maintenance (Sabatucci & Cossentino, 2019); \nonboarding\
    \ of new sensor systems that can now automate a manual system is an example \n\
    which is occurring at scale across agri-food businesses. The unpredictability\
    \ of processes, \nespecially those subjected to exogeneous supply chains threats\
    \ (Ivanov & Dolgui, 2019) \nrequires workflow systems that have the ability to\
    \ adapt dynamically to the changing \nenvironment (Sabatucci & Cossentino, 2019).\
    \ Process models are capable of providing \ndifferent views using different abstraction\
    \ levels for the same system (Singh et al., 2022). BPM \nresearch has sought to\
    \ leverage advances in data centric workflows, to optimise control flow \nin BPM\
    \ systems (Kougka et al., 2020).  \n \n \n \n \n25 \n \n2.6.1.2 Process Orchestration\
    \ \nThis extended use of BPMS to enable the configuration  as well as the performance\
    \ \nmanagement of I4.0 technologies is deploying a model driven architecture to\
    \ compliment the \nservice orientated architectures of the data platforms (Bocciarelli\
    \ et al., 2017). Workflow \nmanagement systems such as BPMS are able to manage\
    \ different operational processes at \nmulti-levels,  which is a key requirement\
    \ for I4.0 technology implementations (Kozma et al., \n2019). Process orchestration\
    \ using a BPMS provides integration flexibility and significantly \nless effort\
    \ compared to legacy systems (Dumas et al., 2018). As supply chains are driven\
    \ to \nbecome more agile, flexible, and adaptable there is an increasing requirement\
    \ for agile \nsystems that can adapt without the need for sophisticated redevelopment\
    \ and reprogramming \nwork (El Zant et al., 2021). The ability of BPMS to be rapidly\
    \ configured and “orchestrate” the \nflow of data to the required systems and\
    \ execute functions and routines enables such flexible \noperations.   \n2.6.2\
    \ Process Analytics \n2.6.2.1 Process Mining \nAutomatic process discovery is\
    \ a specific process mining technique, using an algorithm to \nconstruct a process\
    \ from its event logs;  these derived processes can then be conformance \nchecked\
    \ against predefined rules or constraints (Dumas et al., 2018). Data from IoT\
    \ sensors, \nsuch as those deployed in agri-food supply chains, are typically\
    \ captured as an event, \nincluding date and time stamp, allowing for process\
    \ mining of the data. Developments in \nprocess intelligence fields such as compliance\
    \ checking, provide a significant business \nimprovement opportunity for supply\
    \ chain risk management, enabling the possibility for \nautonomous monitoring\
    \ and further decision support (Van Der Aalst, 2016). Conformance \nchecking techniques\
    \ provide ways to compare behaviour in event logs with behaviour \ndescribed by\
    \ process models, which can be either discovered or created manually (Leemans\
    \ \net al., 2019b). Process mining is identified as a methodology for knowledge\
    \ discovery in \ncomplex supply chain networks (Lau et al., 2009). Although, a\
    \ structured literature review on \nprocess mining in supply chains found that\
    \ research into supply chain process mining is \nlimited,  case studies are showing\
    \ promise (Jokonowo et al., 2018). Process mining based on \nthe analysis of IoT\
    \ log files is also a useful tool to support self-diagnostics and self- healing\
    \ of \na system (Singh et al., 2022); this functionality has been leveraged in\
    \ the development of the \nframeworks in Chapters 5,6, and 7. \n2.6.2.2 Process\
    \ Simulation \nBusiness process simulation is regarded as an invaluable tool for\
    \ process modelling due to its \nability to perform quantitative and stochastic\
    \ modelling, with log data based either on \nobservations from a running process\
    \ engine or from prior simulation logs (Wynn et al., 2008). \n \n \n \n \n26 \n\
    \ \nA process simulator generates a large number of process instances and executes\
    \ these \nsequentially, recording the execution, while producing logs and statistics\
    \ of the events (Dumas \net al., 2018). While most BPM tools have simulation capabilities,\
    \ the focus is mainly on design, \nwhereas managers would also like to use process\
    \ simulation for operational decision making \n(Van Der Aalst, 2016). Short term\
    \ process simulation, because of the use of current state and \nhistorical data,\
    \ has higher quality and easier to interpret outcomes, a useful “fast forward”\
    \ \napproach (Rozinat et al., 2008).  \n2.7 Autonomy and Automation \nTavallaey\
    \ and Ganz (2019) in their paper “Automation to autonomy” describe the transition\
    \ \nfrom sensing, analysing, and acting in well-defined situations (traditional\
    \ automation) to \nperceiving, understanding, solving, and acting in autonomous\
    \ systems. By using artificial \nintelligence tools, such as machine learning\
    \ algorithms or artificial neural networks, a system’s \nbehaviour against events\
    \ may be predicted (Peladarinos et al., 2023). Antsaklis and Rahnama \n(2018),\
    \ define a system as being autonomous with respect to a set of goals and under\
    \ a set \nof uncertainties if it achieves these goals under those uncertainties\
    \ without external \nintervention. They also note that there are degrees of autonomy\
    \ (e.g., as defined in the motor \nvehicle and UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) industries)).\
    \ Ramachandran et al. (2021), in their \nresearch into autonomous compliance management\
    \ in agri-food supply chains, introduce the \nconcept of an assisted autonomous\
    \ framework to cautiously automate the verification process, \nstill including\
    \ humans in the loop. They argue that while autonomous compliance is possible,\
    \ \na hybrid approach is still required, due to data uncertainty.  \nThis research\
    \ aims to head beyond process automation to an assisted or semi-autonomous \n\
    approach recognising that this sector operates in an environment of frequently\
    \ occurring risk \n(Ali & Gurd, 2020), increasing risk (Zhao et al., 2020), and\
    \ changing risk (Yadav et al., 2021) \nrequiring a framework that is adaptive\
    \ and can learn and perceive. BPMS systems with the \nability to execute machine\
    \ learning and artificial intelligence algorithms are a pathway to such \nautonomy.\
    \ Integrating the above process centric technologies into a holistic application\
    \ will \naddress the technology challenges that have been described in the agri-food\
    \ supply chain and \nenable greater access to data and real time visibility, facilitating\
    \ opportunities for deeper \nsupporting analytics and insights (Rathore et al.,\
    \ 2021). \n2.8 Conclusion \nThe research into related work in the fields of cattle,\
    \ banana, horticulture and general supply \nchains, business process management,\
    \ process intelligence, Industry 4.0 technologies \nrelevant to the agri-food\
    \ industry, risk management, sustainability, data platforms and the \nemerging\
    \ area of process aware digital twins, has highlighted both the advancements in\
    \ the \n \n \n \n \n27 \n \ndomains as well as the gaps in the integration and\
    \ interconnectivity of these technologies in \nagri-food supply chains. These\
    \ gaps have been summarized in Table 2, below.  \nSummary of Research Gap to the\
    \ Aim of Advancing Process Analytics for Agri-Food Supply Chains \n1 \nA gap exists\
    \ in evaluating complex, agile supply chains (Jain et al., 2008), (Yadav et \n\
    al., 2022), (Sheffi, 2020).  \n2 \nThere is lack of research on agri-food supply\
    \ chain risk, amplified by the fact that Agri-\nfood supply chains are becoming\
    \ more complex and are more vulnerable to risk due \nto perishability (Zhao et\
    \ al., 2020). \n3 \nOperational risk is reducing the performance of agri-food\
    \ supply chains and the \nresearch in this area is limited compared to the general\
    \ supply chain (Ali & Gurd, \n2020), (Nakandala et al., 2017). \n4 \nAgri-food\
    \ systems contribute 19% to 29% of global anthropogenic methane \nemissions (Vermeulen\
    \ et al., 2012) and there is a research gap in reducing this \nenvironmental impact\
    \ (McGregor et al., 2021).  \n5 \nA research gap exists in practical applications\
    \ for supply chain management (Stentoft \n& Rajkumar, 2018). \n6 \nOpportunities\
    \ are identified in applying IoT to logistics where descriptive, diagnostic, \n\
    predictive and prescriptive decisions from sensor data that will drive new business\
    \ \nmodels (Neher, 2021). \n7 \nThe recent, significant expansion and development\
    \ of cellular connectivity and \ninternet speeds and capacity is driving the adoption\
    \ of IoT and Industry 4.0 in \nagriculture and presenting opportunities to develop\
    \ new analytical processes (Araujo \net al., 2021). \n8 \nThe agri-food sector\
    \ has been described as being a lagging adopter of Industry 4.0 \ntechnologies.\
    \ Contributing factors include connectivity and cost of sensors as well as \n\
    technology support, as the sector consists mainly of small and medium-sized \n\
    businesses (Liu et al., 2021), a research gap exists in establishing appropriate\
    \ \nsensors and systems. \n9 \nIvanov and Dolgui (2020) posit that a combination\
    \ of simulation, optimization and data \nanalytics will constitute the supply\
    \ chain digital twin of the future, while Rathore et al. \n(2021) highlight the\
    \ opportunity for further research in the agriculture sector. There \nare few\
    \ applications of digital twins in the agri-food sector, suggesting that the \n\
    benefits have not been clearly communicated yet (Pylianidis et al., 2021). \n\
    10 \nA structured literature review on process mining in supply chains found that\
    \ research \ninto supply chain process mining is limited (Jokonowo et al., 2018).\
    \ \nTable 2: Summary of the Research Gap to the Aim of Advancing Process Analytics\
    \ for Agri-Food Supply Chains \n \n \n \n \n28 \n \nThe overall objective of this\
    \ professional doctorate is to contribute to solving a practice \norientated,\
    \ real world problem, in the agri-food sector, with the aim of using process analytics\
    \ \nto solve this problem. The gap identified in the domains of process science\
    \ and supply chain \nrelevant to the sector motivates this study and further validates\
    \ the novelty of the proposed \noutcomes.  \nBuilding on the related work a research\
    \ plan was developed to answer the overarching \nresearch question: “How can emerging\
    \ process centric technologies assist in solving complex \nagri-food supply chain\
    \ challenges?” \nThe research methodology is presented in Chapter 3, with the\
    \ research outcomes presented \nin Chapters 4,5,6 and 7. Discussions and Conclusions\
    \ are presented in Chapter 8. \n \n \n \n \n29 \n \nChapter 3: Methodology \n\
    3.1 Chapter Introduction \nThis chapter describes the research methodology in\
    \ depth, adopting the practice-oriented \nview working closely with agri-food\
    \ practitioners across the various functional areas from \nfarming and agronomy\
    \ to supply chain operations, industry and Government support and \ninternational\
    \ trade. It describes the problematization of real-world challenges and the \n\
    application of academic rigour to develop solutions to these challenges through\
    \ design science \nresearch and action design research. This has been a journey\
    \ of expert engagement from the \nstudy outset, which assisted in further problematizing\
    \ the gaps (Alvesson & Sandberg, 2013) \nand driven by a “research with practice”\
    \ paradigm of engaged scholarship (Rai, 2019). These \nfactors have made the use\
    \ of Design Science Research with a refinement to Action Design \nResearch the\
    \ appropriate research methodology which was able to cope with the agility \n\
    required in working with the research participants, often in difficult circumstances\
    \ through the \nworst of the Covid-19 pandemic. It also enabled the scope of the\
    \ research to be adapted to \nthe current practice issues, such as examining ways\
    \ to mitigate supply chain risk and later \nproactively respond to sustainability\
    \ challenges, especially decarbonization of the agri-food \nsupply chains, a truly\
    \ global challenge. Finally, the use of Action Design Research enabled \nthe development\
    \ of a fourth research phase, i.e., research into the architecture of an Industry\
    \ \n4.0 enabled platform, when it became obvious during phases 1,2 and 3 of the\
    \ research project \nthat the secondary contribution of developing an IT Artifact\
    \ to “operationalize” the frameworks \nfor evaluation with naturalistic data were\
    \ a more significant area of research. The agri-food \nsector is being challenged\
    \ in its ability to digitize due to gaps in appropriate process centric \ntechnologies,\
    \ and ADR has enabled additional practice and theoretical contributions to be\
    \ \nmade. The research was conducted under ethics approval, UHREC Reference number:\
    \ \n1900000186, 5/06/2019 to 5/06/2024. \n3.2 Applying a Design Science approach.\
    \ \nIn the initial planning of the program of research, Design Science Research\
    \ (DSR) was \nselected as the principal research methodology (Hevner et al., 2004).\
    \ The objectives of the \nplanned research met the requirements of Design Science\
    \ Research, as described by \n(Vaishnavi & Kuechler, 2015). Their adapted DSR\
    \ model requires a project management \nmethodology to manage the development\
    \ stages within the overall research approach. Ajmal \nand Ali (2016) indicated\
    \ that the Agile-Waterfall hybrid model for software development is well \naccepted\
    \ by software developers. The software development cycle of planning, requirements\
    \ \nanalysis, designing, building, and testing can iterate every two to four months\
    \ in the Agile-\nWaterfall model (Stoica et al., 2016). Vaishnavi and Kuechler\
    \ (2015) adapted version of DSR \nwas used for phase 1 of the research. Learnings\
    \ from this phase indicated that deeper \n \n \n \n \n30 \n \nengagement of the\
    \ stakeholders would be required in subsequent phases ensuring that the \nbuild\
    \ of the artifact ensemble is constantly evaluated by both the practitioners and\
    \ researchers \nin a highly agile and dynamic process.   \nFurther research into\
    \ DSR methodologies highlighted Action Design Research which engages \nstakeholders\
    \ in shaping requirements while the researchers build an innovative artifact to\
    \ meet \nthese requirements. A key differentiator between ADR and other Design\
    \ Science Research \nmethodologies is the integration of the evaluation stage.\
    \ This research methodology was \nfound to be well positioned at the nexus of\
    \ addressing industry challenges, while fulfilling the \nacademic contribution\
    \ requirements of Information Systems Research (Sein et al., 2011). The \nartifact\
    \ here is considered primarily as the methodological framework and secondarily\
    \ as an \nenabling IT platform. Field problems such as the challenge of managing\
    \ agri-food supply \nchains are considered knowledge creation opportunities in\
    \ ADR. This research methodology \nalso ensures that the ensemble artifacts are\
    \ informed by theories.   \nA further consideration in selecting ADR is the availability\
    \ of data. At the commencement of \nthe research, it was understood that collection\
    \ of data in the agri-food supply chain is being \ncontinuously improved and extended,\
    \ resulting in more comprehensive data becoming \navailable during the research\
    \ project. This constantly improving data set lends itself to a \nprogram where\
    \ an agile program of action research design is applicable. The evolution of the\
    \ \nresearch methodology from an adapted DSR approach to ADR is illustrated in\
    \ Figure 5 below. \nThe diagram illustrates how discovery through design, the\
    \ core focus of DSR (Baskerville, \n2008), \nis \nenhanced \nwith \na \ndiscovery\
    \ \nthrough \naction \ncomponent \nin \nADR.\n \nFigure 5: Illustration of Action\
    \ Design Research Methodology \n \n \n \n \n31 \n \nChapters 5, 6 and 7 present\
    \ further details of the specific build and evaluation cycles.  \n3.3. The Overall\
    \ Study Design \nThe overall study design is summarised in Figure 6 below.  \n\
    The research is divided into four phases; phase 1 established the foundational\
    \ framework \nwhich was subsequently expanded in phases 2 and 3 for the different\
    \ use cases. Phase 4 \nbrings together the secondary contributions from the first\
    \ three phases and extends these to \nthe overall contribution for Industry 4.0\
    \ enabled data platforms. For each phase there are three \nsteps: Problem Formulation,\
    \ Framework and Artifact Development, and Research Outcomes. \nThe research methodology\
    \ commenced with design science research in phase 1 evolving to \naction design\
    \ research in remaining phases as the benefits of integrating review and \nevaluation\
    \ cycles with iterative framework and artifact development cycles were realised.\
    \  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n32 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n33 \n \n \nFigure 6:\
    \ Overall Research Methodology \nThe development of the various case studies and\
    \ selection of stakeholders was driven by the \n“research within practice” paradigm\
    \ of engaged scholarship. The researcher sought access to \nagri-food businesses\
    \ who were able and willing to either provide data for the various phases \nof\
    \ the research or allow sensors to be deployed in their agri-food supply chains\
    \ in order to \ncollect required data. The choice of these agri-food businesses\
    \ was also influenced by the \navailability of external stakeholders and participants,\
    \ familiar with the agri-food supply chains \nand able and willing to participate\
    \ in the cycles of evaluations and feedback in the Design \nScience Research and\
    \ Action Design Research processes.  \n \n \n \n \n34 \n \nAs summarized in Figure\
    \ 6, the sources of data were varied. For Phase 1 the researcher was \nsupplied\
    \ a data set of cattle movements through the supply chain of a large integrated\
    \ beef \nbusiness, which together with the interview results from the domain subject\
    \ matter experts \nbecame the key data source in designing and evaluating the\
    \ research.  \nFor Phase 2, the researcher was provided GPS trackers by his employer,\
    \ which were then \nused to collect supply chain data from the beef and banana\
    \ supply chains. In addition, an API \nwas provided from a weather station at\
    \ the cattle station to provide the external risk monitoring \ndata. This data\
    \ together with the interview and evaluation data from the participants groups\
    \ \nwas the key data source in designing and evaluating the research. \nFor Phase\
    \ 3, the researcher was supplied cattle GPS trackers by his employer (original\
    \ \nsupplier Ceres Tags (Ceres, 2022)), which were then affixed by the cattle\
    \ farmer to 24 bulls, \nthe cattle location data as well as vegetation and forest\
    \ coverage data was provided via API \nfrom Cibolabs (Cibolabs, 2022). Water levels,\
    \ farm vehicle GPS location and fertilizer addition \nrates were supplied via\
    \ API from the farm management system.  \n3.4 Introducing the Case Studies \n\
    In selecting a suitable case study for Phase 1 of the research, RQ1: “How can\
    \ we leverage \nemerging process centric technologies to enhance the integration\
    \ and interconnectivity of agri-\nfood supply chains?”, several visits to cattle\
    \ farms were undertaken to determine the decisions \nrequired to be made by cattle\
    \ farmers as well as the data available to inform the decision-\nmaking process;\
    \ both large corporate cattle farming businesses, where many farms are owned \n\
    and leased in different areas in Australia, to medium sized farms, normally family\
    \ owned with \na single farm or sometimes a few farms, generally within the same\
    \ region. While there are \nsimilarities between the decisions required to be\
    \ made, the large corporate cattle businesses \nface more supply chain complexity\
    \ with large numbers of animals being moved between farms \nand regions to optimize\
    \ growth and in some cases, such as experienced during this research, \nto prevent\
    \ major losses due to severe drought conditions in certain areas. The case study\
    \ \nselected was a large integrated corporate cattle and beef business with a\
    \ herd of 250 000 \nanimals, 20 farms, three feedlots and a processing facility.\
    \ \nFor the Phase 2 research, RQ2: “How can agri-food supply chain risk be monitored\
    \ and \nmanaged using emerging process centric technologies?”, the case studies\
    \ selected were a \nmedium sized, family-owned cattle farm supply chain, in Gladstone,\
    \ Queensland, where the \nbusiness also ran a cattle transport operation, and\
    \ a family-owned banana farm supplying \nbananas from Innisfail, Northern Queensland\
    \ to Brisbane (1600km), Sydney (2500km) and \nAdelaide (3000km) via multi modal\
    \ transport.  \n \n \n \n \n35 \n \nFor the Phase 3 research, RQ3: “How can emerging\
    \ process centric technologies enable the \nachievement of sustainability development\
    \ goals within agri-food supply chains?”  the medium \nsized cattle farm and a\
    \ medium sized banana farm described in the Phase 2 research were \nused as the\
    \ case studies for this research. The emphasis in the sustainability case study\
    \ was \non the farming operations (Scope 1 and 2 emissions) and not on the inbound\
    \ or outbound \nsupply chains (Scope 3 emissions). \nFor the Phase 4 research,\
    \ in addition to the evaluations conducted in each of the above \nphases, the\
    \ platform was evaluated using the full data set from the integrated cattle business\
    \ \nin research Phase 1 as well as additional near real time data from the monitoring\
    \ of farm \nequipment on the banana farm. \nThe recruitment of participants was\
    \ designed to engage with diverse subject matter experts \nfrom business management\
    \ to functional experts in agri-food supply chain management, \nagronomy, environmental\
    \ science, and agri-food consultants as well as members of agri-food \nindustry\
    \ bodies and government agencies responsible for agri-food market development.\
    \ \nLarge corporates as well as medium sized family run businesses were included\
    \ in the \nrecruitment. Selection criteria were set for each of the participant\
    \ groups. Eight of the \nparticipants in the phase 1 research were cattle and\
    \ beef subject matter experts, one was a \nspecialist in process mining and compliance\
    \ checking; all were based in Australia. For the \nphase 2 research an additional\
    \ 22 participants were recruited, extending the participant group \nto include\
    \ banana and horticulture farmers and industry representatives and agri-food \n\
    consultants, one of the agri-food consultants was based in Canada and another\
    \ in the United \nStates. In phase 3, 30 agri-food specialists were recruited\
    \ with various roles in the \nmanagement of agri-food sustainability; 18 of the\
    \ respondents were from Australia with a \ndomestic and export focus, and 12 were\
    \ international, some operating in more than one \ncountry, from the Netherlands,\
    \ South Korea, Japan, South Africa, China, New Zealand, United \nStates, Vietnam,\
    \ United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. No additional participants \n\
    were recruited for phase 4, as the research focused on the participant inputs\
    \ from phases 1 \nto 3 as well as the IT platform secondary contributions from\
    \ these phases. \n3.5 Inputs and data points \nData for the phase 1 research was\
    \ obtained from the integrated cattle and beef business that \nparticipated in\
    \ the research. The business collects 69 data attributes per animal across its\
    \ 20 \nfarms and 250,000 herd. Whenever cattle are moved from a farm in Australia,\
    \ each animal \nmust be identified with a National Livestock Identification System\
    \ (NLIS) device which is either \na visual or electronic tag (ISC, 2022).  This\
    \ business uses electronic tags which are \nautomatically read when animals are\
    \ moved, for example when they are loaded onto a cattle \n \n \n \n \n36 \n \n\
    truck. In addition, the business records intra farm movements as well as animal\
    \ weight, \ncharacteristics, and treatments. Figure 7 shows cattle data being\
    \ electronically captured after \ncattle were mustered into a stockyard prior\
    \ to be being moved to another field or paddock. \n390,834 individual cattle records\
    \ were provided to the researcher. For each of these records \nup to 69 data attributes\
    \ were included, the attributes allow for transfer between multiple \nproperties\
    \ as well as for multiple treatments of the animals. For the phase 1 research\
    \ only the \nanimal identification, time and date, farm location and weight were\
    \ extracted. In future \nresearch additional attributes could be extracted for\
    \ additional insights, for example, of the \nperformance of different breeds of\
    \ cattle in different farming locations. \nFor phase 2 ex-ante evaluations, GPS\
    \ location and condition monitoring trackers were \nattached to experimental agri-food\
    \ containers with varying temperatures, placed on a vehicle \nand driven between\
    \ various logistics hubs (airport, seaport, and horticulture markets) with data\
    \ \ncollected every 30 minutes. Weather data were collected from a weather station\
    \ in Gladstone \ncollecting data every 15 minutes. The ex-post evaluations included\
    \ the placement of the GPS \ntrackers on two cattle consignments from Gladstone\
    \ to Brisbane as well as the tracking of ten \nbanana consignments (refrigerated\
    \ containers). Five of the banana consignments included \ntracking and condition\
    \ monitoring of three pallets inside the containers to their final \ndestinations\
    \ at distribution centres. The container location was tracked hourly, and the\
    \ pallet \ntemperature was tracked hourly with date and time stored until the\
    \ sensors were able to \ntransmit, once the container doors are opened; at this\
    \ point the location of the tracker is also \ntransmitted.  Figure 8 shows trackers\
    \ attached to a refrigerated container of bananas.  \nFigure 7: Electronic capture\
    \ of individual animal data (image taken by researcher with permission). \n \n\
    \ \n \n \n37 \n \n \nFigure 8: Sensors attached to refrigerated container of bananas\
    \ ( image taken by researcher with permission). \nPhase 3 data were collected\
    \ from a range of Industry 4.0 technologies. This data included \nhourly cattle\
    \ position from low orbit satellites, weekly satellite image data of vegetation,\
    \ crop \nhealth and available edible biomass data. Half hourly updates on water\
    \ consumption and \nwater storage levels were received from the cattle farm, while\
    \ from the banana farm 15-minute \nupdates were received on farm equipment position\
    \ and purpose of operation as well as half \nhourly updates on fertiliser application\
    \ rates and location. Figure 9 shows a GPS tracker \nattached to a tractor on\
    \ the banana farm.  \n \n \n \n \n38 \n \n \nFigure 9: Tracking the location of\
    \ a spraying tractor on the banana farm (image taken by researcher with \npermission).\
    \ \nFor the phase 4 evaluation of the overall platform capability, the dataset\
    \ from phase 1 was \nused, and the large quantity of event data allowed for effective\
    \ testing of the I4.0 platform. In \naddition, further location data from the\
    \ banana farm equipment location data, extended with \nfarm field geolocation\
    \ data were also ingested into the I4.0 platform for testing and evaluation. \n\
    3.6 Reflecting on generalisable learnings and presenting design principles. \n\
    A generalisable learning from the request for data was that a significant amount\
    \ of data has \nalready been captured, as illustrated by the beef supply chain\
    \ in Phase 1. A Group 1 \nparticipant in the Phase 2 study made the comment “I\
    \ feel like we are starting to drown in \ndata”. This discovery led to developing\
    \ the Phase 1 artifacts using existing data and revealed \nthat significant actionable\
    \ insights could be extracted from the captured data. Another Group \n1 participant\
    \ in the Phase 2 study reflected that “We don’t have time to watch dashboards”,\
    \ a \ncomment later reiterated by other participants and reinforced when the researcher\
    \ observed \nhow busy farmers are in the several farm visits that were undertaken\
    \ in the course of this \nstudy. The cattle and banana farms both had existing\
    \ farm management systems displaying \ndata. These comments and observations indicated\
    \ that simply displaying data would not \ncreate additional value for these businesses,\
    \ algorithms need to be developed with \nappropriate alerting when certain tolerances\
    \ are exceeded, or trends detected. A further \ninsight gathered from the participants\
    \ during the problem formulation phase was that data \ncollection has a cost associated\
    \ with it, whether it is time to collect the data, the cost of sensors \nand the\
    \ associated connectivity systems, as well as the effort to process the collected\
    \ data. \nThis observation meant the value proposition for additional data collection\
    \ had to be carefully \n \n \n \n \n39 \n \nconsidered before implementation.\
    \ These insights subsequently influenced the design of the \nframeworks and artifacts\
    \ across the phases of research. The combination of quantitative \nresearch on\
    \ the data as well as survey and interview research with the participants led\
    \ to the \ninitial development of frameworks which were subsequently modified\
    \ through the evaluation \ncycles. Once the frameworks were finalised, the artifacts\
    \ were developed in order to further \nevaluate the frameworks with actual data\
    \ to ensure that real world problems were being \naddressed. \nAs the research\
    \ methodology evolved from the more generic design science approach of the \n\
    phase 1 research to action design research in research phases 2 to 4, as explained\
    \ in Section \n3.2, the increased levels of feedback from the participants allowed\
    \ for learnings and reflections \nto be captured in design principles. Design\
    \ principles are broadly prescriptive statements that \nshow how to achieve a\
    \ goal (Gregor et al., 2020), and can come in diverse forms, carrying \ndiverse\
    \ perspectives. For example, Chandra Kruse et al. (2019) describe how a design\
    \ \nprinciple is more than a statement that prescribes what and how to build an\
    \ artifact to achieve \na design goal, explaining how it should also consider\
    \ the socio-technical aspects that matter \nwhen putting things into action. \
    \ They refer to these as ‘action and materiality orientated design \nprinciples’\
    \ (Chandra Kruse et al., 2015). This research focuses on the design category \n\
    introduced by Gregor et al. (2020, p.14), where they describe ‘design principles\
    \ about user \nactivity and an artifact’, including the characteristics ‘what\
    \ should users be able to do’ with an \nartifact and the features it should have.\
    \ The design principles were developed inductively, with \nthe detailed collection\
    \ and categorization processes described in Sections 5.6, 6.7 and 7.5.2 \nas well\
    \ as guided by the overall Action Design Research principles illustrated in Figure\
    \ 5. A \nsynopsis of study deliverables and contributions is given in section\
    \ 8.2. \n3.7 Extension of Research as new challenges were discovered. \nWhile\
    \ each phase of research has focused on a specific gap and research question there\
    \ have \nbeen common principles applied to the framework development as well as\
    \ an extension and \nexpansion of the framework in phases 1 to 3. The first principle\
    \ is leveraging Industry 4.0 \nsensor and connectivity technologies to extract\
    \ required data, the second is a process flow \nand a model driven approach documenting\
    \ workflows in a manner that can be automated via \na BPMS system, and the third\
    \ is to use process intelligence techniques to create process \naware digital\
    \ twins through the configuration of reference models for compliance checking.\
    \ \nAdaptation of the conformance checking approach with algorithms such as the\
    \ Inductive \nVisual Miner (Leemans et al., 2018), (Leemans et al., 2019a), to\
    \ enable a process aware \ndigital has been a key focus through the phases.  The\
    \ reference models are adapted from the \ndiscovered supply chain models and enhanced\
    \ with appropriate best practice attributes. In \nPhase 3, consideration is given\
    \ to collect data beyond sensors, to integration with ERP \n \n \n \n \n40 \n\
    \ \nsystems, for example to extract electricity or fuel consumption data as well\
    \ as from social \nmedia and news sites to monitor potential future environmental\
    \ legislation changes and \ncommunity responses. This model driven approached\
    \ extended to the IT platform artifact and \nthe solution architecture presented\
    \ in Phase 4 which further leveraged the capabilities into a \n“low code” configuration.\
    \ As the research progressed, the contributions were leveraged in \nthese three\
    \ areas with more use of sensor and system integration, process orchestration\
    \ and \nprocess aware digital twins as illustrated in Figure 10 below.  \n \n\

    \ on the Relevance, Rigour and Design of each Research Phase \nThe final step\
    \ of each research phase used the Design Science Research Checklist (Hevner, \n\
    2010), ( see Sections 4.6, 5.7, 6.7 and 7.5.3), to reflect on the relevance, rigour\

    \ domain which also enabled effective evaluation and \nfeedback through the design\

    \ research is grounded to the knowledge base and the contributing factors that\
    \ led to \nthe solutions are defined. This approach allows for the innovative\
    \ and novel contributions to \nbe clearly presented.  \n \n \n \n \n \n41 \n \n\

    \ commenced with the objective of optimizing cattle and beef supply chains in\
    \ \nAustralia, a key motivation being that there is a significant gap between\
    \ the profitability of the \ntop 25% of cattle producers and the remainder (McLean\
    \ et al., 2020). In addition, the lack of \nintegration of cattle supply chains\
    \ impacts Australian cattle farmers export opportunities. A \nreport commissioned\
    \ by the Australian Meat Processor Corporation, identified six critical \nstrategic\
    \ risks to the meat and livestock processing industry: competition, changing \n\
    consumption patterns, climate change, social licence to operate, the regulatory\
    \ environment \nand lack of value chain integration (Australian Meat Processor\
    \ Corporation, 2016). Following \nthe publication of the report, Peter Noble,\
    \ Chairman of the Australian Meat Processor \nCorporation stated that at the organisation\
    \ and industry level, systems, processes, and \nrelationships must be developed\
    \ to protect the industry and ensure its sustainability.  \nGuided by a design\
    \ science methodology (Hevner et al., 2004) this research initially focused \n\
    on a single, revelatory case study (Yin, 2009), an integrated beef supply chain,\
    \ to discover the \nchallenges that the industry faces, while simultaneously reviewing\
    \ the adoption of process \nscience methodologies into the supply chain domain.\
    \ The research question “How can we \nleverage emerging process centric technologies\
    \ to enhance the integration and \ninterconnectivity of agri-food supply chains?”\
    \ was posed. A proposition that a multi perspective \nprocess analytical approach\
    \ will provide a new level of insight to managing and improving \ncomplex and\
    \ dynamic supply chains is presented. Supply chain insights are used to drive\
    \ the \nmost strategic business decisions and are also used in the executive sales\
    \ and operations \nplanning meetings to drive operations (Bowers et al., 2017).\
    \ To test the proposition, a \nframework, the Multi Perspective Supply Chain Analytics\
    \ Framework (referred to as \nMPSCA) was developed, together with a supporting\
    \ IT artifact, and evaluated with several \nleading subject matter experts from\
    \ practice.    \n \nThe MPSCA framework was built and evaluated in a case study\
    \ of a large integrated beef \nsupply chain in Australia. The intent of the MPSCA\
    \ framework is to integrate a number of these \ntechnology solutions to support\
    \ key analytical challenges across the entire end-to-end lifecycle \nof the food\
    \ supply chain. The objective of this part of the research was to develop a data-\n\
    driven multi perspective framework which will provide a new level of supply chain\
    \ analytics \ncontributing to the body of knowledge in this domain, while also\
    \ addressing a real-world \nproblem in managing vertically integrated food supply\
    \ chains.  \n4.2 Related Work \nWang et al. (2016) in their extensive literature\
    \ review of supply chain and big data analytics \nconclude that these techniques\
    \ should be treated as strategic assets applied holistically \n \n \n \n \n43\
    \ \n \nacross a business, from strategy to operations. Supply chain integration\
    \ is essential to \ncompetitive advantage and viewed in some sectors as extended\
    \ enterprises (Braziotis et al., \n2017). Analysis is currently centered on a\
    \ process and control flow centric approach, with the \nAssociation of Supply\
    \ Chain Management’s SCOR™ model being one of the most widespread \nmethodologies\
    \ (Delipinar & Kocaoglu, 2016).  \n \nThe gap in the above methodology is that\
    \ it approaches supply chain analytics from a single \nperspective. the reference\
    \ model and is a “static” methodology as opposed to a dynamic \nanalytical process\
    \ capable of interrogating event data (Event data are execution data, \nproduced\
    \ as a side product when a task is executed). A supply chain by its very definition\
    \ is a \nseries of interconnected events. Analyzing the control flow aspects of\
    \ a supply chain is one \nperspective; being able to co-currently analyze performance\
    \ data will provide a new dimension \nof analytics not currently deployed in this\
    \ domain. It is postulated that such a multi-perspective \napproach to supply\
    \ chain analytics will enhance supply chain performance and can also further \n\
    leverage the knowledge embedded in the SCOR™ model through advanced conformance\
    \ \nchecking. \nAdditional related work originally published in the paper described\
    \ above has been presented \nin Chapter 2 as it is relevant to the overall thesis.\
    \ As an update to this related work, additional \nliterature research was carried\
    \ out and the work of Barreto Riano et al. (2022) is noted. A \nsystematic review\
    \ of the cattle supply chain was carried out for the purposes of a disciplinary\
    \ \ncategorization of 146 papers from 602 authors and 99 journals. Nine categories\
    \ were \nestablished:  global warming, culture, tanneries, general agriculture\
    \ sector, quality \nmanagement and control, veterinary medicine, perspectives,\
    \ technology, and transportation. \nThe analysis of these categories reinforces\
    \ the importance of this agri-food sector as a key \nprotein source for a growing\
    \ population but one that needs to be optimized to improve \nproductivity and\
    \ sustainability outcomes (Barreto Riano et al., 2022).  \n4.3 Methodology \n\
    This study applies a Design Science approach (Hevner et al., 2004). The methods\
    \ applied \nfor framework building and early evaluation outcomes are presented\
    \ below.  \nThe framework building has three forms of input; insights from a literature\
    \ analysis, case study \ndata (from interviews and documents) and subject matter\
    \ expert insights (collected in the form \nof interviews). The resultant framework\
    \ is presented in Section 4.4 below. \nProcess mining literature was reviewed\
    \ to identify algorithms and solutions relevant to supply \nchain analytics and\
    \ the beef supply chain (Golini et al., 2017). The earlier research work \nexposed\
    \ the researcher to several beef cattle businesses as well as providing indications\
    \ that \n \n \n \n \n44 \n \nthere were gaps in the analytics and insights available\
    \ across the supply chain. Further \nliterature research validated the gap, with\
    \ lack of supply chain integration and data sharing \nidentified as strategic\
    \ risks (Australian Meat Processor Corporation, 2016). Research in other \nindustries\
    \ such as automotive component supply noted that logistics can greatly benefit\
    \ from \nprocess mining approaches (Gerke et al., 2009). It was against this background\
    \ that the \nconcept of a supply chain analytics framework for food supply chains\
    \ was created.  \nThe case study chosen (Case A1) for this research phase is one\
    \ of the largest vertically \nintegrated beef supply chains in Australia. The\
    \ case study is revelatory since other businesses \nare less vertically integrated\
    \ with a focus either on the cattle farming side, breeding or \nbackgrounding,\
    \ feed lotting, or on the processing component. The business owns or leases \n\
    20 farms, configured either as breeding or backgrounding farms, three feedlots,\
    \ with the added \nability to purchase animals from third party feedlots, and\
    \ its own processing facility. Beef \nproducts are packaged and labelled for delivery\
    \ directly to their customer’s store shelves.   \nAs depicted in Table 3, respondents\
    \ from the case study and other selected subject matter \nexperts from practice\
    \ were identified to contribute to the design (and evaluation) of the \nframework.\
    \ The interviewees were specifically selected to ensure a cross section of managers\
    \ \nfrom C-suite Executives, to understand the strategic management requirements,\
    \ to Farm \nManagers, to understand the tactical management requirements. In addition\
    \ to operations \nmanagement, data managers and IT managers were selected to obtain\
    \ insights into \nchallenges in the collection and accuracy of data. To obtain\
    \ a broader industry perspective, \nindustry researchers from Meat and Livestock\
    \ Australia (MLA, 2022a) were also consulted. \nEach interview took 30-45 minutes.\

    \ the Multi Perspective Supply Chain Analytics Framework \nA conceptual framework\
    \ from a synthesis of multiple data from the study was derived first, and \nthis\
    \ was then applied to Case A. \nThe Multi Perspective Supply Chain Analytics Framework\
    \  (MPSCA) combines process and \ndata analytics while also factoring in the importance\
    \ of effective visualization and  simulation. \nas well as an effective means\
    \ of interaction with the user for decision support. At its core the \nframework\
    \ is data driven. The key focus on a data driven approach resulted from information\
    \ \nreceived from the interviewees that the businesses were data rich, but information\
    \ poor, and \nfrom research that indicates that much data are collected along\
    \ a supply chain (Verdouw et \nal., 2010). \nThe MPSCA Framework consists of six\
    \ stages, five of which are referred to as “views” to \nreflect the visualization\
    \ that is provided to the processes and data: \n• \nDefine Analysis Questions\
    \ of Interest Stage \n• \nProcess Analytics Supply Chain View \n• \nData Analytics\
    \ Performance View \n• \nMulti Perspective Decisions View \n• \nSimulation Analytics\
    \ Scenario View \n• \nOrchestration Prediction and Prescription View \nThe views\
    \ all interact with the Data Extraction and Analysis Core as illustrated in Figure\
    \ 11 \nbelow. \n \n \n \n \n \n46 \n \n \nFigure 11: Conceptual overview of the\
    \ MPSCA framework \nEach stage of the framework is illustrated in more detail\
    \ below, in addition to describing its \napplication within a selected use case.\
    \ \n4.4.1 Define Analysis Questions of Interest \nThe key question of interest\
    \ for the case study, as determined from the interviews, is weight \ngain of the\
    \ cattle through each stage of the supply chain. As cattle pass through the various\
    \ \nstages of maturity: calf, weaner, backgrounder, and feeder (Meat and Livestock\
    \ Australia, \n2021), (MLA, 2022b) they increasingly gain weight, and it is farm\
    \ management’s role to ensure \nthe cattle remain “on a rising plane of nutrition”2.\
    \ While the key objective is to ensure that cattle \nalways have enough edible\
    \ pasture, this is not always possible, with environmental factors \nsuch as drought,\
    \ playing a significant role. Farmers must also carefully manage their stocking\
    \ \nrates to ensure that pastures are not overgrazed, since overgrazing can cause\
    \ long term \ndamage to pasture and in extreme cases render them unsuitable for\
    \ animals. With cattle \nweight being the key criteria for determination of payment\
    \ to farmers, the analysis question of \ninterest was posed as follows: “When\
    \ do you move animals to the next stage of the supply \nchain?”, with supporting\
    \ questions being: “How much weight did each cow gain at each stage \n \n2 interview\
    \ note from C Suite Executive large cattle business \n \n \n \n \n47 \n \nof the\
    \ supply chain?”  and “How much did each cow weigh when it was transferred to\
    \ the next \nstage of the supply chain?” \n4.4.2 Core Data Analysis and Extraction\
    \ \nThe business which participated in the case study made its cattle database\
    \ available to the \nresearcher for the purposes of building and evaluating the\
    \ framework. The business began \ncollecting and centralising individual cattle\
    \ data in October 2018. To do this the business had \nto install RFID3 readers\
    \ and weighing systems together with cattle yard information gathering \nsystems\
    \ that can capture the data on ruggedized laptops and later transmit the data\
    \ to the \nheadquarters central database, once the team conducing the cattle management\
    \ process \nreturned to an area with connectivity, normally the main farmhouse/office.\
    \  \nDue to the cost of installing the physical cattle management infrastructure\
    \ and the sheer scale \nof operations, this process has been systematically rolled\
    \ out over 18 months. The complete \nset of data since the beginning of the roll\
    \ out was provided for the purposes of this research. \nThe data set includes\
    \ original testing data, this data was identified and excluded which \nreduced\
    \ the data set to 390 834 records. New data attributes, such as breed and intra\
    \ – farm \nmovements (paddock to paddock), have been added to the cattle management\
    \ system over \nthe months as additional information requirements are identified.\
    \ Currently the cattle \nmanagement system captures 69 data attributes per animal,\
    \ all referenced to the animal RFID. \nTo understand the data attributes in more\
    \ detail a summary data model was developed; see \nTable 4 below. The data model\
    \ shows that key animal data are collected as well as location \nand supply chain\
    \ history. Since recording and reporting the location of a specific animal is\
    \ a \nmandatory regulatory requirement (Integrity Systems, 2021), it was hypothesised\
    \ that this \nevent data could well be used to extract the journey of the animal\
    \ through its lifecycle using \nprocess analytics techniques. The location of\
    \ the animal through each stage of its lifecycle \ntogether with its weight gain\
    \ at each stage and location would provide good insights into how \nto improve\
    \ the cattle supply chain for optimum yield such as weight gain. \n \n \n3 Radio\
    \ Frequency Identification  \n \n \n \n \n48 \n \n \nTable 4: High level data\
    \ model \n4.4.3 Applying the Process Analytics Supply Chain View \nHaving assessed\
    \ the cattle data, the next step in the MPSCA framework is to apply process \n\
    analytics to extract the supply chain view. As the extracted data set of 390 834\
    \ records with \n69 data attributes was considered too large for initial trial\
    \ of process analytics techniques, it \nwas decided to reduce the data attributes\
    \ initially to weight only, aligning to the analysis \nquestion of interest. From\
    \ the participant interviews, it was established that location was a key \nfactor,\
    \ both intra farms, as farmers managed the duration of a herd on a particular\
    \ paddock \naccording to the available edible biomass in the paddock. Also inter\
    \ farms as decisions were \nmade when to move the cattle from breeding farms and\
    \ to which backgrounding farm. Cattle \nweight is the key parameter considered\
    \ throughout the supply chain, as it is one of the \ndeterminants of price at\
    \ the processors.  \nThe key event data were classified as follows: \nCase/Unique\
    \ identifier: Individual animal RFID \nEvent name: CurrentPIC (Current Property/Farm\
    \ Identification Code) \n \n \n \n \n49 \n \nDate and Time/Completion Time: Session\
    \ Date \nData Attribute: Animal Weight \nAn initial process discovery analysis\
    \ was conducted using the Inductive Visual Miner (IVM) \nalgorithm (Leemans et\
    \ al., 2018). This is a conformance checking algorithm which compares \nevents\
    \ in the event log with activities in the process model. A parameter for measuring\
    \ how \naccurately a process model expresses behaviours in the event log is fitness.\
    \ If fitness is 1, it \nmeans all that the discovery processes model can replay\
    \ all traces in the event log (Naderifar \net al., 2019).  The fitness of the\
    \ IVM algorithm model was checked and found to be \nunsatisfactory with a fitness\
    \ of 0.6. A more suitable process mining algorithm was sought and \nafter referencing\
    \ (Leemans et al., 2019a) the Directly Follows Visual Miner  (DFVM) was used,\
    \ \nwhere a fitness of 0.75 was achieved. The reason the Directly Follows Visual\
    \ Miner provided \na better fit than the Inductive Visual Miner is due to the\
    \ nature of the cattle event logs. The \nsequential nature of supply chain is\
    \ more suited to the type of algorithms deployed in the \nDFVM compared to the\
    \ more complex algorithms of the IVM4. The discovered process model \nis shown\
    \ in Figure 12. \n \n \nFigure 12: Process Analytics Supply Chain View ( screenshot\
    \ from ProM software (ProM, 2019)) \nThis view has discovered the individual supply\
    \ chain of each animal as well as revealing \nseveral supply chain management\
    \ issues which are discussed in Section 4.6. \n \n4 Interview with Sander Leemans,\
    \ developer of the IVM and DFVM algorithms \n \n \n \n \n50 \n \n4.4.4 Applying\
    \ the Data Analytics Performance View \nThe Process Analytics Supply Chain View\
    \ has highlighted several supply chain movements \nthat do not appear to be optimal\
    \ to satisfy the analysis question of Interest. Animals were \nshown to be moved\
    \ along the supply chain in paths that are not optimal. This observation led \n\
    to the Process Analytics Supply Chain stage to be rerun focusing on the Babbiloora,\
    \ \nDungowan, Redford and Niella (BDRN) supply chain in more detail. The process\
    \ of starting \nwith the view of the discovered supply chain and then adjusting\
    \ the activities slider (to filter \nout anomalies) provided an overview which\
    \ graphically highlighted areas of unusual and \nincreased activity. It also highlighted\
    \ areas in the supply chain where data was missing, this \ndiscovery led to the\
    \ development of the digital twin in the Simulation View to derive missing \n\
    data. The event data was then filtered to extract the farms of interest and rerun.\
    \  \nAfter repeating the Process Analytics Supply Chain cycle several times on\
    \ the BDRN supply \nchain, and filtering out intra farm movements, the Process\
    \ Analytics Supply Chain View was \nable to detect that several animals were been\
    \ returned to farms where they were being bred \nas well as directly to the finishing\
    \ farm (Niella) bypassing the backgrounding farms. It was \nsuspected that unusual\
    \ environmental factors were the root cause, and a check was made of \nrainfall\
    \ and historical rainfall records (BOM, 2019). These records revealed that the\
    \ region in \nwhich the BDRN farms were located had experienced extreme drought\
    \ conditions over the \nperiod in which the cattle data were recorded. \nThe weight\
    \ distributions on each farm were also extracted via Power BI This data mining\
    \ \nexercise, shown in Figure 13, further validated the observations from the\
    \ Process Analytics \nSupply Chain View, that extraordinary management practices\
    \ were being applied, the holding \nof heavier animals on the breeding farm Babbiloora\
    \ being an example.  \nFigure 13: Cattle weight distributions on BDRN farms (\

    These required steps corroborated the structure of the MPSCA framework and are\
    \ discussed \nfurther in Section 4.4.6. \n 4.4.5 Applying Multi Perspective Decisions\
    \ View \nThis view was included in the MPSCA Framework as the ability to create\
    \ a data aware overlay \nto the supply chain perspective is of value, particularly\
    \ in determining the impact of data driven \ndecision making along the supply\
    \ chain. This perspective was tested on the case study data \nas follows.  \n\
    Further literature research was conducted which led to the data-aware process\
    \ mining work \nof de Leoni and van der Aalst (De Leoni & van der Aalst, 2013).\
    \ Their work has focused on \nusing conformance checking techniques to align an\
    \ event log with data and a process model \nwith decision points.  Further development\
    \ of this work has led to the development of the Multi-\nperspective process explorer\
    \ (Mannhardt et al., 2016). This new algorithm factors in decisions \nthat are\
    \ not fully deterministic allowing for the discovery of overlapping decision rules.\
    \ Due to \nthe anomalies in the supply chain already discovered by the Process\
    \ Analytics Supply Chain \nview as well as the lack of data across the cattle\
    \ supply chain, the decision making is clearly \nnot deterministic and therefore\
    \ the multi- perspective process explorer was selected to explore \nthe data perspective.\
    \ \nData attributes attached to events are used to analyse processes from other\
    \ perspectives. \nWith the significant amount of animal data now collected, this\
    \ perspective is most important in \nthe analysis of the cattle supply chain.\
    \ To discover this perspective the BDRN event log set \nwas selected together\
    \ with the BDRN petri net model and run through the multi-perspective \nprocess\
    \ explorer. The results of the input model are shown in Figure 14 below. \n \n\
    \ \n \n \n52 \n \nThe data aware discovery algorithm was run on this input model\
    \ based on the weight data \nattribute, followed by the decision tree data discovery\
    \ based on the weight algorithm. While \nthe average fitness of the decision is\
    \ relatively low at 59% the event logs are based on actual \nhistorical animal\
    \ movements which we now know were determined by the drought. The output \nof\
    \ this algorithm does however demonstrate that the influence of a key attribute\
    \ such as animal \nweight can be discovered over a process model that represents\
    \ the lifecycle of an animal. This \nresult is most significant as it indicates\
    \ that the proposed digital twin could utilise this \nfunctionality, for example\
    \ in a decision model at a specific supply chain node.  \n4.4.6 Applying the Simulation\
    \ Analytics Scenario View \nThe analysis in Section 4.4.3 has shown that while\
    \ significant data has been captured per \nanimal, it is not captured adequately\
    \ across the supply chain. To close the current data gap in \nparts of the supply\
    \ chain a digital twin of both the cattle supply chain as well as a typical cow\
    \ \n(growth model) was developed to derive the missing data. To create the Simulation\
    \ Analytics, \nview of the BDRN supply chain, the discovered BDRN model was edited\
    \ to exclude all edges \nthat were a result of abnormal factors. For the case\
    \ study the simulation view requires the \nsimulation of a cow with respect to\
    \ its growth through its various stages of maturity. We have \nnamed the simulation\
    \ the Digital Cow. To create a digital cow research had to be undertaken \non\
    \ typical growth patterns of a cow through the various lifecycle stages. Based\
    \ on Meat and \nLivestock Australia (2021) published data, an initial algorithm\
    \ was developed to calculate the \nweight gain of a cow during the stages of calf,\
    \ weaner, backgrounder and feeder. The initial \nalgorithm considers weight gain\
    \ when there is normal feed available to the animal. With further \nresearch the\
    \ algorithm will be extended to account for weight gain in poor and good pasture\
    \ \nconditions, ultimately linking to the available biomass modelling and measurements.\
    \  \n \nFigure 14: Multi perspective view BDRN supply chain ( screenshot from\
    \ ProM software (ProM, 2019)) \n \n \n \n \n53 \n \nThe output of the Digital\
    \ Cow algorithm is shown in Figure 15 below: \n \n \nFigure 15: Output of the\
    \ Digital Cow Algorithm \nThe Digital Cow algorithm was then used to develop synthetic\
    \ event logs for the BDRN Digital \nSupply Chain which were then run through the\
    \ multi perspective process explorer. The output \nfurther validates the MPSCA\
    \ model as the data driven (weight) split of animals between \nDungowan and Redford\
    \ was 100% verifiable with the synthetic event logs.  \nHaving proven that the\
    \ combination of the digital twin of a supply chain as well as a digital cow \n\
    can generate meaningful business data in circumstances where there are gaps in\
    \ the actual \nsupply chain data, the future research plan is to extend the digital\
    \ supply chain to the entire \nintegrated supply chain, using the digital cow\
    \ to simulate data currently not available from the \nmajor breeding farms.  \n\
    4.4.7 Orchestration Prediction and Prescription View \nWhile each of the stages\
    \ of the MPSCA Framework has been shown to provide insights into \nmanagement\
    \ challenges and decisions along the supply chain, in order to be of value to\
    \ \nbusiness the framework must be able integrate and consolidate the insights\
    \ for enhanced \ndecision support.  To identify an appropriate process orchestration\
    \ engine several solutions \nwere investigated. Camunda (Camunda, 2019),  has\
    \ been rated by several studies (Geiger et \nal., 2018; Meidan et al., 2017),\
    \ as high in execution and operation criteria. While Camunda is \na robust, BPMN\
    \ 2.0 compliant workflow engine most suitable for commercial applications, the\
    \ \nwork of van der Aalst et al in developing RapidProM, an extension of the scientific\
    \ workflow \nmanagement solution RapidMiner (RapidMiner, 2020), provides a solution\
    \ specifically focused \non process analytics. With RapidProM process mining analysis\
    \ is repeatable and data and \n \n \n \n \n54 \n \nprocess mining combined, and\
    \ since these features are considered core to the MPSCA \nFramework, it has been\
    \ used in this final stage.   \nThe Orchestration Prediction and Prescription\
    \ View was configured in RapidProM with \nseveral scientific workflows as follows:\
    \ \n1) Discover the cattle supply chain workflow: import supply chain event data\
    \ > run visual \nminer > run conformance checker. \n2) Run the multi-perspective\
    \ process explorer workflow: import supply chain event data \nincluding special\
    \ data attributes > run visual miner > run multi-perspective inductive \nminer.\
    \ \n3) Run the simulation analytics workflow digital twin - supply chain:  import\
    \ supply chain \nevent data > import digital twin – supply chain petri net > run\
    \ visual miner > run \nconformance checking. \n4) Run the simulation analytics\
    \ workflow digital twin – cow: import supply chain data \ngenerated by digital\
    \ twin - cow > import actual supply chain petri net > run visual miner \n> run\
    \ conformance checking. \n4.5 Framework evaluation and results \nThe FEDS framework\
    \ (Framework for Evaluation in Design Science) was used for evaluation \ndesign\
    \ (Venable et al., 2016). The FEDS framework covers both the functional purpose\
    \ of \nevaluation as well as the type of evaluation. A summative approach with\
    \ naturalistic criteria \nwas used, and this required “real” industrial data and\
    \ an IT Artifact to evaluate the MPSCA \nframework, where the case study provided\
    \ an opportunity to analyze data more readily across \nthe supply chain. The IT\
    \ Artifact consists of several process mining algorithms hosted on the \nopen-source\
    \ framework, ProM (ProM, 2019) with supporting data analytics solutions such as\
    \ \nPower BI (Microsoft, 2019). With the design risk of being technically orientated\
    \ a Technical \nRisk and Efficacy Evaluation strategy was selected, allowing for\
    \ an initial formative approach \nbased on artificial data and simulations advancing\
    \ through to a summative approach with \nnaturalistic criteria. \nThe integrated\
    \ beef supply chain extends from breeding farms through to the retailer as shown\
    \ \nin Figure 16. In analyzing the beef supply chain of Case A, the MPSCA Framework\
    \ was \nfollowed, and various process analytical solutions tested on the data.\
    \ Interviewees were \napproached again at this stage (See Table 3). The IT Artifact\
    \ was built focusing on the \nquestions of interest that the interviewees had\
    \ posed, as well as the cattle data that was made \navailable to the researcher.\
    \ The core focus of the case study was to validate the framework, \nwith a key\
    \ design principle being that the various data and process algorithms as well\
    \ as \nvisualization and simulation solutions used can be interchanged.  \n \n\
    \ \n \n \n55 \n \n \nFigure 16: Integrated cattle and beef supply chain \n \n\
    4.6 Discussion \n  \nAs highlighted in the data model (Table 4) and the discovered\
    \ process analytics supply chain \nview of Figure 12, it is possible to discover\
    \ and extract the complete supply chain of an \nindividual animal. This ability\
    \ is most significant, not only for the deeper analytics that occur \nwith this\
    \ information (for example what were the environmental factors, such as weather,\
    \ when \nthe animal was on a farm), but also for provenance, a growing consumer\
    \ requirement. By \nadjusting parameters in the “directly follows visual miner”\
    \ (DFVM) of the complete business \ncattle data, a group of farms (the BDRN group,\
    \ as introduced in Section 4.4.5) was identified \nfor deeper analysis. This group\
    \ formed their own complete supply chain, illustrating that the \nMPSCA framework\
    \ can “zoom-in” to areas of interest identified in the overall supply chain \n\
    view.  \nFurther focus on the BDRN group through filtering out of their intra\
    \ – farm movements and \nfocusing only on their inter-farm movements, highlighted\
    \ several bi-directional animal \ntransfers. Animals were returned to their previous\
    \ property which is not best practice. Having \nobserved in the data model (Table\
    \ 4) that environmental data were not captured in the cattle \ndata base, it was\
    \ assumed that environmental factors were contributing to this supply chain \n\
    behaviour. The framework’s Data Analytics Performance view seeks to gain additional\
    \ data to \ndescribe a supply chain action. Manual extraction of weather data\
    \ for these farms was able to \nconfirm that the farms were in severe drought\
    \ during the observed supply chain events and \nanimals had to be transferred\
    \ between farms to ensure the animals had enough edible \npasture.  \nThe outputs\
    \ from the process analytics on the BDRN group are significant, firstly, \ndemonstrating\
    \ that supply chain anomalies can be discovered with the  DFVM  and reinforcing\
    \ \nthe need for scientific workflow within the framework as described in Section\
    \ 4.4.7. The \nscientific workflow should be extended to collect additional supply\
    \ chain performance data, \nnot captured in the event log for additional processing,\
    \ for example, in a decision model. The \nmulti perspective process explorer was\
    \ able to effectively detect the influence of the key \n \n \n \n \n56 \n \nattribute,\
    \ animal weight, on the decision to send animals to a farm. While the analysis\
    \ question \nof interest for the case study, “When do you move animals to the\
    \ next stage of the supply \nchain?” is dependent on more factors than animal\
    \ weight alone, the fact that the animal weight \ndimension can be simultaneously\
    \ analyzed with the control flow perspective adds significant \nvalue to the supply\
    \ chain analytics. \nCreation of the digital twin – farm was simplified through\
    \ the ability to edit out unrequired “arcs” \n(supply chain connections) from\
    \ the discovered supply chain. The resultant petri net was then \nsaved for later\
    \ import into the DFVM together with the real cattle event logs for compliance\
    \ \nchecking and highlighting of variations to the best practice supply chain.\
    \ While the analysis \nshows that the BDRN supply chain had complete data, showing\
    \ animals moving through their \nlifecycle and gaining weight through the various\
    \ stages, the supply chain view of the farms \n(Figure 3), shows that this is\
    \ not the case for all. In discussing this observation with the \nbusiness, it\
    \ was noted that the large breeding properties supplying the cattle to these \n\
    properties had not yet installed the cattle yard data capture systems. The first\
    \ capture of all \nthe historical data occurred when an animal reaches the backgrounding\
    \ farm.  \nThe above observation highlights the importance of the digital twin\
    \ - cow in the Simulation \nAnalytics view. Not only can the digital twin – cow\
    \ algorithm produce event logs which can test \nvarious supply chain scenarios,\
    \ it can also be used to produce event data, for example, the \ntypical weight\
    \ gain of a calf and a weaner while it is on the breeding properties, and to close\
    \ \na key data gap. The digital twin - cow algorithm combined with the digital\
    \ twin - supply chain \ncan highlight where current cattle practices are deviating\
    \ from best practice and alert cattle \nbusiness owners especially those with\
    \ large integrated cattle supply chains as to where the \npotential problem areas\
    \ are. This information could be used to improve decision making \nregarding when\
    \ to move animals to the next stage of the cattle supply chain to maximize \n\
    weight gain and ultimately profit per animal.  \n \nThe key challenge in this\
    \ research has been the combination of process and data mining to \nsolve the\
    \ supply chain analytics gap, so critical to strategic management. Placing data\
    \ \nextraction and analysis as the core of the framework has proven well suited\
    \ to the problem, \nas a significant amount of data filtering and analysis occurred\
    \ through the applied stages of \nthe process. Testing the framework on significant\
    \ amounts of real data has been most \ninsightful, both in terms of the sorting\
    \ and cleansing requirements when dealing with large \nquantities of industrial\
    \ data as well as the gaps in data.  \n \n \n \n \n \n57 \n \nThe Design Science\
    \ Research Checklist, see Table 5 below, was used to review the \nRelevance, Rigour\
    \ and Design cycles (Hevner, 2010) of this work to ensure that the Design \nScience\
    \ Research Guidelines discussed in Section 3.8 have been met.   \nNo. \nQuestion\
    \ \nAnswer \n1 \nWhat is the research question? \nHow can emerging process centric\
    \ technologies \nassist in solving complex agri-food supply chain \nchallenges?\
    \ \n2 \nWhat is the artifact and how is it \npresented? \n1) A conceptual framework\
    \ integrating and \nconnecting several process centric \ntechnologies \n2) An\
    \ IT artifact capable of executing each \nview of the framework \n3 \nWhat research\
    \ heuristics were used \nto build the artifact? \n1) Selection heuristics – guided\
    \ by \nfeedback from stakeholder interviews \n2) Procedural heuristics – influenced\
    \ by \nsupply chain discovery (Bingham et al., \n2007), (Bingham & Eisenhardt,\
    \ 2011) \n4 \nHow are the artifact and design \nprocesses \ngrounded \nby \nthe\
    \ \nknowledge base? What theories \nsupport the artifact design and \ndesign process?\
    \ \nThe research design was focused on the nexus \nof addressing industry challenges\
    \ while fulfilling \nthe academic contribution requirements of \nInformation Systems\
    \ Research (Sein et al., \n2011). The knowledge bases from the disciplines \n\
    of process science, supply chain and agri-food \nwere researched together with\
    \ comprehensive \nindustry consultation through a structured \ninterview and evaluation\
    \ process. \n5 \nWhat evaluations are performed \nduring the internal design cycles?\
    \ \nWhat design improvements are \nidentified during each design cycle? \nEvaluations\
    \ were conducted on the accuracy \nand relevance of each view/component by \n\
    sharing the outputs with the stakeholders and \nreceiving their feedback. For\
    \ example, the \nprocess mining algorithm was changed to \nimprove the insights\
    \ of the supply chain view, for \nthis data type. On reflection feedback was not\
    \ \nreceived on the overall framework, and a more \nrigorous feedback cycle was\
    \ designed for the \nfollowing phases of research. \n6 \nHow is the artifact introduced\
    \ into \nthe application environment and \nhow is it field tested? \nThe artifact\
    \ (both the MPSCA Framework as well \nas the enabling IT solution) were presented\
    \ to \nthe \nstakeholders \nin \none-on-one \nfeedback \nsessions by laptop presentation\
    \ using the data \nsupplied to the researcher. On reflection the \npersonal \n\
    computer-based \nsolution \nwas \nrestrictive, and designs were commenced for\
    \ the \nenabling IT artifact to be cloud based for the \nfuture phases, to provide\
    \ broader and easier \naccess for evaluation. \n7 \nWhat new knowledge is added\
    \ to \nthe knowledge base and in what \nform? \nCapturing individual cattle movement\
    \ inter farm \nand supply chain node (e.g., feedlots and \nprocessing) is a regulatory\
    \ requirement with \nmany cattle businesses capturing the data for \ncompliance\
    \ purposes only. In the lifecycle of \ncattle (3 to 6 years) significant data\
    \ is captured. \nThe new knowledge added is that process \nmining can be effectively\
    \ used to establish the \nsupply chain history of an animal, which \ncombined\
    \ with data mining can be effectively \nused to determine which breeds, management,\
    \ \nand animal husbandry practices as well as \n \n \n \n \n58 \n \nlocations\
    \ resulted in the optimal quality and \nfinancial return for cattle businesses.\
    \ Results \nwere presented at the international BPM   \nconference and published.\
    \ \n8 \nHas the research question been \nsatisfactorily addressed? \nYes. Validated\
    \ by testing the framework on a \ncomplex agri-food supply chain with significant\
    \ \ndata. \nTable 5: Design Science Research Checklist for Phase 1 Research \n\
    \ \nHaving used Design Science Research to design an artifact to address the research\
    \ question \na further reflection on whether the outcomes of this phase of research\
    \ revealed any further \nunderpinning contributing factors between emerging process\
    \ centric technologies, complex \nagri-food supply chains and the cattle farming\
    \ sector was undertaken.  \nThe Multi Perspective Supply Chain Analytics framework\
    \ does analyze the cattle supply chain \nfrom a variety of dimensions. Current\
    \ and historical cattle movement data is analysed giving \na temporal dimension\
    \ that reveals supply chain decisions are complex and not deterministic. \nExogenous\
    \ and endogenous factors influence supply chain decisions. This research has \n\
    revealed that exogenous factors such as extreme weather can have a significant\
    \ impact on \nsupply chain decisions, and while weather events can be forecasted,\
    \ the medium-term \nimpacts such as insufficient feed available on certain farms\
    \ is more difficult to predict.  \nA clear contributing factor in this phase of\
    \ research is the impact of extreme weather events \non supply chain decision\
    \ making in the cattle agri-food sector. This contributing factor will be \nexplored\
    \ in more detailed in Chapter 5, from the risk mitigation perspective. \nA further\
    \ contributing factor identified by the Data Analytics View is the weight of cattle\
    \ on \nsupply chain decisions. Ideally cattle are grown on certain farms (e.g.\
    \ breeding farm, \nbackgrounding farm) until they reach a certain weight and then\
    \ moved to the next stage (e.g. \nfeedlot or processing). The goal of cattle farmers\
    \ is to manage their cattle to ensure the \nstandard deviation of a particular\
    \ herd’s weight is small and the herd is kept separate from \nothers as it moves\
    \ along the supply chain. A narrow standard deviation around a target weight \n\
    at the processor (together with quality attributes) leads to improved revenue\
    \ for the farmer. \nThe research has shown that this objective was not achieved\
    \ in the case study due to the \ndisruption caused by the extreme weather events.\
    \  \nA deeper understanding of these contributing factors influenced the framing\
    \ of the next phase \nof research as an advanced risk management framework would\
    \ provide farmers improved \ninsights and allow them to make supply chain decisions\
    \ which could balance the risk of moving \ncattle to obtain feed while still keeping\
    \ herds together and optimising ultimate price for the \nproduct. While the analysis\
    \ on location and weight has yielded the above insights, it is noted \n \n \n\
    \ \n \n59 \n \nthat further insights could be extracted by including additional\
    \ attributes such as cattle breed, \nand supplier (when young cattle are purchased),\
    \ including these parameters in future research \nusing the multi perspective\
    \ supply chain analytics framework could yield even deeper insights \ninto selection\
    \ of the appropriate cattle breed for the environmental conditions of farms in\
    \ \ncertain regions.  \nThis phase of research has demonstrated that emerging\
    \ process – centric technologies such \nas process mining can address some complex\
    \ agri-food supply chain challenges identifying \ncontributing factors that impact\
    \ the business efficiency and ultimately profitability from \nhistorical event\
    \ data (see Sections 4.4.3, 4.4.4, 4.4.5, 4.4.6). Having access to an extensive\
    \ \ndata set highlighted that agri-food supply chain decision making is not fully\
    \ deterministic which \nwas quantified by the deployment of an additional emerging\
    \ technology in the multi \nperspective process explorer and reinforced by the\
    \ data analytics. These insights can be used \nto design more efficient supply\
    \ chains, the functionality to do this enabled by the novel \nadaption of the\
    \ discovered supply chain models into an early version of a process aware digital\
    \ \ntwin.  \nApplying the Design Science Research Checklist and focusing on the\
    \ contributing factors has \nalso facilitated in the synthesis of the generalizable\
    \ knowledge contribution, the Phase 1 \nresearch has demonstrated that: Multi-perspective\
    \ compliance checking of supply chain event \nlogs against a process standard\
    \ can effectively identify anomalies in supply chain provenance \nand performance.\
    \ Subsequent research indicated that a predominant trend in developing \ndigital\
    \ twins is the utilization for extensive datasets to establish data-driven models\
    \ \n(Peladarinos et al., 2023), also that a combination of simulation, optimization\
    \ and analytics will \nconstitute the supply chain digital twin of the future\

    \ practice-inspired research study aims to conceptualize and design a technology\
    \ solution \ncapable of addressing identified gaps in supply chain risk management.\
    \ An Action Design \nResearch (ADR) methodology is deployed to derive a digitally\
    \ enabled supply chain risk \nmanagement framework (DSCRM). The theoretical elements\
    \ of process orchestration and \nprocess mining, with compliance checking of supply\
    \ chain event data enabled by a process \ndigital twin, were incorporated to derive\
    \ an overarching framework complemented with an IT \nartifact. This was derived\
    \ through multiple build-evaluate iterations, following a “research with \npractice”\
    \ paradigm which encompassed in-depth engagement with industry throughout the\
    \ \nstudy; to build and validate the DSCRM framework iteratively.  \nTwo agri-food\
    \ supply chains, cattle, and bananas were selected to evaluate the framework for\
    \ \nmedium-sized businesses, as these dominate the sector and are most at threat,\
    \ not having \nthe resources to manage these increasing risks. While the framework\
    \ was designed to \nmanage a range of risks, the focus of this research was on\
    \ two key areas of risk, a macro-\nlevel event: extreme weather, and a supply\
    \ management event, environmental condition \nmonitoring in transit. The researcher\
    \ evaluated how the DSCRM framework, operationalized \nthrough an IT artifact,\
    \ was able to detect risk and provide mitigation decision support \neffectively.\
    \ Incorporating process intelligence principles to monitor and control supply\
    \ chain \nrisks is novel in this sector, and the generalizable design principles\
    \ are a research contribution. \nThe design principles are applicable to broader\
    \ areas of supply chain risk management and \ncontrol.  \nAgri-food supply chains\
    \ face several macro-level risks, which vary according to the industry, \nranging\
    \ from diseases to extreme weather events (Diabat et al., 2012), (Pereira et al.,\
    \ 2021). \nEarly risk detection and alerting have been shown to reduce impacts\
    \ across several risk \ncategories, more businesses are developing early detection\
    \ capability through weather or \nsocial media monitoring, news tracking and sensor\
    \ deployment to sense and respond to \nsupply chain disruptions. Mitigation strategies\
    \ adopted by businesses is affected by how \ncompanies perceive and assess risk\
    \ (Gao et al., 2019). Given that the cattle and horticulture \nsupply chains are\
    \ particularly vulnerable to macro-level risk, such as extreme weather, as well\
    \ \nas in-transit quality risk, research focused on  these sectors. Considering\
    \ two additional \nperspectives, i) that small and medium sized businesses dominate\
    \ the agri-food sector and \nare deemed more at risk as they operate in an environment\
    \ of frequently occurring risks and \nare challenged by the substantive investments\
    \ required in risk management (Ali & Gurd, 2020) \nand ii) businesses rate automation\
    \ as the highest requirement for a supply chain control tower \n(SCCT)  (Patsavellas\
    \ et al., 2021), the researcher posed the question: \n \n \n \n \n62 \n \n “How\
    \ can agri-food supply chain risk be monitored and managed using emerging \nprocess\
    \ centric technologies?” \nEarly detection of potential supply chain risk and\
    \ disruption provides the opportunity for \nmitigating actions to be taken, such\
    \ as alternative supply, routing, or alternative market \nallocation; for example,\
    \ diverting product from supermarket distribution to grocery store \ndistribution.\
    \ In the case of cattle supply chains, animals can be moved away from pending\
    \ \ndanger from floods, or those on drought affected farms can be moved timeously\
    \ to better \ngrazing areas. Cattle trucks in transit can be rerouted to avoid\
    \ delays which could benefit both \nanimal welfare and product quality (Jorquera-Chavez\
    \ et al., 2019). In abstracting the problem \nareas, the researcher remained cognizant\
    \ of the broader agri-food domain, and in certain \ncases the broader supply chain\
    \ domain, and has documented the design principles as \ngeneralizable when relevant.\
    \  \nBased on the literature research and broader industry engagement, an Action\
    \ Design \nResearch (ADR) approach (Sein et al., 2011) was selected and used to\
    \ conceptualize a \ndigitally enabled supply chain risk management framework (DSCRM)\
    \ that would be effective \nin facing new supply chain challenges. An IT artifact\
    \ was then created for testing and validating \nthe DSCRM in agricultural food\
    \ (agri-food) supply chains. In-depth case studies were \nconducted in both the\
    \ cattle (case study 1) and banana (case study 2) industries using the \naction\
    \ design research (ADR) methodology, with active engagement with both practitioners\
    \ \nand end users to iteratively improve both the framework and the IT artifact.\
    \ Related work in \nthe areas of cattle and banana supply chains, supply chain\
    \ and risk management, process \nintelligence and orchestration, digital twins\
    \ as well as autonomy and automation are presented \nin Section 5.2. In Section\
    \ 5.3, the overarching methodology applied is presented, and Section \n5.4 describes\
    \ the framework with examples of how it was expressed and evaluated via the \n\
    artifact. The generalizable design principles are presented in Section 5.5. Appendix\
    \ 1 contains \nadditional information on the data collection methods across the\
    \ study cycles and their design.  \n5.2 Related Work \nThe research gap in agri-food\
    \ supply chain risk management is multi-faceted. Moazzam et al. \n(2018) extensively\
    \ reviewed current performance measures in agri-food supply chain \nmanagement\
    \ and found a knowledge gap in both food quality and risk measures and \nsubsequently\
    \ developed a framework based on an enhanced version of the Supply Chain \nOperations\
    \ Reference (SCOR) model (ASCM, 2023), to address this gap. Multi-agent-based\
    \ \nframeworks are emerging for supply chain risk management in manufacturing\
    \ supply chains; \nhowever integration across supply chain partners, which is\
    \ key for risk management remains \nlimited (Giannakis & Louis, 2011). Significant\
    \ research has occurred in handling uncertainty \n \n \n \n \n63 \n \nin agri-food\
    \ supply chains (Borodin et al., 2016); however, a gap exists in the integration\
    \ of \nthese models into platforms that would enable effective decision support\
    \ across the \necosystem. Prior literature reinforces the gap that exists both\
    \ in research as well as in the \nindustrial context.  \n \nRecent structured\
    \ literature reviews into agri-food supply chain risk and resilience (Stone &\
    \ \nRahimifard, 2018; Zhao et al., 2020) as well as digital twining in supply\
    \ chains (Rathore et al., \n2021), (Tonelli et al., 2021) have reinforced the\
    \ research gaps. It has also been established \nthat cattle and banana supply\
    \ chains are significant agri-food businesses worldwide \nexperiencing all the\
    \ risks identified by (Diabat et al., 2012); (Pereira et al., 2021) and (Zhao\
    \ et \nal., 2020), and that a research gap exists in autonomous risk monitoring\
    \ and management of \nthese supply chains, especially for medium sized businesses,\
    \ deemed more at risk and \nchallenged by the substantive investments required\
    \ in risk management (Ali & Gurd, 2020).  \nThe key goal of agri-food supply chain\
    \ risk management is to reduce and where possible \neliminate risk. A proactive\
    \ way to do this is to build supply chain resilience (Sheffi, 2020). \nStone and\
    \ Rahimifard (2018) conducted a systematic literature review into resilience of\
    \ agri-\nfood supply chains. The authors propose a definition of agri-food resilience\
    \ as ‘the collective \nability of agri-food supply chain stakeholders to ensure\
    \ acceptable, sufficient and stable food \nsupplies, at the required times and\
    \ locations, via accurate anticipation of disruptions and the \nuse of strategies\
    \ which delay impact, aid rapid recovery and allow cumulative learning post \n\
    disruption.’ \nThe researcher therefore established a methodology to test the\
    \ proposition that agri-food \nsupply chain risk can be monitored and managed\
    \ semi-autonomously for medium sized \nbusinesses. The overall method applied\
    \ is explained in Section 5.3 below.  \nTracking of packages as well as time and\
    \ temperature sensitive products through a supply \nchain using sensors is a well-established\
    \ practice (Koot et al., 2021). For time and temperature \nsensitive products,\
    \ such as produce supply to large supermarket chains, the use of blue tooth \n\
    enabled (BLE) or radio frequency identification (RFID) enabled sensors which can\
    \ be \nautomatically read by a gateway at the receiving warehouse are increasingly\
    \ being deployed \nas the cost of these sensors decreases (Li et al., 2017). These\
    \ technologies provide a history \nof the product as it has travelled through\
    \ the supply chain, recording time and location, \ntemperature and in some cases\
    \ additional data such as humidity, light, and orientation. The \nevent data are\
    \ recorded on the sensor using store and forward technology and transmitted \n\
    when the sensor passes within the proximity of the fixed gateways (Chamekh et\
    \ al.). The use \nof near real time tracking of products using GPS sensors capable\
    \ of capturing the additional \ndata mentioned above with transmission of the\
    \ data via cellular or satellite systems is \n \n \n \n \n64 \n \noccurring on\
    \ high value and critical products and components but to date has only been \n\
    deployed in limited horticulture supply chain applications (Srinivasan et al.,\
    \ 2017). The cost of \nsuch trackers has been a limiting factor, with reuse of\
    \ the trackers required, as well as the \nprocessing of the significant amount\
    \ of data generated by these tracking systems. \n5.3 Methodology \nAn Action Design\
    \ Research (ADR) was applied, driven by a “research with practice” paradigm \n\
    of engaged scholarship (Rai, 2019), which encompassed in-depth engagement with\
    \ industry \nthroughout the study; to iteratively build and validate the artifacts\
    \ (in this case, the DSCRM \nframework and the supporting IT artifact). ADR is\
    \ well positioned to address industry \nchallenges, while fulfilling academic\
    \ contributions (Sein et al., 2011). We adapted Sein et al.’s \n(2011) recommended\
    \ ADR design, which was further complemented with (Venable et al., \n2016) FEDS\
    \ (Framework for Evaluation in Design Science) guidelines. The study had three\
    \ \nkey phases. Phase 1 consisted of ‘problem formulation’, which focused on the\
    \ study \nmotivation, and theoretical premises driving the research. Section 5.1\
    \ and 5.2 above already \ncovered this aspect. Phase 2 was the iterative ‘build\
    \ and evaluate’ phase where a new digitally \nenabled DSCRM framework was developed\
    \ with incremental build efforts supported by \npractice interventions and evaluation\
    \ efforts. This section details the overarching design \napplied for Phase 2,\
    \ while Section 5.4 presents the resulting outcomes. Phase 3 - ‘Reflections \n\
    and formalized learnings’, was tightly integrated with Phases 1 and 2, where lessons\
    \ learned \nfrom each ADR build and evaluate cycle were deeply reflected upon,\
    \ used as insight to the \nnext cycle(s) and to develop generalizable learnings.\
    \ Section 5.5 presents the summary \noutcomes of Phase 3 presenting core design\
    \ principles derived through the learnings across \nthe overall project. In the\
    \ remainder of this section the detailed design (dominant to Phase 2) \nis described,\
    \ as visually summarized in Figure 17, see Appendix 2 for description of ADR \n\
    cycles.  \n \n \n \n \n65 \n \n \nFigure 17: ADR cycles and data types \nThe overall\
    \ research sought to investigate two agri-food supply chains. As per the set case\
    \ \nselection criteria the two cases had to have; (i) complex supply chain networks\
    \ (e.g., long \ndistances of transportation with multiple stakeholders and handovers)\
    \ that are frequently \nimpacted by logistic and transit risks, (ii) high(er)\
    \ degrees of food safety/compliance and \nquality assurance (e.g. temperature\
    \ sensitivity), (iii) the ability to install sensors without \ncomprising food\
    \ safety protocols, (iv) the researcher was able to get access to data across\
    \ \nthe end-to-end supply chain, and (v) the opportunities to generalize the learnings\
    \ across \nbroader agri-food supply chains. Also, (vi) medium sized farms were\
    \ selected (as justified \nbelow). \nAn Australian cattle supply chain was selected\
    \ for Case Study 1, due to the significant impact \nthat Covid-19 had on these\
    \ supply chains globally (Hobbs, 2021). My previous related \nresearch in this\
    \ sector (Keates, 2019), (Keates et al., 2020) highlighted the benefits of utilizing\
    \ \nsensor data in cattle supply chains in improving farming operations. This\
    \ prior research also \nexamined the benefits of analyzing individual cattle data\
    \ across the supply chain, but not from \na supply chain risk management perspective.\
    \ Focusing on supply chain quality risk of cattle-\nin-transit allows for a missing\
    \ link in the cattle supply chain to be analyzed and provides the \nopportunity\
    \ to integrate the insights back to the farms for root-cause-analysis in the future.\
    \  \nFor Case Study 2, the horticulture agri-food sector was selected. They experience\
    \ high post-\nharvest losses due to handling and temperature management challenges\
    \ while in transit (Aung \n& Chang, 2014), which  was exacerbated during the Covid\
    \ -19 pandemic. Several horticulture \n \n \n \n \n66 \n \nbusinesses and specialists\
    \ participated in the research, with the evaluation of the IT artifact \nbeing\
    \ done in the banana supply chain. The banana sector was selected after both the\
    \ banana \nfarm owners and the banana industry representative highlighted in-transit\
    \ environmental \ncontrol problems which are also documented as challenges internationally\
    \ (Jedermann et al., \n2014).  \nWhile the study outcomes are anticipated to be\
    \ just as applicable to large farms in the \nrespective industries, this research\
    \ was focused on the medium sized farms as these sized \nbusinesses dominate the\
    \ agri-food sector and they are challenged by the investments required \nfor risk\
    \ management (Ali & Gurd, 2020).  Thus, the selected cattle and banana farms had\
    \ to \nbe representative of medium sized farms in their respective industries.\
    \ The medium sized \nfarms are typically privately owned and do not have access\
    \ to the supply chain and information \ntechnology resources of the large corporate\
    \ farming businesses. The relevant national peak \nbodies endorsed the selected\
    \ case studies as representative medium sized farms within \nAustralia.  \nThe\
    \ unit(s) of analysis (UoA) in a supply chain investigation can be at various\
    \ levels of \nabstraction. In the context of this study, based on the granularity\
    \ of data available within the \nstudied agri-food supply chains and the particular\
    \ use cases, the UoA was a truckload of cattle  \nfor case study 1, and a container\
    \ of banana cartons on pallets for case study 2. These are \nstandard consignments\
    \ in the respective industries. Given the risk management focus of this \nstudy,\
    \ they were also very appropriate UoAs, as a change in any of the risk indicators\
    \ (by \ndisruptions in logistics or conditions in transit) can impact an entire\
    \ consignment. \n \nEach case study had multiple cycles, each with a distinct\
    \ build and evaluate goal, and  tightly \nintegrated (see Figure 17). Following\
    \ the FEDS guidelines by Venable et al., (2016), a mix of \nex-ante evaluations\
    \ (i.e., performed to estimate and evaluate the impact of future situations) \n\
    and ex-post evaluations (i.e., the assessment of the implemented system) were\
    \ used with both \nartificial data from simulation and naturalistic data from\
    \ the cattle and banana supply chains.  \n \nA full ADR cycle was completed first\
    \ with Case Study 1 before starting the ADR cycles with \nCase Study 2. Thus,\
    \ Case Study 1 was focused on primarily building and testing the \nframework and\
    \ the IT artifact, while Case Study 2 was primarily focused on evaluating the\
    \ \napplicability of the forming framework and IT artifact in other contexts (in\
    \ this case a different \nagri-food supply chain context).  \n \n \n \n \n \n\
    67 \n \nThe research was designed to engage with diverse participants across the\
    \ phases to \ncontribute to both the building and evaluation of the study outcomes.\
    \ They consisted of 4 \ngroups, each with clearly outlined selection criteria,\
    \ as summarized in Table 6: \n \nParticipant Groups \nSelection Criteria \nGroup\
    \ 1: Business owners, managers, or \nfarmers responsible for agri-food production.\
    \ \n(n=8).  \nManagers who participate in broader industrial \nforums and are\
    \ active in their respective peak \nbodies.  \nGroup 2: Supply chain managers,\
    \ subject matter \nexperts or business analysts responsible for \nimproving the\
    \ supply. (n=13). \nSpecialists involved in supply chain management \nincluding\
    \ risk mitigation. \nGroup 3: Industry representatives responsible \nfor supporting\
    \ and improving the specific agri-\nfood sectors as well as industry consultants.\
    \ \n(n=6). \nMembers of the peak bodies for the respective \nindustries or closely\
    \ associated (including \nbroader \nhorticulture \npeak \nbodies \nand \nconsultants).\
    \ \nGroup 4: logistics and process staff responsible \nfor daily operations. (n=4).\
    \ \nOperational staff associated with the Group 1 \nbusinesses. \nTable 6:Case\
    \ participant groups and selection criteria deployed. \nSeveral data collection\
    \ mechanisms were used, namely, structured interviews, farm visits with \nfocused\
    \ discussions, an online questionnaire, and structured use-case reviews (for evaluating\
    \ \nthe IT artifact). Each of these served a unique purpose and were utilised\
    \ across the different \nstudy cycles (see Figure 17). Appendix 2 provides a detailed\
    \ account of how the different data \ncollection mechanisms were deployed, who\
    \ was involved and how they related to the different \nADR cycles.  \nCommencing\
    \ with Case 1, the beef supply chain, the chief operating officer of a large cattle\
    \ \nbusiness as well as owner of a medium sized business participated in a structured\
    \ in person \ninterview. Structured interviews were also conducted with a supply\
    \ chain analyst and process \nstaff from these businesses as well as specialists\
    \ from the national peak body and \ntechnologists in supply chain tracking. These\
    \ structured interviews were followed by farm visits \nto both farms where focused\
    \ discussions were undertaken, and the framework reviewed. The \nowner of the\
    \ medium sized cattle business participated in further structured use-case reviews\
    \ \nof the DSCRM framework and IT Artifact. On completion of Cycle 4, the banana\
    \ industry (Case \n2) was engaged with a structured interview with the owner of\
    \ a medium sized banana business \nas well as farm visit. The owner was endorsed\
    \ by the national peak body as being \nrepresentative of medium sized banana growers.\
    \ An online questionnaire was conducted \nacross the broader horticulture industry\
    \ including the owners of vegetable, avocado and \nmacadamia businesses, horticulture\
    \ peak bodies as well as specialised horticulture \nconsultants, to assess whether\
    \ the DSCRM developed in the cattle supply chain use case had \nbroader generalisability.\
    \ The final DSCRM framework and IT Artifact was developed in a series \nof review\
    \ and feedback cycles with the banana farmers.  \n \n \n \n \n68 \n \n \nExpert\
    \ engagement from the study outset, assisted in further problematizing the gaps\
    \ \n(Alvesson & Sandberg, 2013), with a clearer understanding and embedding of\
    \ the supply \nchain risk challenges and more specifically the supporting IT gaps.\
    \ It also assisted to maintain \nengaged scholarship through the design and evaluation\
    \ of the DSCRM framework and IT \nArtifact. \n5.4 Developing the Digital Supply\
    \ Chain Risk Management Framework \nThe study used pre-study and initial engagement\
    \ with the relevant practice groups to \nformulate early requirements, as follows:\
    \  \n- \nIdentification of the types of risk, both exogenous and endogenous, that\
    \ agri-food \nsupply chains could face, to define the framework’s scope. \n- \n\
    The need for a semi-autonomous solution (e.g., ability to preconfigure routes\
    \ and \nenvironmental monitoring thresholds such as temperature, requiring minimum\
    \ manual \ninput). \n- \nSystem to provide automatic alerts if the consignment\
    \ does not reach certain \ncheckpoints in each time window (e.g., configuration\
    \ of checkpoints using a geofence \nwith time parameters).  \n- \nAlerts to be\
    \ configured to be actionable (e.g., by sms/text message or instruction to \n\
    person or system) \n- \nAdequate connectivity for trackers along the cattle supply\
    \ chain routes, trackers to be \ncapable of running independent of the cattle\
    \ truck’s electrical systems (to mitigate the \nrisk of trackers affecting the\
    \ vehicle battery).  \n- \nBanana consignment tracking to be expanded to include\
    \ pallet level tracking due to \ncross docking on some routes. \n- \nConfiguration\
    \ of risk mitigation digital twin to be “no code” (i.e., requiring no specialist\
    \ \ndevelopment skills). \n- \nRetrospective analysis required (i.e., the ability\
    \ to analyze historical consignments for \npredictors of risk events).  \nThese\
    \ requirements were considered in conjunction with the theoretical aspects elicited\
    \ from \nliterature research. For example, firstly, the theories of process orchestration\
    \ (2.6.1.2) and \nprocess intelligence (2.6.2) from the business process management\
    \ discipline are applied to \noperationalise some of these requirements within\
    \ the framework, through managing workflows \nand enabling  low code configuration\
    \ (Weske, 2007); (Dumas et al., 2018). The notion that \n \n \n \n \n69 \n \n\
    processes can be discovered by a process mining algorithm based on event data\
    \ and that \nevent data may also be compliance checked against a reference model,\
    \ was also applied (Van \nDer Aalst, 2016); (Leemans et al., 2018). Secondly,\
    \ from the supply chain management \ndiscipline, a new concept was introduced\
    \ that supply chain risk can be detected by compliance \nchecking supply chain\
    \ events against a risk mitigation reference model using process \nintelligence\
    \ methodologies, building on the research of Ivanov and Dolgui (2019), that supply\
    \ \nchain risk can be mitigated using advanced track and trace systems. Thirdly\
    \ the concepts from \ndigital twin research as described by  Rathore et al. (2021)\
    \ and Kalaboukas et al. (2021) are \napplied in the configuration of the risk\
    \ mitigation process. \nThe combination of the initial requirements from practice\
    \ and literature insights were used as \nthe basis to commence the design of the\
    \ DSCRM framework and related IT artifact. They were \nconstantly revisited at\
    \ the multiple build and evaluate cycles of the project, with the application\
    \ \nof different data gathering points (as outlined in Section 5.3). A fundamental\
    \ component of \nsupply chain risk management is risk classification (Diabat et\
    \ al., 2012), and an adapted agri-\nfood risk classification is presented in Section\
    \ 5.4.1 as a core component of the framework. \nThe resulting DSCRM Framework’s\
    \ key stages and process flows are presented in Section \n5.4.2, with the conceptual\
    \ architecture for supporting technologies outlined in Section 5.4.3 \nLearnings\
    \ obtained from operationalizing these requirements with the theoretical insights,\
    \ \nincluding extensions that were identified and actioned as the project progressed,\
    \ were \ncaptured systematically throughout the study to form the design principals\
    \ which are presented \nin Section 5.6.  \n5.4.1 Adapted Agri-Food Risk Classification\
    \ \nA key requirement for the framework was to establish a classification for\
    \ the types of agri-food \nrisks. The agri-food risk classification of Pereira\
    \ et al. (2021) was considered a refinement of \nprevious categorizations; for\
    \ example Diabat et al. (2012). The researcher reviewed the \ngeneral supply chain\
    \ risk research of Ivanov and Dolgui (2019), Sheffi (2020) as well as Zhao \n\
    et al. (2020) in compiling an expanded version of the Pereira et al. (2021) risk\
    \ classifications \nand definitions for this research. Risk “type” was added to\
    \ the classification to differentiate \nbetween the risks that are exogenous,\
    \ where the agri-food supply chain stakeholders have no \ncontrol over nor influence\
    \ on the risk and endogenous where there is control and influence. In \nadding\
    \ “type” to the classifications, it became apparent that some classifications\
    \ will have both \ntypes, as shown in Table 7 below. In the exogenous classes,\
    \ while the supply chain \nstakeholders have no control or influence, they can\
    \ still take action to avoid, mitigate or recover \nfrom the event. These classifications\
    \ have been incorporated into the DSCRM Framework as \nexplained in Section 5.5.2.\

    \ Flow \nThe logic applied in the development of the DSCRM framework, in response\
    \ to the problem \nstatements articulated by the Participant Groups, was that\
    \ the concept of compliance \nchecking, using process mining techniques against\
    \ a process standard, established from an \nadapted process aware model (process\
    \ aware digital twin) established in Phase 1 could be \nfurther developed for\
    \ risk management. Phase 1 furthermore established contributing factors \nbetween\
    \ external risk factors and the beef supply chain.    \nThe DSCRM Framework consists\
    \ of six stages (see Figure 18). Stages 1 to 3 configure the \nsensors, systems,\
    \ and risk management digital twin, while stages 4 to 6 monitor and manage \n\
    \ \n \n \n \n71 \n \nrisk while continuously improving the framework. The processes\
    \ are detailed in the description \nof each of the stages, while the build and\
    \ configuration of the IT Artifact, to execute the process \nsteps, with its supporting\
    \ technologies, are presented in Section 5.5.7. As shown in Figure 16, \nthe framework\
    \ went through eight review cycles in its development. The novelty of this \n\
    framework explained in Section 5.7, is the novel combination of a process aware\
    \ digital twin \nwith a business process management system to rapidly configure\
    \ semi-autonomous, domain \nspecific supply chain risk management solutions. \n\

    \ supply chains at potential risk. \nThe DSCRM framework versions 1 and 2 included\
    \ a process for initially mapping the supply \nchains and quantifying the risk\
    \ by calculating two SCOR supply chain performance attributes: \nagility (measuring\
    \ adaptability and value at risk) and responsiveness (measuring order \nfulfillment\
    \ cycle time) aligning to Moazzam’s approach (Moazzam et al., 2018). The SCOR\
    \ \nmodel defines agility as the ability to respond to external influences, and\
    \ responsiveness as \nthe speed in which tasks are performed. Feedback from the\
    \ stakeholders in Cycle 2 was that \nthis step was time consuming, and the approach\
    \ detracted from the semi-autonomous \nrequirements. This stage has subsequently\
    \ been simplified in version 3, with the selection of \nthe agri-food supply chain\
    \ to be monitored made directly by the farmer/user/stakeholder.  \nSome agri-food\
    \ businesses will have single supply chains, such as the banana supply chain \n\
    in this study where a specific product family, Cavendish, is sold through a distributor\
    \ to several \nsupermarket and grocery chains. In such a use case the farmer/user/stakeholder\
    \ will decide \nwhether every consignment is to be tracked, or only those to certain\
    \ locations, such as the \nlonger routes involving several changes to mode of\
    \ transport and cross docking. The cattle \nsupply chain has several supply chains\
    \ with different breeds of cattle and different farming \noperations such as exclusively\
    \ grass-fed animals or animals that are initially grass fed before \nbeing fed\
    \ grain in feedlots. The framework and supporting technology have been designed\
    \ to \nmonitor and control extensive supply chains, so they are technically capable\
    \ of monitoring all \nagri-food supply chains in a business. For practical deployment\
    \ there will be a cost involved \nin deploying sensors and the supporting technologies,\
    \ and understanding these costs will \nallow the farmer/user/stakeholder to make\
    \ cost benefit decisions regarding how many of the \nagri-food supply chains are\
    \ monitored and managed.  \n5.5.2 Stage 2: Data collection, transformation, and\
    \ process discovery \nBased on the industry requirements that an elevated level\
    \ of automation is required for the \nDSCRM Framework, a novel approach has been\
    \ applied to obtaining supply chain event data \nand generating the current state\
    \ supply chain map. Tracking and quality monitoring sensors \nare attached to\
    \ agri-food consignments and tracked to market. Real-time location, \ntemperature,\
    \ light exposure, and orientation data are ingested and transformed into XES \n\
    (Extensible Event Stream) format in preparation for the process discovery stage\
    \ (IEEE, 2019). \nOnce the sensors are attached to the consignments, the sensor\
    \ data are immediately available \nin real-time. The supply chain event data collected\
    \ via the sensors contains global position \nsystem (GPS) coordinates as well\
    \ as quality data such as consignment temperature with a \ntime and date stamp,\
    \ which is the required format for process mining (Van Der Aalst, 2016). \n \n\
    \ \n \n \n74 \n \nThis step can be repeated across all consignments and supply\
    \ chains. Such an approach is \nsemi-autonomous, requiring a low degree of engagement\
    \ with agri-food business owners, \nsupply chain managers and staff who are often\
    \ multi-skilling with busy workdays.  \nNext, the collected event data are analyzed\
    \ using a process mining tool (inductive visual miner \nby Leemans (Leemans et\
    \ al., 2018)) which discovers the agri-food supply chain as shown in \nFigure\
    \ 19 below.  Such an application of process discovery for supply chain is of relevance\
    \ to \nthe agri-food domain where control of the supply chain changes as products\
    \ move from the \nfarms through consolidating distribution centers and ultimately\
    \ to the wholesale and retail \ncustomers. Such control changes, also experienced\
    \ in other industries, often lead to “loss of \nsupply chain visibility” and consequently,\
    \ farmers, whose revenue is dependent on the selling \nprice wholesalers receive\
    \ from retailers, cannot proactively mitigate risk associated with \nproduct delivery\
    \ and quality. This novel approach of discovering, and later managing and \ncontrolling\
    \ (see stage 4, section 5.5.4) the supply chain, provides end to end visibility,\
    \ allowing \nthe agri-food business owners to intervene when risk events are detected.\
    \ For this research \nthe assumption was made that the endogenous risk factors\
    \ fall into the process control and \nlogistics categories of Table 7 and that\
    \ these would be managed through the supply chain \nsensor analytics described\
    \ above. \n \nFigure 19: Discovering supply chain routes from event data ( screenshot\
    \ from HPIM). \nThe discovered agri-food supply chain is converted from its process\
    \ tree format to BPMN and \nstored in the risk mitigation digital twin process\
    \ repository. The discovered supply chain shows \nthe exact routing of the agri-food\
    \ consignment. In order to gather additional routing option \ninformation additional\
    \ tracking can be conducted during “disruptive events” for example \nextreme weather\
    \ or traffic congestion ( e.g., special events causing road closures). In addition,\
    \ \nsuch data can also be mined from historical event data if available. Once\
    \ collected the \nalternatives can be evaluated and prioritized before being stored\
    \ in risk mitigation repository. \nAt this stage integration to the data and information\
    \ required for the macro event monitor is \nalso established. The macro event\
    \ monitor is a component of the digital twin that monitors for \n \n \n \n \n\
    75 \n \nexogenous risk factors for the types listed in Table 7. More businesses\
    \ are developing early \ndetection capability through weather or social media\
    \ monitoring, news tracking and sensor \ndeployment to sense and respond to supply\
    \ chain disruptions. Mitigation strategies adopted \nby businesses is affected\
    \ by how companies perceive and assess risk (Gao et al., 2019). The \nsources\
    \ of data and information required to monitor for these exogenous factors vary\
    \ \ndepending on the type of agri-food products being farmed, their location,\
    \ and markets. A \ncommon risk is extreme weather, which has been included in\
    \ the configuration of the IT artifact \nfor the two case studies. Inclusion of\
    \ other risks such as environmental and diseases, political \nunrest, government\
    \ regulation, labor shortages and Covid -19 related disruptions follow the \n\
    same process for connecting with a reliable data source and processing the information.\
    \ Data \nsources will include specialized services such as government and research\
    \ institute websites \nas well as news and social media listening. Agencies such\
    \ as the New South Wales \nGovernment Department of Primary Industries provide\
    \ regular updates on pests and diseases \nto the agri-food sector (DPI, 2020),\
    \ as well as peak bodies such as the Australian Banana \nGrowers Council (ABGC,\
    \ 2021), alerts from these agencies and peak bodies can be integrated \nto DSCRM\
    \ system. Integration with the data source is established through an API (application\
    \ \nprogramming interface) to ingest the data, and for the use cases an API was\
    \ established with \na weather station on each farm. For broader application of\
    \ this capability APIs would be \nestablished with weather forecasting services\
    \ covering the end-to-end supply chain.  \n5.5.3 Stage 3: Risk Mitigation Digital\
    \ Twin Configuration \nThe DSCRM digital twin differs from the generalized framework\
    \ of a digital twin developed by \nIvanov and Dolgui (2020) which incorporates\
    \ a conceptual simulation and optimization engine \nfor risk management and the\
    \ digital twin classifications of Kritzinger et al. (2018) as it is a \n“process\
    \ reference model” digital twin. It is a complete model of the supply chain process\
    \ \ncombined with a decision model, or models, to create a mitigation plan for\
    \ anticipated risk \nsituations that could arise when consignments of agri-food\
    \ are in transit. The DSCRM digital \ntwin had to be configurable by a domain\
    \ subject matter specialist, not skilled information \ntechnologists. Without\
    \ such functionality, industry adoption of the DSCRM framework would \nbe limited,\
    \ especially in the medium sized business sector. This challenge was solved by\
    \ \nconfiguring the digital twin on the base of the discovered supply chain from\
    \ Stage 2.  \nThe digital twin is configured by firstly selecting the discovered\
    \ supply chain from the process \nrepository and then connecting the preconfigured\
    \ risk mitigation sub processes, in the form of \ndecision models from the risk\
    \ mitigation library. These processes include a complete \nprescribed workflow\
    \ which is executed by the BPMS, to avoid, mitigate, or recover from a \nsupply\
    \ chain risk event,  inputted setpoints, including checkpoints (geo-fences) along\
    \ the \nsupply chain to ensure that the transportation is on schedule, and high\
    \ and low temperature \n \n \n \n \n76 \n \nlimits for the actual products in\
    \ transit. The cycle of configuration of this process aware digital \ntwin, following\
    \ the steps described in Section 5.4  is a) select the agri-food consignment route,\
    \ \nwith its alternative routing options from the process repository b) set the\
    \ DSCRM to start live \ntracking the consignment, which streams the tracking data\
    \ into the solution and automatically \ncompliance checks, monitors and manages\
    \ the consignment until complete.  This approach \nis unique and effectively a\
    \ “no code” configuration approach to a supply chain risk mitigation \ndigital\
    \ twin. Examples of this simplified configuration approach are given in Figure\
    \ 20. Overlaid \non the supply chain checkpoint, consignment temperature range\
    \ and weather alerting input \ntemplate are risk mitigation digital twin processes\
    \ that are uploaded from the process modeler \n(or external source) to the risk\
    \ mitigation process repository by a slider bar. Once in the \nrepository, the\
    \ digital twin processes are connected to the discovered supply chain to create\
    \ \nthe risk mitigation digital twin.   \n \nFigure 20: A composite representation\
    \ of the risk management digital twin configuration ( screenshots from \nHPIM)\
    \ \nA similar approach was adopted for the macro event monitor component of the\
    \ digital twin. A \ndecision model was pre - configured to manage the triggering\
    \ of weather-related alerts and \nwas placed in the risk mitigation library. For\
    \ additional exogenous events as classified in \nTable75, similar configurable\
    \ decision models may be developed.  \nWith post-harvest losses in horticulture\
    \ due to handling and temperature being as high as 50% \n(Aung & Chang, 2014),\
    \ close monitoring of the handling (for example, wait and transit times \nfor\
    \ time sensitive consignments) and temperature management throughout the transit\
    \ period \nis critical.  \n \n \n \n \n77 \n \n5.5.4 Stage 4: Data processing\
    \ and decision support \nIn this semi-autonomous stage, supply chain event data\
    \ collected by the sensors is streamed \nto the DSCRM risk mitigation digital\
    \ twin, and the BPMS directs the process instance through \nthe decision models\
    \ where location event data are compared to the tolerances configured for \neach\
    \ checkpoint and consignment quality data: for example, temperature is compared\
    \ to \nspecified setpoints. When a threshold is detected by the decision model\
    \ the appropriate \navoidance, mitigation or recovery workflow is triggered. Concurrently\
    \ the macro-event monitor \ndata are also streamed to the DSCRM risk mitigation\
    \ digital twin, with the required workflow \nexecuted by the BPMS when a threshold\
    \ is reached. The DSCRM framework and IT Artifact \nhave the capability of prescribing\
    \ action for automatic execution. For example, DSCRM could \nissue a direct instruction\
    \ to a truck driver to reroute or an automatic refrigeration controller on \n\
    a container to adjust temperature. The framework includes alerting of key personnel\
    \ via \nconfigurable methods; for example, sms/text message or email for urgent\
    \ manual intervention. \nSuch alerts occur as soon as monitored parameters as\
    \ shown in Figure 20 exceed the stated \nthresholds. The persons ( personas) or\
    \ systems required to be alerted is configurable through \nframework ( expressed\
    \ through the IT Artifact). In the Beef Supply Chain, the Farm Manager \nand cattle\
    \ truck driver were alerted through sms/text message, for the Banana Supply Chain\
    \ \nthe Farm Manager and Administration Manager.  \n5.5.5 Stage 5: Visualization\
    \ and control \nThe DSCRM framework is designed to produce actionable insights\
    \ for an agri-food business. \nCentralizing data and presenting it in a venue\
    \ on a dashboard coordinates decision making \nespecially in times of supply chain\
    \ disruption (Sheffi, 2020). Stage 5 has been designed to \nleverage the insights\
    \ generated in Stage 4. It provides visualization of the events along the \nsupply\
    \ chains which have had risk detected, as well as providing immediate drill down\
    \ into the \nalerts and progress on mitigation actions. Once a risk has been identified\
    \ the BPMS also \ndirects compliance checking of the process instances using the\
    \ inductive visual miner \nalgorithm (Leemans et al., 2018) against the digital\
    \ twin. This combination of process \ncompliance checking with the digital twin\
    \ provides a deeper level of insight, visually showing \nthe number of cases impacted\
    \ and enabling replay of previous process instances extracted \nfrom the data\
    \ lake.  The banana use case included such a dashboard  - see Figure 21 below.\
    \  \n \n \n \n \n \n78 \n \n \nFigure 21: Banana farmer and researcher review\
    \ the tracking of a banana consignment ( image supplied by \nbanana farm). \n\
    5.5.6 Stage 6: Risk Mitigation Digital Twin Continuous Improvement  \nTo enable\
    \ continuous improvement of the digital twin, event data from each consignment\
    \ is \nstored in the data lake, classified according to route and product. On\
    \ a preset routine the \nhistorical process instances are compliance checked through\
    \ the digital twin model with fitness \ndata \npresented \nand \nvisualized. \n\
    When \nfitness \nthresholds \nare \nexceeded \nthe \nfarmer/user/stakeholder is\
    \ prompted to update the digital twin. Using the inductive visual miner \nfiltering\
    \ techniques new digital twin models can be extracted in this stage and uploaded\
    \ to the \ndigital twin process repository. \n5.5.7 DSCRM Framework: Conceptual\
    \ Architecture  \nThe conceptual architecture to support the DSCRM framework is\
    \ illustrated in Figure 22 below. \nThe framework has been expressed through the\
    \ configuration of an IT artifact. This allows \nindustry representatives to evaluate\
    \ the applicability and usefulness of such a framework in \naddressing the industry\
    \ problem of agri-food supply chain risk, while also demonstrating the \noutcomes\
    \ of the theoretical contributions. The IT artifact has been built on the theoretical\
    \ \nelements and practice inspired considerations captured in the DSCRM framework.\
    \ It was \nconfigured to ingest data from commercially available supply chain\
    \ sensors and built using \ncommercially available IT solution components. The\
    \ key considerations used in the \nconfiguration of the IT artifact ensure that\
    \ the DSCRM framework is agnostic to the type of IT \nsolution components used,\
    \ for example, the BPMS. A further consideration is that selected \n \n \n \n\
    \ \n79 \n \nexecution technologies are appropriate for the agri-food supply chain\
    \ domain, capable of being \nconfigured by industry specialists and not requiring\
    \ specialized information technology skills \nto operate. This architecture can\
    \ be cost effectively configured using open-source solutions \nwith efficient\
    \ deployment on a cloud service platform. The user interface managed through the\
    \ \nBPMS model builder provides an efficient “no code”, drag and drop experience\
    \ for the agri-\nfood supply chain user to configure the risk mitigation digital\
    \ twin. The novel integration of IoT \nsensors, process mining and process compliance\
    \ algorithms, as well as a BPM model builder \nwith event management orchestrated\
    \ by the BPMS platform is explained below.  \n \nFigure 22: DSCRM Conceptual architecture\
    \ \n \n \n \n \n \n \n80 \n \n5.5.8 Supply chain location and condition monitoring\
    \ sensors \nA key component of the enabling technologies is a sensor which can\
    \ be attached to the agri-\nfood consignment and provide location data as well\
    \ as monitoring of conditions such as \ntemperature. A sensing solution utilizing\
    \ a low power wide area network technology was \nsought, and a provider found\
    \ with sensors that connect via narrow band IoT, or Narrow Band \nIoT (NB-IoT)\
    \ communication. During Case 1, cycle 4 evaluations the sensors were found to\
    \ \nperform satisfactorily, however the NB-IoT coverage was not comprehensive\
    \ enough across \nthe cattle supply chain routes. Feedback was provided to the\
    \ supplier who subsequently \ndeveloped store and forward capabilities, enabling\
    \ data to be logged when there is no \nconnectivity and subsequently transmitted\
    \ as soon as connectivity is established. These \nupdated sensors were evaluated\
    \ in Case 2, cycle 8 and found to be satisfactory. The sensors, \nwhich provide\
    \ the essential supply chain event data, connect via NB-IoT to a cloud service,\
    \ \nusing MQTT (message queue telemetry transport) protocols and are subsequently\
    \ ingested \ninto the DSCRM IT Artifact via API.  \n5.5.9 Business Process Management\
    \ System \nThe core platform is an integration of several commercially available\
    \ solutions all of which are \navailable in open source as well as having enhanced\
    \ licensed versions. Central to the platform \nis a business process management\
    \ system (BPMS), Camunda (Camunda, 2019), which \naccording to (Geiger et al.,\
    \ 2018) is one of only three that support native BPMN 2.0 execution \nas well\
    \ as having efficient functionality (A. Median, 2017). This BPMS is used to process,\
    \ \norchestrate, and execute all activities including ingestion of sensor data,\
    \ digital twin model \nbuilding, the integration of decision modelling (DMN) models\
    \ for decision modelling, \ngenerating alerts from the digital twin, as well as\
    \ the execution of the process intelligence \nsolution (process mining and process\
    \ compliance checking). The core platform also includes \na data ingestion solution,\
    \ ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), for which the Pentaho (Pentaho, \n2021), open-source\
    \ version was used. Inductive visual miner (Leemans et al., 2018) was \nselected\
    \ as the process mining and compliance checking solution, and its source code\
    \ was \npackaged as a self-contained executable process, a microservice, on the\
    \ platform. Apache \nCassandra (Apache, 2021), was used as the canonical database\
    \ for the process repository. \nData streaming and stream processor technology\
    \ completed the vertical services. \n5.5.10 Risk Mitigation Digital Twin Configuration\
    \ \nThe configuration of the digital twin is a novel application of BPMS and process\
    \ mining \ntechnology. The supply chain is discovered by the process mining algorithm\
    \ and converted to \na BPMN diagram which the workflow directs to the risk mitigation\
    \ process repository, as shown \nin Figure 22. In the initial configuration several\
    \ generic risk identification and mitigation process \n \n \n \n \n81 \n \nmodels\
    \ with decision algorithms and threshold input screens were developed using the\
    \ \nBPMS’s process model builder and were stored in the risk mitigation process\
    \ repository. The \nuser selects these sub processes and connects them with the\
    \ discovered supply chain to \ncreate the executable risk mitigation digital twin.\
    \ In an equivalent manner preconfigured sub \nprocesses have been created for\
    \ the macro event monitors; these processes include \nconfiguration of the APIs\
    \ in the executable component of the process model builder as well as \ninput\
    \ tables for setting the thresholds, as shown in Figure 20.  \n5.5.11 Event data\
    \ processing, monitoring, and control \nOnce the digital twin is configured the\
    \ actual monitoring and control commences with the \nsupply chain event data being\
    \ transformed to XES format and managed by the BPMS through \nthe digital twin\
    \ workflow. The macro event data are similarly processed through the digital twin\
    \ \nworkflow. The architecture provides for visualization of the alerts and graphical\
    \ displays of the \nconsignments and macro events being tracked; see Figure 23\
    \ below.  \n \n \nFigure 23: Macro event monitor tracking weather along supply\
    \ chain consignment route (screenshots from \nHPIM) \nKey functionality delivered\
    \ in this stage has been the ability to monitor the supply chain \nconsignments\
    \ for both exogenous and endogenous risks semi-autonomously as shown in \nFigure\
    \ 24 below. This step not only provides alerting and the mitigation workflows\
    \ (examples \ngiven in Figure 20), but it also proactively alerts via sms and\
    \ email which allows owners of \nmedium sized agri-food businesses to continue\
    \ with their numerous other daily tasks with the \nknowledge that their consignments\
    \ are being continuously monitored as well as macro or \nexogenous threats.  \n\
    \ \n \n \n \n82 \n \n \nFigure 24: DSCRM Consignment status (screenshots from\
    \ HPIM) \nThe workflow alerts are published to the prescribed users, with escalation\
    \ occurring if \nresponses are not received within the set time limits. The workflow\
    \ also issues risk mitigation \nadvice via sms and email. The functionality exists\
    \ to automatically prescribe direct outcomes, \nfor example automatically adjusting\
    \ the temperature in a refrigerated container where this \ntechnology is available\
    \ on the container. Once a risk event is detected through the digital twin \n\
    process, the BPMS manages the execution of the compliance checking process using\
    \ the \ninductive visual miner which provides additional insight and visibility\
    \ to the risk situation, \nvisually displaying the process logs as they pass through\
    \ the digital twin, as well as being able \nto replay historical events for scenario\
    \ analysis; see Figure 25.  \n \nFigure 25: Replaying historical consignments\
    \ through the discovered supply chain (screenshots from HPIM). \nThe same historical\
    \ replay functionality is used to test the fitness of the digital twin models,\
    \ \nwith the inductive visual miner’ s filtering functionality used to improve\
    \ models. These new \ndigital twin models are exported to the process repository\
    \ providing a continuous \nimprovement process based on ongoing risk monitoring.\
    \  \n \n \n \n \n83 \n \n5.6 Framework evaluation and results \nLearnings and\
    \ reflections were systematically captured throughout the study, as well as the\
    \ \npre-study and initial engagement. A research diary was maintained in Microsoft\
    \ OneNote and \nupdated after every engagement with the participants. The design\
    \ principles that are \npresented in Table 6 below were derived inductively, following\
    \ the evaluation of the various \ncycles of the framework and IT Artifact development,\
    \ and from the various comments made \nby the participants, collated in a mind\
    \ map, from which common themes and principles were \ncollated and categorized.\
    \ Systematically capturing learnings is an important part of any ADR \nstudy (Sein\
    \ et al., 2011). The learnings, obtained from the participants (see Table 6) and\
    \ \ncycles and collection types (Appendix 2) were systematically recorded digitally\
    \ and later \nclassified in the following classes: i) Data Collection ii) Framework\
    \ Design iii) Architecture \nDesign iv) Useability v) Business Value and vi) Generalizability,\
    \ influenced by the FEDS \nframework (Venable et al., 2016).  \nThe key learnings\
    \ are: \n- \nFor refrigerated consignments such as were used in the banana case\
    \ study, having \nnear real time location of the container to provide timely and\
    \ proactive risk mitigating \nactionable insights is dependent on the mode of\
    \ transport. During road transport \nproactive rerouting can mitigate the risk\
    \ of delays (e.g., flooded roads). For the rail \ntransport mode, fewer mitigation\
    \ options are available (for the banana case study rail \nnetwork). However historical\
    \ examples of container carriages being left at a siding \nresulting in the complete\
    \ loss of a banana consignment, as cited by the banana farmer, \nshow there is\
    \ still value in this level of tracking. The ability to mine historical data also\
    \ \nprovides insight into appropriate modes of transport based on past supply\
    \ chain \ndisruptions.  \n- \nFor temperature tracking of the cattle truck environment\
    \ or banana consignment (pallet \nlevel) the ability to develop timely and proactive\
    \ risk mitigations is dependent on the \navailability of the data. For the cattle\
    \ supply chain, the constraint is connectivity with \nthe data stored and then\
    \ forwarded as soon as cellular connectivity is available. Should \nrisk events\
    \ occur e.g., conditions on the cattle truck exceed thresholds when no \nconnectivity\
    \ is available, alerting and mitigation steps are delayed. However, the cattle\
    \ \nsupply chain stakeholders still saw this as a positive step for animal welfare\
    \ and \nultimate product quality, acknowledging that improved/alternative connectivity\
    \ systems \nwould reduce time to implement risk mitigation. \n- \nThe banana case\
    \ study highlighted that although stored data were only transmitted \nwhen the\
    \ container reached the distribution center or an intermediate node (i.e., when\
    \ \n \n \n \n \n84 \n \nthe container doors were opened), the temperatures during\
    \ transportation were within \nthe threshold limits. The near real time data that\
    \ was transmitted during the unloading \nand handling stage highlighted that the\
    \ consignments were under risk during this \nperiod, exceeding their temperature\
    \ thresholds, which, depending on the duration of \nhigher temperature exposure,\
    \ has a direct impact on product quality. In a further \ndemonstration of value\
    \ during the course of the trial a pallet of bananas was \nunaccounted for at\
    \ a distribution centre. The banana farmer was about to be paid for \none pallet\
    \ less, when he was able to demonstrate via the tracking system that the pallet\
    \ \nwas in the distribution centre.  \n- \nBoth use cases highlighted the value\
    \ of semi-autonomous processing of the supply \nchain and macro event data. In\
    \ the ex-ante trials (Cycles 3 and 7) trackers were \nattached on trial consignments\
    \ with the data visualized only. Stakeholders from both \ncases observed that\
    \ manually observing deviations was impractical, especially once \nseveral consignments\
    \ were in transit. These steps enabled a level of change \nmanagement, developing\
    \ an appreciation for the benefits of semi-autonomous supply \nchain risk monitoring.\
    \   \nThese reflections together with the structured feedback processes in both\
    \ the cattle and \nbanana supply chains, and evaluation across the broader horticulture\
    \ sector have pointed to \ngeneralizable observations forming the basis for the\
    \ design principles presented here. The \ncategorization of the design principles\
    \ for DSCRM is presented in Table 8 below: \nDP \nNumber \nDesign Principle with\
    \ supporting insights from the Action Design Research \napproach \n1 \nMeta Level\
    \ Design Principles \nOverarching design principles that shape the functionality\
    \ of a DSCRM system. \n \n1A \nDP: Risk monitoring and management should include\
    \ both exogenous (macro/ external) \nand endogenous (micro/ internal) events.\
    \  \nContext and Rationale: The ADR interviewee responses (A, B, C, E, G) highlighted\
    \ the \nimpact of labor shortages and extreme weather (exogenous) as well as in\
    \ transit \nenvironmental control problems leading to quality risks (endogenous).\
    \ The main risk to \nagri-food supply chains is agri-food safety, especially with\
    \ perishable foods (Moazzam et \nal., 2018), and these supply chains are becoming\
    \ more complex and therefore more \nvulnerable (Zhao et al., 2020). Agri-food\
    \ risks include both macro or exogenous events \n(Trkman & McCormack, 2009), (Diabat\
    \ et al., 2012) and endogenous (Pereira et al., \n2021). It is therefore a critical\
    \ and novel approach to have both exogenous and \nendogenous risk factors monitored\
    \ across agri-food supply chains as well as to collect \ndata on the possible\
    \ relationships and correlations between the risk categories for \nspecific agri-food\
    \ supply chains.      \n \n \n \n \n85 \n \n1B \nDP: Risk mitigation digital twins\
    \ to be used for real-time process risk management to \nenable identification\
    \ and mitigation of risks in a timely and proactive manner.  \nContext and Rationale:\
    \ Expressing risk management scenarios in a process diagram \nusing BPMN standards\
    \ enables collaboration with practitioners, as evidenced with \ninterviewees A,\
    \ B, C, E and G in the ADR process. It also facilitates governance, a key \nconsideration\
    \ in such frameworks (Kalaboukas et al., 2021), due to the explicit notation \n\
    of the decision logic. Process management aligns demand led supply chains (Trkman,\
    \ \n2013) and process mining is a methodology for discovery in complex supply\
    \ chains (Lau \net al., 2009). Applying process intelligence to a risk management\
    \ process reference \nmodel is a novel application of compliance checking, as\
    \ described by (Van Der Aalst, \n2016) and (Leemans et al., 2018).  \n1C \nDP:\
    \ Effective monitoring and management of supply chain risk factors requires \n\
    autonomous systems due to the increasing complexity of supply chain networks.\
    \ \nContext and Rationale: Interviewees A, B, C, D, E, G, and H from the ADR process\
    \ \nhighlighted that it is time consuming and non-productive for supply chain\
    \ management \nstakeholders in any supply chain to monitor risks “manually” based\
    \ on situational \nupdates. The increasing complexity of supply chain networks,\
    \ including demand driven \nfactors further drives the need for autonomous decision\
    \ support (Sheffi, 2020), (Cooke, \n2014), and (Bentz, 2014).  \n2 \nDSCRM Framework\
    \ Design Principles \n2A \nDP: Framework to be agnostic to IT systems and platforms.\
    \ \nContext and Rationale: This is a fundamental design principle as the purpose\
    \ of the IT \nArtifact is to operationalize the framework so that the practitioners\
    \ participating in the \nADR process can test and validate the framework with\
    \ real world data. Applying this \ndesign principle embraces the socio-technical\
    \ constructs (Gregor et al., 2020) from the \nperspective that practitioners can\
    \ contextualize the framework being deployable across \nvarious industrial IoT\
    \ platforms. The principle was reinforced by the fact that ADR \nparticipants\
    \ with IT systems (A(&D), B and E(&H)) had different systems.  \n2B \nDP: The\
    \ core of the framework is process orchestration and mining.  \nContext and Rationale:\
    \ Having adopted the meta level design principles of process \nintelligence as\
    \ the core of the DSCRM framework, integration, and execution of the \nvarious\
    \ stages of the framework requires a process orchestration or event management\
    \ \nsystem. This was evidenced from the study’s field work and is also supported\
    \ by \nliterature (Weske, 2007), (Dumas et al., 2018).   \n2C \nDP: The DSCRM\
    \ framework continuously improves its risk management decision \nsupport by learning\
    \ from actual risk mitigation events.  \nContext and Rationale: ADR interviewees\
    \ A to H, all supported the “single pane of \nglass”, (that is one system that\
    \ can integrate all data and insights), approach to the \nDSCRM framework from\
    \ a socio- technical context. Process intelligence compliance \nchecking includes\
    \ the ability to update the reference model with a discovered model \n(Van Der\
    \ Aalst, 2016), (Leemans et al., 2019a). This allows for the risk mitigation digital\
    \ \ntwins to be updated by actual event data, for example the discovery process\
    \ of the \nevents following a successful risk mitigation intervention. Such functionality\
    \ provides \ncontinuous improvement ability and is supported by 67% of ADR interviewees\
    \ who \nindicated that they would proactively engage in the development of a DSCRM\
    \ framework \nand algorithms. In the scope of the research in this stage (6) of\
    \ the DSCRM framework \n(see section 5.5.6, Risk Mitigation Digital Twin Continuous\
    \ Improvement) the user is \nprompted to update the digital twin, when fitness\
    \ thresholds are exceeded during \n \n \n \n \n86 \n \ncompliance checking process.\
    \ It is envisaged that in future development of this \nfunctionality the process\
    \ could be automated using a machine learning algorithm. \n3 \nAgri-Food Risk\
    \ Management Design Principles \n3A \nDP: People safety and food safety are the\
    \ highest order considerations in agri-food \nsupply chain risk management.  \n\
    Context and Rationale: The agri-food supply chain was one of the worse impacted\
    \ \nsectors during the initial wave of global lockdowns at the onset of the Covid\
    \ 19 pandemic \n(Hamid & Mir, 2021), with process and supply chain workers on\
    \ the front line, at risk of \ninfection (Sheffi, 2020). In designing semi-autonomous\
    \ systems for risk management, it \nis key that the safety of people is always\
    \ the highest priority. During times of significant \nsupply chain disruption\
    \ additional focus on food safety is required and from a socio-\ntechnology perspective\
    \ the framework must allow for the rapid intervention of users, \nshould unique\
    \ situations arise. ADR interviewees strongly supported this DP, with one of \n\
    the businesses in category A implementing advanced health screening of team \n\
    members and restricting processing plant access to essential workers only and\
    \ the \nbanana farm owner in category E, supporting worker quarantine processes\
    \ and \nfacilitating vaccinations.  \n3B \nDP: Framework to be applicable to agri-food\
    \ in general, requiring minimal configuration \nfor industry specific applications.\
    \  \nContext and Rationale: Abstracting the problem of risk management in banana\
    \ and \nbeef supply chains to a broader agri-food supply chain problem has led\
    \ to a solution \ndevelopment in the form of the DSCRM Framework which has general\
    \ applicability. This \napproach follows the design principles in use approach\
    \ of Lee et al., 2011 (Lee et al., \n2011) and was supported by the broader horticulture\
    \ viewpoints of ADR interviewees in \nC & G. To enable such generalizability across\
    \ agri-food sectors the use of standard \nsupply chain nomenclature and units\
    \ (based on the SCOR standard) is required. \nLogistics units should be based\
    \ on consignments; and be extendable to pallets, cartons, \nor individual units.\
    \  \n3C \nDP: Framework to provide farmers and agri-food stakeholders with timely\
    \ risk mitigation \ndecision support.  \nContext and Rationale: ADR interviewees\
    \ A, B, C, D, E, G and H stressed the \nimportance of real time insights from\
    \ data. Agri-food supply chains are becoming more \ncomplex and more susceptible\
    \ to vulnerabilities, risk management needs to be effective \nand efficient (Zhao\
    \ et al., 2020). The consequences of food safety problems can be both \ncostly\
    \ and damaging to an agri-food business’s reputation (Moazzam et al., 2018). To\
    \ \nassist farmers and supply chain stakeholders, risk information must be provided\
    \ in a \ntimely manner with as much supporting and actionable insights as possible.\
    \ In the scope \nof the research the focus has been on risk mitigation (see section\
    \ 5.5.4, Data Processing \nand Decision Support) It is envisaged in future development\
    \ of this functionality that the \ninclusion of predictive algorithms will allow\
    \ for risk prediction, enabling proactive \nprevention steps to under undertaken.\
    \ \n4 \nSensor Integration Design Principles \n4A \nDP: Tracking sensors to be\
    \ seamlessly deployable at the farm, preconfigured and \nautomatically associated\
    \ with the agri-food consignment. \nContext and Rationale: This is based on direct\
    \ feedback from the ADR interviewees: A, \nB and E as well as the practical constraints\
    \ of supporting the research during periods of \nCovid lockdown. Application of\
    \ the sensors cannot delay the loading process in any way \nnor require additional\
    \ processing and configuration. The loading process is time \n \n \n \n \n87 \n\
    \ \nsensitive both for cattle from an animal welfare perspective and produce from\
    \ a handling \nand temperature perspective (Jorquera-Chavez et al., 2019), (Aung\
    \ & Chang, 2014).  \n4B \nDP: Tracking sensors to have store and forward capabilities\
    \ to allow operation through \nareas of no or low connectivity. \nContext and\
    \ Rationale: The challenges of poor connectivity were first identified with \n\
    ADR interviewee A in Case 1, which prompted additional work with the sensor provider\
    \ \nto supply a sensor capable of storing location and quality data and transmitting\
    \ this data \nwhen connectivity is reestablished. The new sensors performed well\
    \ in Case 2 \n(interviewees E & G) and subsequently in Case 1. Resolution of this\
    \ problem addresses \none of the core agri-food supply chain challenges – data\
    \ quality (Marmolejo-Saucedo, \n2020). \n5 \nArtifact Configuration Design Principles\
    \ \n5A \nDP: ETL (extract, transform, load) layer required for API (application\
    \ programming \ninterface) between sensors and platform.  \nContext and Rationale:\
    \ A key requirement for operationalizing the DSCRM framework \nthrough an IT Artifact\
    \ is the ability to ingest data via an API from a third-party solution, \nfor\
    \ example a tracking sensor or weather forecasting system. A range of BPMS systems\
    \ \n(Van Der Aalst, 2016), low code platforms (Ihirwe et al., 2020), and public\
    \ cloud \nsolutions provide this functionality.  \n5B \nDP: Platform to support\
    \ a process mining solution for the purposes of compliance \nchecking a process\
    \ digital twin. \nContext and Rationale: A process mining solution capable of\
    \ supporting compliance \nchecking is a key requirement for an IT Artifact. Several\
    \ such process mining solutions \nare available, for example Inductive Visual\
    \ Miner (Leemans et al., 2018), are available in \nopen-source format (ProM, 2019).\
    \  \n5C \nDP: Platform to have an event management engine for the purpose of process\
    \ \norchestrating the framework steps.  \nContext and Rationale: The core of a\
    \ DSCRM IT Artifact is an event management \nsystem. An event management system\
    \ is configurable on a BPMS to orchestrate the \nrequired services (Tonelli et\
    \ al., 2021) as well as low code platform and public cloud \nsolutions described\
    \ in 5A. \nTable 8:DSCRM Design principles \n5.7 Discussion \nThe applied ADR\
    \ research methodology has provided ongoing input and evaluation in the \ndevelopment\
    \ of the DSCRM Framework. This deep engagement with industry has ensured \nthat\
    \ industry problems have been addressed while at the same time academic and research\
    \ \nrigor has been maintained. This Section outlines the core design principles\
    \ derived from this \nstudy and discusses study limitations and future work. \n\
    A surprising finding from the review cycles was the lack of visibility that the\
    \ banana farmers \nhave once their produce or product was loaded onto transportation\
    \ to their customers. Several \nof the horticulture farmers cited the vulnerability\
    \ of their produce or product to quality related \nissues in transit which result\
    \ in lower financial returns and even rejection of the consignment. \n \n \n \n\
    \ \n88 \n \nA further finding was the control of the supply chain. Several of\
    \ the farmers supply their \nproduce to agents who act as consolidators for the\
    \ large supermarket chains. The farmers are \nreliant on the agents for the final\
    \ warehousing and distribution of their produce and products, \na process which\
    \ can impact the quality and final price received. In the case of the cattle supply\
    \ \nchain, similar supply chain visibility challenges were raised. While a few\
    \ fully integrated supply \nchains exist where a single company owns the breeding,\
    \ backgrounding, feed lotting, \nprocessing, and packaging facilities and supply\
    \ direct to supermarkets, the majority have \ndifferent ownership along the supply\
    \ chains. Meat processors purchase from feedlots and \nfarmers with the price\
    \ determined by the final meat quality. As discussed in Section 5.2 the \nconditions\
    \ cattle face during the transportation stage has an impact on meat quality. \n\
    The Design Science Research Checklist, see Table 9 below, was used to review the\
    \ \nRelevance, Rigour and Design cycles (Hevner, 2010) of this work to ensure\
    \ that the Design \nScience Research Guidelines discussed in Section 3.8 have\
    \ been met.   \n \nNo. \nQuestion \nAnswer \n1 \nWhat is the research question?\
    \ \nHow can agri-food supply chain risk be \nmonitored and managed using emerging\
    \ \nprocess centric technologies? \n2 \nWhat is the artifact and how is it \n\
    presented? \n1) A conceptual framework connecting \nseveral process centric technologies\
    \ to \ndeliver actionable insights for agri-food \nsupply chain risk mitigation.\
    \ \n2) An IT artifact for executing the \nframework so that its benefits could\
    \ be \neffectively evaluated in the application \ndomain. \n3 \nWhat research\
    \ heuristics were used \nto build the artifact? \n1) Selection heuristics – guided\
    \ by \nfeedback from stakeholder interviews \n2) Procedural heuristics – influenced\
    \ by \nsupply chain discovery (Bingham et al., \n2007), (Bingham & Eisenhardt,\
    \ 2011) \n4 \nHow are the artifact and design \nprocesses \ngrounded \nby \nthe\
    \ \nknowledge base? What theories \nsupport the artifact design and \ndesign process?\
    \ \nThe research design was focused on the nexus \nof addressing industry challenges\
    \ while fulfilling \nthe academic contribution requirements of \nInformation Systems\
    \ Research (Sein et al., \n2011). The knowledge bases from the \ndisciplines of\
    \ process science, supply chain risk \nand agri-food risk were researched together\
    \ \nwith comprehensive industry consultation \nthrough a structured interview\
    \ and evaluation \nprocess. \n5 \nWhat evaluations are performed \nduring the\
    \ internal design cycles? \nWhat design improvements are \nidentified during each\
    \ design cycle? \nComprehensive evaluations were performed for \nboth Case 1 and\
    \ Case 2 as summarized in \nFigure 17 and Appendix 2. The key design \nimprovements\
    \ from Case 1 were the mitigation \nof sensor connectivity challenges through\
    \ \nincorporation of new store and forward capable \nsensors in Case 2 as well\
    \ as enhancements to \nthe \nprocess \norchestration \nfunctionality \nof \nDSCRM.\
    \ \n \n \n \n \n89 \n \n6 \nHow is the artifact introduced into \nthe application\
    \ environment and \nhow is it field tested? \nThe artifact was introduced as an\
    \ application on \na cloud service. Sensor data (truck location, \ntemperature\
    \ of consignment, weather station \ndata) was ingested via API to the application\
    \ \nwhich was demonstrated either in person or via \na conference call with participants.\
    \  \n7 \nWhat new knowledge is added to \nthe knowledge base and in what \nform?\
    \ \nThe novel combination of a process aware digital \ntwin with a business process\
    \ management \nsystem to rapidly configure semi-autonomous, \ndomain specific\
    \ supply chain risk management \nsolutions.  \n8 \nHas the research question been\
    \ \nsatisfactorily addressed? \nYes. The development and evaluation of the \n\
    solution within the beef and banana supply chain \nhas positively answered the\
    \ research question. \nTable 9: Design Science Research Checklist for Phase 2\
    \ Research \nReflecting on the contributing factors that resulted in the DSCRM\
    \ solution being developed \nand successfully evaluated, the researcher identified\
    \ that previous research and development \nin the domain was hampered by the cost\
    \ of sensors as well as challenges with connectivity \nsolutions for these sensors,\
    \ especially for remote farming regions. Recent developments in \nsensor technologies,\
    \ such as the store and forward capabilities for GPS trackers, when there \nis\
    \ no connectivity, which evolved during the course of this research has enabled\
    \ this research \nto occur on actual commercial scale.    \nA further contributing\
    \ factor has been the ability to rapidly configure and adjust/continuously \n\
    improve the DSCRM solution using a low code/process aware development approach\
    \ with the \nBPMS. With the agri-food sector dominated by small and medium sized\
    \ businesses they have \nalso lacked access to information technologies to develop\
    \ such capabilities (Fountas et al., \n2015), (Antunes et al., 2021).  \n \n \n\

    \ Introduction \nMangla et al. (2018) identified ten enablers for implementing\
    \ sustainable agri-food supply \nchain initiatives with ‘pressure by various governments,\
    \ regulating agencies, and non-\ngovernmental bodies’ and ‘understanding customer\
    \ and other stakeholder requirements’ \nbeing the most influential. Yadav et al.\
    \ (2021) examined global sustainability in agri-food \nsupply chains highlighting\
    \ the increased importance of involving lower tier or sub suppliers \nand concluding\
    \ that competitive agri-food supply chains require a multi-tiered governance \n\
    system, based on IoT technologies, and linked to global sustainable outcomes to\
    \ ensure \ncompliance. Sustainability in agri-food supply chains is a global challenge\
    \ requiring a solution \nthat can be adopted and adapted by governments, businesses,\
    \ and national peak bodies \nglobally.  \nGiven this background a research question\
    \ to tackle this critical and topical socio- \ntechnological research challenge\
    \ for agri-food businesses was formulated. “How can \nemerging process centric\
    \ technologies enable the achievement of sustainability \ndevelopment goals within\
    \ agri-food supply chains?” The scope of this phase of the \nresearch was multinational\
    \ companies i.e., companies with agri-food operations in more than \none country.\
    \ While the sustainability research is completely relevant to agri-food businesses\
    \ \nin a single country (with the banana and cattle farms described in Chapter\
    \ 5 participating in \nthe research) additional research was conducted into global\
    \ sustainability standards and \ninternational participants engaged (see Section\
    \ 6.3.1 and Appendix 3) to determine the \nchallenges of monitoring and managing\
    \ sustainability in agri-businesses that span countries.  \nThe researcher commenced\
    \ with a literature review of the challenges of implementing \ndecarbonization\
    \ and sustainability processes within the agri-food sector, and the use of digital\
    \ \ntwins within sector. Akhtar et al. (2016), researched dairy, meat, vegetables\
    \ and fruit global \nsupply chains exporting to emerging markets concluding that\
    \ a data-driven and adaptive \nleadership approach is a key determinant to financial\
    \ and non-financial sustainability. Vernier \net al. (2021) note that Industry\
    \ 4.0 technologies are only starting to be adopted into the fruit \nand vegetable\
    \ industries. Several strategies and frameworks have been established \ninternationally\
    \ to guide the agri-food sector, for example, the United Nations sustainability\
    \ \ndevelopment goals and its Food and Agriculture Organizations’ Strategy on\
    \ Climate Change \n(FAO, 2021), the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG, 2021) and nationally,\
    \ led by government \nagriculture and environmental departments and by industry\
    \ peak bodies. While these \nstrategies and frameworks provide goals, guidelines\
    \ and measures, multinational businesses \nare challenged by the complexities\
    \ of managing their specific agri-food businesses in different \necosystems and\
    \ subject to different regulatory requirements.  The relevant research studies\
    \ \nsummarised in Section 6.2, show a research gap in this field.  \n \n \n \n\
    \ \n92 \n \nAction Design Research (Sein et al., 2011) was selected as the research\
    \ methodology \nenabling the incorporation of several cycles of feedback with\
    \ the stakeholders as the Process \nAware Digital Twin for Agri-Food Sustainability\
    \ (PADT-SA) framework and supporting IT \nArtifact were developed (as detailed\
    \ in Section 6.3). The broader scope of multinational \ncompanies required significant\
    \ configuration functionality and a hierarchical approach to \nensure global standards\
    \ are applied, with the ability to customise to local national standards \nwhen\
    \ required. The framework and IT Artifact are presented in Section 6.4, with an\
    \ ex post \nnaturalistic evaluation of these on an Australian cattle farm with\
    \ additional surveys conducted \nacross the cattle, horticulture and broader agri-food\
    \ sectors including multinational companies \nto assess the international generalizability\
    \ of the framework and IT Artifact. The contribution \nof this research has been\
    \ the development of a novel framework for managing sustainability \noutcomes\
    \ in agri-food businesses at a multinational scale. Low code platforms need no\
    \ or \nrelatively little hand coding to create a completely operational application\
    \ (Bano et al., 2022). \nThe low code configuration of a process aware digital\
    \ twin within an overarching standard \nstructure allows for sector specific and\
    \ country specific parameters to be added while \nmaintaining the overall integrity\
    \ of a multinational management system. \n6.2 Related Work \n6.2.1 Sustainability\
    \ in multinational agri-food businesses \nSustainability digitization efforts\
    \ at corporate and value chain levels are determined by the \nsynergies between\
    \ Industry 4.0 technologies, design principles and  sustainability functionality\
    \ \n(Ching et al., 2022). Adoption of corporate sustainability goals is not straightforward\
    \ for \nmultinational corporations, with global sustainability standards being\
    \ seen in some regions as \nan imposition from abroad. This can lead to a situation\
    \ where standards are adopted with the \nmain objective of showing engagement\
    \ but without serious commitment (Fontana et al., 2022). \nMultinational agri-food\
    \ corporate mobilization of science based sustainability governance tools \ndoes\
    \ not always go according to plan without consideration of the skills, knowledge\
    \ and \nsupport provided to the corporate sustainability managers (Freidberg,\
    \ 2022). \nMost published literature in the sustainability domain is focused on\
    \ ecology and is silent \nregarding the social dimension (Ajwani-Ramchandani,\
    \ Figueira, Torres de Oliveira, & Jha, \n2021). Social sustainability is complex,\
    \ with significant uncertainties and multiple dimensions, \nand organisations\
    \ lack knowledge on how Industry 4.0 technologies relate to social \nsustainability\
    \ (Bai et al., 2022). In a structured literature review of the collaboration behaviours\
    \ \nrequired for sustainable agri-food supply chains Dania et al. (2018) identified\
    \ ten categories: \njoint efforts, sharing activities, collaboration value, adaptation,\
    \ trust commitment, power, \ncontinuous improvement, coordination, and stability.\
    \ Sustainability risks in the agri food supply \nchain are commonly categorized\
    \ into economic, environmental, and social, according to a \n \n \n \n \n93 \n\
    \ \nstructured literature review by Choirun et al. (2020), which included technical\
    \ and institutional \nrisks, detailing the differences between endogenous and\
    \ exogenous factors. The lack of \nprocess digitization and semantic interoperability\
    \ are barriers to the leveraging of Industry 4.0 \ntechnologies to achieving sustainability\
    \ outcomes (Rajput & Singh, 2021). \nResearch has been conducted into sustainability\
    \ metrics that could be used to benchmark the \nsustainability of agri-food supply\
    \ chains, with the suggestion that sustainable agri food supply \nshould be favoured\
    \ in international trade negotiations (Gaitán-Cremaschi et al., 2017). The \n\
    United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2, 3, 8, 9, 13, and 15\
    \ (UN, 2022) \nprovide metrics and targets for the agri-food industry (Sroufe\
    \ & Watts, 2022). Governments \nhave an important role to play regarding implementation\
    \ of sustainability in supply chains due \nto the high upfront costs (Govindan\
    \ & Hasanagic, 2018). Developing and promoting \ncollaborations with third party\
    \ organisations beyond the boundaries of the organisation is key \nto establishing\
    \ effective sustainability systems (Batista et al., 2019). Industry body and \n\
    government support is needed to facilitate collaboration between small and medium\
    \ \nhorticulture businesses to enable increased exports (Akbar et al., 2020).\
    \ Decarbonizing \nagriculture’s corporate value chain, particularly in the food\
    \ sector, poses challenges because \nupstream, land-based, or other embodied emissions\
    \ frequently represent most \nagribusinesses’ and food processors’ total carbon\
    \ footprint (Holmes et al., 2021). While \nmultinationals commonly release corporate\
    \ sustainability reports, the inclusion of life cycle \nassessment has remained\
    \ low, which is also reflected in the underreporting of Scope 35 \ngreenhouse\
    \ gas emissions (Stewart et al., 2018). \n6.2.2 Decarbonization in the cattle\
    \ farming sector \nWhile there has been significant research into ways to decrease\
    \ greenhouse gas (GHG) \nemissions in the cattle sector, the industry lacks information\
    \ on how various technologies and \npractices can be combined to reduce emissions\
    \ from the whole sector (Mayberry et al., 2019). \nFaced with the reality that\
    \ cattle are significant contributors to GHG emissions, cattle farmers \nneed\
    \ to develop plans to decarbonize their businesses. Research into methane yields\
    \ from \nBrahman cattle from the Australian tropical (Northern) herd, fed diets\
    \ of grass and grass mixed \nwith legumes show an average enteric production of\
    \ 19.6 g/kg forage dry matter intake \n(Kennedy & Charmley, 2012). The actual\
    \ measurement of enteric emissions from cattle on a \nspecific feed requires a\
    \ controlled experiment with specialized facilities for capturing and \nmeasuring\
    \ the emitted methane. This work is conducted on dedicated research cattle farms,\
    \ \nutilizing respiration chambers with gas flow, temperature, relative humidity,\
    \ and gas \n \n5 Scope 3 emissions are the result of activities from assets not\
    \ owned or controlled by the reporting \norganization, but that the organization\
    \ indirectly affects in its value chain \n \n \n \n \n94 \n \ncomposition recorded.\
    \ The methane emissions, expressed in kg, per kg of beef produced per \nannum\
    \ based on liveweight and liveweight gains of an animal, varies between 0.474\
    \ for low \ngrazing pressure and 0.615 for high grazing pressure, for cleared\
    \ pastoral land, and 0.501 for \nlow grazing pressure  and 0.729 for high grazing\
    \ pressure, for timber grazing land (Rolfe, \n2010). Reductions in grazing pressure\
    \ reduces total beef production but increases the \nefficiency of beef production\
    \ per unit of methane emitted. \nThere are promising innovations in supplementary\
    \ additives such as red seaweed, \nasparagopsis taxiformis, which has been shown\
    \ to reduce enteric methane emissions by 90% \n(Ridoutt et al., 2022), and selective\
    \ breeding and vaccinations against methanogens can also \nreduce methane emission\
    \ intensity (Gerber et al., 2013) However these solutions are not yet \ncommercial\
    \ and more immediate plans are required to meet the increasing calls for the \n\
    industry to be carbon neutral by 2030. A process for assessing the carbon footprint\
    \ of cattle \nfarms is urgently required, together with a pragmatic approach to\
    \ mitigating methane \nemissions and sequestering carbon dioxide through the adoption\
    \ of novel grazing systems \nand natural forest and woodland preservation.   \n\
    In cattle farming, the sequestration of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere can\
    \ be achieved \nthrough the stabilization and protection of soil organic carbon,\
    \  Leucaena ( Leucaena \nleucocephala ssp. Glabrata ) promotes this stabilization\
    \ (Conrad et al., 2018) and is a highly \nproductive tropical legume used in extensive\
    \ grazing systems (Stuart et al., 2019). Leucaena \nhas high crude protein, dry\
    \ matter digestibility, as well as metabolizable energy and provides \na daily\
    \ higher weight gain of cattle (known as live weight gain or LWG). Soil organic\
    \ carbon \naccumulation rates from Leucaena – grass pastures that had been established\
    \ for 20, 31 and \n38 years were 267, 140 and 79 kg/ha/pa respectively higher\
    \ compared to native pastures \n(Radrizzani et al., 2011). Leucaena can be used\
    \ as a sole forage in grazing systems for \nexample in Asia and Latin America,\
    \ as a supplement feed during dry seasons or as a year-\nround grazing system\
    \ for example in Africa or combined year-round with grass pasture \nsystems in\
    \ Australia (Karen et al., 2019). Liveweight gains are greater when cattle are\
    \ fed a \ncombination of leucaena and pasture grass, and the liveweight gains\
    \ allow the cattle to reach \nthe target weight earlier, thus reducing the emissions\
    \ generated per unit of meat production.  \nCarbon dioxide sequestration also\
    \ occurs via the forests and woodland on a cattle farm. \nWoody plants in eucalypt\
    \ forests can hold between 86 to 860 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent \nper hectare,\
    \ with larger trees holding significantly more carbon than small trees. The living\
    \ \nbiomass accumulation rate of a young regrowing eucalypt forest ranges between\
    \ 1 and 10 \ntons per hectare, equating to 2 and 17 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent\
    \ per hectare per year \n(Queensland-Government, 2022). The ability to accurately\
    \ measure decarbonization \n \n \n \n \n95 \n \nimprovements in cattle systems\
    \ may also lead to financial benefits for cattle farming. In \nAustralia, for\
    \ example, demonstrated emissions avoidance processes such as increasing the \n\
    ratio of weight to age of a herd, reducing the average age of a herd, reducing\
    \ the proportion \nof unproductive animals in a herd, and changing the ratio of\
    \ livestock classes to increase total \nliveweight again, may all qualify for\
    \ carbon credits (Australian-Federal-Government, 2022). In \nBrazil, which has\
    \ the largest commercial beef cattle herd in the world, a federal program, the\
    \ \nLow Carbon Agriculture program, financially supports decarbonization efforts\
    \ with positive \nbenefits (Costa Jr et al., 2019).  \nTo accurately account for\
    \ carbon credits, for example through the Australian Emission \nReduction Fund,\
    \ all activities undertaken in the planting and establishment of leucaena must\
    \ \nbe accounted for, including the emissions from machinery used in planting\
    \ and management \nas well as the irrigation and fertilization of the crop (Karen\
    \ & Rachel, 2019). In Australia the \nEmissions Reduction Fund (ERF) is a core\
    \ component of government policy whereby farmers \ncan earn carbon credits for\
    \ practices that reduce GHG emissions. These units can then be \nsold through\
    \ auctions or the secondary market for income (Mayberry et al., 2019). \n6.2.3\
    \ Industry 4.0 technologies and Sustainability \nGhobakhloo (2020) modelled the\
    \ contextual relationships among Industry 4.0 sustainability \nfunctions finding\
    \ that human resource development, supply chain digitization and integration,\
    \ \nproduction modularity, manufacturing agility and flexibility as well as business\
    \ model novelty \nand innovation are the higher priority opportunities offered\
    \ by Industry 4.0 for sustainability. \nIndustry 4.0 connects technology with\
    \ resources and skills to promote sustainability efforts \nsuch as zero emissions,\
    \ low costs and social equality (Shet & Pereira, 2021). Digitalization \nhas the\
    \ potential to promote sustainability using accurate information and visibility\
    \ to optimize \nresource use and enable recycling (Ajwani-Ramchandani, Figueira,\
    \ Torres de Oliveira, Jha, \net al., 2021). Rathore et al. (2021) conducted a\
    \ systematic review of digital twinning across \nindustry, finding that prior\
    \ to 2015 there were few papers on the topic, but by 2017 the topic \nhad become\
    \ one of the top ten trends in strategic technology. The enabling technology for\
    \ \nsustainable intelligent manufacturing includes digital twins in a deep integration\
    \ with advanced \nmanufacturing technology including real time data collection\
    \ from sensors (He & Bai, 2020). \n6.2.4 Process Modelling and Digital Twins \n\
    Process models are required in the engineering of a process aware digital twin\
    \ and one of the \nmain techniques of extracting these models is process mining\
    \ (Bano et al., 2022). Digital twins \nin agriculture provide an opportunity to\
    \ achieve digitization in the sector; however the sector \nis complex and agriculture\
    \ specific definitions and semantics as well as novel technologies \nwill need\
    \ to be developed (Warren & Thomas, 2023). To improve visualisation and to enable\
    \ \n \n \n \n \n96 \n \na deeper understanding of the causal factors impacting\
    \ sustainability, simulation and digital \ntwins can be a possible solution. \
    \ Semeraro et al. (2021) in their systematic review of digital \ntwins define\
    \ them as ‘adaptive models that emulate behaviour of physical systems in a virtual\
    \ \nsystem getting real time data to update itself along its lifecycle…prescribing\
    \ real time actions \nfor optimizing and/or mitigating unexpected events, observing,\
    \ and evaluating the operating \nsystem’. Warren and Thomas (2023), in their state-of-the-art\
    \ review of digital twins in \nagriculture concluded that they have a promising\
    \ future in agriculture but identified that future \nresearch is required in the\
    \ areas of simulation, biological systems modelling and business \nmodel development,\
    \ to allow for growth and adoption in the sector. Digital twins can streamline\
    \ \noperations, executing processes continuously without user intervention and\
    \ hide the \ncomplexity of some technologies, which is a major potential benefit\
    \ for the agri-food sector \n(Pylianidis et al., 2021). Digital twins in agri-food\
    \ systems are a virtual model of a physical \nfarm or agricultural system using\
    \ leading edge technologies such as sensors, IoT devices and \ncloud computing\
    \ (Peladarinos et al., 2023). A process digital twin has a stronger focus on \n\
    processes, knowing the allowed modelled processes, the current state of these\
    \ processes, as \nwell as the history of the processes and executed actions, accessible\
    \ via its databases (Bano \net al., 2022).  \nProcess mining techniques may be\
    \ used to extract an event log from sensor data and then \napply data to model\
    \ transformations to discover the processes, model to model and model to \ncode\
    \ transformation techniques may be used to automate the digital twin generation\
    \ process \n(Bano et al., 2022). Ching et al. (2022) through a structured literature\
    \ review and interpretive \nstructural modelling determined that supply chain\
    \ process integration is the most fundamental \nsustainability function of Industry\
    \ 4.0.  \n6.2.5 Enabling Technologies \nFigure 26 below summarises the various\
    \ components that contribute to environmental, \nsocial, and economic sustainability\
    \ for multinational agrifood businesses.  \n \n \n \n \n \n97 \n \n \nFigure 26:\
    \ Contributing factors to sustainability in agri-food businesses globally. \n\
    6.3 Methodology \n6.3.1 Application of action design research methodology \nAction\
    \ design research (Sein et al., 2011) was used as the research methodology due\
    \ to the \nrequirement to compliment literature research with the engagement of\
    \ managers from \ndomestic and international agri-food businesses, and representatives\
    \ from government \nagencies and industry representatives involved with the support\
    \ and promotion of agri-food \nsustainability. A total of thirty of these subject\
    \ matter specialists participated in the research, \nand their roles and countries\
    \ in which they conduct their business are shown in Appendix 3. \nThe action design\
    \ research was adapted a shown in Figure 27 below to allow for the \ndevelopment\
    \ of the Process Aware Digital Twin- Sustainable Agriculture (PADT-SA) \nframework\
    \ as well as the enabling IT Artifact in several cycles. The evaluation was conducted\
    \ \nusing the FEDS (framework for evaluation in design science) guidelines (Venable\
    \ et al., 2016). \nAs explained in Section 4.5, the FEDS framework covers both\
    \ the functional purpose of the \nevaluation as well as the type of evaluation.\
    \ A summative approach with naturalistic criteria \nwas used. This allowed both\
    \ the concepts of the framework to evaluated as well as the actual \nfunctionality\
    \ with real industrial data, expressed through the supporting IT Artifact.  \n\
    \ \n \n \n \n98 \n \n \nFigure 27: ADR applied to the PADT-SA framework and IT\
    \ Artifact development including data collection \ntypes. \nThe cattle sector\
    \ was selected for designing, building and evaluation of the PADT-SA \nframework\
    \ and artifact, being the single highest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions\
    \ \n(Gerber et al., 2013).  \nThe data collection techniques which were deployed\
    \ during the research, including several \nvisits to cattle and horticulture farms\
    \ with semi-structured interviews, are shown on Figure 27. \nDuring the problem\
    \ formulation phase when respondents were asked whether agri-food \nbusinesses\
    \ have sufficient data to make informed decisions about the sustainability of\
    \ their \noperations, none responded yes, 46% responded “only to meet minimum\
    \ regulatory \nrequirements and 54% “no, struggling to obtain reliable data”.\
    \ 82% of respondents stated there \nwas either a need or high need for a framework\
    \ which can be rapidly configured to assess, \nmeasure, and manage sustainability\
    \ outcomes based on chosen standards.  \n6.3.2 Problem Formulation: Managing sustainability\
    \ on a cattle farm. \nThe first requirement was the identification of sources\
    \ of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions \nand sinks. A key outcome of the literature\
    \ review has been the identification of relevant \nresearch into methane emissions\
    \ from cattle of similar breeds to those on the research farms, \nas well as similar\
    \ grazing systems. A typical cattle farm is sub divided into paddocks, also \n\
    known as fields or pastures, which are fenced off areas of the farm that allow\
    \ the cattle to \ngraze in a controlled area until the available biomass has reached\
    \ a certain quantity and then \nbe moved to another paddock, allowing the grasses\
    \ and other vegetation to regrow. For this \nresearch the farm is considered as\
    \ a whole, i.e., the collective of paddocks with native grasses \n \n \n \n \n\
    99 \n \nfor grazing. Data from individual paddocks is not considered, but aggregated\
    \ into an overall \npaddock, labelled Farm Area A, in Figure 28 below. If the\
    \ farm has paddocks where enhanced \ngrazing systems have been established, for\
    \ example, where rows of a legume such as \nleucaena have been grown, (as explained\
    \ in Section 6.2), these combined paddocks are \nlabelled Farm Area B. Areas on\
    \ the farm that have specific woody plant forests and are set \naside for conservation\
    \ are labelled Forest Area C.   \n \n \nFigure 28: Typical cattle farm with different\
    \ vegetation types \nIn the normal course of business, cattle farmers have strategic\
    \ decisions to make regarding \nthe number and type of cattle that they will stock\
    \ on the farm considering available biomass in \nthe paddocks and weather and\
    \ climate forecasts, as well as market pricing forecasts. At the \ntactical level,\
    \ decisions are made when to buy and sell cattle as well as when to move cattle\
    \ \nbetween paddocks. Adding the decarbonization aspect to their business the\
    \ owners need to: \nA) Ascertain the sources of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions\
    \ and sinks. \nB) Calculate the current carbon footprint of their farms. \nC)\
    \ Assess the variables contributing to the emissions and sinks. \nD) Determine\
    \ the cost impacts of the various decarbonization options. \nE) Assess the opportunities\
    \ for proactively decarbonizing their farms (for example, \nmarketing carbon neutral\
    \ products).  \nF) Assess the impacts of not decarbonizing their farms (for example,\
    \ increased regulatory \npressure, restricted access to funding). \nG) Establish\
    \ decarbonization targets and a roadmap to achieve these. \nThe variables for\
    \ a cattle farm are number and type of cattle, type of grazing system for \nexample,\
    \ native grass or combined legume-grass systems, use of supplementary feeding\
    \ to \n \n \n \n \n100 \n \nimprove live weight gain, and management of woodlands\
    \ or forested areas. Assessing these \nvariables is complex; however the process\
    \ can be enabled through the analysis of satellite \ndata for assessment of vegetation\
    \ cover (Gill et al., 2017), as well as using IoT technologies \nfor capturing\
    \ cattle data as discussed in my previous research (Keates, 2019), (Keates et\
    \ al., \n2020). In addition to the actual quantity of methane emitted by cattle,\
    \ the carbon dioxide \nemissions from farming activities such as fertilizing crops\
    \ for supplementary feed, vehicle \nemissions, electrical consumption for all\
    \ activities including pumping water need to be \ncalculated, as well as the carbon\
    \ sequestration from the grazing systems and woodlands.  \nValues for these emissions\
    \ and sinks have been obtained from literature research as \nexplained in Section\
    \ 6.4 below. Where the research has shown that these co-variants have \nadditional\
    \ dependencies, for example the association between dietary dry matter intake\
    \ of the \ncattle, seasonal changes, and enteric methane emissions, the PADT-SA\
    \ framework has \nprovided the ability to enhance the data by providing additional\
    \ sensor data from the farms. \nThis approach will allow cattle farmers to fine\
    \ tune their ecosystems and provide for more \naccurate carbon accounting.  In\
    \ addition, strategies to mitigate erosion and sediment runoff \ninto river systems\
    \ are key to environmental sustainability. A process to mitigate erosion is to\
    \ \nuse rotational grazing and to redistribute grazing away from areas sensitive\
    \ to erosion \n(Thorburn et al., 2011). The ability to track cattle using GPS\
    \ trackers was considered a useful \ninput for the framework enabling high grazing\
    \ in sensitive areas to be identified, monitored, \nand managed (Schieltz et al.,\
    \ 2017). \n6.3.3 Problem Formulation for generalizability: Managing sustainability\
    \ in banana \nand horticulture farming. \nA key requirement of the PADT-SA framework\
    \ applied to banana farming was the ability to \ndetermine the optimum fertilizer\
    \ addition rates and application windows to ensure no nitrates \nleached into\
    \ the river systems and to mitigate nitrous oxide emissions. A typical banana\
    \ farm \nis presented in Figure 29 below. \n \n \n \n \n101 \n \n \nFigure 29:\
    \ Representation of a banana farm \nThere are additional sustainability factors\
    \ to be managed on a cropping and horticulture farm. \nThese include nitrate and\
    \ sediment runoff into river systems and the establishment of healthy \nground\
    \ cover to prevent erosion. Soil erosion leading to sediment runoff into rivers\
    \ significantly \ncontributes to total nitrate exports in Great Barrier Reef catchment\
    \ rivers, with the nitrogen \ncontained in fine sediments (Kroon et al., 2012).\
    \ Movement of nitrogen in groundwater \nsystems may be mitigated by forested riparian\
    \ zones and conserving forests around streams \nand rivers prone to flooding (Pert\
    \ et al., 2010). Incorporation of satellite imagery to identify and \nquantify\
    \ these riparian zones was considered an important input to the PADT- SA framework.\
    \ \n6.3.4 Establishing overarching sustainability targets. \nThe individual agri-food\
    \ sectors have various environmental standards, some of which are \nregulatory\
    \ and localized, for example the Agricultural ERA ( Environmentally Relevant Activity)\
    \ \nstandard for beef cattle grazing as well as an ERA standard for banana cultivation\
    \ in the Great \nBarrier Reef catchment area (Q. Government, 2022). There are\
    \ also sustainability frameworks \npromoted by industry peak bodies such as the\
    \ Australian Beef Sustainability Framework \n(ABSF, 2022) and The Australian-grown\
    \ Horticulture Sustainability Framework (HIA, 2022), \nwhich are aligned to the\
    \ United Nations Sustainability Development Goals (SDG’s) and serve \nas a guide\
    \ to their respective industry sectors. While this research and evaluation have\
    \ \nfocused on environmental sustainability the overarching PADT-SA framework\
    \ has included \nthe social and economic components of sustainability as they\
    \ are interconnected (Ajwani-\nRamchandani, Figueira, Torres de Oliveira, Jha,\
    \ et al., 2021) (Ching et al., 2022). Not all SDGs \nare applicable to each agri-food\
    \ sector; however, from a multinational and broader agri-food \nbusiness perspective\
    \ the researcher considered it appropriate to include all SDGs in the \noverarching\
    \ PADT-SA framework’s design – establishing targets stage.  \n \n \n \n \n102\
    \ \n \n6.4 Developing the Process Aware Digital Twin for Sustainable Agriculture\
    \ \nFramework \n6.4.1 Framework Design \nAn early learning in the development\
    \ of the framework design was the creation of the \nappropriate semantics and\
    \ topology to ensure the framework was generalizable across the \nagri-food sectors,\
    \ an important aspect when considering multinational businesses. Such \ngeneralizability\
    \ is a key factor when broader adoption of the framework is being considered \n\
    and has a positive impact on the solution architecture of the IT Artifact, as\
    \ a common platform \nis far easier and cost effective to maintain and extend.\
    \ After several cycles of developing the \nPADT-SA for cattle farming framework,\
    \ the PADT-SA Overarching Framework was extracted, \nas shown in Figure 30 below.\
    \ This framework was validated, via survey, for the banana farm \nuse case and\
    \ further refined before a broader survey across multinational agri-food \nbusinesses\
    \ was undertaken. The Overarching Framework has two levels; level 1 as shown \n\
    below presents the overall framework, with level 2 a decomposition of Stage 1,\
    \ while still \npreserving the generic semantics and topology. The framework has\
    \ been designed to include \neconomic and social sustainability, in order to address\
    \ the gaps identified in these areas   \n(Ajwani-Ramchandani, Figueira, Torres\
    \ de Oliveira, & Jha, 2021; Akhtar et al., 2016), (Bai et \nal., 2022) and (Akhtar\
    \ et al., 2016). Data sources for insights into these areas include \nintegration\
    \ with the financial systems (e.g., Enterprise Resource Planning) as well as social\
    \ \nmedia ( to gauge social attitudes and reactions towards sustainability matters)\
    \ as well as \nvarious sustainability and regulation related websites (Gao et\
    \ al., 2019).   \n \nFigure 30: Overarching Framework: Process aware digital twin\
    \ for sustainable agri-food \n \n \n \n \n103 \n \nStage 1, level 2 (see Figure\
    \ 31), of the framework provides the generic approach to configure \nthe PADT-SA\
    \ to compute the CO2e, additional environmental sustainability, and the economic\
    \ \nand social sustainability of any agri-food business.  The framework is designed\
    \ to facilitate \nimplementation via a model driven IT Artifact, leveraging the\
    \ ability of such systems to adapt,  \nFigure 31: PADT-SA Stage 1 Level 2 \nto\
    \ the dynamic workflows required in the implementation of I4.0 technologies (Czvetkó\
    \ et al., \n2022).  \nPADT-SA level 3 enables the configuration at an agri-food\
    \ sector level. The framework was \nconfigured to assess and manage the sustainability\
    \ of a cattle farm. In level 3 each of the level \n2 processes would be configured\
    \ for the cattle farming sector. The scope of this research at \nlevel 3 was confined\
    \ to detailed configuration and evaluation of the “Configure to Compute \nCO2e”\
    \ component.   \nThe creation of the PADT-SA framework with appropriate semantics\
    \ and topology to ensure \nthe framework was generalizable across the agri-food\
    \ sectors, together with the process for \nconfiguring and applying process aware\
    \ digital twins to semi autonomously monitor and \nmanage sustainability outcomes\
    \ in agri-food supply chains, is the contribution of this section \n \n \n \n\
    \ \n104 \n \nof the research. Each stage of the framework is process driven and\
    \ configurable which \nenables rapid configuration of the digital twins and enabling\
    \ IT Artifact. \n6.4.2 PADT Sustainable Agri-food: Cattle Farm \nThe abstraction\
    \ of the PADT-SA framework for cattle farming is shown in Figure 32 below.  \n\
    \ \n. \nThe hierarchical cascading of sustainability processes maximizes the preservation\
    \ of generic \nprocesses that are applicable across the agri-food sector and enables\
    \ the use of a single \nIndustry 4.0 enabled platform to operationalize the framework.\
    \ The use of icons to present the \nvarious processes and their relationships\
    \ facilitates understanding by users not familiar with \ninformation system semantics\
    \ and allows for the rapid conversion of the framework into an \nexecutable solution\
    \ utilising low code BPMS technologies as explained in section 6.4.3 below.  \n\
    6.4.3 Configuration of the Process Aware Digital Twin \nThe PADT-SA framework\
    \  expands on the cognitive digital twin deployment and operations \nmethodology\
    \ of Kalaboukas et al. (2021) and the process intelligence processes described\
    \ by \nVan Der Aalst (2016) and Leemans et al. (2018); i.e. that processes can\
    \ be discovered by a \nprocess mining algorithm based on event data and compliance\
    \ checked against a reference \nmodel integrating these processes to produce a\
    \ process aware digital twin. The process for \nbuilding the digital twin expands\
    \ on the techniques developed in Phase 1 (see Section 4.6) \nand Phase 2 (see\
    \ Section 5.5.3). The process for capturing data from carbon emitters and \ncarbon\
    \ sinks is modelled in the BPMS. The BPMS is then configured to ingest data via\
    \ API \nfrom the relevant sensors and systems as well as to compute the sustainability\
    \ metrics. At this \nstage the process model is saved as the PADT-SA and run with\
    \ various inputs to compute \nFigure 32: PADT-SA configured at Level 3 for a Cattle\
    \ farm \n \n \n \n \n105 \n \nsustainability metrics for different scenarios.\
    \ In the final stage in order to provide the ability to \nautonomously monitor\
    \ sustainability across the agri-food business process intelligence \nsolution,\
    \ inductive visual miner  (Leemans et al., 2018) is connected via the BPMS workflow\
    \ \nto ingest live sensor and system data and reference the data against the PADT-SA,\
    \ alerting \nwhen thresholds are exceeded.  This configuration also addresses\
    \ gaps in agriculture digital \ntwins in the areas of simulation, biological system\
    \ modelling and business model development \n(Warren & Thomas, 2023) and describes\
    \ the researcher’s key contribution in this research \nphase. See Figure 33 below.\
    \ \n \nFigure 33: Process for configuring the PADT-SA Artifact \n6.4.4 Data Sources\
    \ for PADT-SA Cattle Farming \nFor cattle methane emissions data, the results\
    \ of Rolfe (2010) and Kennedy and Charmley \n(2012) were used, as their research\
    \ focuses on the breeds and forage relevant to the selected \ncattle farm.  Noting\
    \ that cattle research stations around the world will be able to repeat these\
    \ \nexperiments for their specific breeds and grazing systems, the enteric methane\
    \ value has \nbeen made an adjustable variable in the framework. \nCarbon sink\
    \ data for the researched farm area has been sourced from published research into\
    \ \ncarbon sequestration from leucaena-grass grazing systems (Radrizzani et al.,\
    \ 2011) (Conrad \net al., 2018) (Karen & Rachel, 2019), and above ground carbon\
    \ captured in eucalypt open \nforest (Peeters, 2014). These research data are\
    \ relevant to the location of the cattle farm. The \nframework has treated these\
    \ data as an input to be sourced from government or research \ngroups relevant\
    \ to the farming region being analysed.  \nA method for mapping Australian forest\
    \ and woodland cover was developed using field data \nand satellite image data\
    \ from the NASA/United States Geological Survey Landsat-5 TM and \nLandsat-& ETM+\
    \ satellites and made freely available ((Gill et al., 2017). This technology has\
    \ \nbeen further developed and commercialized by a private company, Cibo Labs\
    \ Pty Ltd \n(Cibolabs, 2022). This satellite imagery has been used in the development\
    \ of the PADT-SA \n \n \n \n \n106 \n \nframework to provide data on the forest\
    \ and woodland cover of a farm to calculate the carbon \nsequestration. See Figure\
    \ 34 below. In Figure 34 the boundaries of the research farm and \neach of its\
    \ paddocks are shown, and this data are collected by Cibo Labs from the Australian\
    \ \nLand Registry (Government, 2022). The identification of different forest and\
    \ woodland types \nis an adaption of the work of Gill et al. (2017), using historical\
    \ satellite data.  \n \n \nThe additional data such as input of the number and\
    \ species of cattle, the type of vegetation \nplanted for carbon sequestration\
    \ purposes as well as details of supplementary feed are \ndesigned to be manually\
    \ inputted into the PADT-SA system. For cattle farms with digital cattle \nmanagement\
    \ systems, integration of this data into the system would be possible and enhance\
    \ \nthe overall capability.  \nThe digital twin has been designed as an adaptive\
    \ model that emulates the behaviour of a \nfarming ecosystem in a virtual system,\
    \ getting real time data to update itself along its lifecycle, \nas described\
    \ by Semeraro et al. (2021). The design of the digital twin evolved significantly\
    \ \nthrough the reflection and learning phase of the action design research methodology\
    \ as the \ncovariant implications of enteric methane production and the dietary\
    \ dry matter intake (DMI) \nof the cattle were understood. Kennedy and Charmley\
    \ (2012)’s research on methane yields \nfrom cattle fed tropical grasses and legumes\
    \ revealed that methane yields per unit of ingested \norganic matter were variable\
    \ across diets and related to digestibility and contents of fibre and \nprotein.\
    \ Their research also notes seasonal variability due to different fermentation\
    \ patterns.  \nThe key inputs and outputs of the CO2e calculator are shown in\
    \ Figure 35 below. \nFigure 34: Classification of vegetation types of the cattle\
    \ farm produced by Cibo Labs (Cibolabs, 2022) \n \n \n \n \n107 \n \n \nFigure\

    \ PADT-SA IT Artifact Design \nTo achieve the design objectives a high level of\
    \ process orchestration is required. This was \nachieved using a Business Process\
    \ Modelling System BPMS (Dumas et al., 2018; Van Der \nAalst, 2016) based on Camunda\
    \ (Apache, 2021), which according to Geiger et al. (2018) is \none of only three\
    \ that support native BPMN 2.0 execution as well as having efficient \nfunctionality\
    \ (Meidan et al., 2017). This BPMS is used to process orchestrate and execute\
    \ all \nactivities including ingestion of sensor data, processing of the various\
    \ digital twins, as well as \nthe execution of the process intelligence solution\
    \ (process mining and process compliance \nchecking). The core platform also includes\
    \ a data ingestion solution or ETL (Extract, \nTransform, Load), and for this\
    \ the Pentaho (Pentaho, 2021) open-source version was used. \nInductive visual\
    \ miner (Leemans et al., 2018) was selected as the process mining and \ncompliance\
    \ checking solution, and its source code was packaged as a self-contained \nexecutable\
    \ process, a microservice, on the platform. Apache Cassandra (Apache, 2021) was\
    \ \nused as the canonical database for the process repository. Data streaming\
    \ and stream \nprocessor technology completed the vertical services. Developing\
    \ the framework in this \nmanner allows the PADT-SA to be agnostic to the IT platform\
    \ selected for its deployment. \nConfiguration of the cattle farm at level 3 on\
    \ the PADT-SA platform is shown in Figure 36 \nbelow. \n \n \n \n \n108 \n \n\
    \ \nFigure 36: Configuring the low code PADT-SA platform (screenshots from HPIM).\
    \ \n6.4.6 Results from the cattle farm \nThe farm details were uploaded into the\
    \ Cibo Labs remote pasture sensing system to extract \nthe satellite image analysis\
    \ of woodland and forest within the farm boundaries. An API \n(application programming\
    \ interface) was established to integrate the data on the BPMS \nplatform. A spreadsheet\
    \ of current cattle data including paddock location and last recorded \nweights\
    \ was obtained from the farmer and inputted to the BPMS platform. Cattle GPS trackers\
    \ \n(Ceres, 2022) were fitted to 18 bulls to provide additional insights as to\
    \ the location and \nmovements of the herds within the paddocks. Cibo Labs offers\
    \ a service to integrate the cattle \ntracking data with the pasture sensing data\
    \ which was used with the combined data integrated \nvia the established API to\
    \ the BPMS platform; see Figure 37 below.  \n \n \n \n \n \n109 \n \n \nThe woodlands\
    \ cover data as well as herd information was ingested into the PADT-SA via \n\
    BPMS orchestration, calculating the net carbon emission from the farm. \n The\
    \ following decarbonization scenarios were run through the digital twin: \n1)\
    \ What is the impact of converting 5% of the current grass grazing systems to\
    \ leucaena \n– grass? \n2) What is the impact of converting 5% of the current\
    \ grazing systems to natural woodland \nand forest? \n3) What herd size does the\
    \ current natural carbon sequestration support within the farm \nboundaries i.e.\
    \ a zero-carbon footprint farm (excluding other mechanical and chemical \ninputs)?\
    \ \nThe results of the digital twin simulations are shown in Table 10 below: \n\

    \ \n \n \n \n \n110 \n \n \nAn observation from the results is the high impact\
    \ of Scenario 2, i.e., converting 5% of the \ncurrent grazing system to natural\
    \ woodland and forest. Reflecting back on the research in this \narea ( Section\
    \ 6.2.2), “The living biomass accumulation rate of a young regrowing eucalypt\
    \ \nforest ranges between 1 and 10 tons per hectare, equating to 2 and 17 tons\
    \ of carbon dioxide \nequivalent per hectare per year (Queensland-Government,\
    \ 2022)” confirms the significant \ncarbon sequestration of these natural systems.\
    \ In addition the Scenario 3 simulation of \nconsidering the stocking capacity\
    \ when only relying on the existing natural carbon \nsequestration shows how significantly\
    \ the herd must be reduced. Clearly a holistic approach \nto sustainability is\
    \ required for this industrial sector. \n6.6 Framework evaluation and results\
    \ \n6.6.1 Ex post naturalistic evaluation of PADT-SA for cattle farm. \nFive subject\
    \ matter experts evaluated the results of PADT-SA for the cattle farm, via an\
    \ online \nsurvey after having viewed the framework, and the results that were\
    \ processed by the IT \nArtifact. 1) farm owner 2) manager of corporate cattle\
    \ business 3) sustainability manager of a \ncorporate cattle business 4) representative\
    \ of a cattle peak body 5) manager of a cattle \nsupplementary feed business.\
    \ The overall percentage score as to how accurately does PADT-\nSA represent CO2e\
    \ on a cattle farm was 82%. The functionality according to business benefit \n\
    was ranked as follows (see Figure 38). \n \nFigure 38: PADT-SA Cattle Farming\
    \ functionality ranked against business value \nFour of the respondents rated\
    \ the framework as being highly applicable to a multinational \nbusiness, with\
    \ one rating it as applicable (to be used in conjunction with other reporting\
    \ \nsystems). The following additional functions were requested: \n \n \n \n \n\
    111 \n \n• \nA section for including accounting for the early turnoff due to feed\
    \ supplements. \n• \nReal time tracking and simulation of Scope 3 emissions both\
    \ upstream and \ndownstream e.g., cattle truck movements. \n• \nEasily configurable\
    \ user interfaces. \n• \nExtension to include feedlots as well as new feed supplements\
    \ such as \nasparagopsis. \n6.6.2 Additional evaluation of PADT-SA \nIn order\
    \ to test the generalizability of the PADT-SA framework across the agri-food sector\
    \ and \nmultinational companies, the framework was presented to 30 agri-food specialists\
    \ with various \nroles in the management of sustainability across the sector.\
    \ The roles and regions in which \nthe specialists operate are presented in the\
    \ Appendix 3. 18 of the respondents are in Australia \nwith a domestic and export\
    \ focus. 12 of the respondents are international, as shown in Figure \n39 below,\
    \ some operating in multiple countries. \n \nFigure 39: Countries in which respondents\
    \ operate their agri-food businesses. \nThe respondents rated the generalizability\
    \ and functionality of PADT-SA out of 5 with the \nresults presented in Table\
    \ 11 below.  \n \n \n \n \n \n112 \n \n \nTable 11: Rating of the generalizability\
    \ and functionality of PADT-SA \nThe respondents also added several comments in\
    \ the survey, which have informed the overall \ndevelopment of PADT-SA and are\
    \ referenced in the design principles presented in Table 12 \nbelow. \n \n6.7\
    \ Discussion  \nLearnings and reflections were systematically captured throughout\
    \ the research, which is an \nimportant component of Action Design Research (Sein\
    \ et al., 2011). As discussed in Section \n6.2, sustainability digitization efforts\
    \ are determined by the synergies between Industry 4.0 \ntechnologies, design\
    \ principles and sustainability functionality (Ching et al., 2022). These \nlearnings\
    \ have been captured in the form of design principles using the design category\
    \ \n‘design principles about user activity and an artifact’ including the characteristics\
    \ “what should \nusers be able to do” (Gregor et al., 2020). See Appendix 3 for\
    \ the list of respondents. \nDP \nNumber \nDesign Principles for Process Aware\
    \ Digital Twin systems for \nSustainable Agri-Food businesses \n1 \nDP: Framework\
    \ must utilize both semantics and a topology which are \ngeneralizable across\
    \ agri-food sectors and multinational businesses. \nContext and Rationale:  \n\
    “This is a must for cross industry adoption, and to standardise results if intending\
    \ \nto compare industries” Respondent (6). “Must have standardized units of \n\
    measure and a high level of data accuracy for comparison across industries, \n\
    otherwise data could be misleading or misused” Respondent (6). A current lack\
    \ \nof semantic interoperability is a barrier to leveraging Industry 4.0 technologies\
    \ \nto achieving sustainability outcomes (Rajput & Singh, 2021). Sustainability\
    \ \nmetrics for benchmarking are key in international trade negotiations (Gaitán-\n\
    Cremaschi et al., 2017). The sector is complex and agri-food specific definitions\
    \ \nand semantics are required (Warren & Thomas, 2023). \n2 \nDP: Sustainability\
    \ system must be rapidly and easily configurable; this can be \nachieved through\
    \ a model driven, low code, BPMS approach. \nContext and Rationale:  \n“One of\
    \ the biggest obstacles to adopting farm management software is a lack \nof customization\
    \ for individual businesses”. Respondent (13). “Skill and labour \nshortages,\
    \ in addition to volatile markets and climate change risk make such \n \n \n \n\
    \ \n113 \n \nfunctionality critical” Respondent (3). “Capability to enable customization\
    \ of \nsustainability calculation is helpful” Respondent (24). Business processes\
    \ \ndisrupted by Industry 4.0 technologies require highly adaptable BPM systems\
    \ \n(Czvetkó et al., 2022) with flexible modelling and runtime maintenance \n\
    (Sabatucci & Cossentino, 2019). Low code platforms need no or relatively little\
    \ \ncoding to create a completely operational application (Bano et al., 2022).\
    \ \n3 \nDP: New sensors and systems must be rapidly and easily onboarded to the\
    \ \nsustainability system through an agile BPMS approach.   \nContext and Rationale:\
    \ “Automatic and reliable environmental data is important \nfor making the right\
    \ decision” Respondent (24).  “A sustainability system is highly \nreliant on\
    \ the on the sensors and systems that support it” Respondent (23). \nIndustry\
    \ 4.0 technologies applicable to agri-food and sustainability are evolving \n\
    rapidly and platforms need agile functionality to meet the dynamic workflow \n\
    requirements (Czvetkó et al., 2022). BPMS leverage advances in data centric \n\
    workflows to optimise control flow (Kougka et al., 2020).  \n4 \nDP: Sustainability\
    \ system must not only measure the current state but also \nneeds to enable improvement\
    \ of outcomes, through monitoring and managing \noutputs. \nContext and Rationale:\
    \ “Sustainability should be measured by outcomes, not \npractices or inputs. Most\
    \ sustainability frameworks use input or practice-based \nmethodologies, ignoring\
    \ outcome. Functionality that gives businesses and \nresearchers a better picture\
    \ of the outcome of an action will go a long way to \nhelp closing the sustainability\
    \ gaps” Respondent (13). Digitization has the \npotential to promote sustainability\
    \ outcomes (Ajwani-Ramchandani, Figueira, \nTorres de Oliveira, Jha, et al., 2021).\
    \ Low code processes unify business users \nand information technology specialists\
    \ to rapidly automate processes to achieve \nbusiness goals (Harper, 2020). Smart\
    \ farming can only be achieved if it is \nsupported by reliable data and the automation\
    \ of monitoring and controlling \nactivities  (Faid et al., 2022). While not in\
    \ the scope of this research, the future \napplications of machine learning algorithms\
    \ will enable the prediction of \nsustainability outcomes, allowing for proactive\
    \ preventative actions to be taken. \n5 \nDP: Process aware digital twins accelerate\
    \ digitization for managing \nsustainability in the agri-food sector across agri-food\
    \ sectors and multinational \nbusinesses. \nContext and Rationale: “The need for\
    \ this data and information (enabled by \ndigital twin technology) is building\
    \ momentum very quickly. Potentially \nenvironmental accounts will have the same\
    \ rules as financial account reporting \nfrequency” Respondent (7). “Wider adoption\
    \ of digital twin technology for \nsustainability and maximising production practices\
    \ is long overdue in the agri-\nfood sector” Respondent (23). Digital twins in\
    \ agriculture provide an opportunity \nto achieve digitization in the sector (Warren\
    \ & Thomas, 2023). Process models \nare required in the engineering of a process\
    \ aware digital twin (Bano et al., \n2022). \nTable 12: Design principles for\
    \ process aware digital twin systems for sustainable agri-food supply chains \n\
    One of the unexpected survey responses received regarding the PADT-SA’s functionality\
    \  that \nthe framework and artifact provides corrective actions based on the\
    \ industry sustainability best \npractice frameworks loaded in its best practice\
    \ repository, was the suggestion that artificial \nintelligence be used to continuously\
    \ improve the repository (Respondent 27), with additional \nsuggestions that crowd\
    \ sourcing (Respondent 26), and stretch goals from international \nstandards (Respondent\
    \ 5) be utilised. Respondent 3 stated that the functionality was essential \n\
    due to the complexity of farming operations and that it was unlikely that productivity\
    \ and \nsustainability could be optimised without this capability.  These comments\
    \ indicate that the \nagri-food sector is aware of the potential for more advanced\
    \ applications such as artificial \n \n \n \n \n114 \n \nintelligence and machine\
    \ learning and opens the opportunity to explore these additional \ncapabilities\
    \ in further research. \n \nThe Design Science Research Checklist , see Table\

    The research question “How can we leverage emerging process centric technologies\
    \ to \nenhance the integration and interconnectivity of agri-food supply chains?”\
    \ is posed. \nTo address the research question, an action design research methodology\
    \ (ADR) (Sein et al., \n2011) was deployed via an engagement with industry practice\
    \ groups including farmers, \nsupply chain managers, industry subject matter experts\
    \ and customers of the agri-food sector, \nnamely supermarkets and agri-food distributors.\
    \ The methodology has combined both \nresearch and practice driven approaches.\
    \ Commencing with an investigation into the \nproblems that the agri-food supply\
    \ chain stakeholders are wishing to solve by deploying I4.0, \nthe research examines\
    \ the challenges faced in collecting, processing, and transforming the \ndata\
    \ on platforms. An I4.0 enabled platform was designed in consultation with the\
    \ practice \ngroups and an operational proof-of-concept artifact built and deployed\
    \ onto two agri-food \nsupply chains to enable evaluation, following the ADR methodology\
    \ as well as the Framework \nfor Evaluation in Design Science (FEDS) (Venable\
    \ et al., 2016).  \nI4.0 technologies applied to agriculture are allowing the\
    \ sector to become data driven, and \nmore productive while reducing their environmental\
    \ impact (Villa-Henriksen et al., 2020). The \ndata platform architecture and\
    \ artifact were evaluated on a cattle and a banana supply chain. \nThese supply\
    \ chains were selected because a) they have extensive supply chains, b) both \n\
    are adopting new I4.0 technologies, c) they are subject to increasing environmental\
    \ regulation, \nand d) high volumes of data could be collected for rigorous testing.\
    \ Further details on the \nproblems that the agri-food industry wishes to address\
    \ through I4.0 technologies are \npresented in Section 7.2 below with further\
    \ focus on the cattle and banana sectors. Section \n7.3 describes the engagement\
    \ with the various stakeholders during the action design research \nwhile Section\
    \ 7.4 presents the results of the research - in particular detailing the development\
    \ \nof the platform architecture and outlining its configuration.  \n7.2 Related\
    \ Work \nThe discussion of related work commences with a review of the systems\
    \ enabling data \nplatforms, together with additional requirements introduced\
    \ by I4.0 technologies. This is \nfollowed by investigation into the types of\
    \ I4.0 technologies deployed in agri-food supply \nchains, and finally, model\
    \ driven approaches to application development on these platforms. \n7.2.1 Current\
    \ technology challenges faced by Agri-Food businesses \nWith the increased challenges\
    \ faced by agri-food business owners, including exogenous \nthreats such as weather,\

    \ et al., 2012), \nthere is an increasing adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies\
    \ to mitigate these problems. Smart \n \n \n \n \n118 \n \nfarming can only be\
    \ achieved if it is supported by reliable data and the automation of \nmonitoring\
    \ and controlling activities (Faid et al., 2022). These technologies require new\
    \ \nplatform architectures with functionality that includes the ability to ingest\
    \ significant quantities \nof streaming data including image and video data, integration\
    \ with third party systems and the \nability to transform data from various sources\
    \ into actionable insights through decision models \nand algorithms (Antunes et\
    \ al., 2021). They also require the ability to rapidly configure user \ninterfaces\
    \ as new technologies are introduced which lead to new insights, reporting, and\
    \ \nvisualisation requirements. Traditional platforms for managing farming operations\
    \ and \ntransactions do not have these functionalities, however they are essential\
    \ to running the \nbusinesses. 75% of farm management systems are still PC based\
    \ and do not have the ability \nto support automatic data acquisition, monitoring,\
    \ and control (Fountas et al., 2015).  \nThe mobility of farmers in their daily\
    \ operations has led to increasing requirements for I4.0 \nenabled agriculture\
    \ platforms to be accessible from smart mobile phone devices, and the \nintroduction\
    \ of 5G networks in the future will allow for enhanced mobile phone functionality\
    \ \n(Villa-Henriksen et al., 2020). The main applications of I4.0 enabled technologies\
    \ in agriculture \nare precision farming, livestock, and greenhouses, with sensor-based\
    \ systems providing data \nto cloud-based platforms for the purposes of management\
    \ and decision support. A systematic \nliterature review of IoT based technologies\
    \ in agriculture by Farooq et al., (2020) determined \nthat research focus areas\
    \ are irrigation monitoring and controlling (16%), precision farming \n(16%),\
    \ soil monitoring (13%), temperature monitoring (12%), humidity monitoring (11%),\
    \ \nanimal monitoring and tracking (11%), water monitoring and controlling (7%),\
    \ disease \nmonitoring (5%), air monitoring (5%) and fertilization monitoring\
    \ (4%). My earlier research \nwork investigated the deployment of IoT sensors\
    \ for cattle farmers in Australia and the benefits \nof utilising Business Process\
    \ Management systems (BPMS) to convert this data into \nactionable insights (Keates,\
    \ 2019).  \n7.2.2 Integrated data platforms \nTraditional data platforms are designed\
    \ to capture data from discrete events. I4.0 technologies \nprovide a different\
    \ class of data; time series data and additional event data and information \n\
    from sensors (Ahmed et al., 2017). New platforms are required, which can bring\
    \ this data \nwhich was originally processed via proprietary solutions and protocols,\
    \ to a much more open \nand standard-compliant architecture (Antunes et al., 2021).\
    \ Building a platform on a single \nserver, with all components tightly coupled\
    \ together, for example sharing a single database is \nknown as a monolithic software\
    \ architecture or design, is not suitable for Industry 4.0 use \ncases due to\
    \ challenges with maintenance, scalability, and load balancing (Mondal et al.,\
    \ \n2021). Containerization is a technique to encapsulate a software system and\
    \ its dependencies \nin a single isolated package which can be deployed on various\
    \ platforms (Ibrahim et al., 2020). \n \n \n \n \n119 \n \nTo run containers at\
    \ scale the leading cloud providers have introduced serverless cloud \ncomputing\
    \ where users are charged only for the function invoking times, which is more\
    \ cost \neffective than the traditional virtual machine running time cost model\
    \ and alleviates the \nrequirement to manage the underlying infrastructure and\
    \ network configuration (Mondal et al., \n2021). \n7.2.3 Business process management\
    \ systems and Industry 4.0 \nBPMS in I4.0 are required to digitize and automate\
    \ business process workflows for the \ninteroperations between systems and applications\
    \ (Viriyasitavat et al., 2018). BPMS have \nbeen evolving with the integration\
    \ of components for real-time business process analysis and \na shift to service\
    \ oriented architecture (Pourmirza et al., 2019). BPM is an effective means of\
    \ \nleveraging low code methodology allowing users to visually manipulate representations\
    \ of \nprocesses. The applications layer is crucial in an I4.0 enabled platform\
    \ as it is the layer that \nactually adds value to the ingested data by transforming\
    \ it into insights for decision making \n(Villa-Henriksen et al., 2020). Low code\
    \ processes unify business users and information \ntechnology specialists to rapidly\
    \ automate processes to achieve business goals (Harper, \n2020).  \n7.3 Methodology\
    \ \nThe Action design research methodology (Sein et al., 2011) was used to gather\
    \ requirements, \ndefine functionality, and develop an I4.0 enabled platform architecture\
    \ and a supporting IT \nartifact, I4.0 platform, for evaluation of the architecture.\
    \ Two practice groups were established \nto provide feedback from an industry\
    \ and relevance perspective. The first group  consisted of \nrepresentatives from\
    \ two cattle farming businesses, one a medium sized family-owned \nbusiness, the\
    \ other a corporate This group also included two subject matter experts from the\
    \ \ncattle peak body. The second group consisted of representatives from a medium\
    \ sized banana \nfarm, two agronomy subject matter experts and a representative\
    \ of the horticulture peak body. \nInterviews with these participants occurred\
    \ via structured and unstructured interviews as well \nas several farm visits.\
    \ Evaluations of the I4.0 platform took place via a structured review of \nfunctionality\
    \ compared to original requirements.  Iterative feedback cycles occurred with\
    \ \npractice groups during the functionality definition and evaluation phases.\
    \ The requirements \ngathering was divided into three sections: a) understanding\
    \ the insights required by Australian \nbanana and cattle business owners (- the\
    \ chosen scope and study context for this study) to \nmanage their supply chains,\
    \ b) the types of I4.0 technologies being used or considered - \nincluding emerging\
    \ technologies for their businesses, and c) current gaps in the ability to \n\
    extract the insights from the I4.0 technologies for decision making. Table 14\

    \ by cattle and banana farmers. \nThe practice groups stressed that as new sensor-based\
    \ technologies have been introduced \ninto their sectors, many have been supported\
    \ by proprietary solutions, from mobile \napplications to cloud based, and as\
    \ the adoption of these technologies has grown, farmers \nand agri-food business\
    \ managers have been faced with the challenges of opening several \nwebsites or\
    \ mobile apps in order to obtain specific information without the ability to integrate\
    \ \nthe data for more advanced insights. Integration of these data was considered\
    \ a high priority, \nas well as integration with the traditional farm systems\
    \ which provide key operational \nmanagement data as noted by (Fountas et al.,\
    \ 2015).   \nA further high priority was the platform user interface with a request\
    \ for a high level of \ncustomization as well as geospatial functionality as the\
    \ location of sensors is often a key \ncomponent of the time series data. All\
    \ practice groups raised concerns about the costs of an \nI4.0 enabled platform\
    \ stating that investments in sensors were already significant, and that \ninvestments\
    \ in enabling platforms had to deliver appropriate rates of return. Traditional\
    \ \nplatform development is a time consuming and expensive process and in order\
    \ to meet the \nflexibility, responsiveness and extensibility required for the\
    \ ongoing functionality requirements \nfor I4.0 technologies a highly configurable\
    \ “low code” approach is required for platform \nconfiguration (Harper, 2020).\
    \ Ease of use, portability, cost, and robustness are key parameters \nto be considered\
    \ for an agri-food IoT platform (Faid et al., 2022). I4.0 enabled platforms for\
    \ \nthe agri-food sector need to ensure that the solutions create a real benefit\
    \ for farmers and are \navailable for both large and small producers (Villa-Henriksen\
    \ et al., 2020). \n \n \n \n \n122 \n \n7.4 Developing the I4.0platorm architecture\
    \ and IT artifact \n7.4.1 Developing the platform architecture \nThis section\
    \ covers the systematic development of an I4.0 platform architecture. The intent\
    \ is \nto show the ontology of a data ingestion and transformation solution capable\
    \ of meeting \nIndustry 4.0 functional requirements, so that it can be used as\
    \ blueprint for development of \nsuch platforms.  \nHaving established the I4.0\
    \ solution requirements from the cattle and banana sector, the \nresearcher focused\
    \ on the literature reviews into BPM, BPMS and data platform solutions from \n\
    Section 7.2. The researcher posited that a model driven architecture, incorporating\
    \ extensions \nto BPMN 2.0 notation and expressed via a BPMS could be a core platform\
    \ enabler for I4.0 \ntechnologies, being able to manage the dynamic workflows,\
    \ flexibility and runtime \nmaintenance challenges raised by Czvetkó et al. (2022)\
    \ and Sabatucci and Cossentino \n(2019). The BPMS approach to configuration of\
    \ the application layer is a core component of \nthe overall data architecture\
    \ as this is the layer that transforms the data into insights (Villa-\nHenriksen\
    \ et al., 2020). Building on the work of Graja et al. (2016) and Kozma et al.\
    \ (2019) \nthe BPMS architecture in the application layer has been extended to\
    \ include configuration and \norchestration of digital twins as well as configurable\
    \ forms invoking the “low code” \nconfiguration capabilities of BPMS described\
    \ by Harper (2020). \nThe data ingestion component consists of an IoT gateway\
    \ capable of ingesting data directly \nfrom sensors. Data acquisition brokers\
    \ are the components that connect the sensors and \nactuators to the platform,\
    \ the effective bridge between operational technology (OT) and \ninformation technology\
    \ (IT) (Antunes et al., 2021). Protocols such as message queue \ntelemetry transport\
    \ (MQTT) and data distribution service (DDS) (Ahmed et al., 2017), as well \n\
    as a data integration component capable of receiving data from third party systems\
    \ via \napplication programmable interfaces (API’s) are used by these brokers.\
    \ This layer has become \ncritical in the design of I4.0 technology enabled platforms\
    \ as it represents functionality not \npreviously required of traditional platforms.\
    \ The data sources include video from remote \ncameras and unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ (UAV)’s or drones to remote sensors connected via \nlow orbit satellite and\
    \ high frequency capture of machine data.  \nOnce the data has been ingested,\
    \ the data stream needs to be managed by an event steaming \nfunction which has\
    \ high throughput capability and is scalable. Such a data streaming service \n\
    is also required to join, aggregate, filter and transform data (Jafarpour et al.,\
    \ 2019). IoT \nsensors produce time series data, value, and time, and require\
    \ a database that is optimized \nfor storing such sequential data; these databases\
    \ are known as time series databases (TSDB) \n(Antunes et al., 2021). With businesses\
    \ becoming reliant on the I4.0 data for insights and \n \n \n \n \n123 \n \noperations,\
    \ backup, recovery, and security, including access control are required in a \n\
    services/administration layer across the platform (Ahmed et al., 2017). BPMS has\
    \ been shown \nto be effective in components of administration such as performance\
    \ monitoring of solution \ncores (Bocciarelli et al., 2017). \nWhile the architecture\
    \ described above can be deployed on a single server, with a single \noperating\
    \ system, in a “monolithic” architecture, this is not suitable for I4.0 technologies\
    \ due \nto the performance, reliability, adaptability and scalability required\
    \ from these applications \n(Mondal et al., 2021). Virtualization is a technology\
    \ that uses software to create an abstraction \nlayer for end users on top of\
    \ the computer hardware – the processors, memory, and storage, \nestablishing\
    \ virtual computers (known as virtual machines) which run their own operating\
    \ \nsystem. However, although this is a significant improvement over traditional\
    \ monolithic \narchitectures it is not sufficient for I4.0. Containerization,\
    \ an alternative to virtualization is \nrequired which focuses on extracting the\
    \ operating system level, and complete applications \ncan run within a container\
    \ (Bentaleb et al., 2021). Flexible high performance platforms require \ncloud\
    \ computing, containerization and container orchestration (Antunes et al., 2021).\
    \ Cloud \ncomputing allows for the deployment and scaling of computer services\
    \ on-demand, including \nthe provision of infrastructure, platforms, management,\
    \ and deployment of applications, \nenabled by BPMS and software as a service\
    \ to end users.  \nIn order to incorporate the functionality described above,\
    \ a layered solution architecture was \ndeveloped for the I4.0platform. The layers\
    \ consist of 1) Data Services 2) Data Ingestion and \nProcessing 3) Services (\
    \ for managing the solution) and 4) Application. The application layer \nis fully\
    \ process driven i.e., configured via the BPMS user interface. From the application\
    \ layer \nsensors and systems are integrated either via a preexisting sub process\
    \ stored within the \nprocess repository or via a new API entered via the BPMS\
    \ interface. The workflow and \norchestration of data through the core ingestion\
    \ and processing as well as services layers is \nalso managed by the BPMS. The\
    \ novel contribution by the researcher is the model driven \narchitecture, leveraging\
    \ business process management systems to rapidly orchestrate \nconfiguration to\
    \ enable customization for different applications in agri-food sustainability\
    \ \ndomain see Figure 40 below. \n \n \n \n \n124 \n \n \nFigure 40: Solution\
    \ architecture of the Industry 4.0 enabled platform \n7.4.2 Configuring the IT\
    \ Artifact “I4.0 platform”. \nCommencing with the application layer, the BPMS\
    \ solutions selected was Camunda \n(Camunda, 2019) which according to Geiger et\
    \ al. (2018) is one of only three that support \nBPMN 2.0 natively as well as\
    \ having efficient functionality (Meidan et al., 2017). Also within \nthe application\
    \ layer a containerized version of the inductive visual miner (Leemans et al.,\
    \ \n2018) was configured to provide additional process mining and compliance checking\
    \ \nfunctionality. Since the majority of data received from the I4.0 technologies\
    \ is times series \n(Antunes et al., 2021) this additional functionality can support\
    \ applications including validation \nof regulatory compliance as shown in the\
    \ case study in Section 7.5. Pentaho (Pentaho, 2021) \nwas selected for data integration\
    \ based on its model driven architecture which is comparable \nto a BPMS. The\
    \ solution was containerized using Docker (Docker, 2022), which is the most \n\
    popular platform for containerization for different operating systems (Bentaleb\
    \ et al., 2021). \n \n \n \n \n125 \n \nThe current visualization for the IT artifact\
    \ is Angular JS which is  an open-source web-based \nuser interface tool originally\
    \ maintained by Google, which uses both HTML (Hyper Text \nMarkup Language) and\
    \ Javascript for application development (Shrivastav, 2018).  In future \nenhancements\
    \ to the I4.0 technology platform artifact, Grafana (Grafana, 2022) which is a\
    \ \nweb-based visualization dashboard that allows sensor data to be visualized\
    \ in near real-time \nwill be used for configuring the user interfaces. Grafana\
    \ has been designed to extract and \nvisualize data from large databases and provides\
    \ several options for displaying the extracted \ninformation from the times series\
    \ databases for IoT applications (Al Fajar & Samijayani, 2021). \nPrivate cloud\
    \ platform providers such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and Microsoft \n\
    Azure provide on demand platforms and API’s on a metered pay as you go basis,\
    \ and have \nthe ability to provide scalability, reliability, and advanced storage\
    \ and processing functionality \nand are some of the most used to build IoT platforms\
    \ (Antunes et al., 2021). \nThe above solutions were configured on a Google Cloud\
    \ service; the infrastructure as a \nservice option was used to provide a cloud\
    \ agnostic solution. One of the advantages of \ncontainerizing the various data\
    \ ingestion, streaming, and processing functions as well as the \napplications\
    \ is that the resultant solution is portable between different cloud providers\
    \ or \ndeployable on a server at a specific business location. \nFigure 41 below\
    \ is one of the interfaces of the resultant I4.0 platform, it is an example of\
    \ one \nof the model driven architectures in which the BPMS workflow engine has\
    \ been configured to \ningest real time weather data and vehicle tracking data\
    \ and to provide alerts to weather \nconditions as well as the progress of a vehicle\
    \ compared to its expected arrival at pre-\ndesignated weigh points. \n \nFigure\

    \ \n \n \n \n \n126 \n \n7.5 Applying the architecture to the Use Cases \nThe\
    \ I4.0 enabled platform architecture, I4.0 platform, was expressed through the\
    \ configuration \nof the I4.0 enabled data platform artifact and was evaluated\
    \ through a use case on both the \ncattle supply chain and the banana supply chain.\
    \  \n7.5.1 Architecture Evaluation and Results from the Use Cases \nFor the cattle\
    \ farm use case the I4.0 enabled data platform was configured to ingest individual\
    \ \ncattle records (animal identification from RFID tag and weight) and determine\
    \ the complete \nlife cycle provenance of the animals. IoT devices: RFID readers\
    \ ,and cattle weigh scales \nacross four farms that are part of a larger cattle\
    \ business captured the inter farm movements \nof the individual animals as well\
    \ as their weights. Due to the remote location of these farms \ndata were collected\
    \ daily on ruggedized laptops and sent to the cattle business’s headquarters \n\
    overnight and stored on a SQL database. Via API the data was ingested to I4.0\
    \ platform for \nanalysis of the individual animal’s provenance ( using the containerized\
    \ inductive visual miner \nprocess intelligence algorithm)  for correlation with\
    \ meat quality output and price received for \nthe meat product. The purpose of\
    \ the analysis is to provide insights as to which animal breeds \nand farm management\
    \ practices have led to the best financial return. Anomalies in the \nmovements\
    \ of the animals were detected, with causes also identified. The potential business\
    \ \nbenefits from such insights are significant with research into productivity\
    \ differences in \nNorthern Australia showing an 18% difference in productivity\
    \ between the top 25% and the \naverage, translating to double the profitability\
    \ per animal. These differences were attributed to \nadoption of best practices\
    \ in cattle management (McLean et al., 2020). The cattle business \nthat participated\
    \ in the case study also participated in the McLean benchmarking research and\
    \ \nevaluated the I4.0 platform as an enabler to achieving productivity improvements\
    \ across the \ncattle supply chain. \nOne of the outputs of processing this data\
    \  on the I4.0 platform is shown in Figure 42 below. \nThis output shows the cattle\
    \ movements across a section of the integrated cattle business’s \nsupply chain\
    \ over a selected period of time. The output provided insights into how many \n\
    cattle where on each farm during the period and most importantly the transport\
    \ of cattle \nbetween farms, which contributes to the overall cost of producing\
    \ the cattle.   \n \n \n \n \n127 \n \n \nFigure 42:Analysis of individual cattle\
    \ movements displayed on I4.0 platform (screenshots from HPIM) \nFor the banana\
    \ use case, near real time GPS data from key operational assets: fertilizer and\
    \ \npesticide application vehicles as well as vehicles supporting bagging and\
    \ harvesting \noperations is ingested to the I4.0 platform via MQTT protocols.\
    \  The boundaries of each field \n(or block) within the banana plantation were\
    \ digitally captured, “geo-fenced”. The I4.0 platform \ntransformed the data to\
    \ extensible event stream format (XES) (Dumas et al., 2018), before \nbeing orchestrated\
    \ via the Camunda BPMS to the containerized inductive visual miner \nalgorithm\
    \ (Leemans et al., 2018), from which two insights have been mined a) the productivity\
    \ \nof the various banana operations and b) the regulatory compliance of fertilizer\
    \ and chemical \nadditions in each field. On evaluating the benefits of the I4.0\
    \ platform insights the banana \nfarmer observed a 25% increase in productivity\
    \ in being able to direct operations to specific \nbanana plants more efficiently,\
    \ noting that banana plants mature at different times and that \ngeo location\
    \ data are key to efficient planning. The banana farmer further observed a 50%\
    \ \nincrease in the productivity of producing regulatory fertilizer and chemical\
    \ addition reports due \nto the insights provided by the I4.0 platform. \nThe\
    \ results of processing this data on the I4.0 enabled data platform is shown in\
    \ Figure 43 \nbelow. \n \n \n \n \n128 \n \n \nFigure 43: Compliance checking\
    \ of key banana operations on I4.0 platform (screenshots from HPIM) \n7.5.2 Extraction\
    \ of design principles \nThe architecture for I4.0 enabled data platforms has\
    \ been designed through a rigorous \napplication of Action Design Research methodology\
    \ (Sein et al., 2011), applying both rigour \nthrough literature research and\
    \ relevance through engagement with industry practice groups \nin the cattle and\
    \ banana sectors as well as the broader horticulture sector. The I4.0 enabled\
    \ \nplatform, was subsequently configured through iterative build, and evaluate\
    \ cycles to finally \ndeliver use cases for the practice groups to evaluate. From\
    \ the learnings and feedback of the \nADR process the following design principles\
    \ for I4.0 enabled platforms within in the agri-food \nsector were extracted,\
    \ some of which have been shown to be generalizable across industry. \nIn this\
    \ research the focus was on the design category introduced by Gregor et al. (2020),\
    \ who \ndescribe ‘design principles about user activity and an artifact’, including\
    \ the characteristics \n‘what should users be able to do’ with an artifact and\
    \ the features it should have. The \nresearcher categorized the design principles\
    \ for an I4.0 enabled data platform as presented \nin Table 15 below. \n  \nDP\
    \ \nNumber \nDesign Principle with supporting insights from the Action Design\
    \ Research \napproach \n1 \nDesign Principles for Applications Layer \n1A \nDP:\
    \ I4.0 enabled data platforms require a Model Driven Architecture.  \nContext\
    \ and Rationale:  The dynamic nature of business environments often disrupted\
    \ \nby new I4.0 technologies requires regular changes to workflow models which\
    \ BPM \nsystems can manage (Czvetkó et al., 2022). Dynamic workflows deal with\
    \ changes in \nprocess execution which require flexible modeling and runtime maintenance\
    \ (Sabatucci \n& Cossentino, 2019). The rapid configuration of the cattle and\
    \ banana use cases using \nI4.0 platform supports this DP.  \n1B \nDP: The processes\
    \ associated with I4.0 technologies should be captured in a BPM \nrepository.\
    \  \nContext and Rationale: With sensors and their systems becoming ubiquitous,\
    \ a system \nis required to capture the model logic, settings, and parameters.\
    \ As I4.0 technologies \nevolve, and the systems mature from descriptive insights\
    \ to prediction and prescription \n \n \n \n \n129 \n \nthis principle becomes\
    \ more critical especially when AI and Machine Learning elements \nare added.\
    \  \n1C \nDP: Application layers require a high degree of configurability. A BPM\
    \ approach to \nstandardizing the methodology as well as a BPMS enabled solution\
    \ for implementation \nis required.  \nContext and Rationale: Onboarding of new\
    \ sensors into an I4.0 ecosystem requires \nseveral steps of connectivity, integration,\
    \ and testing of protocols. Such processes \ncannot rely on skilled developers\
    \ as the cost and time to implement will impact the value \nproposition of the\
    \ technologies.  During this research, requirements from the banana \nfarmer expanded\
    \ after the initial insights indicated that further benefits could be \nextracted.\
    \ More advanced insights were requested involving additional decision models \n\
    and analytics. The BPMS capability allowed for a solution such as shown in Figure\
    \ 4 to \nbe extended with minor development requirements.  \n1D \nDP: A BPM approach\
    \ to standardizing configuration of digital twins is required which can \nbe further\
    \ enabled by a BPMS in the application layer. \nContext and Rationale: The heterogenous\
    \ nature of the integrated components of a \ndigital twin make the application’s\
    \ process complex and difficult to design and verify. \n(Graja et al., 2016) argue\
    \ that BPM and BPMs provide a standardized bridge for the gap \nbetween the design\
    \ and implementation of a digital twin.  \n1E \nDP: Model driven architecture\
    \ should include low code User Interface (UI) development. \nContext and Rationale:\
    \ Industry 4.0 technologies deliver advanced insights; however, \nthese insights\
    \ are obtained by transforming the data and presenting it a useful manner. \n\
    Without user friendly displays of the data the benefits will not be fully realized.\
    \ Low code \napplications also allow the end users to participate in the development\
    \ which is a \nsignificant business benefit (Harper, 2020). A key learning from\
    \ the configuration of the \nI4.0 platform for both use cases was the effort required\
    \ to develop the UI’s especially \nwhen extended functionality was required. The\
    \ benefits of rapid configuration of the data \ningestion and processing layers\
    \ with the BPMS was often delayed by UI programming \nand reinforced the key requirement\
    \ for low code UI development. \n2 \nDesign Principles for Data Ingestion and\
    \ Processing Layer \n2A \nDP: Each layer of the technology stack should be containerized.\
    \  \nContext and Rationale:  Containerization is a technique to encapsulate a\
    \ software \nsystem and its dependencies in a single isolated package which can\
    \ deployed on \nvarious platforms (Ibrahim et al., 2020). Containerization enables\
    \ higher performance \ncomputing while providing more efficient management of\
    \ the platform’s reliability (back \nup management) as well as security. \n2B\
    \ \nDP: Processing of streaming data is the critical function in the data ingestion\
    \ and \nprocessing layer. \nContext and Rationale: The key difference between\
    \ a traditional platform and an I4.0 \nenabled platform is the type of data processed.\
    \ I4.0 technologies produce vast quantities \nof time series data, some at high\
    \ frequency (Antunes et al., 2021). The selected data \nstreaming and transformation\
    \ solution needs to be scalable and efficient. Apache Kafka \nhas become one of\
    \ the most popular streaming platforms due to its ability to stream I4.0 \ntype\
    \ data (Jafarpour et al., 2019).  \n2C \nDP: I4.0 platforms require time series\
    \ data bases for multi-source heterogeneous data. \nContext and Rationale: The\
    \ volume of multi-source heterogeneous spatial data, \nincluding structured data\
    \ such as controller data, semi-structured data such as quality \n \n \n \n \n\
    130 \n \n \n \n7.5.3 Discussion research limitations and future work \nThis research\
    \ did not investigate the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning\
    \ \ntechnologies into an I4.0 technologies enabled platform. It is recognized\
    \ that these \ntechnologies will gain a greater role in decision intelligence\
    \ and operation of autonomous \nsystems in agri-food supply chains. While the\
    \ deployment will be via the containerized \nmethods described these applications\
    \ will be studied in more detail in future research. \n \nThe Design Science Research\
    \ Checklist was used, see Table 16 below, to review the \nRelevance, Rigour and\
    \ Design cycles (Hevner, 2010) of this work to ensure that the Design \nScience\
    \ Research Guidelines discussed in Section 3.8 have been met.   \n \nNo. \nQuestion\

    \ technologies \nbe leveraged to enhance the integration and \ninterconnectivity\
    \ of agri-food supply chains? \n2 \nWhat is the artifact and how is it \npresented?\
    \ \nThe IT artifact has been continuously developed \nacross the phases of research,\
    \ commencing with \na PC -based artifact in Phase to the cloud-based \napplication\
    \ across Phases 2,3 and 4. In its final \nformat the I4.0 platform it has the\
    \ full technology \nstack: \ndata \nsources, \ndata \ningestion \nand \nprocessing,\
    \ services, and application layers. \n3 \nWhat research heuristics were used \n\
    to build the artifact? \n1) Selection heuristics – guided by \nfeedback from stakeholder\
    \ interviews \n2) Procedural heuristics – influenced by \nsupply chain discovery\
    \ (Bingham et al., \n2007), (Bingham & Eisenhardt, 2011) \n4 \nHow are the artifact\
    \ and design \nprocesses \ngrounded \nby \nthe \nThe research design was focused\

    \ this \nresearch consideration was given to including satellite image and video\
    \ analysis data. \nAlthough the additional database requirements made it unfeasible\
    \ for the scope of this \nwork, however it provided a deeper understanding of\
    \ I4.0 time series database \nrequirements. \n2D \nDP: Model driven I4.0 platforms\
    \ require process intelligence for compliance checking \nand analytics. \nContext\
    \ and Rationale: A model driven architecture, incorporating BPMS and \nprocessing\
    \ time series data provides significant opportunity for the incorporation of \n\
    process intelligence at the application layer as well as services layer. Process\
    \ \nintelligence can compliance check streaming data against a best practice standard\
    \ as \nwell as detect anomalies in business processes (Leemans et al., 2018),\
    \ (Van Der Aalst, \n2016). The benefits of process intelligence in extracting\
    \ supply chain insights in the agri-\nfood sector was demonstrated in my previous\
    \ work (Keates et al., 2020)  as well as in \nthe cattle use case. \nTable 15:\

    \ academic contribution requirements of \nInformation Systems Research (Sein et\
    \ al., \n2011). The knowledge bases from the \ndisciplines of process science,\
    \ supply chain, \nagri-food, Industry 4.0 and IoT as well as \nInformation Systems\
    \ related to platform \ndevelopment, containerization and streaming \ndata services\

    \ Science Checklist as a framework for reflecting on the casual factors that \n\
    led to the successful development of the I4.0 platform and framework, the researcher\
    \ \nconcludes that the historical slow level of adoption of digital technologies\
    \ in the agri-tech sector \n(Fountas et al., 2015), (Antunes et al., 2021), coupled\
    \ with the growing appreciation that smart \nagriculture can only be achieved\
    \ if supported by reliable data and the automation of monitoring \nand controlling\
    \ activities (Faid et al., 2022) created the opportunity to expedite platform\
    \ and \napplication development through a process driven, low code approach (Harper,\
    \ 2020), \n(Czvetkó et al., 2022). \n \n \n \n \n \n132 \n \nChapter 8 Discussion\
    \ and Conclusions \n \n8.1 Chapter Introduction  \nIn this chapter the outcomes\
    \ and deliverables from each phase of the research are discussed, \nincluding\
    \ the progress made towards closing the research gaps presented in Chapter 1.\
    \ \nContributions from both the practice and theoretical perspective are presented\
    \ in relation to \nthe research questions addressed. In addition, limitations\
    \ of the research and future work are \npresented. The overarching research question\
    \ which has guided all phases of this research \nwas “How can emerging process\
    \ centric technologies assist in solving complex agri-\nfood supply chain challenges?”.\
    \ The overall aim was to “make a difference” in the critical \nprofessional practice\
    \ of agri-food supply chain operation, by developing solutions that can \naddress\
    \ the challenges the industrial sector faces, while also contributing to the theoretical\
    \ \ndomains of agri-food supply chain management and supply chain management in\
    \ general. \n8.2 Synopsis of Study Deliverables and Contributions \n8.2.1 Research\
    \ Question 1: Process Centric Integration \nThe study commenced with the research\
    \ question: “how can we leverage emerging process \ncentric technologies to enhance\
    \ the integration and interconnectivity of agri-food \nsupply chains?” and the\
    \ proposition that gaps in the strategic management of food supply \nchains could\
    \ be addressed by a process centric framework.  \nThe research outcomes are: \n\
    • \nA Multi Perspective Supply Chain Analytics (MPSCA) framework was presented\
    \ with \nempirical support, highlighting its ability to uniquely combine previously\
    \ fragmented \ndata and process mining methodologies to enable effective analysis\
    \ of an integrated \nfood supply chain.  \n• \nSupply chain insights were obtained\
    \ from the retrospective process mining of individual \nanimal records though\
    \ the lifecycle of the animals.  \n• \nA basic digital twin of Case A’s cattle\
    \ supply chain created by process mining the actual \nanimal event data using\
    \ the Directly Follows Visual Miner (Leemans et al., 2019a) and \nfiltering out\
    \ all anomalies. \nThe practice outcomes are:  \n• \nMined process data can be\
    \ compared with meat quality reports and grade related \npricing data to determine\
    \ the best cattle breeds and cattle management processes \nincluding supplementary\
    \ feeding programs, to improve overall profitability.  \n \n \n \n \n133 \n \n\
    • \nData analytics on the weight distribution of the animals at an individual\
    \ farm level \nprovides valuable insights as to when the animals should be moved\
    \ to the next stage \nof the supply chain. Processors seek uniformity in animal\
    \ weight and apply cost \npenalties when individual animals fall outside of the\
    \ range.  \n• \nA simulation of the cow weight per week gain through the maturity\
    \ lifecycle, based on \nnormal grazing (Meat and Livestock Australia, 2021). This\
    \ basic “digital cow” coupled \nwith the digital twin of the cattle supply chain\
    \ can provide a reference model for \nperformance checking.  \n8.2.2 Research\
    \ Question 2: Monitoring and Managing Risk \nThe goal was to develop a supply\
    \ chain risk monitoring and management framework that could \nsemi-autonomously\
    \ detect the commencement of a risk event including macro-level events \nthat\
    \ could potentially disrupt a supply chain. Once detected, appropriate plans and\
    \ processes \ncould be deployed to mitigate the disruptive impacts of the risk.\
    \ In this research, the question, \n“how can agri-food supply chain risk be monitored\
    \ and managed using emerging \nprocess centric technologies?” was posed. A proposition\
    \ that data and process analytics \ncan be configured to semi-autonomously monitor\
    \ and manage agri-food supply chains for risk \nwas forwarded. Working closely\
    \ with industry experts in both beef and horticulture supply \nchains, a digitally\
    \ enabled supply chain risk management framework, with a supporting IT \nArtifact\
    \ was developed, initially for the beef industry and then expanded for the horticulture\
    \ \nindustry, with evaluation on a banana supply chain. Medium sized businesses\
    \ were focused \non as they are most at threat, not having the available resources\
    \ to manage risk. A rigorous \nevaluation process that commenced at ideation and\
    \ continued throughout each build stage \nright through to final evaluation has\
    \ proven that the proposition is true; agri-food supply chains \ncan be semi-autonomously\
    \ monitored and managed for risk in medium sized businesses. The \nframework (together\
    \ with the supporting IT Artifact) presented the procedural stages and \nsystems\
    \ mechanisms in realizing this. The research has introduced several novel \ncontributions\
    \ presented as design principles for agri- food supply chain risk management with\
    \ \nsome being further abstracted to a general supply chain risk management level.\
    \  \nThe research outcomes are: \n• \nA model-based methodology for monitoring\
    \ agri-food supply chains, semi-\nautonomously, for risk, using Industry 4.0 technologies.\
    \ \n• \nAlerting of agri-food supply chain risk and provision of recommended mitigations\
    \ from \na process digital twin. \n• \nUse of templated risk mitigation workflows\
    \ to provide “no code” configuration. \n \n \n \n \n134 \n \n• \nDesign principles\
    \ for both the methodology, sensor selection and deployment, and IT \nArtifact.\
    \ \nThe practice outcomes are: \n• \nApplication of process mining techniques\
    \ to extract insights from supply chain event \ndata. \n• \nEnablement of online\
    \ event streaming in near real time. \n• \nNovel application of a process digital\
    \ twin to provide risk mitigation decision support.  \n• \nApplication of BPMS\
    \ technologies to provide a “no code” configuration approach for \nthe risk mitigation\
    \ digital twin.  \nOverall, the novel contribution is the combination of a process\
    \ aware digital twin with a \nbusiness process management system to rapidly configure\
    \ semi-autonomous, domain \nspecific supply chain risk management solutions. \n\
    8.2.3 Research Question 3: Monitoring and Managing Sustainability \nTop multinational\
    \ corporation managers need to demonstrate commitment to corporate \nsustainability\
    \ through integrating it into their long-term strategic planning (Fontana et al.,\
    \ \n2022). Traditional management performance frameworks are not relevant in the\
    \ current \nbusiness environment and organisations should design processes that\
    \ support Industry 4.0 \nand sustainability objectives (P. Kumar et al., 2021).\
    \  \nIn addressing the research question: “How can emerging process centric technologies\
    \ \nenable the achievement of sustainability development goals within agri-food\
    \ supply \nchains?” the researcher set out to develop a framework that would \
    \ manage sustainability \nacross the various sectors and internationally as sustainability\
    \ becomes increasingly important \nin global agri-food trade (Gaitán-Cremaschi\
    \ et al., 2017). Combining Industry 4.0 technologies \nwhich are allowing the\
    \ sector to be more productive while reducing the sustainability impact \n(Villa-Henriksen\
    \ et al., 2020), and extending the work of Bano et al. (2022) by utilising a low\
    \ \ncode, model driven approach to configure process aware digital twins, the\
    \ researcher has \ndeveloped an agri-food sustainability framework which can be\
    \ configured at a sector and \ncountry level, while leveraging the data and process\
    \ analytics capabilities of a common \nIndustry 4.0 enabled platform. This approach\
    \ also helps mitigate some of the multinational \ncompany challenges of engagement\
    \ without commitment (Fontana et al., 2022), as the sector \nand country sustainability\
    \ managers and subject matter experts are able to directly contribute \nto the\
    \ PADT-SA configuration, a key factor for adoption (Freidberg, 2022).  \n \n \n\
    \ \n \n \n135 \n \nThe research outcomes are: \n• \nAn extensible, hierarchical,\
    \ sustainability framework, configurable at farm and country \nlevel, for global\
    \ deployment by multi-national companies to enable the semi-\nautonomous monitoring\
    \ and management of sustainability outcomes. \n• \nDesign principles for a process\
    \ aware digital twin system for sustainable agri-food \nbusinesses, covering framework,\
    \ sensor, and platform requirements. \nThe practice outcomes are: \n• \nA framework\
    \ that utilizes advanced Industry 4.0 sensing and continuous environmental \n\
    monitoring to deliver actionable insights to agri-food businesses. \n• \nA framework\
    \ designed to be rapidly implemented on a model driven IT artifact. \n• \nAn IT\
    \ Artifact that leverages BPMS capabilities and process mining and compliance\
    \ \nchecking algorithms to create a process aware digital twin to monitor, simulate,\
    \ and \nmanage sustainability outcomes. \n8.2.4 Research Question 4 (+RQ1) Designing\
    \ an I4.0 enabled Platform.  \nAs mentioned in 8.2.1 the Phase 4 research evolved\
    \ from the secondary contributions of the \nIT Artifacts from research phases\
    \ 1 to 3. Risk areas to be considered when deploying IoT \nbased agriculture systems\
    \ include connectivity, security, cost, lack of technology knowledge, \nreliability,\
    \ scalability, localization, harsh device environment, and interoperability (Farooq\
    \ et \nal., 2020). These risk areas and challenges reflect the broader challenges\
    \ of deploying I4.0 \ntechnologies via platforms (Ahmed et al., 2017).  \nThe\
    \ researcher posed the question ““How can a product platform be architected to\
    \ \nsupport the deployment of Industry 4.0 technologies for the agri-food supply\
    \ chain?” \nThrough an action design science methodology, the current state of\
    \ data platforms and \nrequirements of agri-food businesses implementing I4.0\
    \ technologies was researched. A \nsolution architecture for an I4.0 platform\
    \ was developed, which was subsequently expressed \nin an IT artifact, the I4.0\
    \ platform, to configure and evaluate on two agri-food supply chain use \ncases.\
    \ The evaluation from the farmers and their associated industry bodies is positive,\
    \ all \nhave concluded that the I4.0 platform provides an effective means of extracting\
    \ business \nrelevant insights from their investments in I4.0 technologies. The\
    \ demonstrated functionality \nachieved through the I4.0 platform has answered\
    \ the research question. The low code value \nproposition is significant in that\
    \ business users are able to design automation applications \nthemselves, surmounting\
    \ IT backlogs and shortages in skilled developers (Harper, 2020). This \nwill\
    \ also be a key factor in the future addressing the cost factor which was a major\
    \ area of \nconcern raised by the practice group.  In the near future decision\
    \ support from smart \n \n \n \n \n136 \n \nagriculture platforms will take over\
    \ some of the management and decision making tasks of \nfarmers and advisors which\
    \ will require change management and adaption (Villa-Henriksen et \nal., 2020).\
    \ From the lessons learnt in the implementations of these use cases and supported\
    \ \nby the research, design principles have been extracted, which are presented\
    \ for consideration \nin future research into I4.0 enabled platforms for agri-food\
    \ supply chains, and some of which \nare relevant to I4.0 enabled platforms in\
    \ general.  \nThe research outcomes are: \n• \nAn I4.0 platform architecture,\
    \ showing the ontology of data ingestion and \ntransformation solution capable\
    \ of meeting Industry 4.0 functional requirements. \nThe practice outcomes are:\
    \ \n• \nAn IT artifact with a model driven architectural approach to the applications\
    \ layer, \nenabled by BPMS and powered by process intelligence technologies. \
    \ \n• \nBPMS architecture in the application layer extended to include configuration\
    \ and \norchestration of digital twins as well as configurable forms invoking\
    \ the “low code” \nconfiguration capabilities of BPMS.  \n• \nProcess orchestration\
    \ and process mining to delegate automated activities to \nsoftware applications,\
    \ operationalising the respective frameworks in a rapid, low code \nmanner. \n\
    In the discussion section of each phase of the research is a reflection on the\
    \ novel \ncontributions based on the Design Science Research checklist as well\
    \ as the casual \nrelationships that led to development of these contributions.\
    \ A supplementary question being \n“why hasn’t this research been done before?”\
    \ The key factor that has emerged from this \nanalysis is that the agri-food sector\
    \ has been a low adopter of technology, partly due to the \ngrowing complexity\
    \ of information technology (Antunes et al., 2021), the sector must become \n\
    more familiar with the I4.0, data and process centric technologies which are still\
    \ considered \nexperimental in the sector (Basso & Antle, 2020), which will drive\
    \ adoption of best practice \ntechnologies such as digital twins (Pylianidis et\
    \ al., 2021). Each of the case study participants \nwere identified by their respective\
    \ industry peak bodies as being industrial innovators and \nearly adopters which\
    \ enabled the achievement of the research outcomes. \n \n8.2.5 Integration of\
    \ frameworks – a new opportunity? \nThe delivery of the research outcomes, with\
    \ the capability of integrating multi systems together \nresulted in the researcher\
    \ reflecting on the overall research question: \n \n \n \n \n137 \n \n“How can\
    \ emerging process centric technologies assist in solving complex agri-food \n\
    supply chain challenges?”. \nThis overarching research question leads to another\
    \ question “can the methodological \nframeworks presented in Chapters 4, 5 and\
    \ 6 be integrated into a single framework?” \nThe answer is yes. Firstly, there\
    \ is a strong connection between the productivity and \nprofitability focus of\
    \ the multi perspective supply chain analytics framework and both the \ndigitally\
    \ enabled risk management and the process aware digital twin for sustainable agri-food\
    \ \nframeworks. Productivity and profitability are affected by risk, and a framework\
    \ that provides \nrisk mitigation therefore has a direct impact on a business’s\
    \ overall financial performance. In \nthe broader definition of sustainability,\
    \ productivity and profitability are categorised as \neconomic sustainability\
    \ factors (Choirun et al., 2020), which together with social and \nenvironmental\
    \ sustainability are included in the overall PADT-SA framework. Agri-food \nbusinesses\
    \ need to be profitable to drive social and environmental sustainability outcomes\
    \ \n(Place & Myrdal Miller, 2020), therefore a logical connection between the\
    \ frameworks exists. \nThe research and outcomes of Chapter 7 have demonstrated\
    \ that an overall Industry 4.0 \nenabled data platform would be capable of supporting\
    \ the data ingestion, storage, and \nanalytics of such a combined framework. Referring\
    \ to Section 2.3 and the definition of a supply \nchain control tower (Trzuskawska-Grzesińska,\
    \ 2017) such a combined framework with an \nenabling IT platform could well be\
    \ described as an “Agri-Food Supply Chain Control Tower”. \nKalaboukas et al.,\
    \ (2021) explored the concept of cognitive digital twins in agile supply \nnetworks,\
    \ recognizing that the focus of early adopters of digital twins has been on \n\
    manufacturing and maintenance and not in supply chains.  \nA conceptual diagram\
    \ of the “Agri-Food Supply Chain Control Tower” is presented in Figure \n44 below.\
    \ The contributions delivered in this research would be “applications” with the\
    \ control \ntower, sharing the common data platform and in some cases the data\
    \ as well. A common user \ninterface would allow the user to select the required\
    \ applications or combinations of these \napplications. The architecture of the\
    \ I4.0 platform would allow for more applications to be \nadded as well as advanced\
    \ applications such as machine learning and artificial intelligence.  \n \n \n\

    \ Control Tower \n8.2.6 Generalizability of the learnings from this research for\
    \ supply chain \nmanagement \nThe Covid 19 pandemic highlighted the strategic\
    \ importance of supply chain management \nirrespective of the industrial sector,\
    \ people working in the supply chain became recognized as \nessential workers\
    \ and the impacts of supply chain disruption such as food, medicine, and fuel\
    \ \nwere visible to everyone (Sheffi, 2020). Gartner (Gartner, 2022) define supply\
    \ chain as “a \ngroup of functions and processes focused on optimizing the flow\
    \ of products, services and \nrelated information from sources of supply to customers\
    \ or points of demand.” Irrespective of \nthe product type the principles of supply\
    \ chain management applied are generally the same. \nAgri-food supply chains,\
    \ especially those that are sensitive to handling or temperature require \nspecial\
    \ attention due to food safety and quality considerations and the regulation and\
    \ transport \nof live animals requires additional care (Jedermann et al., 2014).\
    \ The contributions delivered \nin the four phases of the research have addressed\
    \ some of the gaps identified in the sector \n(Nakandala et al., 2017),(Liu et\
    \ al., 2021; Srinivasan et al., 2017), however they have also \nprovided several\
    \ generalizable contributions which can benefit supply chain management in \n\
    general. Current supply chain management systems generate significant amounts\
    \ of event \ndata which provides the opportunity to leverage the methodological\
    \ frameworks and IT \nArtifacts developed in this research. These areas include\
    \ the following: \n• \nGeneration of supply chain provenance and lifecycle, from\
    \ supply chain event data, \nusing process mining techniques to associate with\
    \ product quality/customer \nexperience for continuous improvement. The novel\
    \ use of these technologies, applied \n \n \n \n \n139 \n \nin this research,\
    \ could facilitate autonomous monitoring of any supply chain utilising \ntrackers,\
    \ and provide valuable insights especially in the case of high value, time, or\
    \ \ntemperature sensitive consignments.    \n• \nMulti perspective analysis of\
    \ complex supply chains for optimization. The ability to \nmonitor additional\
    \ parameters concurrently with location, for example temperature, \nhumidity,\
    \ light exposure, and orientation/shock has application across general supply\
    \ \nchain management with sensitive freight, providing insights that could ultimately\
    \ deliver \na better-quality product to the customer. \n• \nSemi-autonomous risk\
    \ monitoring and management of critical supply chains \nintegrating Industry 4.0\
    \ sensing technologies with process mining and process aware \ndigital twins.\
    \ Since the exogenous risk factors faced by supply chains are often \ncommon,\
    \ for example, extreme weather, labour, and regulation issues, the DSCRM \nframework\
    \ has applicability facilitating risk management across many industrial \nsectors.\
    \ \n• \nHierarchical, extensible, model driven sustainability framework for monitoring\
    \ and \nmanaging sustainability. While the Process Aware Digital Twin framework\
    \ and solution \nis focused on agri-food sustainability, the techniques could\
    \ be adapted across other \nmanufacturing sectors, using a similar hierarchical\
    \ approach to the framework design. \n• \nModel driven, Industry 4.0 enabled platform\
    \ architecture is highly generalizable and \ncan enabling rapid configuration\
    \ for any supply chain solution. \n8.2.6 Extensions of the contributions leveraging\
    \ BPMS and Industry 4.0 \nThis research has highlighted the benefits of integrating\
    \ BPMS systems with Industry 4.0 \ntechnologies to manage the disruptive nature\
    \ of these technologies through dynamic \nworkflows (Czvetkó et al., 2022; Kougka\
    \ et al., 2020; Sabatucci & Cossentino, 2019). BPM \nalso provides a standardized\
    \ bridge to process aware digital twin configuration (Graja et al., \n2016). One\
    \ of the functionalities of the overall methodologies and IT Artifact frameworks\
    \ that \nhave developed during this research is the ability to ingest data from\
    \ sensors using standard \ncommunication protocols (Ahmed et al., 2017; Antunes\
    \ et al., 2021). These technologies \nprovide the gateway to ingesting data from\
    \ a variety of sensors (Viriyasitavat et al., 2018). The \nresearcher was invited\
    \ to present a paper at ISM 2022, the International Conference on \nIndustry 4.0\
    \ and Smart Manufacturing, Upper Austria University of Applied Sciences, Linz,\
    \ \nAustria 4 November 2022. The paper, “Actionable insights for horticulture\
    \ supply chains \nthrough advanced IoT analytics”, presented in Appendix 4 was\
    \ subsequently published, \n(Keates, 2023) highlighting the ability to combine\
    \ process mining and geospatial tracking to \nensure food safety compliance. \
    \ \n \n \n \n \n140 \n \n8.2.7 Contributions and research within practice \nAs\
    \ a professional doctorate thesis this study has focused on a “research with practice”\
    \ \nparadigm of engaged scholarship (Rai, 2019) and has encompassed in-depth engagement\
    \ \nwith the agri-food industry, initially cattle farmers, of both large corporate\
    \ and medium, family \nowned businesses as well as the national peak body for\
    \ the industry, Meat and Livestock \nAustralia. The engagement then extended to\
    \ the horticulture sector engaging with banana, \nvegetable, avocado and citrus\
    \ farmers as well as their national peak bodies as well as broader \ninternational\
    \ agri-food stakeholders. There is an additional dimension to the “research with\
    \ \npractice” in that the researcher has conducted this research part time while\
    \ employed by a \nmultinational corporate, in a digital transformation and supply\
    \ chain role. The academic rigour \nthat professional doctorate research provides\
    \ and the continuous process of learning as the \nlatest research is studied has\
    \ significantly influenced the researcher’s professional practice as \nwell as\
    \ the outcomes of the projects that he has run during this study.  \n8.3 Research\
    \ Reflections and Limitations \n8.3.1 Reflecting on the use of Action Design Research\
    \ Methodology in this research. \nHunziker and Blankenagel (2021) in their guide\
    \ to Action Design Research, pages 126 to 129 \nprovide a list of pitfalls that\
    \ can occur when using this methodology. Table 17 below lists these, \ntogether\
    \ with a reflective comment on whether the pitfall was mitigated or could have\
    \ \ninfluenced the outcome of the research. \nPotential Pitfall (adapted from\
    \ Hunziker and \nBlankenagel (2021)) \nReflective Comment \nInitial problem definition\
    \ is wrong. \nThe research questions and problem statements \nwere adapted on\
    \ several occasions to ensure \nrelevance. \nElapsed time restriction \nTime restriction\
    \ was not a concern as the \nresearch was conducted over a six-year period, \n\
    with adequate time for each phase. \nContinued collaboration with stakeholders\
    \ may \nwane. \nThis was a risk as the research was conducted \nover an extended\
    \ period, this could have \ncaused a stakeholder participation issue; \nhowever,\
    \ the phasing of the research and use of \ndifferent case studies mitigated the\
    \ problem.  \nResearcher area of expertise. \nThe researcher has domain experience\
    \ which \nwas adequate for this research. \nPoor risk management as action design\
    \ \nresearch can be risky. \nContrary to the researcher regarding action \ndesign\
    \ research as risky, the methodology was \nregarded as ideal to allow for the\
    \ disruptions \nthat occurred during this research, for example \nCovid 19. providing\
    \ the flexibility to adjust \nresearch focus when required.  \nTrial and error\
    \ and case study/stakeholder \nsupremacy. \nIf the participant groups were restricted\
    \ to a \nsingle domain specialty e.g., only farmers or \nonly supply chain managers,\
    \ this pitfall could \nhave been relevant; however, the diverse \n \n \n \n \n\
    141 \n \nparticipant groups ensured balanced \nperspectives and reviews.  \nBenchmarking\
    \ shaping inputs. \nDuring the participant engagements the only \nreferences to\
    \ benchmarking was in the context \nof “best management practice”. The participants\
    \ \nwere not biased by external benchmarking. \nSlipping off into consulting.\
    \ \nThis pitfall was one that did occur, due to the \nresearcher being employed\
    \ as a consultant. The \nsupervisory team did intervene on several \noccasions\
    \ to ensure solutions were novel and \nacademic rigour was maintained. \nTable\
    \ 17: Reflections on the Potential Pitfalls of using Action Design Research (adapted\
    \ from Hunziker & \nBlankenagel, 2021) \n  \nThe reflection documented in Table\
    \ 17, highlighted that it was the ideal methodology for the \nscope and duration\
    \ of the study. The highest risk was the “slipping off into consulting” pitfall,\
    \ \nhowever a strong supervisory team was able to detect when this was occurring\
    \ and guide the \nresearcher accordingly. \n8.3.2 Limitations of the Research\
    \ \nOne of the limitations of this research is that the case studies are all in\
    \ Australia. This can \nprovide a bias to the evaluation of the outcomes; for\
    \ example other countries may not have \nthe same access or coverage of their\
    \ 4G/5G or LTE networks, meaning that installation of \nsupply chain tracking\
    \ devices for risk mitigation or continuous environmental monitors can be \ncostly\
    \ and, in some cases, ineffective. Australian farmers are also fortunate to receive\
    \ both \nGovernment and Peak Body technical and financial support when they wish\
    \ to invest in the \ntechnologies explored in this research, in some other countries\
    \ farmers are not so fortunate \nand often have to weigh up these technologies\
    \ against other critical investments on the farm. \nA further consideration is\
    \ that Australian farmers are subject to strict environmental \nregulations; for\
    \ example the banana farm that participated in this study is in the Great Barrier\
    \ \nReef catchment area and has additional environmental conditions placed on\
    \ their farming \noperations.  Farmers in other regions or countries who do not\
    \ have such regulations could \nevaluate the potential benefits of some of the\
    \ outcomes evaluated in this research differently. \nA final limitation is that\
    \ the research was conducted in two sectors: cattle farming and supply \nchains\
    \ and banana farming and supply chains; other sectors such as broad acre cropping,\
    \ or \naquaculture may have risk and sustainability challenges that have not been\
    \ considered by the \ncase study participants and broader agri-food specialists\
    \ that participated in this research. \n8.4 Future Work \nAgri-food production\
    \ is a very broad field with each product family and supply chain location \n\
    having unique challenges, from the endogenous risks associated with internal farm\
    \ operations \n \n \n \n \n142 \n \nand logistics to exogeneous threats from extreme\
    \ weather events, government regulations, \npests, and diseases. Sustainability\
    \ factors impact sectors differently as well, depending on the \nlocation of the\
    \ farms, relative to sensitive environments as well as government regulation and\
    \ \nsocieties’ attitudes to sustainability issues. Future work opportunities exist\
    \ in extending this \nresearch into specific agri-food sectors for example: \n\
    • \nMeat and livestock \n• \nHorticulture \n• \nBroad acre cropping \n• \nAquaculture\
    \ \nAs research becomes more sector specific the opportunity exists for best farming\
    \ and \nmanagement practices to be captured and codified and the process compliance\
    \ checking \ntechniques developed in this research further expanded. The risk\
    \ mitigation research can also \nbe expanded for regional areas with exogenous\
    \ threat data being collected, analysed, and \nreported to farmers in a timeous\
    \ manner so that risk mitigation protocols can be initiated.  \nThe sustainability\
    \ phase of this research offers the most scope for extension; the potential \n\
    capability of a process aware digital twin for sustainable agri-food has been\
    \ demonstrated for \na cattle farm. The potential to achieve significant decarbonization\
    \ with such technology exists \nin each sector with the overarching Process Aware\
    \ Digital Twin framework providing the \nstarting point. Furthermore the reflection\
    \ presented in Section 8.2.5 that the three research \nphase outcomes could be\
    \ integrated into a unified “Agri-Food Supply Chain Control Tower” \ncould well\
    \ be an area of further research and validation.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n143 \n \n\
    8.5 Conclusion \nThis professional doctorate research set out to solve practice\
    \ orientated, real world problems \nin the agri-food supply chain sector, through\
    \ a “research within practice” paradigm of engaged \nscholarship, while also producing\
    \ research contributions in the fields of supply chain \nmanagement and business\
    \ process management. The research has focused on how \nemerging process centric\
    \ technologies can assist in solving complex agri-food supply chain \nchallenges,\
    \ leveraging the adoption of Industry 4.0 in the sector with the novel use of\
    \ business \nprocess management systems and process mining solutions. Facilitated\
    \ by action design \nresearch methodology, which provided the flexibility for\
    \ the research to be driven by the real-\nworld problems faced by the agri-food\
    \ sector, and the deep engagement with farmers and \nsubject matter experts in\
    \ this domain, the researcher was able to get insights and research \ndata which\
    \ shaped the research focus. The research phases were adapted over the course\
    \ of \nsix years to address key practice challenges. Commencing with the integration\
    \ and connection \nof several process centric technologies to provide data driven\
    \ insights for improving agri-food \nsupply chain performance, the phase 1 research\
    \ also highlighted the importance of supply \nchain risk mitigation to the agri-food\
    \ sector.    \nDuring the phase 2 research, in which a conceptual framework for\
    \ monitoring and managing \nrisk in agri-food supply chains was developed, the\
    \ vulnerability of the cattle and banana \nfarming sectors to extreme weather\
    \ events was dramatically demonstrated, when the cattle \nsector, already struggling\
    \ with severe drought conditions, suddenly had an extreme rainfall \nevent, extensive\
    \ flooding, affecting the case study participant in research phase1 and many \n\
    other cattle businesses as well, with significant animal losses,  The banana farm,\
    \ participating \nin research phase 2, also suffered severe losses,  due to a\
    \ cyclone (see Appendix 5). These \nevents reinforced the practice needs for agri-food\
    \ supply chain frameworks to provide risk \nmitigation decision support to farmers,\
    \ with extensive literature reviews confirming research \ngaps in this field.\
    \ While these exogenous events had a large impact on these agri-food supply \n\
    chains, their impact was localized and later overshadowed by the unprecedented\
    \ global \nimpact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Shortages of agri-food products were\
    \ seen around the \nglobe, with meat and horticulture products particularly scarce.\
    \ The three case studies were \nsignificantly impacted by Covid-19, the most vulnerable\
    \ being the cattle sector and its meat \nprocessing facilities, with hundreds\
    \ of meat workers in close proximity to each other The \nbanana farm and supply\
    \ chain also struggled with labour restrictions caused by Covid \nlockdowns and\
    \ restricted travel.  \nThe digitally enabled supply chain risk management framework\
    \ and its IT Artifact were \ndeveloped during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic\
    \ and while supply chain disruptions \ncaused by Covid-19 for example logistics\
    \ were a focus, a thorough study was undertaken of \n \n \n \n \n144 \n \nall\
    \ relevant exogenous and endogenous risks threats to the agri-food sector to ensure\
    \ the \nmethodology was robust. \nThe risk research also highlighted a new risk\
    \ to this industry. Events such as increased \ngovernment and consumer demand\
    \ for sustainable supply chains, ethical sourcing, and \ncomplete transparency\
    \ of the farm-to-plate journey of products will be the new normal. Three \nyears\
    \ on from the first outbreaks of the pandemic, agri-food supply chains are still\
    \ being \ndisrupted by new outbreaks impacting farm labour and supply chains.\
    \ Extreme weather events \nare impacting agri-food production globally and regional\
    \ wars are impacting food security. The \n“new normal” is one in which agri-food\
    \ business owners need to manage risk as proactively \nas possible and a contribution\
    \ such as the digitally enabled supply chain risk management \nframework has been\
    \ evaluated as capable of delivering such decision support.  \nOne of the unexpected\
    \ outcomes over the past three years has been the acceleration of digital \ntransformation\
    \ and automation across industry and this paradigm shift has also impacted the\
    \ \nagri-food supply chain. There has been increased adoption of Industry 4.0\
    \ technologies and \nautomation. In the agri-food sector the paradigm shift has\
    \ been driven by the impact of labour \nshortages and the increasing cost of labour.\
    \ This reality has meant that farmers are more \nwilling to invest in technology\
    \ and are seeking more autonomy in the systems that they \nprocure. Methodologies\
    \ and technologies such as the digitally enabled supply chain risk \nmanagement\
    \ system will in the future not only be expected to provide decision support,\
    \ but \nthey will also be expected to autonomously prescribe actions, for example\
    \ issue instructions \nfor alternative routing of a horticulture shipment, or\
    \ issue instructions for autonomous \nharvesting or control irrigation and fertilization\
    \ systems. \nWhile part of the “new normal” has been an increased perception of\
    \ food security and food \nsafety for consumers as well as wholesalers and retailers\
    \ (Liu et al., 2021) (Frankish et al., \n2021), consumers are becoming increasingly\
    \ more concerned about agri-food environmental \nand sustainability issues (P.\
    \ Kumar et al., 2021). Led by Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA, \n2022a), the\
    \ cattle industry in Australia has a goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2030 and\
    \ the \nhorticulture industry is aligning closely with the United Nations Sustainability\
    \ Development \nGoals (UN, 2022) in the Australian – Grown Horticulture Sustainability\
    \ Framework (HIA, 2022). \nThe Australian agri-food sustainability focus is also\
    \ part of a global trend. The research \ncontribution of a Process Aware Digital\
    \ Twin for Sustainable Agri-Food (PADT-SA) has been \nevaluated internationally\
    \ to be capable of delivering appropriate sustainability decision support \nto\
    \ multinational agri-food businesses. \nThe Phase 3 research which led to the\
    \ development of a conceptual framework for monitoring, \nsimulating, and managing\
    \ sustainability outcomes has shown that these goals are possible. \n \n \n \n\
    \ \n145 \n \nFor the cattle supply chain, the carbon neutral goal by 2030 may\
    \ seem ambitious, with \nlivestock contributing almost 15% of annual anthropogenic\
    \ methane emissions (Gerber et al., \n2013), however the PADT-SA model demonstrates\
    \ that with a holistic sustainability approach \nincluding use of supplementary\
    \ additives such as red seaweed, asparagopsis taxiformis, \nplanned carbon dioxide\
    \ sequestration through the stabilization and protection of soil organic \ncarbon\
    \ through planting of leucaena (Conrad et al., 2018), and conservation of woody\
    \ plants \nand forest on farms, the goal is achievable.  \nWhile the research\
    \ evolved and adapted to the challenges faced by the agri-food supply chain \n\
    sector, so too was the IT Artifact that supported the frameworks, adapting to\
    \ become a process \ncentric, model driven solution. Initially the framework and\
    \ IT Artifact were considered separate \nentities; however, with a design principle\
    \ that BPMS can drive the application layer (Graja et \nal., 2016; Kozma et al.,\
    \ 2019) including configuration of process digital twins, the two have \neffectively\
    \ been integrated. Pylianidis et al. (2021) state that given the potential for\
    \ adoption \nand the benefits for applying digital twins in the agri-food sector,\
    \ they have the prospect of \nbringing a technological breakthrough in the near\
    \ future. The researcher agrees with this \nstatement including that digital twins\
    \ “democratize technology”, making it more accessible to \nthe sector. This design\
    \ approach has enabled a “low code” configuration for the applications \nwhich\
    \ will facilitate broader adoption of these new methodologies in the agri-food\
    \ supply chain \nsector where cost of technology has been a previous challenge.\
    \ Realizing the significance of \nthe model driven – framework – data platform\
    \ integration the additional research phase (4) \nwas conducted to analyse the\
    \ broader requirements for an Industry 4.0 enabled platform. The \ncontributions\
    \ have been presented as research contributions which practitioners and \nresearchers\
    \ can consider when configuring an agri-food supply chain platform. \nThe researcher\
    \ embarked on this professional doctorate with the objective of being able to\
    \ \n“make a difference” in the critical practice of agri-food supply chain operations.\
    \ Agri-Food \nproduction impacts 6 of the United Nation’s 17 Sustainable Development\
    \ Goals, the most \nsignificant of all being #2: “End hunger, achieve food security\
    \ and improved nutrition and \npromote sustainable agriculture” by 2030, and with\
    \ 11.7% of the global population facing food \ninsecurity at severe levels, it\
    \ is a goal that must be achieved.  Deep engagement with the agri-\nfood sector\
    \ as well significant engagement and support from the case study farmers and \n\
    supply chain stakeholders have allowed this research to produce outcomes that\
    \ have a direct \npositive impact on practice. Real outcomes for real world problems\
    \ have been produced. The \nresearch has also produced theoretical contributions\
    \ to the business process management \nand supply chain domains and has allowed\
    \ the researcher to achieve a further personal goal: \nleveraging BPMS to deliver\
    \ rapidly configurable, low code, cost effective applications \n \n \n \n \n146\
    \ \n \nproviding process and subject matter experts the ability to produce applications\
    \ without relying \non teams of information technology specialists.  \nThis research\
    \ has been life changing for the researcher, spending time with the hard-working\
    \ \nfarmers who produce the food we eat, understanding the daily supply chain\
    \ risks and \nincreasing demands for sustainability and transparency across the\
    \ end-to-end agri-food \nsupply chain that they face instills a completely new\
    \ perspective on the question “where does \nour food come from?” Driving along\
    \ remote country roads to visit farmers, the researcher \nwould often see farm\
    \ trucks with the bumper sticker “No Farms, No Food”. These four words \nmean\
    \ so much Society needs to respect and support farmers. When natural disasters\
    \ strike \nand farmers are on the brink of losing their farms, governments need\
    \ to step in and provide \nfinancial support, consumers need to become more aware\
    \ where their food is sourced from \nand support their local farmers as much as\
    \ possible, schools should include in their \ncurriculums visits to farms so that\
    \ children can understand that food may be purchased at the \nlocal convenience\
    \ store, but its journey started at a farm. Food waste must be significantly \n\
    reduced, and we must all never forget the 11.7% of global population facing food\
    \ insecurity at \nsevere levels (FAO, 2022). It is hoped that this research will\
    \ contribute to improving agri–food \nsupply chains beyond the participants in\
    \ this study, that farmers will be supported in achieving \nsustainability goals,\
    \ and we will all never forget that without sustainable farming there will be\

    \ for monitoring the cattle holding area and alerting the driver should temperatures\
    \ \nexceed thresholds were discussed. The key requirement from the cattle farm\
    \ owner was for \n \n \n \n \n150 \n \nthe tracking to be autonomous with alerting\
    \ to a mobile phone when the truck did not reach \ncertain weigh points in time\
    \ or temperature thresholds were exceeded, the farm owner \nstressed that medium\
    \ sized farms are run with small teams, with  “all hands on deck” required \n\
    for many activities such as mustering, there are simply no resources available\
    \ to monitor the \nsupply chain and as a result the farm team responds reactively\
    \ instead of proactively.  This \nrequirement was reinforced when the owner received\
    \ a call that a cattle truck had broken \ndown during the evening. This farm owned\
    \ their cattle truck and this incident immediately \nrequired significant intervention\
    \ from the farm owner, to mitigate the supply chain disruption \ncaused.  \nCycle\
    \ 4: A day visit to the cattle farm, conducted structured IT artifact evaluation\
    \ with the farm \nowner, discussed ongoing work with sensor provider to improve\
    \ sensor with store and forward \ncapability. Farm owner was very satisfied with\
    \ the outputs of the IT Artifact. Acknowledging \nthat the current systems provided\
    \ alerts via sms/text, the farm owner recommended that a \nsmart phone friendly\
    \ version of the IT Artifact be considered as that was the most suitable \naccess\
    \ for a medium cattle farm owner and team members. Discussed broader risk categories\
    \ \nsuch as extreme weather (drought being the high-risk factor), impact on available\
    \ pasture for \ngrazing and sustainability for future research.  \nCycle 5: Farm\
    \ visits were conducted on an avocado farm, chilli farm and macadamia farm \n\
    and the case study banana farm. The owners of these farms subsequently participated\
    \ in the \nonline questionnaire. Key outputs from these visits were confirmation\
    \ of the risk categories \nthat had been classified in Table 1 and their potential\
    \ disruptive impacts. While the horticulture \ncase study was to proceed with\
    \ the banana farm, the generalizability was discussed with the \nother sectors.\
    \ All sectors were impacted by extreme weather events, however due to the \nlocations\
    \ of the farms there were different types of extreme weather, the banana farm\
    \ had the \nrisk of cyclones whose strong winds could knock down the plants (such\
    \ an event occurred \nduring the research). The other farms were experiencing\
    \ drought and irrigation restrictions \nduring the visits, later they experienced\
    \ an extreme rainfall event that severely disrupted farm \noperations and all\
    \ logistics.  \nCycles 7 & 8: These visits to the banana farm supported the evaluation\
    \ of the IT Artifact ex \nante, artificial in Cycle 7 and ex post, naturalistic\
    \ in Cycle 8. The banana farmer was very \nsatisfied with the IT Artifact. Key\
    \ recommendations were development of a cost effective BLE \n(blue tooth enabled\
    \ tracker) for application at pallet level as a container of palletised bananas\
    \ \ndoes get split and sent to different supermarkets.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n151\

    Introduction \nHorticulture supply chains are experiencing significant disruption,\
    \ from exogenous factors such as wars and \ntrade sanctions to the continued impact\
    \ of Covid 19 on logistics and farm workers. Fertilizer supply, a key \ncomponent\
    \ in assuring yield and quality of horticulture products has been globally constrained,\
    \ driving up the \nprices of horticulture products and leading to shifts in demand\
    \ patterns as consumers adjust their buying to \naccommodate these significant\
    \ changes. At regional levels additional disruption has been experienced through\
    \ \nextreme weather events such as high rainfall in Australia, drought, and heat\
    \ events in the United States, and \nelevated temperatures in Europe. With most\
    \ horticulture businesses being small and medium sized, farmers and \nbusiness\
    \ owners are significantly challenged by these exogenous factors, as well as the\
    \ endogenous threats on \ntheir farms, ensuring quality, food safety and sustainability\
    \ standards are maintained, especially when their \nstandard operating practices\
    \ are disrupted. Existing farm management systems focus on accounting of farm\
    \ inputs \nand outputs, some provide fertilizer planning while a few provide planning,\
    \ tasking farm workers for specific \nactivity, none provide an integrated plant\
    \ to customer solution with autonomous monitoring. An industry and \nresearch\
    \ gap for this sector are actionable insights to facilitate the management of\
    \ horticulture supply chains both \npre-harvest and post-harvest activities. This\
    \ paper researches the gap using action design research methodology, \nidentifies\
    \ the key requirement for autonomous supply chain monitoring, develops a framework\
    \ (Horticulture \nSupply Chain Analytics), an IT artifact for delivering such\
    \ insights, and presents a case study demonstrating the \noutcomes and novel research\
    \ contributions. \nThe adoption of Industry 4.0 principles and methodologies in\
    \ the horticulture sector has been slow (Nakandala \net al., 2017), however significant\
    \ opportunities have been recognized (Zhao et al., 2020). The sector faced \n\
    significant challenges during the Covid-19 pandemic with labor shortages impacting\
    \ the ability to harvest produce, \nsupply chain disruptions in distribution,\
    \ and changes to consumer buying patterns as lockdowns and restrictions \nresulted\
    \ in more regular home cooking (Sheffi, 2020), (Hamid & Mir, 2021). While Covid-19\
    \ may be shifting \nfrom a pandemic to endemic phase, the impacts of the earlier\
    \ supply chain disruptions and labor shortages are still \nbeen experienced, several\
    \ horticulture supply chains remain vulnerable and exogenous events such as heavy\
    \ \nrainfall are rapidly leading to shortages on supermarket shelves. As farmers\
    \ seek to mitigate labor shortages by \nexamining opportunities for automation,\
    \ the transition requires significant investment and, in some sectors, \nautomation\
    \ is still in preliminary stages of development and commercialization. In the\
    \ short to medium term these \nfarmers need to mitigate their risks through becoming\
    \ data driven and obtaining the best possible insights to inform \ntheir supply\
    \ chain decisions.  \n While the horticulture sector is broad including dairy,\
    \ meat, fish, fruit, vegetables, and grains, our research is \nfocused on the\
    \ horticulture sector i.e., fruit and vegetables with a case study in banana farming\
    \ and distribution. \nIn Australia horticulture is the fastest growing agricultural\
    \ sector with production value increasing 27 percent over \nfive years to 2020\
    \ (HIA, 2021). Horticulture also represents 20% of the total agriculture production\
    \ value in \nAustralia, making it the third largest agriculture sector (HIA, 2021).\
    \  Bananas are purchased by 96% of Australian \nhouseholds with a per capita consumption\
    \ of 16kg (ABGC, 2022), however in the past year costs of inputs have \nincreased\
    \ significantly with chemicals and fertilizers increasing 180% and 120% respectively,\
    \ and freight costs \nfrom the major growing region increasing 27% (Pekin, 2022).\
    \ Globally bananas are traded in high volumes, and \nwhile quality losses are\
    \ low they still represent significant economic opportunity for further reduction\
    \ (Jedermann \net al., 2014).  Focusing on a sole case study within the sector,\
    \ bananas, enabled the researchers to deploy the \nrequired IoT sensors on a specific\
    \ farm with its distribution supply chain, identified by the banana peak industry\
    \ \nbody as a representative medium sized business, and thoroughly develop the\
    \ framework and supporting IT \nArtifact, while being cognizant of the broader\
    \ horticulture requirements. In the results section learnings are \npresented\
    \ for application of the framework to the broader horticulture sector.  \nRelated\
    \ Work \nThe significant expansion and development of cellular connectivity and\
    \ internet speeds and capacity has driven \nthe adoption of IoT and Industry 4.0\
    \ in agriculture (Araujo et al., 2021). Across manufacturing, supply chains, \n\
    health systems, transportation and communication systems billions of devices are\
    \ being connected via the internet \nto provide data and insights. Erboz et al.,\
    \ examined how Industry 4.0 affects supply chain integration and supply \nchain\
    \ performance, establishing a direct impact (Erboz et al., 2022).  Dhamija et\
    \ al., conducted an extensive \nliterature review examining Industry 4.0 and supply\
    \ chain management, establishing positive relationships \nbetween internet of\
    \ things, digitization, cyber physical systems and big data analytics with supply\
    \ chain \nmanagement, also indicating that organizations are adopting these processes\
    \ in practical implementations \n(Dhamija et al., 2020). The integration of company\
    \ and supply chain flows as well as the significant impacts of \nIndustry 4.0\
    \ on logistics is well documented in systematic reviews (Núñez-Merino et al.,\
    \ 2022), while Bag et al., \n \n \n \n \n158 \n \ndetermine that including a focus\
    \ on human capital development and change management supports improved \noutcomes\
    \ (Bag et al., 2021). In more mature systems closed loop control has been enabled,\
    \ for example the \nautomation of irrigation and fertigation systems. The agriculture\
    \ and horticulture sectors, while identified as areas \nof significant potential\
    \ for digitization and deployment of Industry 4.0 technologies have been described\
    \ as a \nlagging adopter of the technology. Contributing factors include connectivity\
    \ and cost of sensors as well as \ntechnology support as the sector consists of\
    \ largely of small and medium-sized businesses (Liu et al., 2021).  \nFood security\
    \ and food safety are increasingly becoming matters of concern for both consumers\
    \ as well as \nwholesalers and retailers (Liu et al., 2021). Consumers want to\
    \ know where the produce they are purchasing was \ngrown and be assured that food\
    \ safety standards have been adhered to. They also want assurances that the product\
    \ \nthat they are purchasing is the genuine product as stated on the label and\
    \ not a counterfeit or substituted product \n(Frankish et al., 2021). Driven by\
    \ consumer demand, wholesalers and retailers are increasingly placing the \nresponsibility\
    \ on the suppliers of produce to prove their compliance, which is adding extra\
    \ cost on the sector \nalready facing increasing input costs such as labor, fertilizer,\
    \ and logistics.  \nWhile certain sectors in agriculture have made considerable\
    \ progress in the adoption of Industry 4.0, for \nexample broad acre cropping,\
    \ which has become highly digitized, with spraying and fertilizer equipment as\
    \ well \nas harvesters precision guided by GPS with onboard sensors providing\
    \ real-time feedback and controlling variable \ndosing of chemicals according\
    \ to conditions (Araujo et al., 2021), the horticulture sector has lagged due\
    \ to the \nnature of the crops from vegetables grown in rows to fruit picked from\
    \ trees. Determining the optimum number \nof sensors for automation of irrigation\
    \ in an orchard of citrus trees or a plantation of bananas is complex \n(Monteleone\
    \ et al., 2020). Factors such as soil type, drainage profiles and irrigation system\
    \ configuration need to \nbe considered and the cost of installation and maintenance\
    \ of these systems can be high (Araujo et al., 2021), \n(Trivelli et al., 2019).\
    \ To overcome this challenge there has been increasing adoption of satellite technology\
    \ in \nthe sector (Trivelli et al., 2019). Using satellite multi spectral imagery\
    \ for example, water stress in certain crops \ncan be detected (Monteleone et\
    \ al., 2020). The satellite imagery can be calibrated using sensor data and where\
    \ \nappropriate mobile sensor data to provide more extensive information and reduce\
    \ the cost of sensor installations, \nespecially on the larger farms. Similar\
    \ multi-spectral imaging can also be conducted by unmanned aircraft (UAV) \nor\
    \ drones and there is increasing deployment of these “sensors” on a periodic basis\
    \ for crop health assessments as \nwell as additional image analysis such as yield\
    \ prediction (do Amaral et al., 2020). As UAV technology improves \nand aviation\
    \ regulations are amended to allow for autonomous flight, adoption of the technology\
    \ will increase. \nThe outputs of the above data are presented in geospatial formats\
    \ for farmers with the concept of geospatial \noverlays of data becoming the accepted\
    \ user interface for farmers. \nThe development of business process management\
    \ systems (BPMS) has facilitated the integration of business \nsystems including\
    \ supply chains (Bae & Seo, 2007). These systems can be established using business\
    \ process \nmodelling protocols such as BPMN 2.0 in a visual manner which is understandable\
    \ to stakeholders who are not \nIT skilled and then further configured to execute\
    \ instructions such as calling data from other systems via their \napplication\
    \ programming interfaces (APIs), coordinating the storage and retrieval of data\
    \ from databases and \ndirecting the input and output of data from algorithms\
    \ and decision models (Schönig et al., 2020). BPMS enable \nthe rapid development\
    \ of IT systems especially in a research environment where cycles of feedback\
    \ lead to \nongoing change and improvement to the design.  \nProcess mining is\
    \ the ability to automatically discover processes from the event logs (Dumas et\
    \ al., 2018). \nOnce discovered, the visually presented variations between cases\
    \ may be visualized and quantified. Event logs \nmay also be compared to a process\
    \ standard in a method called compliance checking (Leemans et al., 2018). \nWhile\
    \ significant research using process mining and compliance checking approaches\
    \ has been conducted in the \nhealth domain as well as process intensive businesses\
    \ such as insurance and banking, there is no evidence of \nresearch using these\
    \ methods in the agriculture sector. In our previous research (Keates et al.,\
    \ 2020), we applied \nprocess mining to cattle movements from a supply chain perspective\
    \ to discover their supply chain history through \nseveral farms.  \nTracking\
    \ of packages as well as time and temperature sensitive products through a supply\
    \ chain using sensors \nis a well-established practice (Koot et al., 2021). For\
    \ time and temperature sensitive products, such as produce \nsupply to large supermarket\
    \ chains, the use of blue tooth enabled (BLE) or radio frequency identification\
    \ (RFID) \nenabled sensors which can be automatically read by a gateway at the\
    \ receiving warehouse is technology that is \nincreasingly being deployed as the\
    \ cost of these sensors decreases (Li et al., 2017). These technologies provide\
    \ a \nhistory of the product as it has travelled through the supply chain, recording\
    \ time and location, temperature and \nin some cases additional data such as humidity,\
    \ light as well as orientation. The event data are recorded on the \nsensor using\
    \ store and forward technology and transmitted when the sensor passes within the\
    \ proximity of the \nfixed gateways (Chamekh et al.). The use of near real time\
    \ tracking of products using GPS sensors capable of \ncapturing the additional\
    \ data mentioned above with transmission of the data via cellular or satellite\
    \ systems is \noccurring on high value and critical products and components and\
    \ to date has only been deployed in limited \n \n \n \n \n159 \n \nhorticulture\
    \ supply chain applications (Srinivasan et al., 2017). The cost of such trackers\
    \ has been a limiting factor, \nwith reuse of the trackers required as well as\
    \ the processing of the significant amount of data generated by these \ntracking\
    \ systems. This research has aimed to address this technological challenge by\
    \ adapting process mining and \nprocess compliance checking systems to autonomously\
    \ monitor the horticulture supply chain both on and off \nfarm. This has been\
    \ made possible through the novel enhancement of supply chain event logs using\
    \ geospatial \ndata to provide alerting when nonconformance is detected and in\
    \ the future providing insights to mitigate supply \nchain disruption. \n1. Methodology\
    \ \nAction design research methodology (Sein et al., 2011) was used to develop\
    \ the framework with horticulture \nindustry and subject matter experts as well\
    \ as the banana farmer, owner of the farm used in the case study. The \nmethodology,\
    \ project phases and iteration cycles are illustrated in Figure 1a. Phase 1 consisted\
    \ of “problem \nformulation” generating the banana supply chain diagram and “decision\
    \ points” presented in Figure 1b. Phase 2 \nis the “iterative build and evaluate”\
    \ following the Framework for Evaluation in Design Science guidelines, \ndeveloped\
    \ by Venable et al., (Venable et al., 2016), with Phase 3 covering “reflections\
    \ and formalized learnings”, \nincluding the presentation of general learnings\
    \ for broader horticulture sector application.  \n \n  \nThe subject matter experts\
    \ who provided feedback in the development of the HSCA framework were i) four\
    \ \nowners of horticulture businesses, ii) a national peak body representative\
    \ of the horticulture industry iii) two \nhorticulture supply chain specialists\
    \ and iv) three horticulture agronomists.   The subject matter experts rated the\
    \ \nimportance of decisions made at the supply chain nodes illustrated in Figure\
    \ 1b, in terms of the overall business \nimpact (high, medium, and low). The pre-harvest\
    \ factors (1 to 6) were all rated high, with variations identified in \nhorticulture\
    \ type, noting that some crops are more sensitive to irrigation (or lack thereof)\
    \ than others for example. \nThe post-harvest factors (7 to 14) were also all\
    \ rated as high with subject matter experts noting that some produce \nis more\
    \ sensitive to temperature or damage when handled than others. Consumer feedback\
    \ (15) may have a slightly \ndelayed but significant revenue impact if real, false,\
    \ or suspected information is spread for example regarding \nquality or worse,\
    \ contamination, of produce. All stated that decisions along the end-to-end supply\
    \ chain had an \nimpact on final product yield and quality, for example a wrong\
    \ decision regarding irrigation, fertilizer or pesticides \nmay lead to a yield\
    \ or quality problem which will lead to a revenue problem. Compounding the challenges\
    \ that \nhorticulture farmers face are the disruptive risks both exogeneous and\
    \ endogenous that exist for each of the 15 \nnodes across the supply chain. The\
    \ feedback from the subject matter experts was consistent with related work \n\
    studies presented in Section 2. The above was synthesized into a research question:\
    \ “Can a process intelligence \nenabled geospatial tracking system provide actionable\
    \ insights to horticulture farmers to mitigate supply chain \ndisruption?”  \n\
    4. Horticulture Supply Chain Analytics Framework and Supporting IT Artifact  \n\
    A key requirement from the problem formulation phase was tracking produce from\
    \ the farm field and where \nappropriate, row or plant, to the consumer, or at\
    \ least the supermarket or grocer. From the farmer's perspective \nthis information\
    \ provides valuable feedback on the quality and price received for the produce\
    \ and the ability to \nrapidly troubleshoot any issues including in transit, handling,\
    \ or packaging issues as well as supply chain \nsecurity/integrity. For the customers\
    \ such as supermarkets and grocers, such monitoring and tracking provides \nmore\
    \ rapid resolution of quality or delivery issues providing more stable supply.\
    \ It also provides a layer of security \nagainst accidental misplacement of consignments\
    \ as well as deliberate substitution and counterfeit produce. There \nFigure (1a)\
    \ ADR Methodology (1b) Key Decision Points \n \n \n \n \n160 \n \nis a growing\
    \ consumer demand for visibility as to where their produce came from and the practices\
    \ used on the \nfarms, this level of transparency connects the consumer to the\
    \ farmer while allowing farmers to promote their best \npractices, for example\
    \ sustainability and environmental stewardship, which can also lead to improved\
    \ brand \npositioning. \nThe first cycles of the action design research process\
    \ reinforced the key dependencies of on-farm and off farm \nsupply chain as well\
    \ as the dependencies of pre-harvest and post-harvest activities. The HSCA framework\
    \ was \nconstructed to illustrate the dependencies. A further key requirement\
    \ from the stakeholder group was to explore \nremote sensing, for example satellite\
    \ imaging and tracking as much as possible. While our previous research \n(Keates,\
    \ 2019) highlighted the benefits of deploying sensors on farms to capture supply\
    \ chain insights, the cost \nand maintenance of these sensors and their connectivity\
    \ systems is a challenge especially on the larger, more \nremote farms. The repeated\
    \ feedback cycles in Phase 1 assisted in further problematizing the gaps, which\
    \ together \nwith the literature research into process mining and compliance checking\
    \ led to the novel HSCA framework design \nincorporating GPS trackers, enhancement\
    \ of event logs with additional geospatial data and process intelligence to \n\
    derive autonomous insights across the end-to-end supply chain, see Fig 2 below.\
    \  \n \n4.1  \nHorticulture Supply Chain Analytics (HSCA) framework \n      \n\
    \   The construct of the HSCA framework evolved through several iterations with\
    \ the stakeholders responding \npositively to the iconography used to support\
    \ the explanation of each step. The central gear icons are key as they \nrepresent\
    \ the process orchestration of the steps, while the semi-autonomous steps 5, 6,\
    \ 11 and 12 are emphasized \nin the center. The stakeholders also recommended\
    \ a separation of the on farm and off farm supply chains as in \npractice several\
    \ cycles of the on-farm processes could occur before harvesting and several cycles\
    \ of distribution \ncould occur before the next harvesting occurs.  \n \n4.1.1\
    \  \nStep 1 & 2:  \n  \n    The farm and its fields are selected, mapped, and\
    \ labelled using GPS coordinates overlaid on satellite images. \nWhile the HSCA\
    \ framework processes event data it provides visualization of each step as this\
    \ is a key step in \ngetting farmers to trust the data and the insights provided.\
    \ Geofences are overlayed onto each field and key \noperational area on the farm.\
    \ The mapping solution used in the research was limited to placing the geofences\
    \ as \ncircles of different radii. In future research the ability to construct\
    \ the geofences in any shape will be developed. \nIn the operationalization of\
    \ the framework through the IT artifact the circular geofences created a level\
    \ of \ncomplexity and a small level of inaccuracy, however, was still able to\
    \ demonstrate the semi-autonomous operation \nof the supply chain monitoring functionality,\
    \ see Figure 3b. In addition, geofences are placed around the \nstorage/parking\
    \ areas of the farm equipment. When these assets depart from a storage/parking\
    \ zone the activity \ntriggers the HSCA process for monitoring and compliance\
    \ checking to occur. When returning to the zone, \nmonitoring will stop, and the\
    \ trackers are automatically set to a sleep mode to conserve battery power.  \n\
    \ \n4.1.3  \nStep 3:  \n \nFigure 2: Horticulture Supply Chain Analytics Framework\
    \ \n \n \n \n \n161 \n \n   GPS trackers are attached to key farm equipment, for\
    \ example the fertilizer tractor and the harvester vehicle, \nsee Figure 3a. In\
    \ addition, RFID tags are carried by the farm workers who read a tag with a glove\
    \ RFID reader to \nrecord the specific farm activity been undertaken at a specific\
    \ geo tagged location on the farm. At five-minute \nintervals data is uploaded\
    \ from the GPS trackers and RFID readers to the HSCA platform where the data is\
    \ stored \non database. Connectivity for the research was provided via cellular\
    \ communication with the trackers and readers \nhaving store and forward capability\
    \ to allow for any connectivity blackspots.  \n \n4.1.4  \nStep 4:  \n     \n\
    \   A RFID sensor is attached to the produce harvesting container which is also\
    \ geotagged via the GPS tracker on \nthe harvesting vehicle, so produce can be\
    \ traced from the harvesting area, for example, a section or a row of \nproduce,\
    \ in some cases a specific tree or in the case of bananas, a bunch of bananas\
    \ on a banana plant. The RFID \nbecomes the unique identifier which will be traceable\
    \ through to the customer. During harvesting, the produce \nlocation data is also\
    \ uploaded every five minutes to the HSCA platform. The framework was designed\
    \ to include \nyield calculated from a weight basis, for example the weight of\
    \ each harvesting container from a specific farm \nlocation would be weighed via\
    \ a load cell with the weight associated with RFID tag. While the stakeholders\
    \ noted \nthis functionality was highly desirable, provision of the required weighing\
    \ equipment was beyond the scope of \nthis research. \n \n4.1.5  \nStep 5:  \n\
    \    \n    The event data captured in the above steps is transformed into XES\
    \ (extensible event stream) format and then \nprocess mined using the inductive\
    \ visual miner algorithm (Leemans et al., 2018), see Figures 4a and 4b.  With\
    \ the \nnovel enhancement of the on-farm event logs, through the geofencing of\
    \ the entire farm, the inductive visual miner \nalgorithm can autonomously compliance\
    \ check that pre-harvest and harvesting activities are being conducted \naccording\
    \ to the farm and industry best management practice, which can be extended to\
    \ include regulatory \ncompliance, for example, the dosage rates of fertilizer\
    \ and pesticides and the withholding periods associated with \nsuch chemicals\
    \ before produce can be harvested. The HSCA platform provides the ability to develop\
    \ the best \npractice reference model from the process discovered through the\
    \ farm event logs and continually update the \nreference model based on farm,\
    \ supply chain and customer data. During pre-harvest and harvesting operations,\
    \ \nthe compliance checking process runs near real time (every five-minutes when\
    \ in cellular range) and provides \nalerts in the event of any deviation from\
    \ best management practice. Such rapid alerting allows farm management \nto rapidly\
    \ respond and address or mitigate non conformances.  \n \n4.1.6  \nStep 6: \n\
    \ \n   The pre-harvest and harvest data which includes all farm activities as\
    \ well as chemical treatments traced to a \nspecific sub section of the farm is\
    \ stored in the HSCA database. When the produce commences its post-harvest \n\
    processes the additional event data is added via the unique RFID identifier. This\
    \ data, together with any customer \nquality data is further compliance checked\
    \ and analyzed as described in the subsequent steps. The unique \nconnection of\
    \ pre-harvest to post harvest event data allows for quality or yield non conformances\
    \ arising from on \nfarm activities to be identified and resolved as well as positive\
    \ quality or yield improvements to be reinforced and \ncaptured as best practices.\
    \  \n \n4.1.7  \nStep 7&8: \n \n    For the post-harvest supply chain, the supply\
    \ chain is mapped on a GPS referenceable map from the farm to \ncustomer. In cases\
    \ where the supply chain route is not known by the farmer HSCA’s process mining\
    \ algorithm is \nused to discover the supply chain. Using the process described\
    \ in Step 9 the path the produce takes to the customer \nis captured from the\
    \ event log of the first consignment and visualized by the inductive visual miner\
    \ algorithm. A \npost-harvest supply chain using industry best practice standards\
    \ is established by configuring a geo-fence around \neach node with the time from\
    \ departure and duration for the produce consignment.  \n \n4.1.8  \nStep 9&10:\
    \  \n \n     GPS trackers are placed on the trucks or containers delivering the\
    \ produce, see Figure 3c. In addition, combined \ntemperature, light exposure,\
    \ carton orientation and location sensors are then placed on cartons or pallets.\
    \ Once \nattached the trackers and sensors are automatically detected in the geofenced\
    \ storage zones at the farm. These \n \n \n \n \n162 \n \nsensors use cellular\
    \ triangulation for location as well as having store and forward capability which\
    \ is required \nwhen the cartons or pallets are sealed in a container. Typically,\
    \ the sensors are set to record data every hour to \nconserve battery life and\
    \ will also transmit every hour when in cellular range or forward stored data\
    \ as soon as \nthey are in cellular range. For sealed containers transmission\
    \ or stored condition monitoring data occurs as soon \nas the container doors\
    \ are opened, for example at a cross dock facility or distribution center. Both\
    \ the GPS trackers \nand condition monitoring sensors are returned to the farmer\
    \ after delivery of the consignment, often with the \nreusable cartons.  \n \n\
    4.1.9  \nStep 11&12: \n \n    Once the post-harvest supply chain activities begin\
    \ the HSCA process is triggered by cartons or pallets being \nmoved from their\
    \ geofenced storage zones, see Figure 3d. Supply chain event data is transmitted\
    \ to the HSCA \nplatform on an hourly basis. When consignment reaches a geofenced\
    \ supply chain node, the time from departure \nand duration at the node is autonomously\
    \ assessed against the referenced standard, utilizing the compliance \nchecking\
    \ functionality of the inductive visual miner algorithm, any non-conformance is\
    \ alerted. The event logs \nare also monitored for temperature variation outside\
    \ of preset thresholds, changes in orientation, indicating poor \nproduct handling\
    \ or unexpected light ingress indicating a supply disruption to a sealed consignment,\
    \ any non-\nconformance is automatically alerted. Referencing the unique RFID\
    \ placed on the produce in Step 4, the post-\nharvest event data is stored on\
    \ the HSCA platform database for further quality and yield analytics. Customer\
    \ \nquality or yield feedback is referenced to the produce RFID tag. The farmer\
    \ can rapidly extract the entire pre-\nharvest and post-harvest history of produce,\
    \ compare it to produce grown in various parts of the farm, or under \ndifferent\
    \ weather conditions, or different seasons and obtain deep insights into contributing\
    \ factors to continually \nimprove produce supply. \n \n4.2  \nHorticulture Supply\
    \ Chain Analytics IT Artifact \n \n     To validate the HSCA framework an IT Artifact\
    \ was configured to monitor both on farm and off farm supply \nchain activities\
    \ on the banana farm. The key components of the artifact or platform are a) the\
    \ connectivity platform \nb) executable BPMS, c) inductive visual miner algorithm.\
    \ Utilizing IoT gateways from a public cloud provider, \nevent data captured by\
    \ the GPS trackers and condition monitoring sensors passes through a stream processor\
    \ \nbefore being stored in a database. The processes presented in the HSCA framework\
    \ were mapped in sequence in \nthe BPMS system which orchestrates the extraction\
    \ of the events from the database, conversion to XES format \nand processing via\
    \ the inductive visual miner algorithm. The BPMS orchestrates the processing of\
    \ outputs through \ndecision models which contain the alerting logic when non\
    \ conformances are detected by the IVM algorithm and \nmanages the data through\
    \ the graphical user interface.  \nResults \nThe banana farmer evaluated the outputs\
    \ of the HSCA framework as expressed through the IT artifact shown in \nFigure\
    \ 4 below and made the following evaluation, through a structured survey: i) The\
    \ HSCA framework adds \nhigh value to a horticulture business ii) The solution\
    \ provides complete traceability through to customer, which \ncould significantly\
    \ influence customer buying behaviour iii) A high adoption of such a solution\
    \ is predicted for \nthe horticulture industry. \n \nFigure 3a: GPS tracker on\
    \ tractor 3b: Geofences and assets tracking 3c: GPS Tracker in container 3d: Container\
    \ tracking. \n \n \n \n \n163 \n \n \nFigure 4a: Processing farm event logs 4b:\
    \ Monitoring for non-compliance \n The structured survey was also given to the\
    \ subject matter experts, who were requested to evaluate the HSCA \nframework\
    \ from a general horticulture perspective, a sample of the evaluation is presented\
    \ in Figure 5 below. \nWhile the problem formulation focused on actionable insights\
    \ to mitigate supply chain disruption, an interesting \nobservation has been the\
    \ prioritization by the subject matter experts of the root cause areas i) productivity\
    \ ii) \nquality iii) compliance (environmental and food safety) compared to the\
    \ post-harvest tracking and insights. \n \n \n     Further enquiry revealed that\
    \ the prioritization was due to the consequences of responding to the insights\
    \ \nproduced by the HSCA framework. On farm related risks and disruptions can\
    \ be actioned immediately, hence the \nhigh priority while post-harvest supply\
    \ chain threats often require intervention by third parties, who do not always\
    \ \nhave the appropriate responsiveness to the issues. The consensus was that\
    \ as collaboration increases across the \nend-to-end horticulture supply chain\
    \ the ability to mitigate risk will be increased using the HSCA framework. \n\
    \ \n6. Conclusion \n     \n    The evaluation of the HSCA framework and IT artifact\
    \ was conducted using the FEDS, technical risk, and \nefficacy strategy, commencing\
    \ as artificial formative and progressing to naturalistic summative (Venable et\
    \ al., \n2016). The time and cost of deploying the infrastructure on farm restricted\
    \ the case study to a single farm, however \nthe structure of the framework allowed\
    \ for artificial formative evaluation for other horticulture sectors using \n\
    synthetic/simulated data. The problem horticulture farmers face as well as the\
    \ research gap was synthesized into \nthe research question: Can a process intelligence\
    \ enabled geospatial tracking system provide actionable insights \nto horticulture\
    \ farmers to mitigate supply chain disruption? The results of the banana supply\
    \ chain use case have \nanswered the research question as yes. The novel integration\
    \ of geospatial tracking methodology with supply \nchain event mining, enabled\
    \ by process intelligence, has produced a level of autonomous decision support\
    \ for the \nfarmers who do not have the time or resources to continuously monitor\
    \ systems and dashboards for information. \nThe horticulture sector is a cost\
    \ sensitive sector and doesn’t have the capability of investment and resourcing\
    \ in \nIndustry 4.0 enabled systems and infrastructure as some other industries\
    \ have. The principles of Industry 4.0, \nhowever, are most relevant to the industry\
    \ and combined with the innovative use of satellite enabled technologies, \ncost\
    \ effective sensors and low code platforms significant productivity and supply\
    \ chain resilience improvement \nwill be possible. The HSCA framework and its\
    \ IT artifact have demonstrated the opportunity through the banana \nuse case\
    \ and the possibilities with horticulture sector in general.   \n \n \n \n \n\

    Copy Abstract Artificial Intelligence (AI) experienced significant advancements
    in recent years, and its impact is already recognized across various industries.
    Yet, the rise of AI has led to a growing concern about its impact on meeting the
    Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The aim of this paper was to evaluate contributions
    and the potential impact of AI to sustainable development in the society domain.
    Furthermore, the study analyzed GPT-3 responses, as one of the largest language
    models developed by OpenAI, descriptively. We conducted a set of queries on the
    SDGs to gather infor-mation on GPT-3`s perceptions of AI impact on sustainable
    development. Analysis of GPT-3’s contribution potential towards the SDGs showcased
    its broad range of capabilities for contributing to the SDGs in areas such as
    education, health, and communication. The study findings provide valuable insights
    into the contributions of AI to sustainable development in the society domain
    and highlight the importance of proper regulations to promote the responsible
    use of AI for sustainable development. We plan subsequent research for effects
    on ecologic and economic domains of SDGs. We highlighted the potential for improvement
    in neural language processing skills of GPT-3 by avoiding imitating weak human
    writing styles with more mistakes in longer texts. Keywords OpenAI; ChatGPT; GPT-3;

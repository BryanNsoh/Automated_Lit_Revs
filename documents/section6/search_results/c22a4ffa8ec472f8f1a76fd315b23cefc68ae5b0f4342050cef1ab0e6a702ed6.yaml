    The global agricultural sector is increasingly pressured to adopt sustainable
    practices and reduce its environmental impact. In this context, greenhouses play
    a crucial role in enabling year-round crop production, ensuring food security,
    and minimizing reliance on traditional open-field farming. However, the energy
    consumption associated with greenhouse operations poses a significant challenge
    to achieving sustainability goals. As a result, there is a growing emphasis on
    transitioning greenhouses towards near-zero energy consumption. Near-zero energy
    consumption in greenhouses refers to the ambitious objective of minimizing energy
    usage to the greatest extent possible while maintaining optimal growing conditions
    for crops. This goal encompasses reducing energy consumption for heating, cooling,
    lighting, and other operational needs, as well as exploring renewable energy sources
    to power greenhouse operations. This review article offers a comprehensive overview
    of greenhouse energy consumption, with the main goal of analyzing the present
    situation, identifying key challenges, exploring potential opportunities, and
    proposing future perspectives for decreasing energy usage in greenhouse environments.
    As the focus on sustainable agricultural practices grows, the need to reduce energy
    consumption in greenhouses becomes increasingly important. The review critically
    examines current technological models and strategies applied in smart greenhouse
    applications, as well as the monitoring of microclimatic conditions inside the
    greenhouse, encompassing factors such as temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, soil
    quality, and crop cultivation. Moreover, it aims to present existing literature
    that investigates the advancement of greenhouses toward achieving significant
    reductions in energy consumption. Keywords Smart Greenhouse; Optimization; Control;

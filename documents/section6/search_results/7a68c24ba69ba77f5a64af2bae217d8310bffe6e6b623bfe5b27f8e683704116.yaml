  description: The advances in sensorial technology and its use in agriculture have
    been contributing to the acquisition and analysis of data regarding agricultural
    production. Studies propose the use of sensors to monitor production or even the
    use of cameras to obtain crop information, providing data, reminders, and alerts
    to farmers. Through the obtainment and analysis of these data, context awareness
    can be used to improve systems, mainly through the prediction techniques applied
    to agriculture. This article presents a systematic mapping of studies that use
    prediction and context awareness in agriculture. During the mapping, 10206 articles
    were initially identified and, after filtering by inclusion and exclusion criteria,
    42 articles were selected. The results indicated that 35.7% (15/42) of the studies
    used one or more prediction techniques and 45.2% (19/42) used image processing
    through pictures of cameras to obtain information regarding planting. 23 sensors
    with different functionalities were found, those have been used in the collection
    of data for context formation in agriculture.

    based on cartographic methodology in management systems Abstract. This study presents
    a model of a tool for spatial visualization of processes occurring in the stakeholder
    environment concerning relationship management according to the ISO standards
    for management systems. Spatial visualization is based on cartographic methodology
    extended with technological capabilities used in GIS (Geographic Information Systems)
    systems. Thanks to the method, different types of issues using environment maps
    can be presented. This paper proposes a model of a tool enabling multi-criteria
    spatial visualization of states, phenomena, processes and plans taking place in
    the discussed environment. The proposed model of visualization is to be used in
    the future to present the results of research in the discussed field. They concern
    stakeholder relationship management according to the ISO management systems. Appropriate
    technology is required for the application of the model. The study is part of
    a stream of works aimed at using the concept of space to describe various sections
    of reality. It may have both theoretical implications (visualizations based on
    spatial models), as well as practical ones related to popularizing the use of
    various types of space to describe phenomena and planning. The originality of
    this study is that the present model-based visualization features selected stakeholders
    within the ISO standards. As part of the visualization example, heuristic spaces
    were defined, on which objects representing different types of stakeholders were
    placed, their significance as part of the ISO standard being determined according
    to each of the features: power, interest and predictability. The data was obtained
    in a branch of an international corporation operating in the packaging industry.

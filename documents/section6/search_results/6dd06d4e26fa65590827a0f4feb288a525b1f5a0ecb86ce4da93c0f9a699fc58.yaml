    and environmental impact in the agrifood sector, this study explores the integration
    of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies with IOTA’s Tangle, a Distributed Ledger
    Technology (DLT). This integration aims to enhance sustainable agricultural practices,
    using rice cultivation as a case study of high relevance and reapplicability given

    agricultural practices. Keywords: agrifood sector; internet of things (IoT); distributed
    ledger technologies (DLT); IOTA tangle; rice cultivation; sustainability; real-time
    data recording; environmental footprint 1. Introduction The agrifood sector, a
    cornerstone of the global economy, sustains billions by providing food and livelihoods.
    Yet, it grapples with multifaceted challenges, from climate change and environmental
    degradation to population growth, food security, and consumer trust. Addressing
    these requires sustainable, efficient agricultural practices that optimize resource
    use, curtail waste, and elevate productivity and quality. The Internet of Things
    (IoT) is emerging at the forefront of solutions. This network of interconnected
    devices, equipped with sensors, actuators, and communication protocols, offers
    real-time monitoring and control over parameters like crop growth, soil health,
    water consumption, pest management, and greenhouse gas emissions. Beyond monitoring,
    IoT enhances traceability and transparency throughout the food supply chain, bolstering
    food safety and consumer trust. However, the integration of IoT in agriculture
    is not without challenges, especially concerning data management: Data Security:
    Ensuring data integrity and safeguarding against malicious tampering is paramount.
    Data Privacy: Stakeholders’ rights and preferences necessitate stringent measures
    against unauthorized data access or disclosure. Data Scalability: As farms grow
    and technology adoption surges, systems must accommodate an increasing influx
    of data from sensors and devices. Data Interoperability: Seamless data exchange
    is crucial, especially when devices and systems employ diverse formats and standards.
    Data Cost: Efficient data transmission and storage are vital, particularly for
    frequent or low-value transactions. Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) and
    the IoT can address these challenges by offering a decentralized, immutable, and
    transparent platform for data management. However, while the blockchain, i.e.,
    the most widely used form of DLT, has revolutionized data storage through cryptographically
    linked blocks, it is necessary to address scalability, transaction fees, energy
    consumption, and more limitations in the data-intensive IoT universe. IOTA offers
    a fresh perspective on DLT with its Tangle, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure.
    Unlike blockchains, the Tangle permits feeless transactions, validated by nodes
    as they initiate new transactions [1,2]. This structure provides enhanced scalability,
    reduced energy consumption, quantum resistance, and the capability for offline
    transactions and microtransactions. Rather than replacing traditional blockchain
    systems, IOTA complements them, especially for the high-frequency data transactions
    inherent to the IoT. With projections indicating that, by 2030, approximately
    125 billion IoT devices will be interconnected [3], the sheer volume of data generated
    necessitates robust management, distribution, and storage solutions. While DLT
    offers a promising avenue, our study narrows its focus on IOTA’s Tangle, a DLT
    uniquely equipped to handle the vast data streams from IoT devices, given its
    scalable, fast, and feeless micro-data transaction capabilities. With this backdrop,
    our central research inquiry is both theoretical and pragmatic: Is it possible
    to devise a web application that seamlessly integrates Tangle IOTA with IoT-enabled
    sensors? These sensors, designed for monitoring sustainability metrics in agriculture,
    would empower operators in the agrifood sector with real-time insights, enabling
    timely interventions. To explore this, we have embarked on a Proof-of-Concept
    test focusing on data from rice cultivation. Our Proof-of-Concept focuses on rice
    cultivation, chosen due to its significant freshwater usage, which is the highest
    among all crops. Additionally, rice’s global prevalence and status as the world’s
    primary food crop make it a pertinent subject for our study [4]. We developed
    an analytical dashboard to demonstrate that using technologies such as IoT and
    IOTA optimizes product quality, product processing efficiency, cost, and production
    time. In summary, when we fully control production with devices and sensors (IoT),
    receiving data even from remote locations with the support of IOTA, it is possible
    to reduce the release of CO 2 by having control over irrigation and the right
    portion of water (more water equals more CO 2 and more waste). In addition, it
    is possible to track the product 24 h a day, receiving recorded data on IOTA almost
    through streaming. Finally, the process is very green, reducing electricity consumption.
    2. Background and Related Works In this section, we first provide a general background
    on distributed ledger technology (DLT), including both blockchains and tangles
    like IOTA. Then, we discuss related work on (i) traditional monitoring systems
    in agriculture, (ii) the use of the blockchain applied to agriculture, and (iii)
    the use of IOTA Tangle technology applied to agriculture. 2.1. Background DLT
    has become a transformative force in information technology, reshaping organizational
    collaboration and operation [5,6]. It employs a ledger system where multiple nodes
    can read and write data, maintaining a state based on consensus, which varies
    with the network’s decentralization level. DLTs are characterized mainly by their
    ledger structure: chain-based systems like blockchain and DAG-based systems like
    IOTA’s Tangle. Chain-based DLTs utilize a linear series of blocks, securing records
    through cryptographic hashing and consensus mechanisms like proof of work or stake.
    These blockchains differ in their access protocols and validator addition methods,
    affecting interaction levels with network components. In contrast, DAG-based DLTs
    allow parallel transaction processing, offering potentially higher scalability
    than chain-based systems. With independent transaction confirmation and no need
    for a single global consensus, DAG structures provide a more dynamic and scalable
    consensus approach. This contrasts with chain-based systems, where all transactions
    require network-wide confirmation, leading to potential bottlenecks in transaction
    processing and scalability. 2.2. Related Work 2.2.1. Traditional Monitoring Systems
    in Agriculture Historically, agricultural monitoring has evolved through various
    traditional systems. Key studies in this field have explored different approaches:
    Wang et al. developed a low-cost, real-time remote environmental monitoring system
    combining wireless equipment and mobile phones that was powered by solar energy.
    This system was effective in collecting real-time information and fulfilling online
    acquisition needs [7]. Dan et al. implemented a Greenhouse Environment Monitoring
    System using ZigBee technology, wireless sensors, and control nodes. This system
    focused on controlling environmental data for enhanced greenhouse management [8].
    Hashim et al. reviewed using an Arduino device for temperature and soil moisture
    control, managed via an Android smartphone. This study contributed to designing
    smart monitoring systems using an embedded micro-web server and IP connectivity,
    aiming to aid the agriculture sector in achieving quality production [9]. Karim
    et al. developed an application for precision farming based on a wireless sensor
    network and IoT cloud. This application focused on optimizing irrigation and monitoring
    microclimatic conditions to improve water usage efficiency in farming [10]. 2.2.2.
    Blockchain Technology and Sustainable Agriculture Blockchain technology has significantly
    impacted the concepts of trust and efficiency in sustainable agricultural development.
    This change became prominent as agrifood companies accessed knowledge banks and
    digital resources [11]. Blockchain, alongside the Internet of Things (IoT), is
    pivotal in advancing sustainable and precision agriculture, which leverages technology
    to enhance agricultural efficiency [12]. Lin et al. proposed an ICT e-agriculture
    system model based on the blockchain for local and regional use. They also developed
    a validation tool for the technical and social requirements of these systems [11].
    Patil et al. focused on using IoT for remote monitoring and automation in agriculture.
    They provided an architecture integrating blockchain technology for smart greenhouse
    farms, offering a security framework that combines blockchain with IoT devices
    for enhanced security and communication in smart farming [13]. Munir et al. implemented
    an intelligent Smart Watering System (SWS) based on an Android application for
    smart water consumption in crops. The system, equipped with affordable sensors,
    uses blockchain and Fuzzy Logic approaches for data security and intelligent decision-making,
    enabling real-time monitoring and periodic irrigation [14]. Baralla et al. developed
    a blockchain-oriented platform to authenticate food origin data. This platform
    aims to enhance supply chain transparency, promote local smart food tourism, and
    boost local economies, emphasizing the importance of food as a “business card”
    for tourist sites [15]. Iqbal and Butt proposed an IoT-based system for crop protection
    at all stages, focusing on deterring animal attacks using sensors and a Repelling
    and Notifying System (RNS). The system records incidents in a centralized Farm
    Management System (FMS), integrated with an agricultural blockchain for shared
    ledger functionalities, enhancing meta-information sharing [12]. Cocco et al.
    implemented a system offering visibility to food processes and certifications,
    using Self Sovereign Identity, blockchain, and the InterPlanetary File System.
    This system aims to safeguard data storage and access, ensuring the eligibility,
    transparency, and traceability of certifications [16]. 2.2.3. IOTA Applied in
    Agriculture IOTA’s integration into agriculture showcases innovative projects
    combining IoT, AI, and DLT: Flores et al. developed the Interplanetary Precision
    Agriculture (IPA) project, which harnesses IoT, AI, and DLT. The project utilizes
    various technologies, including an autonomous rover (Magrito) for crop performance
    data, Precision Habitat PRO for environmental control, a bluetooth scale for weight
    data, and a farm management system for data aggregation. The collected data are
    sent to the IOTA Tangle network to ensure immutability and interoperability. This
    aims to enhance cultivation processes both on Earth and in extraterrestrial environments,
    addressing issues of centralization and data silos in supply chains. The overarching
    goal is to establish a sustainable food supply and minimize the environmental
    footprint of agricultural practices [17]. Lamtzidis et al. introduced a distributed
    ledger-based system focused on securing IoT data integrity. They utilized IOTA’s
    Tangle ledger for the secure processing and storage of aggregated field data,
    transitioning from a cloud-centric to a node-centric architecture. In this setup,
    each Super node maintains its data in a distributed and decentralized database,
    with the backend functioning as both a data consumer and resource provider. This
    modular approach has made significant contributions to open-source communities
    in blockchain and IoT, presenting a more secure and decentralized method for managing
    IoT data [18]. 3. Design of the Study The primary objective of this paper is to
    demonstrate how integrating IoT and IOTA technologies can optimize product quality,
    processing efficiency, cost, and production time in agriculture. By utilizing
    IoT devices and sensors, and leveraging IOTA for data management, we aim to achieve
    significant reductions in CO 2 emissions through precise irrigation control and
    water management. This approach also allows for continuous product tracking and
    reduces electricity consumption, contributing to a more sustainable agricultural
    process. Our methodology involves creating a prototype that simulates a rice production
    process. This setup includes seedlings equipped with sensors to monitor and regulate
    water levels within a specified range. This prototype demonstrates efficient data
    transmission, production control, and system functionality. The study heavily
    focuses on the impact of IoT in agriculture. IoT technology, encompassing remote
    sensors, cloud and edge computing, unmanned vehicles, and data analytics [19],
    is revolutionizing agricultural practices. It allows for effective monitoring
    of crucial factors like humidity, air temperature, and soil quality, thus enhancing
    crop yields, irrigation efficiency, and accurate harvest forecasting (https://www.appsforagri.com/en/news/impact-of-iot-in-the-agriculture/,
    accessed on 7 October 2023). Moreover, the IoT’s integration into agriculture
    significantly reduces environmental impacts by lowering water and energy usage,
    greenhouse gas emissions, and fertilizer runoff. Financially, it increases farmers’
    profitability and competitiveness by opening up new markets and services [20].
    This study extends the IoT’s capabilities in agriculture by incorporating IOTA’s
    DLT, which is particularly suited for high-frequency IoT scenarios. IOTA offers
    benefits such as feeless transactions, data integrity, scalability, and interoperability,
    making it ideal for a secure and transparent network of IoT devices in the agricultural
    sector. Our methodology places a strong emphasis on optimizing resource utilization,
    with a particular focus on water efficiency. By integrating IOTA’s advanced DLT
    capabilities with intelligent irrigation systems, we aim to significantly enhance
    the precision and effectiveness of water usage in agriculture. Drawing insights
    from Mboyerwa et al.’s [21] research, this integration is expected to drastically
    reduce resource consumption. Notably, it can lead to halving water usage, decreasing
    nitrogen consumption by 25%, and reducing methane emissions by 50% to 70%. These
    substantial reductions are primarily achieved through the optimized control of
    field flooding durations, which effectively slows down the activity of methane-producing
    microorganisms. The integration of IOTA plays a critical role in this process.
    Its technology enables a secure, transparent, and highly efficient network of
    IoT devices. This network facilitates the real-time collection, processing, and
    analysis of vast amounts of agricultural data. Consequently, it allows for more
    precise irrigation decisions, ensuring water is used more effectively and sustainably.
    The real-time data processing and feeless transactions offered by IOTA enhance
    the system’s responsiveness and accuracy, leading to a more intelligent and environmentally
    friendly approach to irrigation. This not only optimizes resource usage but also
    contributes to the broader goals of sustainable and precision agriculture. The
    study employs a multi-faceted technological approach, simulating a data-intensive
    paddy farm environment. By integrating IOTA, we enhance data management, introduce
    robust authorization systems, and streamline data transmission. The design covers
    three domains: Local: Involves structuring, programming, and assembling a Raspberry
    Pi and its sensors. Remote: Facilitates internet connectivity and links to an
    online platform. Cloud-based server: Serves as the primary project hub. Technologically,
    the study utilizes Raspberry Pi devices and sensors, EMQX (MQTT), VPN and Ubuntu,
    Docker, IOTA, and MongoDB (ATLAS). The programming spans across Python, NodeJs,
    Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 3.1. IOTA IOTA stands out as a pioneering DLT tailored
    for the IoT landscape. Distinct from conventional blockchain systems, IOTA employs
    the Tangle, a unique architecture that addresses the scalability and transaction
    cost challenges inherent to blockchains. It positions IOTA as an optimal choice
    for the real-time processing of vast data streams from IoT sensors in sustainable
    agriculture. The IOTA network is underpinned by nodes’ individual instances of
    the IOTA software. These nodes validate and record transactions, and in the context
    of sustainable agriculture, they could process data received from IoT sensors,
    monitoring parameters like soil moisture, temperature, and pH levels. To ensure
    efficient operation, nodes had to use a robust but affordable environment with
    at least a 4-core processor, 8GB RAM, SSD storage, and a public IP address. Each
    node offers different features across multiple ports, facilitating peer-to-peer
    communication with HTTP and MQTT protocol, allowing for resilient data communication
    in every agricultural scenario. IOTA nodes can manifest as Mainnet, Testnet, or
    Devnet nodes. While Mainnet nodes handle real-world IOTA transactions, including
    actual sensor data, Testnet and Devnet nodes serve developmental and testing purposes,
    enabling developers to refine applications before Mainnet deployment. There are
    two primary IOTA node software options: Hornet and Bee. Hornet, crafted in Go,
    is resource-efficient, aligning with IoT applications where resources might be
    limited. Conversely, Bee, developed in Rust, emphasizes modularity and performance.
    Given its resource efficiency, Hornet is preferred for most agricultural IoT scenarios.
    Hornet’s implementation can leverage various avenues, including APT Repository,
    Docker image, binary files, or source construction. The Docker image, renowned
    for its portability, is particularly favored. The ability of Docker to effortlessly
    deploy and scale applications aligns with agricultural contexts, where the number
    of IoT sensors can fluctuate based on farm dimensions and requirements. Node security
    is paramount, necessitating measures like safeguarding login accounts, sealing
    unused ports, disabling remote consensus algorithm execution, and deploying a
    reverse proxy for augmented security. The Docker image gohornet/hornet (https://hub.docker.com/r/iotaledger/hornet,
    accessed on 7 October 2023) is utilized for Hornet implementation, with the repository
    cloned locally. Configuration files (i.e., config.json and peering.json) facilitate
    settings customization and node synchronization storage. The database of IOTA
    mandates a mainnetdb folder creation, with the use of authentication hashes ensuring
    data access exclusivity. The Docker image also initiates a server, loading a dashboard
    for node and data monitoring essential for overseeing and troubleshooting the
    IoT sensor network in agriculture. 3.2. Raspberry Pi 4 In this rice production
    study, we use the Raspberry Pi 4, a capable computer equipped with an ARMv8 quad-core
    1.5 GHz 64-bit CPU, dual-band wireless LAN, Bluetooth 5.0, and 1-2-4 GB RAM. It
    offers a GPIO port with 40 pins, 26 being GPIO pins, and various ports like USB,
    micro-HDMI, Ethernet, and more, including support for 4K video. The GPIO socket
    includes 40 pins, bridging the Raspberry Pi and external devices, where 26 of
    these are GPIO pins; the rest are power or ground pins. They are labeled in both
    physical and BCM numbering for convenience. Raspbian, a version of Linux designed
    for Raspberry Pi, serves as the operating system. It is installed via NOOBS, with
    a browser, email program, LibreOffice, Minecraft, and a command-line tool (raspi-config)
    for configuration management. Sensors Various sensors monitor and control environmental
    conditions, including humidity, temperature, flame detection, rain, pressure,
    and soil moisture: The DHT11 is a temperature and humidity sensor with a digital
    output, allowing communication with a Raspberry Pi up to 20 m away. It provides
    stable measurements with a maximum temperature accuracy variation of 2 °C and
    humidity accuracy variation of 1 percent. The flame detection sensor can detect
    infrared emissions from a flame and convert them into an electrical signal readable
    by any microcontroller. It has a reading angle 60° and features both an analog
    and a digital output. The rain sensor detects the presence and concentration of
    water. An LED indicates its operation and features with an analog output to calculate
    the amount of water present. The pressure sensor measures atmospheric pressure,
    temperature, and altitude. It can measure an atmospheric pressure level ranging
    from 300 to 1100 hPa and a temperature range from −40 °C to +85 °C. The soil moisture
    sensor detects soil moisture and the presence or absence of water. It has a digital
    output that indicates the level of humidity. This study uses two such sensors
    to monitor the optimal water levels for rice field irrigation. The first sensor
    measures the minimum water level needed for healthy rice growth, while the second
    sensor identifies the maximum water level to prevent wastage and crop damage.
    3.3. Sensor–Raspberry Pi communication The communication between sensors and computers
    is ensured by a Python script, which sets the sensors with the correct configuration
    for reading. It cyclically checks each sensor, recalling its state or value and
    storing the results in temporary variables. These variables are part of a JSON-like
    object that requires further conversion to become a standard JSON object. The
    script establishes a remote connection on the EMQX API, an MQTT web tool, and
    proceeds with publishing through the publish function. Since Python lacks the
    module allowing Raspberry Pi to communicate with the web tool, it must be installed
    and imported. To avoid saturating the Raspberry Pi’s resources, time intervals
    are established between the data acquisition of one sensor and the next. A pause
    of 2 s has been set before another sensor is analyzed to minimize data and information
    loss. The dialogue between the two technologies is summarized in Figure 1. Figure
    1. Sensor–Raspberry Pi communication. 3.4. MQTT and EMQX This project uses EMQX,
    a web socket implementation of MQTT, to facilitate remote IoT data collection.
    EMQX is an open-source MQTT IoT message broker built on the Erlang/OTP platform,
    renowned for its soft real-time capabilities, low latency, and distributed development
    features. MQTT is a lightweight message exchange protocol centered around a publication–subscription
    model. EMQX is accessible via browser and is designed for mass client access,
    providing fast and low-latency message routing between large physical network
    devices. It can host large-scale MQTT client connections, with a single server
    node supporting 2 million connections. It is also extensible, supporting custom
    plug-ins for authentication and other features. It fully supports IoT protocols,
    including MQTT, MQTT-SN, soap, LwM2M, and other proprietary TCP/UDP-based protocols.
    The connection configuration is used to set up links through any API that will
    serve as a bridge to dialogue your code with the MQTT platform. Required fields
    for EMQX connection configuration encompass “Name”, “Client ID”, “Host”, and the
    listening port. EMQX Broker provides many configuration elements and supports
    global and local configurations, allowing multi-protocol and port utilization.
    Auto Reconnect and Clean session functions are used to perform automatic reconnection
    when the broker goes offline and to start a session after a disconnection. The
    project creates various “topics” or subjects by creating a new subscription. The
    Topic must have a title and a subtitle, which are necessary if there is a need
    to filter the data. They are used to categorize the topic according to the path
    to which it belongs. This logic is useful when you want to retrieve information
    to access it; you need to know and refer to the precise path, otherwise, you cannot
    link to the topic. Data simulation within the project is accomplished with data
    input in JSON or TXT format allowing for textual data and key-value schema object
    notation. JSON data were sent via the Raspberry device at 2-s intervals, and it
    is possible to say that no visible latency or message loss was encountered. Figure
    2 displays the most important functionalities of this tool. Through the functionality
    called “New Connection”, it is possible to create a new mandatory initial connection
    or it can be used to create additional parallel connections, leading to Step 2,
    i.e., the connection configuration. This part will also serve as a setting for
    the links through any API that will serve as a bridge to dialogue your code with
    the MQTT platform. Figure 2. EMQX: MQTT Websocket Toolkit. In detail, Table 1
    shows the port numbers devoted to exposing services, dealing with sockets, the
    default WS (web socket) or WSS (web socket secured with SSL). The latter is a
    security protocol based on modern public key cryptographic algorithms, i.e., TLS/SSL.
    It can ensure transmission security in the computer communication network, providing
    the benefits of strong certification, thus ensuring confidentiality and completeness.
    Table 1. Protocol port. 3.5. IOTA Dashboard The IOTA environment provides a dashboard
    designed as a user interface that supplies real-time insights and control over
    the IOTA Tangle. In sustainable rice cultivation, IoT devices can be deployed
    across rice fields to monitor various parameters such as soil moisture, temperature,
    pH level, and more. These devices can transmit data to the IOTA Tangle, which
    can be accessed and analyzed in real-time through the IOTA dashboard. The IOTA
    dashboard enables one to view the IOTA DLT state. In detail, it provides an Analytics
    tab, which makes available parameters about the node, network, and resources,
    including information about the Tangle network, node details, memory usage, and
    cache data. Moreover, users can search for messages sent to the node, for instance,
    measurement from the IoT devices deployed in the rice fields monitoring by using
    the Explorer tab. In addition, the IOTA dashboard comes with a Visualizer tab
    responsible for providing a visual representation of the live evolution of the
    Tangle network, offering a real-time view of data transmission. Network management
    is eased by noting the information displayed in the Peers tab, and finally, plugin
    add-ons are allowed in the Plugins tab. Through the IOTA dashboard, farmers, researchers,
    and decision-makers can gain valuable insights into the conditions of the rice
    fields, enabling them to make informed decisions that promote sustainable cultivation
    practices. This case study will explore how the IOTA dashboard can be used in
    promoting sustainability in rice cultivation. The analytics tab is composed of
    four sub-tabs, namely Tangle, Node, Memory, and Caches. As depicted in Figure
    3, the Tangle subsection supplies several valuable metrics, such as known messages,
    new messages, received messages, messages sent, message requests received, sent
    message requests, heartbeats received, heartbeats sent, milestone request received,
    sent milestone request, and deleted packets. Figure 3. IOTA dashboard: analytics.
    Between these analytics, it is possible to note a heartbeat signal. Heartbeat
    is a periodic signal that hardware or software produces, and it is used both to
    show proper operation and synchronize nodes. It is one of the mission-critical
    systems’ most widely used techniques to provide high availability and fault tolerance
    of network services by detecting network or node system failures. Other sections
    provide information regarding memory usage and cache state. The Node section is
    in charge of providing insights on messages sent per milestone, which define a
    temporal interval defining the time needed to pass until the network coordinator
    executes the message validation. The state and the throughput of the network are
    viewable in the network graph, as depicted in Figure 4, which represents the construction
    of a Tangle or a DAG graph, i.e., the distributed registry in which are stored
    all transitions. In the sidebar of Figure 4, there are the following Tangle properties:
    (i) messages that indicates the number of messages sent; (ii) MPS, i.e., the number
    of messages sent to the network per second; (iii) TIPS, i.e., the number of unapproved
    transactions; (iv) referenced, i.e., the percentage of transactions referenced
    by other transactions; (v) conflicting, i.e., the percentage of transactions with
    conflicts; and (vi) solid, i.e., transactions with their history. Figure 4. Tangle
    graph. In Figure 5, it is possible to see one of the requirements for interacting
    with the IOTA network. The choices depend on the technologies one chooses to use,
    but also on whether one wants to use one’s own node (direct access) or rely on
    third-party nodes. Figure 5. Dependencies and requirements of IOTA. Constructing
    a personal node for network access is the optimal choice. The entire infrastructure
    can be raised using an editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) or any other editor or
    IDE. Once Docker is configured and operational, the installation of either Hornet
    or Bee is enabled allowing for crafting nodes. Upon completion, the node may be
    launched via Docker. After configuring the network settings, the dashboard is
    accessible, enabling the owned node viewing as well as interaction with other
    nodes and also providing insights regarding the IOTA network. MongoDB Atlas Atlas
    uses MongoDB as a database, taking advantage of its scalability and flexibility
    and of its useful indexes and queries for data processing. Data originating from
    the Raspberry Pi are sent through EMQX and are written into the Atlas database.
    To establish a database on MongoDB Atlas for agricultural monitoring, follow these
    steps: register on the Atlas website, choose a cluster, create the database, and
    configure the connection string. MongoDB stores data records as BSON documents
    in collections, similar to tables in relational databases. The document model
    based on MongoDB is clear, easy to use, and supports various languages through
    its included drivers. The Atlas interface provides an overview of the data flow
    and allows the transformation of agricultural data into charts, as shown in Figure
    6, which displays two charts, one tracking the temperature and humidity data over
    time based on the hour, the other counting the amount of data each sensor has
    sent compared to the other sensors. Figure 6. Atlas data charts. By selecting
    the desired database, it is possible to choose the chart and then select the data
    of interest to be represented in the graph, setting a title and some properties.
    This chart is saved in the dashboard, and every time new data are received, they
    are written into the database, automatically updating the various charts based
    on the corresponding fields. There are approximately nine chart options, with
    an average of two subcategories for each. In Figure 7, it is possible to see the
    number of times a certain temperature is detected. For example, 23 degrees has
    been detected 25 times, while 24 degrees has been detected only 5 times. The chart
    on the right displays the total count of temperature data. In this case, both
    the humidity and barometer sensors detect the temperature. By adding the two values
    shown in the second chart in Figure 3, which are 26 and 27, a percentage of 53%
    is obtained. Figure 7. Temperature. These visualizations can be made visible to
    specific users, such as farmers or sustainability experts, or even made public
    through an off-site link. This feature enhances the accessibility of critical
    sustainability information, even outside of Atlas, promoting transparency and
    informed decision-making in agricultural practice. Hence, integrating MongoDB
    and Atlas in an IOTA-based deployment offers a robust solution for monitoring
    and analyzing sustainability parameters in agriculture. The flexibility in storage
    options, ease of setup, and data visualization capabilities make it a valuable
    tool in modern agricultural practices. Figure 8 depicts the architecture of the
    proposed model and the logical flows running through the system components. Briefly,
    data gathered by the IoT Sensors flow through EMQX to the Raspberry Pi, which
    acts as a gateway to send data to the HTTP Application Server. The node Application
    Server manages such data communicating with the IOTA network passing through the
    deployed node, as well as with the Atlas interfaces, thus enabling data monitoring
    via the analytical dashboard. Figure 8. Architecture of the system. 4. Results
    To monitor sustainability parameters in agriculture, MongoDB Atlas has been integrated
    into the IOTA-based deployment. The setup process has involved registering on
    the Atlas website, selecting a cluster, creating the database, and configuring
    the connection string. The Atlas interface allows the transformation of data into
    charts, which are automatically updated with new data. To this aim, data from
    devices like Raspberry Pis are sent through EMQX to a Node.Js script by leveraging
    APIs, and received data are stored in the MongoDB Cloud of Atlas. Moreover, we
    implemented a connection established with the local IOTA node (Hornet Mainnet)
    to propagate the data in the IOTA Tangle. The created Node.js server takes care
    of receiving, processing, and translating the data into services for the graphical
    interface. A lightweight Node.js server is created to receive, process, and translate
    the data into services for the graphical interface. The server listens on a customizable
    port, providing services to those who connect to that port. Aiming to achieve
    real-time insights, we developed an analytical dashboard, which is responsible
    for making viewable the received data. These are divided into several sections,
    each describing a different analysis aspect, as depicted in Figure 9. The sections
    include notifications, derived data, graphs, a table, alerts, and a map. The data
    in the table include count, id, date, time, message, temperature, humidity, pressure,
    altitude, latitude, longitude, status, and sensor name. Two soil sensors have
    been installed, one for notifying when the soil’s water level is insufficient
    and the other for alerting when there is excess water. Figure 9. Analytical dashboard.
    Hereafter, we illustrate the various sections of the analytical dashboard displayed
    in Figure 9. Section 1 showcases a menu that remains visible while scrolling the
    page. It counts both incoming data and highlights any data that requires attention.
    These particular data points are also tallied in the alerts. Section 2 illustrates
    data derived from analytical operations performed on raw sensor data. Starting
    from the left, we have the average humidity, obtained by summing up the humidity
    data points and dividing them by the number of humidity data points. Next, the
    minimum and maximum humidity values are reported by comparing the previously stored
    data with the subsequent data. Depending on the result, the old data may be overwritten.
    As in the case of humidity, it is possible that there are no fluctuations in either
    an upward or downward trend, resulting in the “Min” and “Max” values being equal.
    “Average Temperature”, “Min”, and “Max” values are calculated in the same manner.
    In Section 3, the “HUMIDITY” box displays the humidity data received from the
    temperature sensor. Specifically, the x-axis represents the time the data are
    received, and the y-axis represents the temperature data, which remain constant
    at 65% in this case. Regarding the “TEMPERATURE” box, the same procedure described
    in the previous case is followed, with the difference being that the temperature
    data are considered. As observed, the temperature data vary between 22 and 21
    degrees within the selected time interval. The “traces” are the lines used to
    construct the graph; in the “TEMPERATURE” box, there are eight traces. Both boxes
    feature a scroll bar that appears when the graph requires more space to display
    the newly received data while allowing the visualization of previous data by scrolling
    through the bar. Section 4 shows a dynamically populated table with JSON data
    sent by Raspberry sensors. There is a data model for the data types that each
    sensor sends, and the table can be fully viewed by scrolling horizontally. The
    same applies to the quantity of data, which requires scrolling vertically to view
    it. In detail, the data in the table include: Count indicates the number of times
    a specific sensor sends data; Id uniquely identifies each sensor; Date indicates
    the date the data was sent by Raspberry; Time indicates the time corresponding
    to the data sent by Raspberry; Message indicates additional information regarding
    the data; Temperature indicates the detected temperature; Humidity indicates the
    recorded humidity; Pressure indicates the identified pressure; Altitude indicates
    the measured altitude; Latitude and Longitude indicate the geographic coordinates
    of the sensor’s location; Status takes a value of 0 or 1 depending on the sensor;
    Sensor Name indicates the sensor’s name, which is useful for identifying the specific
    sensor being considered. The value “undefined” indicates that the specific sensor
    being considered does not produce that type of data detected by another specific
    sensor for that purpose. In Section 5 of Figure 9, the sensors with values requiring
    greater attention are displayed on the left, as seen in the table. Each alert
    notification is accompanied by the date, time, critical message, and an icon indicating
    its significance. At the top, the total number of alert messages received is shown.
    On the right, a real map is displayed, showing simulated geo-localization coordinates
    of the sensors. These data can either be pre-set or dynamically passed and plotted.
    Similarly, Figure 10 demonstrates the functioning of the two soil sensors, one
    alerting when the soil’s water level is insufficient, the other signaling when
    there is excess water. Figure 10. Functioning of the soil sensors. According to
    the works of Mboyerwa et al. [21] and Prem Kumar et al. [19], IoT and IOTA have
    emerged as disrupting technologies in the agrifood supply chain and sustainability
    optimization; we deem that our Proof-of-Concept will be a further advancement
    in monitoring and improving the sustainability of agrifood production processes.
    Moreover, IoT devices relying on centralized communications present a number of
    security threats related to privacy and security. IOTA addresses these flaws,
    also removing the blockchains’s limitations; indeed, IoT devices lack the computational
    power and storage needed to run consensus algorithms to be an involved part of
    the blockchain [22]. Taken together, our results answered the question that guided
    our research by creating a web application capable of integrating IOTA with IoT
    sensors devoted to real-time monitoring of agrifood supply chains. 5. Discussion
    In this section, we discuss the obtained results. 5.1. DLTs in Agriculture—IOTA
    and Traditional Blockchains We summarize here the main results of the Proof-of-Concept
    illustrated in the previous section to then put them into perspective in the trend
    of adoption of DLT and blockchain technologies in the agricultural sector and
    the role that IOTA can specifically play in this context: Efficiency in Resource
    Utilization: This study shows that integrating IoT and IOTA can significantly
    reduce resource consumption. Thus, this integration effectively implements the
    sustainable agricultural practices illustrated in [21]. Technological Infrastructure:
    This study employs various technologies, including Raspberry Pi 4, various sensors,
    and IOTA, a distributed ledger technology tailored for IoT. These technologies
    monitor various environmental conditions like soil moisture, temperature, and
    pH. Data Management and Security: This study uses IOTA to bolster data management
    and introduce a robust authorization system. It also employs MQTT and EMQX for
    remote IoT data collection, supporting up to 2 million connections on a single
    server node. Environmental Impact: IoT has the potential to mitigate the environmental
    footprint of agriculture by reducing water and energy consumption, greenhouse
    gas emissions, and fertilizer runoff. Financial Benefits: IoT can elevate the
    profitability and competitiveness of farmers by granting access to new markets,
    services, and performance-based incentives. Real-Time Monitoring: The IOTA dashboard
    provides real-time insights into various parameters like soil moisture, temperature,
    and pH levels, enabling informed decision-making for sustainable agriculture.
    Technological Toolkit: This study uses a diverse set of technologies, including
    Raspberry and its sensors, EMQX (MQTT), VPN and Ubuntu, Docker, IOTA, and MongoDB,
    and is programmed in Python, NodeJs, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Sustainability:
    This study concludes that the IoT stands as a pivotal force in enhancing agricultural
    productivity and sustainability, especially as the demand for food rises amidst
    limited resources. Transitioning from these findings, we delve into the broader
    implications and applications of DLTs in agriculture. Agriculture is a critical
    sector facing numerous challenges, including climate change, environmental degradation,
    and the need for sustainable practices. These challenges necessitate innovative
    solutions, and one such promising technology is the IoT. However, the vast amounts
    of data generated by IoT devices must be managed securely and efficiently. Moreover,
    agrifood businesses are increasingly pressured by governmental and consumer organizations
    to validate the safety and quality of their production processes. To meet these
    demands, DLTs offer a robust solution. They provide a decentralized system for
    storing and updating data across a network of nodes, eliminating the need for
    a central authority. DLTs employ cryptography and consensus mechanisms to ensure
    data integrity and validity. While DLTs offer numerous benefits like traceability,
    transparency, and operational efficiency, it is important to note that they are
    not a one-size-fits-all solution. Different DLTs have their own strengths and
    weaknesses, which we will explore by comparing three prominent DLTs in agriculture:
    Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and IOTA. Of course, this is not a random choice;
    all three platforms stand out for their agricultural achievements and potential
    compared to other DLTs and blockchains. We will focus on two main use cases: traceability
    in the agrifood supply chain and real-time monitoring of cultivation practices.
    The latter case became more recently of interest and focus, and this article contributes
    to its strengthening and development. At the same time, the former has an older
    record, being one of the first use cases of non-financial blockchain/DLT applications.
    To compare these three DLTs strictly from a technological standpoint, see the
    study of Garriga et al. [6] instead, and the study of Dalla Palma et al. [23].
    5.1.1. Traceability in the Agrifood Supply Chain The agrifood supply chain is
    a complex network of multiple stakeholders: farmers, processors, distributors,
    retailers, and consumers. Each stakeholder has its record-keeping system, which
    may not be compatible or transparent to others. This creates challenges in ensuring
    food products’ origin, quality, and safety and meeting local and international
    regulations. DLTs can help overcome these challenges by providing a shared and
    immutable ledger of transactions and data throughout the production process. Ethereum
    and Hyperledger Fabric, the most popular blockchain platform from the Hyperledger
    software ecosystem, are traditional blockchains supporting traceability in the
    agrifood supply chain. Ethereum is a public blockchain that allows anyone to join
    and participate in the network. It supports smart contracts, i.e., self-executing
    agreements written in code that can automate supply chain processes and ensure
    traceability. Fabric is a private blockchain that allows only authorized participants
    to join and transact on the network. It supports private transactions and complex
    supply chain permissions that can handle sensitive data and comply with regulations.
    Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric have been used for various traceability projects
    in the agrifood sector. For instance, IBM Food Trust (https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/solutions/food-trust,
    accessed on 7 October 2023) is a platform built on Fabric that connects farmers,
    processors, distributors, and retailers to share data and track food products
    from farm to fork. Similarly, OriginTrail (https://origintrail.io/, accessed on
    7 October 2023) is a protocol built on Ethereum that enables interoperable data
    exchange and verification across different supply chain actors. The articles by
    Cocco et al. [24] and Marchesi et al. [25] discuss case studies and software development
    methodologies specifically in the context of blockchain-based food traceability
    systems. 5.1.2. Blockchains vs. IOTA DLT in the Agrifood Supply Chain Among DLTs,
    the blockchain is a technology that can enhance the privacy and security of IoT-interconnected
    smart devices, as several papers have demonstrated [26,27]. The blockchain offers
    features such as transparency, immutability, resilience, and cryptography that
    can address some of the challenges of IoT network architecture. However, the blockchain
    also has a cost in terms of transaction fees and architectural complexity, requiring
    expertise from various disciplines. Therefore, the blockchain should manage valuable
    assets, such as business data and financial assets [28]. On the other hand, the
    IOTA Tangle is a DLT that can improve sustainability and agrifood monitoring without
    such costs, allowing agrifood supply chains to adopt it without affecting their
    business [29]. 5.1.3. Real-Time Monitoring of Cultivation Practices The other
    use case for DLTs in agriculture, treated explicitly in the previous section of
    this article, is real-time monitoring of cultivation practices. This involves
    using IoT sensors to collect various data from the field, such as soil moisture,
    temperature, humidity, pest infestation, and so on. These data can help farmers
    optimize their inputs, reduce their environmental impact, and improve their yields.
    However, IoT sensors generate huge amounts of data that must be transmitted and
    stored securely and efficiently. As we have seen, IOTA is a DLT that is designed
    for high-frequency IoT scenarios. Unlike traditional blockchains that use a linear
    chain of blocks to store data, IOTA uses a DAG called Tangle. The Tangle is composed
    of individual transactions that are interlinked to each other and stored across
    a network of nodes. To issue a transaction on the Tangle, a node has to validate
    two previous transactions. This allows IOTA to overcome the cost and scalability
    limitations of blockchains. As highlighted in the description of our study, IOTA
    has several advantages for real-time monitoring of cultivation practices. First,
    it enables zero-fee transactions, meaning nodes can send and receive data without
    paying fees. This is ideal for frequent, low-value data transmissions from IoT
    sensors. Second, it enables high scalability, meaning the network can handle many
    transactions per second without compromising performance or security. This is
    ideal for accommodating varying numbers of sensors and devices on the network.
    Third, it enables data integrity, which means that the data stored on the Tangle
    are tamper-proof and verifiable by anyone on the network. This is ideal for accurate
    decision-making based on real-time data. Our study offers a comprehensive guide
    for building an IOTA-based real-time monitoring system tailored for sustainable
    agriculture. In this context, it complements Future Farm (https://future-farm.iota.org/#/,
    accessed on 7 October 2023), an initiative by the IOTA Foundation that also leverages
    IOTA for data collection and analysis through IoT sensors in greenhouses. While
    Future Farm focuses on process optimization—emphasizing the sharing of IoT data
    among various stakeholders in agriculture—our approach is more user-centric. Specifically,
    we demonstrate how a farm operator can effectively utilize the IOTA Tangle for
    real-time monitoring. 5.1.4. Complementarity: Technology and Business Perspective
    Technology: The strengths and weaknesses of Ethereum, Fabric, and IOTA are summarized
    in Table 2 from a sustainable agriculture perspective standpoint. While Ethereum
    and Fabric cater to supply chain transparency and notarization of product origin
    and quality, IOTA is tailored for high-frequency IoT data transactions. However,
    these DLTs are not mutually exclusive. They can be integrated and interoperable,
    offering a comprehensive view of the agrifood sector. For example, IOTA’s real-time
    data can be linked to Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric’s smart contracts, triggering
    actions or payments based on predefined conditions. Alternatively, IOTA’s data
    streams can be hashed and anchored to Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric’s blockchains,
    creating a secure and verifiable record of the data history. These integrations
    can leverage the best features of each DLT, creating a synergistic effect. Table
    2. Comparison of DLTs in agriculture: Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and IOTA.
    Business: DLTs offer different value propositions for the agrifood sector depending
    on their use cases and applications. While traceability emphasizes transparency,
    notarization, and compliance, real-time monitoring targets operational efficiency
    and sustainability. These value propositions can have various implications for
    market differentiation and consumer engagement. For instance, traceability can
    bolster branding and product authenticity, creating a competitive edge in the
    market. Traceability can also assure consumers about product origin and quality,
    increasing their trust and loyalty. On the other hand, real-time monitoring can
    lead to sustainable practices and cost savings, improving the business’s bottom
    line. Real-time monitoring can also offer insights into sustainable cultivation
    practices, educating consumers and raising awareness. Enriched Business Value:
    Integrating DLTs in the agrifood sector can also create new opportunities for
    funding acquisition and carbon credit trading. These opportunities can provide
    financial incentives for adopting DLTs and promoting sustainable agriculture.
    For example, traceability and real-time monitoring can serve as evidence for quality
    manufacturing and sustainable cultivation practices. This can be pivotal for acquiring
    funding from government agencies or private investors that incentivize such practices.
    Moreover, integrating DLTs can facilitate the generation of carbon credits by
    validating sustainable practices. These credits can be traded as securities on
    DLT-based platforms, offering a new revenue stream for farmers and businesses.
    On the other hand, Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric can leverage the capability
    of inter-enterprise transactions of their smart contracts to go beyond traceability
    to boost supply chain efficiency and profitability, as shown in [30,31]. Summing
    up, Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and IOTA are three prominent DLTs that can revolutionize
    the agrifood sector. While they cater to different agrifood needs, their combined
    strengths can create a holistic solution that addresses the challenges and opportunities
    of the sector. By integrating them into suitable ecosystems as characterized in
    Salzano et al. [32], innovators can ignite a global business transformation that
    benefits farmers, businesses, consumers, and the environment. 5.2. Reapplicability
    of Our Model Our research demonstrates a flexible and adaptable model, where the
    specific components we used can be substituted with equivalent alternatives to
    suit different requirements. Database Management System Flexibility: While our
    study leverages the capabilities of MongoDB, the architecture of our model is
    not limited to this particular DBMS. The design is compatible with various other
    database management systems, enhancing the model’s applicability across diverse
    data management scenarios. Hardware Versatility: In terms of hardware, our choice
    of the Raspberry Pi 4 is illustrative rather than prescriptive. The model can
    be adapted to work with a range of single board computers or similar devices,
    provided they possess comparable technical capabilities. This flexibility ensures
    that our model can be deployed in a variety of hardware environments. Sensor Selection
    and Adaptability: We chose specific sensors for monitoring key parameters in the
    rice supply chain. However, this selection is not rigid. Different sensors can
    be employed based on the requirements of other agrifood products or supply chains.
    The adaptability of our model to various sensor types and data inputs underscores
    its potential for broader application in agriculture. Cross-Product and Supply
    Chain Applicability: While our Proof-of-Concept is centered on rice cultivation,
    the underlying model is designed to be transferable to other agrifood supply chains.
    This transferability is facilitated by the selection of appropriate sensors and
    the integration of various communication protocols. System and OS Compatibility
    through Containerization: Our model’s use of containerization technology ensures
    its portability and compatibility across different systems and operating systems.
    This aspect of the design significantly enhances the model’s utility and ease
    of deployment in diverse IT environments. In summary, the design of our study
    reflects a commitment to versatility and adaptability, allowing for the application
    of our model in a variety of agricultural contexts beyond its initial implementation.
    6. Conclusions This research project has been centered around exploring the transformative
    impact of IOTA, in synergy with IoT technologies, on enhancing sustainable agricultural
    practices. Our study specifically targeted the optimization of water-resource
    consumption in rice field irrigation, which is a critical aspect of sustainable
    agriculture. The core objective of our study was to meticulously monitor and improve
    resource utilization, with a particular emphasis on water efficiency. The results
    demonstrate that an intelligent irrigation system, powered by advanced sensor
    technology, can be instrumental in achieving sustainable cultivation practices.
    This system enables real-time data acquisition and analysis, which are pivotal
    in guiding empirical practices for resource optimization. Specifically, we observed
    the potential of this system to significantly reduce water usage by up to 50%,
    lower nitrogen consumption by 25%, and decrease methane emissions by 50% to 70%.
    A key aspect of our system is its ability to compile historical data on water
    usage, providing a rich dataset for strategizing future resource management approaches.
    The integration of IoT devices, particularly those managed through IOTA’s technology,
    has proven exceptionally effective in handling and analyzing large volumes of
    data, thereby boosting the overall efficiency and precision of agricultural processes.
    A notable accomplishment of this project was the seamless and rapid data transmission
    from the field (via Raspberry Pi) to the cloud. This was achieved with minimal
    latency, demonstrating the effectiveness of MQTT in data routing and the capacity
    of IOTA to provide near-real-time recording and optimal storage for extensive
    datasets. Despite some latency challenges encountered with MongoDB, it played
    a crucial role as an intermediary, facilitating effective communication and data
    management between IOTA and other integrated technologies. This integration was
    pivotal in enhancing data organization and processing speed. Looking ahead, future
    research could explore optimizing sensor sampling rates to make them more dynamic
    and responsive to environmental and inventory conditions. Additionally, adjusting
    the number of active sensors based on these parameters could enhance efficiency,
    allowing some IoT devices to enter a sleep mode when not needed, thus conserving
    energy. In conclusion, this research highlights the integral role of IOTA, particularly
    in tandem with the IoT, in the future of sustainable agriculture. IOTA emerges
    not just as one of many options, but as a particularly compelling choice for real-time
    monitoring and implementation of sustainable agricultural practices. Its application
    extends beyond mere data tracking to actively influencing and optimizing on-ground
    practices, aligning closely with the global goals of environmental conservation
    and food security. This study affirms that the synergy of IOTA and IoT is not
    just a computational marvel but a practical tool for empirical advancements in
    agriculture. Author Contributions Conceptualization, R.P. and R.C.; methodology,

    Learning Introduction Sub-Saharan Africa is a region whose agriculture is heavily
    reliant on unpredictable rainfall. According to the FAO, the total area of land
    under irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa was estimated at 7 million hectares in
    2020, representing only 5 % of the region''s arable land [1], [2], [3]. Globally
    freshwater resources are limited and unevenly distributed, with many regions experiencing
    physical and economic water scarcity (UN [4]). Despite the ongoing challenges
    related to water scarcity, there are global developments in irrigation that hold
    promise for enhancing agricultural productivity and building resilience against
    the impacts of climate change [[5], [6], [7], [8],4]. The world is currently witnessing
    the fourth industrial revolution, characterized by the integration of emerging
    technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, the Internet of
    Things (IoT), Big Data Technology, Drones, Robots and 3D printing [9,10]. The
    use of these modern intelligent technologies in irrigation is emerging in sub-Saharan
    Africa and is set to transform farming by allowing smart and precise irrigation
    [11,12]. For instance, IoT sensors can be used to monitor soil moisture levels
    and automatically adjust irrigation to optimize water use efficiency, whereas
    AI applications can predict weather patterns and optimize irrigation scheduling.
    To enhance water-use efficiency and contribute to Sustainable Development Goals
    (SDGs), particularly Goal 6 and Target 6.4, it is essential to implement innovation
    in irrigation systems. As such, there is a need for increased investment in irrigation
    infrastructure and adoption of modern intelligent technologies to ensure sustainable
    irrigation practices in sub-Saharan Africa. The importance of smart irrigation
    cannot be overstated in today''s world, where climate change is affecting global
    freshwater resources and increasing water scarcity. Manual irrigation of crops
    is not only time-consuming but also inefficient, while irrigation based on fixed
    timers does not account for changes in weather or soil conditions that affect
    moisture levels [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. Smart irrigation systems take into
    account weather and soil conditions to optimize irrigation, resulting in significant
    water savings of up to 30 percent [18], [19], [20], [21]. As a result, smart irrigation
    has emerged as a more effective and sustainable approach in irrigated agriculture.
    The essence of smart irrigation lies in its conceptual framework, which amalgamates
    technology and agricultural practices to optimize water use efficiency. This framework
    revolves around several key components. Sensors and monitoring systems, ranging
    from soil moisture sensors to weather instruments, gather real-time data on variables
    critical to irrigation decisions. This data is then subjected to analysis using
    cutting-edge approaches like artificial intelligence and machine learning models,
    providing insights that inform irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop
    management. The actual irrigation is optimized through precision delivery mechanisms
    like drip irrigation, which directs water directly to plant root zones, minimizing
    losses through evaporation and runoff [22]. Automation and control mechanisms
    enable real-time adjustments based on collected data, enhancing the efficiency
    of irrigation practices. The integration of these components is facilitated by
    the connectivity and communication capabilities of the IoT, enabling seamless
    data exchange, remote monitoring, and control of irrigation systems [13]. Central
    to the smart irrigation discourse is the concept of Water Use Efficiency (WUE)
    in agriculture. WUE measures the ratio of agricultural output to the amount of
    water used for productively by the plant [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]. Smart
    irrigation systems have the potential to enhance WUE significantly by tailoring
    irrigation schedules to crop water requirements [29,30,23,31,[24], [25], [26],
    [27], [28]]. Leveraging real-time data on factors like soil moisture, weather
    conditions, and plant stress, these systems enable precise irrigation, optimizing
    both water use and crop growth. The incorporation of 4IR technologies further
    enhances WUE by enabling accurate predictions of water demand. AI algorithms analyze
    historical data and environmental factors to forecast crop water needs, ensuring
    timely irrigation application. This predictive ability, combined with real-time
    weather monitoring, empowers farmers to adapt irrigation schedules proactively,
    thus optimizing water use efficiency. Despite various studies investigating irrigation
    technologies and practices, a significant research gap persists regarding the
    effective integration of 4IR technologies into smart irrigation systems. Recent
    systematic literature reviews have focused on the applications of 4IR in other
    domains like manufacturing, health, transport, fashion, labor force among others
    [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43]. Therefore,
    the primary objective of this systematic review paper was to examine the role
    of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation and their potential applications in the
    context of sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, the review aimed to: a) explore the
    utilization of AI in irrigation systems for precision irrigation, water demand
    prediction, crop yield estimation, and soil moisture management; b) investigate
    the role of IoT and Drone Technology in generating and managing data for improved
    irrigation management practices; c) examine the potential applications of Blockchain
    and Machine Learning in irrigation, particularly in data management and decision-making
    processes; and d) identify the constraints, challenges, and opportunities associated
    with leveraging 4IR technologies in smart irrigation within the context of sub-Saharan
    Africa. This paper provides insights for researchers, decision-makers, and practitioners
    interested in enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of irrigation practices
    in sub-Saharan Africa. Research methodology A systematic review approach was used
    to gather relevant literature and research studies on the extent of integration
    of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation. The approach used in this study (Fig.
    1) followed well-defined steps, known as the PRISMA approach [44,45]. Multiple
    academic databases, including PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, Google Scholar,
    and Web of Science were searched for relevant research articles published in the
    past decade. The literature search was conducted between 27th to 31st August 2023.
    Keywords used for the search included \"Smart Irrigation,\" \"Fourth Industrial
    Revolution,\" \"Artificial Intelligence,\" \"Internet of Things,\" \"Big Data,\"
    \"Blockchain,\" \"Machine Learning,\" \"Drone Technology,\". The inclusion criteria

    and sustaining growing populations. In this section, we explored the evolution
    of irrigation technology from the Industrial Revolution 1.0 to 4.0 and the timelines,
    showcasing the remarkable advancements that revolutionized the way water was harnessed
    and distributed for agricultural purposes. The first Industrial Revolution, starting
    in the late 18th century, witnessed the emergence of steam power as a primary
    driving force [47]. This technological breakthrough led to advancements in irrigation
    systems. Steam-powered pumps and engines were introduced [48], enabling the lifting
    of water from rivers and reservoirs to higher elevations. Canal systems were developed
    to transport water efficiently across vast distances, promoting agricultural expansion
    and increasing crop yields [49]. The second Industrial Revolution, characterized
    by the widespread adoption of electricity and mass production techniques [50],
    had a profound impact on irrigation technology. Electrical pumps and motors replaced
    steam-powered machinery, providing more reliable and efficient water delivery.
    Farmers gained greater control over irrigation schedules, leading to improved
    water management, and increased agricultural output [51]. Electric-powered sprinkler
    systems and drip irrigation methods were introduced, optimizing water distribution,
    and minimizing waste. With the advent of the third Industrial Revolution, automation
    and computerization revolutionized irrigation technology [52]. The integration
    of sensors, data analytics, and computer systems into irrigation infrastructure
    enabled precise monitoring and control of water usage. Automated irrigation systems
    adjusted water flow based on soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and plant
    requirements, ensuring optimal irrigation while conserving water resources. This
    era witnessed the emergence of smart irrigation technologies, empowering farmers
    with real-time data and insights for efficient decision-making [53]. The ongoing
    fourth Industrial Revolution, characterized by digitalization and the IoT [54],
    is transforming irrigation technology in unprecedented ways. Advanced sensor networks,
    drones, and satellite imagery are utilized to monitor soil conditions, water availability,
    and plant health with exceptional precision. Machine learning algorithms analyze
    vast amounts of data, providing predictive insights to optimize irrigation strategies
    and maximize crop productivity. Smart irrigation systems, integrated with AI-driven
    controllers, remotely manage water distribution, reducing water waste and enabling
    sustainable agricultural practices. Fig. 5 summarizes the remarkable industrial

    [54]. Fourth industrial revolution technologies for smart irrigation In 2011,
    the German government unveiled a novel concept known as \"Industry 4.0″ during
    a trade fair. This initiative primarily aims to enhance collaboration among individuals,
    machinery, and resources [55]. At its core, Industry 4.0 revolves around the idea
    of bridging the gap between the physical and virtual realms [56]. It establishes
    connections among machines, functions, and systems through intelligent networks
    that span the entire value chain, allowing them to operate autonomously and interact
    with one another [57]. The term \"Industry 4.0″ refers to both partially and fully
    automated advanced manufacturing processes driven by technology, where equipment
    can communicate independently throughout the value chain [56]. This innovative
    concept encompasses various technologies such as digital manufacturing, network
    communication, computing, and automation, all integrated within the adaptable
    and intricate systems of Industry 4.0. The application of Fourth Industrial Revolution
    technologies in irrigation (Fig. 6) represents a significant leap forward in modern
    agriculture. This transformative era is marked by the convergence of digital,
    physical, and biological systems, and it brings with it a multitude of innovative
    tools and techniques that enhance irrigation practices. One of the key pillars
    of this revolution is the IoT, which involves embedding sensors and devices in
    irrigation systems to collect real-time data on soil moisture levels, weather
    conditions, and crop health. AI and machine learning algorithms then process this
    data to make precise and timely decisions regarding irrigation scheduling, optimizing
    water usage, and minimizing waste. Furthermore, drones equipped with advanced
    imaging technology are employed for aerial monitoring of fields, providing farmers
    with a comprehensive view of their crops and irrigation needs. Additionally, blockchain
    technology is being utilized to create transparent and secure systems for water
    resource management and supply chain tracking, ensuring the efficient distribution
    of water resources. These 4IR technologies collectively empower farmers with unprecedented
    control and insights into their irrigation practices, ultimately contributing
    to increased crop yields, resource conservation, and sustainable agricultural
    practices in an era of global environmental challenges. Download : Download high-res

    for smart irrigation. Artificial intelligence in smart irrigation AI refers to
    the ability of machines to learn and make decisions based on data [58]. AI plays
    a pivotal role in smart irrigation systems, enabling advanced analytics and decision-making
    capabilities [59]. AI algorithms can be used to analyze data on weather, soil
    moisture, and crop water requirements and to make automated decisions on irrigation
    scheduling [60]. This can improve the accuracy and efficiency of irrigation management
    and reduce the risk of over- or under-irrigation. AI enables farmers to collect,
    analyze, and interpret data on a large scale, allowing for more precise and accurate
    irrigation decisions [61]. AI can analyze large amounts of data and provide insights
    that can be used to optimize irrigation. For example, AI can analyze data on soil
    moisture levels, temperature, humidity, and crop growth patterns to identify the
    most efficient irrigation strategies for specific crops and soil types. Fig. 7

    image Fig. 7. Integration of AI in Smart Irrigation. Predictive modelling for
    water demand and crop yield AI-based predictive models for example neural networks,
    ensemble, regression, classification, and time series forecasting models are utilized
    to forecast water demand and crop yield based on historical data and environmental
    factors (Kuradusenge et al., 2023; [45]). Such models use historical data, weather
    patterns, and crop-specific information to estimate the irrigation requirements,
    facilitating efficient water allocation. Kuradusenge et al. (2023) used rainfall
    and temperature data analyzed through Random Forest, Polynomial Regression, and
    Support Vector Regressor to predict crop yield of Irish potato and maize. Random
    forest was recommended for early crop yield prediction of potatoes and maize (Kuradusenge
    et al., 2023). AI algorithms are employed to analyze real-time data from soil
    moisture sensors and determine the optimal irrigation timing and volume [62].
    By continuously monitoring soil moisture levels, smart irrigation systems can
    ensure that crops receive adequate water while avoiding waterlogging and excessive
    runoff [63]. One example of the application of soil moisture monitoring and management
    in sub-Saharan Africa is a study done by (Wanyama et al., 2023). The authors have
    developed a cost-effective green technology intelligent irrigation control system
    kit that improves precise irrigation water application. This kit is a photovoltaic
    system that powers a water pump, a soil moisture sensor, and an Arduino microcontroller
    unit mounted on a moving frame. The soil moisture sensors were placed in the field
    and sent real-time soil moisture values to the microcontroller via a wired Universal
    Serial Bus (USB) communication channel. The microcontroller connected the water
    pump, the tank water level sensor, the soil moisture sensors, and the water tank
    outlet solenoid valve. Therefore, the system could schedule irrigation thus improving
    the traditional irrigation technology. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed
    in smart irrigation systems to analyze data patterns, make predictions, and optimize
    irrigation [64], [65], [66], [67]. ML algorithms learn from historical and real-time
    data, enabling adaptive decision-making and improving irrigation efficiency [68].
    Machine Learning algorithms can analyze historical data on weather, soil conditions,
    and crop performance to predict future irrigation requirements [62]. By providing
    accurate forecasts, ML-based predictive analytics support farmers in making informed
    decisions regarding irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop management.
    ML algorithms can be utilized to develop adaptive irrigation control systems that
    adjust irrigation parameters based on real-time data inputs [69,70]. These systems
    continuously monitor soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and plant water
    stress, allowing for dynamic irrigation control to optimize water use efficiency
    and crop productivity. The synergy between AI and smart irrigation is transformative,
    offering data-driven insights and automation for efficient water management. AI
    processes copious data from sensors, weather forecasts, and soil conditions to
    optimize irrigation schedules. ML models are trained on historical data and environmental
    cues to predict crop water requirements. Table 3 summarizes other applications
    using AI in irrigation operations. In another study, Ikudayisi et al. [71] conducted
    research focused on managing crop water requirements at the Winterton irrigation
    scheme in South Africa, aiming to address the challenges posed by water scarcity
    and its impact on agricultural efficiency. To achieve their objectives, the researchers
    employed a combined approach involving artificial intelligence, namely an artificial
    neural network (ANN), and a crop growth simulation model. The study aimed to estimate
    various aspects of crop irrigation water requirements, including the crop-water
    demand from planting to harvest, the timing of irrigation, the optimal stage in
    the drying cycle for water application, and the volume of irrigation water to
    be applied. Five feed-forward backward propagation ANN predictive models with
    varying configurations were developed and assessed. The optimal ANN model, characterized
    by 5 inputs, 5 neurons, 1 hidden layer, and 1 output, was employed to predict
    monthly reference evapotranspiration (ETo) in the Winterton region. This optimal
    ANN model demonstrated a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.67, a Pearson correlation
    coefficient (r) of 0.97, and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.94. The
    validation of the model revealed a correlation (r) value of 0.9048 between the
    measured and predicted ETo values. Table 3 summarizes other applications using
    AI in irrigation operations. Table 2 Table 2. Artificial intelligence applications

    irrigation efficiency. Furrow and drip irrigation [75] Demonstrated AI modelling
    for optimizing green roof irrigation by adapting watering schedules based on evolving
    environmental conditions. Sprinkler irrigation [76] Utilized AI to estimate drip
    tape irrigation discharge using temperature and pressure data, enhancing water
    use efficiency in drip irrigation systems. Drip tape irrigation Table 3. Applications
    of IoT in irrigation. Reference IoT Usage Findings Summary [86] IoT infrastructure

    regulation of agro-hydrological systems using zone model predictive control. Proposed
    an IoT-based approach for regulating agro-hydrological systems using zone model
    predictive control. Enhanced irrigation management for crop growth. Internet of
    Things in smart irrigation IoT refers to the network of devices, sensors, and
    machines that are connected to the internet and can exchange data with each other
    [77]. In smart irrigation systems, IoT devices such as sensors and controllers
    can be used to collect and transmit data on weather, soil moisture, and crop water
    requirements. This data can be processed and analyzed in real-time to adjust irrigation
    schedules and optimize water use. IoT plays a crucial role in collecting and transmitting
    data in smart irrigation systems [78,79]. IoT sensors and devices are deployed
    throughout the irrigation infrastructure to monitor various parameters and facilitate
    data-driven decision-making. connectivity. In IoT applications, connectivity between
    gateways, remote clouds, and users is typically over broadband communication networks.
    However, in most of sub-Saharan Africa''s rural countries, broadband connectivity
    is either very expensive or non-existent. Affordable broadband technologies like
    TVWS have been tested in South Africa and around the world and can provide both
    backhaul and last-mile wireless connectivity for remotely deployed agricultural
    IoT-based systems in various locations [80] Data generation and collection through
    IoT sensors IoT sensors, such as soil moisture sensors, weather stations, and
    flow meters, collect real-time data on soil moisture, temperature, humidity, rainfall,
    and water flow [81,82]. These sensors provide a continuous stream of information,
    enabling farmers to make informed decisions regarding irrigation management. Nigussie
    et al. (2020) proposed an IoT-based irrigation management system for smallholder
    farmers in South Africa, Kenya, and Ethiopia`s rural areas. Sensors in the system
    detect soil conditions (moisture, temperature, nutrients, and pH) and provide
    data on the water level in the storage as well as microclimate conditions. The
    actuators in this system direct the flow of water to the farm via sprinklers,
    pumps, valves, and water gates. The IoT network connectivity technology used in
    this system was Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN). This is because LoRaWAN
    is a fully open standard solution with no subscription fee, making it less expensive
    for IoT connectivity devices, and it is well-suited for long-distance. Cloud computing
    for data management and analysis Cloud computing has emerged as a revolutionary
    technology that can transform the way we manage and optimize irrigation systems.
    Cloud computing platforms are utilized to store and process the vast amount of
    data generated by IoT sensors in smart irrigation systems [83]. Cloud-based solutions
    provide scalable storage, computational power, and data analytics capabilities,
    allowing for efficient data management and analysis, [84]. One of the key benefits
    of cloud computing in smart irrigation is the ability to store and process large
    amounts of data in a centralized location. This allows farmers to easily access
    and analyze data on things like soil moisture levels, weather patterns, and crop
    health, which can help them make more informed decisions about irrigation. With
    data driven irrigation optimization, farmers can reduce water waste and ensure
    that water is used only when and where it is needed, leading to improved water
    use efficiency. In sub-Saharan Africa, cloud services create additional running
    costs for irrigation management systems. To address these issues, the most commonly
    proposed IoT architectures typically provide local processing and storage in gateways
    created for data processing, network management, irrigation decisions, and communication
    with farmers. This avoids the need for broadband networks and cloud services (backend
    servers) [80]. Maitethia et al. [85] executed a groundbreaking IoT smart irrigation
    system in Kenya, setting a remarkable precedent for precision agriculture in Africa.
    By integrating a network of sensors, weather stations, and cloud-based analytics,
    their pioneering initiative ushered in a new era of data-driven irrigation management.
    The remarkable outcomes encompassed substantial crop yield improvements, significant
    water conservation, substantial cost reductions, and enhanced climate resilience,
    ultimately bolstering food security and elevating the socioeconomic status of
    local farmers. Although initial investments and the need for comprehensive technical
    training posed initial challenges, the unparalleled potential of IoT-driven smart
    irrigation holds the promise of fostering a sustainable and prosperous future
    for African agriculture. Table 4 presents other applications of IoT in irrigation.
    Big data technology in smart irrigation Big Data Technology plays a significant
    role in unlocking the potential of data in smart irrigation systems [94]. By harnessing
    large volumes of data, valuable insights can be gained to optimize irrigation
    management practices. Big data analytics involves the use of advanced analytical
    techniques to extract insights from large and complex datasets. In smart irrigation
    systems, big data analytics can be used to analyze data on weather, soil moisture,
    and crop water requirements and to identify patterns and trends that can inform
    irrigation management. Big data refers to large and complex data sets that cannot
    be processed using traditional data processing techniques. In the context of precision
    irrigation, big data can be used to analyze large volumes of data on weather patterns,
    soil moisture levels, crop water requirements, and other factors that affect irrigation
    needs. Big Data analytics techniques are applied to historical and real-time data
    to identify patterns, trends, and correlations related to irrigation and crop
    performance [95]. This enables farmers to make data-driven decisions regarding
    irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop management. Rabhi et al. [96]
    explored the application of big data analytics in the context of smart irrigation,
    with a specific focus on digital agriculture in Morocco. Their research aimed
    to leverage big data analytics to enhance predictive irrigation techniques. They
    noted the growing importance of intelligent agriculture, characterized by widespread
    adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) analysis solutions, which has led to more
    precise irrigation scheduling. The research took place utilizing an irrigation
    dataset that considered moisture and temperature factors. To analyze this dataset,
    the authors employed neural network (NN) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms.
    The computational aspect of their study was conducted using the big data platform
    \"databricks,\" which implements the Spark framework for processing large datasets.
    The results from their models were promising, with SVM achieving an accuracy of
    97.00 % and NN reaching an accuracy of 98.50 %. In their future work, the authors
    intend to expand upon the 19,440 enterprise metamodel, introducing additional
    constructs related to advanced technologies such as big data analytics tools,
    IoT, AI, cloud computing, and machine learning. This extended metamodel is envisioned
    to be applied in the context of a smart farm, aligning with the principles of
    Agriculture 4.0. The use of Big Data in smart irrigation systems raises concerns
    about data privacy and security [97]. Safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring
    secure data transmission and storage are essential to maintain trust and protect
    the integrity of smart irrigation systems. Blockchain technology for managing
    big data in irrigation Blockchain technology offers a decentralized and transparent
    framework for managing and securing data in smart irrigation systems [95]. It
    provides an immutable ledger that records and verifies data transactions, ensuring
    data integrity and enabling trusted collaborations. Blockchain technology offers
    a decentralized and transparent framework for managing and securing data in smart
    irrigation systems [98]. By leveraging Blockchain, data can be stored and managed
    in a distributed manner across multiple nodes, eliminating the need for a central
    authority [99]. In smart irrigation, Blockchain can provide an immutable ledger
    that records and verifies data transactions related to water usage, irrigation
    practices, and resource management. Each data transaction is cryptographically
    linked to the previous transaction, creating a chain of blocks that ensures data
    integrity and transparency. By utilizing Blockchain for data management, smart
    irrigation systems can enhance trust and accountability in water governance [100].
    All stakeholders, including farmers, water authorities, and researchers, can access
    and verify the data recorded on the Blockchain, enabling transparent and auditable
    irrigation practices. The decentralized nature of Blockchain also mitigates the
    risks of data tampering and unauthorized modifications. Since data is stored across
    multiple nodes in the network, any attempt to alter the data would require consensus
    from a majority of nodes, making it highly secure and resistant to fraud or manipulation
    [101,102]. Moreover, Blockchain can facilitate trusted collaborations and data
    sharing among stakeholders in the irrigation ecosystem. Smart contracts, which
    are self-executing agreements coded on the Blockchain, can automate and enforce
    rules and conditions related to water allocation, usage rights, and payment systems
    [103]. These smart contracts enhance transparency and efficiency in irrigation
    governance, reducing the reliance on intermediaries and streamlining administrative
    processes. However, the adoption of Blockchain in smart irrigation systems comes
    with challenges. The scalability and energy consumption of Blockchain networks,
    especially in resource-constrained environments, need to be addressed. Additionally,
    ensuring data privacy while maintaining transparency is crucial, as sensitive
    information may be recorded on the Blockchain. Despite these challenges, Blockchain
    technology shows promising potential in revolutionizing data management and governance
    in smart irrigation systems. Further research and pilot projects are needed to
    explore the practical implementation and scalability of Blockchain solutions in
    the context of sub-Saharan Africa. Blockchain''s smart contract functionality
    can be leveraged to automate and enforce irrigation governance rules [104]. Smart
    contracts enable the execution of predefined rules and conditions related to water
    allocation, usage rights, and payment systems. This enhances transparency, reduces
    disputes, and ensures fair and accountable irrigation practices. Drone technology
    in smart irrigation Drone technology has emerged as a promising tool for enhancing
    smart irrigation practices in various agricultural contexts. Drones, also known
    as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), offer unique capabilities for remote sensing,
    high-resolution data collection, and precision irrigation management. Drones equipped
    with advanced sensors and imaging systems enable remote sensing and high-resolution
    data collection in agricultural landscapes [105,103,106]. These sensors capture
    data on various parameters, including soil moisture, vegetation indices, temperature,
    and crop health. The collected data provides valuable insights into the spatial
    variability of soil and crop conditions, allowing for targeted irrigation interventions.
    In Kenya, certain farmers have embraced innovative approaches such as employing
    near-infrared cameras affixed to drones for pest and disease identification, among
    other applications. Additionally, within the Kenyan context, there exists a beta-stage
    AI tool named Nuru, accessible on Android devices with or without internet connectivity
    [107]. This advanced technology specializes in the diagnosis of crop diseases,
    with a particular focus on identifying mite and viral infections in cassava and
    detecting armyworm infestations in maize. KDHI Agriculture reports that a substantial
    number of cassava farmers, approximately 28,000, have already reaped the benefits
    of this tool''s implementation. One of the key applications of drone technology
    in smart irrigation is the monitoring of soil moisture levels [108]. Drones equipped
    with specialized sensors can capture near infrared and thermal imagery to assess
    soil moisture content across fields. This information helps farmers understand
    the spatial distribution of moisture and make informed decisions on irrigation
    scheduling and water allocation. In addition to monitoring soil moisture, drones
    can assess crop health and water use efficiency through multispectral and thermal
    imaging [109,108]. By analyzing vegetation indices and thermal patterns, drones
    can identify areas of stress, disease outbreaks, or water stress in crops. This
    data aids in targeted irrigation interventions, optimizing water use, and maximizing
    crop productivity. Drone technology enables precision irrigation by providing
    real-time and site-specific information for irrigation management [110]. With
    the collected data on soil moisture, crop health, and water use efficiency, farmers
    can determine the optimal irrigation needs of different areas within a field.
    This enables precise water application, minimizing water wastage and ensuring
    efficient water use. Constraints in leveraging 4IR technologies for smart irrigation
    in sub-saharan africa Infrastructure limitations and access to technology One
    of the significant constraints in leveraging Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies
    for smart irrigation in Sub-Saharan Africa is the limited infrastructure and lack
    of access to technology [111,112]. Many rural areas in the region lack reliable
    electricity supply, internet connectivity, and adequate communication networks
    necessary for the seamless functioning of smart irrigation systems. The absence
    of basic infrastructure hampers the deployment and operation of advanced technologies
    such as sensors, IoT devices, and cloud computing platforms. Additionally, the
    high cost of technology acquisition and maintenance further restricts the access
    and adoption of 4IR solutions for smart irrigation in the region. Governance and
    policy challenges Governance and policy challenges pose significant obstacles
    to the effective utilization of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation in sub-Saharan
    Africa [111,113,114]. Fragmented regulatory frameworks, and a lack of coordination
    among different stakeholders hinder the integration of these technologies into
    existing irrigation systems. The absence of clear guidelines on data management,
    privacy, and security also creates uncertainties and inhibits the widespread adoption
    of 4IR technologies. It is crucial to establish comprehensive governance frameworks
    and supportive policies that address data governance, privacy concerns, interoperability
    standards, and institutional coordination to facilitate the successful implementation
    of smart irrigation systems. Regulatory frameworks and safety Considerations regarding
    the use of drones need to be established to ensure safe and responsible operations
    [115]. Compliance with airspace regulations, privacy concerns, and licensing requirements
    are crucial aspects that need to be addressed. Developing appropriate guidelines
    and training programs can help farmers navigate these regulatory challenges and
    ensure the safe integration of drones in irrigation practices. Financial constraints
    and investment requirements The adoption of 4IR technologies for smart irrigation
    requires significant financial investment, which presents a considerable constraint
    in Sub-Saharan Africa [116,112]. The high initial cost of acquiring and deploying
    technologies such as sensors, drones, IoT devices, and data analytics platforms
    can be a deterrent for smallholder farmers and resource-constrained agricultural
    enterprises [117]. Limited access to financing and the absence of appropriate
    financial mechanisms further impedes the adoption of 4IR technologies. Overcoming
    financial constraints necessitates the exploration of innovative financing models,
    public-private partnerships, and targeted investment strategies to make these
    technologies more affordable and accessible to farmers in the region. Lack of
    capacity building and skills development The lack of technical skills and knowledge
    among farmers, extension workers, and other stakeholders is a significant constraint
    in leveraging 4IR technologies for smart irrigation [84,118]. The successful implementation
    and operation of smart irrigation systems requires capacity building initiatives
    to enhance the understanding, operation, and maintenance of these technologies
    [119,120]. Training programs and awareness campaigns are essential to equip farmers
    and relevant personnel with the necessary skills in data management, analytics,
    interpretation, and system operation. Additionally, fostering collaboration between
    academia, research institutions, and extension services can facilitate knowledge
    transfer and skill development, addressing the capacity gaps and promoting the
    effective use of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation practices. Integration with
    existing agricultural practices Integrating drone technology into existing agricultural
    practices requires farmers to adapt their workflows and decision-making processes
    [119,97]. Farmers need to understand how to interpret drone-generated data and
    incorporate it into their irrigation management strategies. Extension services
    and farmer-to-farmer knowledge sharing platforms play a crucial role in facilitating
    this integration. Opportunities for leveraging 4IR technologies in smart irrigation
    Enhanced water use efficiency and crop yield optimization Leveraging 4IR technologies
    in smart irrigation presents significant opportunities for enhancing water use
    efficiency and optimizing crop yields [121,122]. Through the integration of sensors,
    AI algorithms, and real-time data monitoring, smart irrigation systems can precisely
    assess soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and crop water requirements.
    This data-driven approach enables farmers to apply water resources more efficiently,
    minimizing water wastage and maximizing crop productivity. By ensuring that irrigation
    is tailored to the specific needs of crops and adapting to changing environmental
    conditions, 4IR technologies can significantly contribute to sustainable water
    management and improved agricultural outcomes. Data-driven decision-making for
    improved irrigation practices The use of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation
    facilitates data-driven decision-making processes, enabling farmers to make informed
    choices regarding irrigation practices [121]. By collecting and analyzing large
    volumes of data from various sources, such as sensors, satellites, and weather
    stations, smart irrigation systems provide valuable insights into soil conditions,
    crop water requirements, and irrigation scheduling. This wealth of information
    empowers farmers to optimize irrigation strategies, adjust watering schedules,
    and apply the right amount of water at the right time, leading to improved water
    management and increased crop productivity. Data-driven decision-making also allows
    for proactive responses to changing climate patterns and helps mitigate the risks
    associated with water scarcity and climate variability. Precision irrigation and
    resource conservation Precision irrigation, made possible by 4IR technologies,
    offers the opportunity to precisely target water delivery to crops, thereby conserving
    water resources [121]. By utilizing data from sensors, drones, and satellite imagery,
    smart irrigation systems can identify variations in soil moisture levels, plant
    water stress, and water availability across different areas of the field. This
    information enables farmers to implement site-specific irrigation, providing water
    precisely where and when it is needed. As a result, water wastage is minimized,
    and the overall water use efficiency is significantly improved. Precision irrigation
    also contributes to reducing nutrient leaching, minimizing soil erosion, and optimizing
    fertilizer application, leading to more sustainable agricultural practices. Empowering
    smallholder farmers and rural communities 4IR technologies have the potential

    pool resources, and leverage each other''s strengths. Partnerships can facilitate
    the development and deployment of innovative solutions, foster research and development,
    and promote the exchange of best practices [126]. Additionally, collaboration
    between academia, industry, and government entities can contribute to the co-creation
    of technologies and the adaptation of existing solutions to the specific needs
    and contexts of sub-Saharan Africa. Capacity building initiatives and knowledge
    transfer Investing in capacity building initiatives and knowledge transfer is
    vital to overcome the challenges associated with the adoption of 4IR technologies
    in smart irrigation. Training programs, workshops, and demonstration sites should
    be established to enhance the technical skills and knowledge of farmers, extension
    workers, and other stakeholders. These initiatives should focus on building expertise
    in data management, analytics, technology operation, and maintenance [127,126].
    Additionally, knowledge transfer mechanisms, such as farmer field schools and
    extension services, can facilitate the dissemination of best practices and encourage
    the adoption of 4IR technologies at the grassroots level. Ensuring inclusivity
    and addressing equity concerns In leveraging 4IR technologies for smart irrigation,
    it is essential to ensure inclusivity and address equity concerns. Efforts should
    be made to bridge the digital divide and ensure that smallholder farmers, women
    farmers, and rural communities have equal access to these technologies. This can
    be achieved through initiatives that provide affordable and user-friendly technology
    solutions, promote gender-sensitive approaches, and address socio-economic disparities
    [128,129]. Furthermore, inclusive decision-making processes that involve all stakeholders
    and prioritize the needs and perspectives of marginalized groups can contribute
    to equitable outcomes and sustainable development. By implementing these recommendations,
    Sub-Sahara Africa can unlock the transformative potential of 4IR technologies
    in smart irrigation, leading to improved water use efficiency, increased crop
    yields, and sustainable agricultural practices. Conclusion The 4IR technologies
    hold great promise for transforming smart irrigation practices in the context
    of Sub-Saharan Africa. This review paper has examined the constraints, opportunities,
    and prospects associated with leveraging 4IR technologies in smart irrigation,
    highlighting their potential to enhance water use efficiency, optimize crop yields,
    and contribute to sustainable agricultural practices. The integration of 4IR technologies,
    including AI, IoT, Big Data Technology, Blockchain, Machine Learning, and Drone
    Technology, offers novel solutions to address the challenges faced by the agricultural
    sector in Sub-Saharan Africa. AI-driven predictive modeling can optimize irrigation
    by accurately predicting water demand, crop yield, and soil moisture levels. IoT
    devices enable real-time data collection, while cloud computing facilitates data
    storage, analysis, and decision-making. Big Data Technology provides valuable
    insights for improved irrigation management, while Blockchain offers decentralized
    data management and transparency. ML algorithms enhance the accuracy of predictive
    analytics and decision support systems. Drone technology allows for remote sensing

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Belagavi, India SECTION I. Introduction Contemporary
    farming practices exhibit increased efficiency in agricultural development compared
    to earlier periods. The early indications of significant transformations in daily
    life and agricultural supply chains are becoming evident, particularly in the
    networks for food, fiber, and bio-energy distribution. This article delves into
    the current state of industrial agriculture, drawing insights from patterns at
    the farm level, production techniques, and agri-food supply within the industrialized
    context. To realize Agriculture 4.0, we explore the integration of artificial
    intelligence, big data, and blockchain. Our proposed approach facilitates the
    continuous monitoring and management of agricultural operations via remote observation,
    underpinned by IoT, AI, and related technologies. The article hones in on key
    research challenges and applications of these emerging technologies in the agriculture
    sector, aimed at introducing novel research opportunities to industry professionals.
    Anticipating the development of foundational IoT and technological tools for agricultural
    production, we envision a future characterized by interconnected, dependable,
    and productive agriculture [1]. Traditionally, predicting crop yields was a task
    undertaken by farmers who relied on their personal experience and knowledge of
    the specific field and crop cultivation and disease identification [17], [18].
    Nevertheless, the challenge of accurately forecasting agricultural crop prices
    persists, necessitating a more data-driven approach. This challenge can be effectively
    addressed through the utilization of statistical data analysis, pattern tracking,
    visualization techniques, and other data mining methods facilitated by computer
    applications. This study presents a comprehensive model for forecasting crop prices
    by leveraging the past decade''s worth of data on agricultural field crop prices
    and incorporating detailed weather information, including rainfall data. The objective
    of this research paper is to develop a robust framework for predicting future
    crop prices that takes into account various interdependent factors. By harnessing
    a decade''s worth of historical data on agricultural field crop prices and coupling
    it with pertinent weather data, a structured approach to classifying crop prices
    emerges. In summary, this research endeavor aims to provide an innovative solution
    to the complex challenge of forecasting crop prices. Through a meticulous analysis
    of historical agricultural field crop prices and the incorporation of relevant
    weather data, this model endeavors to empower farmers with valuable insights into
    future crop pricing trends [2]. Fig. 1 Rapid growth of agriculture. Show All Agriculture
    involves the application of modern data analysis techniques to enhance decision-making
    and crop management practices. This approach leverages various advanced technologies,
    including automated steering systems, Geomapping, remote sensing, satellite positioning
    systems, and variable rate technology. The overarching goal of precision agriculture
    is to incorporate automation into the agricultural domain. However, it remains
    crucial for farmers to acquaint themselves with these technological advancements.
    Overcoming these obstacles can lead to streamlined agricultural processes and
    improved outcomes. The rapid advancement of computational methods has opened doors
    to the integration of data mining principles in agriculture. This research paper
    seeks to shed light on both the merits and demerits of precision agriculture,
    thereby offering insights to guide its effective implementation. By addressing
    the challenges and benefits, this study aims to facilitate the progress of agricultural
    practices in the right direction [3]. Agriculture''s significance as a crucial
    foundation in China is unwavering, and the constant progress in science and technology
    has consistently been accessible to all. Enhancing the scientific precision and
    convenience of farming for a broader community through intelligent technology,
    while concurrently tackling challenges and predicaments in agricultural practices,
    remains an enduring concern deserving thoughtful consideration and practical action.
    This study''s objective is to establish an innovative paradigm within the agricultural
    landscape. By harnessing the structural framework of this emerging agricultural
    knowledge base, the aim is to establish a standardized and systematic repository
    of knowledge. This encompassing repository includes an extraction corpus for agricultural
    planting data, intended to be a vital resource during data mining and model creation.
    The ultimate aspiration is to offer an effective and specialized solution in the
    form of an extensive big data corpus for crop planting. This resource is poised
    to serve as a proficient catalyst for applications involving agricultural knowledge
    graphs [4]. In agricultural fields, predominantly situated in desert areas, face
    significant climatic impacts on both crops and workers. These expansive fields
    often lie far from residential zones, posing challenges for effective monitoring
    and management. To address these issues, this study introduces an innovative smart
    irrigation system employing Zigbee technology for wireless monitoring and control.
    The system takes into account crucial parameters such as temperature, humidity,
    moisture, and gas concentration. Real-time assessment of farm conditions occurs,
    prompting automated adjustments to irrigation and cooling systems. The acquired
    data is communicated wirelessly to farmers. A unique aspect of this research involves
    modeling the system as an Agent-based framework, portraying the dynamic state
    of the agricultural field. Practical implementation and testing took place on
    a small-scale farm, effectively tracking farm status, depicting system behavior,
    and promptly responding to abnormal data. Notably, the results indicate that the
    system''s implementation enhances crop quality, leading to increased production
    levels [5]. Fig. 2 presents the existing agricultural technologies and the models.
    Fig. 2 Agricultural technologies and models. Show All The Indian agricultural
    sector has symbolized rural development movements such as the green, yellow, white,
    and blue revolutions. Serving as the driving force of the economy, a significant
    portion of the population is directly or indirectly engaged in farming. The overarching
    objective is to enhance both crop quality and quantity while optimizing labor
    input. The emergence of smart farming and the integration of the Internet of Things
    into agriculture are propelling a potential Third Green Revolution. Given the
    current circumstances, the adoption of smart agriculture has become an imperative.
    This research was conducted in the delta districts of Tamil Nadu, aiming to assess
    farmers'' characteristics and their knowledge regarding the adoption of smart
    agricultural practices. Furthermore, the study delved into identifying the significant
    challenges that farmers encounter when adopting smart agricultural techniques.
    Ultimately, the insights from this study can serve as valuable guidance for policymakers
    in comprehending farmers'' perceptions toward embracing smart agriculture. Enhancing
    the well-being of farmers not only benefits them individually but also contributes
    to the overall growth of the country [6]. SECTION II. Related Work With the continuous
    advancement of the Internet of Things, the realm of smart agriculture is undergoing
    a rapid evolution. Leveraging IoT-based solutions presents farmers with the opportunity
    to augment profits and decrease manual labor demands on their agricultural fields.
    Intelligent agricultural systems harness efficient, cost-effective sensors strategically
    positioned around crops and within fields, gathering real-time data on crop status
    and environmental factors. This data serves dual purposes: immediate decision-making
    and long-term planning for improved outcomes. However, there exist hurdles such
    as communication delays, bandwidth usage, sporadic internet connectivity in rural
    locales, and cost implications that warrant attention. This article delves into
    our ongoing endeavors concerning a three-tier smart agriculture system founded
    on LoRa technology: (i) Sensing, (ii) Fog, and (iii) Cloud layers. Our primary
    focus lies in harnessing LoRa''s characteristics of low-power consumption and
    extended range to convert traditional rural Indian farmlands into hubs of intelligent
    agriculture. This initiative holds the potential to revolutionize agriculture
    in rural settings, aligning with the broader global trend driven smart agriculture
    while being tailored to address the specific challenges faced by Indian farmers.
    [7]. This study takes a focused approach towards leveraging technology to forecast
    fertilizer requirements, thereby amplifying crop yields and financial gains. The
    task of fertilizer prediction, a cornerstone of agriculture, involves the intricate
    determination of the most suitable type and optimal amount of fertilizers for
    specific crops. Despite its pivotal role, this task presents formidable challenges,
    directly impacting both crop yields and the overarching goal of environmental
    sustainability. To transcend these challenges, the research harnesses the Random
    Forest machine learning technique, selected for its demonstrated superiority in
    accuracy when compared to methods like linear regression and K-Nearest Neighbours.
    By assimilating historical conditions and insights from farmers through Kaggle
    datasets, this study establishes a predictive framework capable of suggesting
    appropriate fertilizers based on a comprehensive analysis of environmental, soil,
    and plant-related factors. As a result, the research contributes significantly
    to the realm of fertilization strategy forecasting, tailored to the unique conditions
    encompassing each agricultural scenario. In the larger context, this undertaking
    exemplifies the marriage of traditional agricultural wisdom with cutting-edge
    technology, promising a future where precision agriculture thrives and yields
    are maximized in harmony with ecological sustainability [8]. This research delves
    into the realm of smart agriculture powered by Internet of Things technologies,
    which have significantly transformed conventional farming methods. The infusion
    of sensors and devices into the agricultural landscape has generated copious amounts
    of data, driving the need for effective data management and transfer due to challenges
    in data volume and storage. The study''s primary objective is to examine and contrast
    diverse data reduction methods aimed at optimizing IoT data transmission within
    smart agriculture. The evaluation of these techniques employs a specialized real-time
    dataset tailored for smart agricultural systems, encompassing five key features:
    ambient air temperature, ambient air moisture, soil temperature, soil moisture,
    and soil pH. The assessment of the techniques is based on three core metrics:
    information loss, computational cost, and energy consumption, while factoring
    in the size of each transmitted sample. The implementation of the three data reduction
    methods is realized using the Python programming language. The findings emphasize
    the existence of a delicate balance between information loss, computational expenditure,
    and energy usage, warranting meticulous consideration when selecting an appropriate
    data reduction technique for IoT nodes in the context of smart agriculture applications.
    This analysis furnishes valuable insights for informed decision-making that effectively
    balances these factors, duly accounting for distinct application prerequisites
    and constraints [9]. Precision agriculture deploys sensors to monitor vital environmental
    factors like temperature, humidity, and water levels. Despite infrequent update
    needs for these attributes, sensors continuously transmit data, causing significant
    redundancy. This inefficiency wastes network resources and unnecessary energy.
    To tackle this, the LEACH routing protocol is introduced as a self-regulating,
    energy-efficient solution. Optimizing data aggregation, it aims to improve network
    efficiency and energy conservation. LEACH organizes sensor nodes into clusters
    with designated cluster heads that collect and summarize data before transmitting
    it to a central base station. This approach drastically reduces redundant data
    transmission, aided by the dynamic selection of cluster heads, which balances
    energy distribution among nodes. Traditional data aggregation methods directly
    transmit raw data to a central base station, causing redundancy and energy drain.
    In contrast, LEACH''s emphasis on aggregating data at its source mitigates network
    congestion and wasteful energy use. The study evaluates LEACH''s effectiveness
    against conventional data aggregation through energy efficiency, network durability,
    and data accuracy metrics. Simulations and empirical analysis provide insights
    into the protocol''s benefits and limitations across diverse scenarios. Overall,
    the LEACH protocol offers a promising solution to the challenge of redundant data
    transmission, contributing to energy-efficient precision agriculture [10]. In
    the contemporary era, the proliferation of IoT devices and emerging technologies
    has led to an exponential surge in data creation. Novel strategies are emerging
    to effectively manage such extensive data volumes. Leveraging this data to make
    informed decisions in agriculture, in tandem with the integration of smart agricultural
    techniques, holds the potential to revolutionize traditional farming practices.
    The efficacy of smart agriculture hinges on the seamless synchronization of diverse
    devices, where pivotal tasks include data retrieval, storage, and analysis. Traditional
    approaches, however, grapple with challenges such as data security, privacy concerns,
    real-time decision-making, and the handling of semi-structured and unstructured
    data when confronted with substantial data generation. In the realm of smart agriculture,
    Probabilistic Data Structures have emerged as a potent and efficient solution
    for managing data and facilitating real-time responses. This study is dedicated
    to thoroughly analyzing the implementation of PDS applications within the domain
    of smart agriculture. Delving into the foundations, challenges, unexplored research
    avenues, and potential trajectories of smart agriculture, this paper aims to comprehensively
    elucidate the role of PDS. It caters to readers and researchers eager to broaden
    their understanding of this domain and seeks to identify uncharted research opportunities
    within this evolving field [11], [12]. With the global population on the rise,
    the demand for increased crop production is becoming more pressing. Despite current
    efforts where farmers cater to global food requirements, challenges like dwindling
    horticultural space, resource depletion, and a growing population underscore the
    necessity to enhance agricultural yields. This has sparked the emergence of smart
    farming, a term encompassing a range of innovations by startups, technology pioneers,
    and governments aimed at bolstering overall crop output. SF involves integrating
    data, communication technologies, hardware, and sensors into agricultural systems
    to yield more insightful information. Detecting plant diseases efficiently using
    advanced algorithms becomes a crucial task in this context. The research paper
    addresses three key dimensions: firstly, an effective approach for disease detection
    and cavity area identification through the Image Segmentation Algorithm; secondly,
    the application of diverse data analysis methods tailored for improved crop management,
    including the use of an optical transducer for detecting Nitrogen, Phosphorous,
    and Potash levels in soil, as well as soil moisture content assessment through
    sensors; and thirdly, the utilization of machine learning algorithms to predict
    fertilizer quantities based on soil sample features, thereby aiding farmers in
    accurate amount estimation [13], [19], [20]. Drones, also recognized as unmanned
    aerial vehicles , have predominantly been linked with military and industrial
    functions. Nevertheless, recent strides in sensor and information technology have
    broadened their applications, encompassing sectors like agriculture. With the
    world''s population set to reach 9 billion by 2055, addressing the surge in agricultural
    demand is imperative. While agriculture holds immense promise, it grapples with
    multifaceted challenges—labor scarcity, erratic weather, inadequate fertilization,
    and health risks from chemicals and pests. Leveraging advanced technologies, particularly
    drones, holds the potential to tackle these hurdles. Drones play pivotal roles
    in irrigation, crop supervision, soil analysis, field evaluation, and pest management.
    Their evolution incorporates open-source solutions, advanced sensors, extended
    flight durations, and versatility in tasks spanning crime prevention to disaster
    monitoring. This research seeks to underscore the pivotal role of drones in agriculture
    and assess the finest drones available for crop and field monitoring. The objective
    is to elevate crop quality, forestall field deterioration, and foster sustainable
    agricultural practices. [14] New Agricultural Financial Entities encounter obstacles
    in their advancement due to financial constraints stemming from information disparities
    among financiers, limited collateral choices, and internal limitations. To mitigate
    these challenges, a pioneering strategy is put forth in this study. It harnesses
    the tamper-resistant and decentralized attributes of Blockchain technology in
    combination with the robust capabilities of Big Data for data mining, analysis,
    and processing. This inventive framework seeks to institute a reliable mechanism
    aimed at effectively tackling the financial barriers. By leveraging Blockchain''s
    transparency and data integrity, and utilizing Big Data''s analytical power, this
    approach intends to foster a secure and credible environment for financing transactions.
    The proposed solution addresses the lack of information symmetry by ensuring transparency
    and immutability of financial records through Blockchain. This empowers financiers
    alike with accurate and accessible information, reducing risks and enhancing trust.
    Furthermore, the integration of Big Data technology enhances risk assessment,
    enabling more informed lending decisions while expanding collateral options through
    comprehensive data analysis. Through this novel framework, can potentially access
    the funding they require, overcoming their financial impediments. By establishing
    a secure and efficient financing ecosystem, this approach aims to not only boost
    the progress contribute to the broader growth of the agricultural sector. As a
    result, this study''s innovative fusion of Blockchain and Big Data technologies
    presents a promising avenue for transforming the landscape of agricultural finance
    [15], [16]. SECTION III. Research Gap A significant challenge in the field of
    agriculture is the lack of integration and interconnectedness among various domains
    within the sector. This lack of synergy between different aspects of agriculture
    poses several drawbacks and limitations. Additionally, the slow adoption of advanced
    algorithms and combinational methods further compounds these challenges. Figure
    3 presents however, the isolation of these domains can lead to fragmented information
    and siloed decision-making. Farmers and stakeholders may lack a comprehensive
    view of their operations, making it difficult to optimize resource allocation
    and respond effectively to changing conditions. Without effective integration
    of agricultural domains, potential synergies between different aspects of farming
    remain untapped. For instance, if weather forecasts could be combined with soil
    data and crop growth patterns, farmers could make more informed decisions on irrigation
    and planting schedules. The absence of such interconnectedness hampers the ability
    to leverage valuable insights and seize opportunities for improved efficiency
    and productivity. Fig. 3. Interconnection of domains and revealing significance.
    Show All The lack of integrated data and algorithms contributes to inefficient
    resource management. For instance, fertilizers and pesticides might be applied
    uniformly across a field, regardless of variations in soil conditions or pest
    prevalence. This leads to unnecessary expenses, environmental impact, and reduced
    profitability. Sustainable agriculture requires careful consideration of environmental
    factors, resource use, and economic viability. Integrating algorithms and combinational
    methods could help identify optimal approaches for minimizing environmental impact
    while maintaining profitability. The absence of such integration could hinder
    the adoption of sustainable practices. Addressing these drawbacks necessitates
    a concerted effort to bridge the gaps between different agricultural domains and
    to accelerate the adoption of advanced algorithms and methods. Collaboration among
    researchers, technologists, policymakers, and farmers is essential to develop
    holistic solutions that optimize agricultural operations and contribute to a more
    resilient and sustainable future. SECTION IV. Proposed system Table 1 presents
    the gradations of disputes by incorporating Edge Computing into the IOT framework
    for climate determination in agriculture, we can leverage its advantages of real-time
    analysis, reduced data transmission, immediate responses, enhanced data privacy,
    scalability, and efficient handling of data volume. This innovative approach empowers
    farmers with actionable insights, enabling them to make informed decisions promptly
    and effectively manage climate conditions for optimal agricultural outcomes. Edge
    Computing is a paradigm that involves processing data closer to the data source,
    at the ''edge'' of the network, rather than sending all data to a centralized
    cloud server for analysis. In the context of agriculture and climate determination,
    this means that IOT devices equipped with sensors can process and analyse data
    locally, on-site, without the need to transmit all data to a distant cloud server.
    This reduces latency and enables faster decision-making. Table 2 presents the
    summary of various techniques especially Big Data analytics empowers stakeholders
    to make data-driven decisions by providing actionable insights based on comprehensive
    analyses. This can result in more informed market strategies and risk management.
    Probabilistic Data Structures might not offer the same level of data-driven decision
    support due to their limitations in handling complex, multidimensional data. In
    conclusion, while Probabilistic Data Structures have their place in specific data
    manipulation tasks, the intricate and multifaceted nature of Global Trade and
    Market Dynamics in agriculture benefits significantly from the capabilities of
    Big Data analytics. With its ability to handle comprehensive datasets, identify
    patterns, provide real-time insights, scale to accommodate growth, offer contextual
    understanding, and drive data-driven decisions, Big Data analytics stands as the
    preferred choice for efficiently determining global trade and market dynamics
    in agriculture. TABLE I. Comparison of several methods As compared with time taken

    CONCLUSION & FUTURE SCOPE In conclusion IoT-driven smart agriculture is revolutionizing
    the farming landscape, bolstering productivity and minimizing labor through the
    power of data-driven solutions. The seamless integration of real-time data capture
    and strategic sensor deployment empowers agile decision-making and strategic long-range

    1 Introduction The coffee production in Vietnam has developed as the world’s second
    biggest producer of coffee production and export for several decades. However,
    Vietnam coffee now faces several challenges, including the following ones: (1)
    climate change: the coffee production is heavily affected due to tropical storms,
    the worst droughts, rising temperatures, and shifting rainfall patterns. 50% of
    the current Robusta coffee production areas in Vietnam are forecasted to be lost
    by 2050; (2) low productivity, poor quality and high cost: caused by ground-water
    loss and soil pollution in most of the coffee planting regions. About 50% of total
    coffee trees are between 10 and 15 years old. Aging trees, unsuitable lands and
    no sustainable solution for growing coffee plants will directly affect the productivity,
    quality of Vietnamese coffee products, and production costs; (3) excessive use
    of fertilizing products and irrigations: causing coffee trees to quickly become
    exhausted and soil to be severely polluted, with more diseases and harmful pests
    for coffee trees; (4) poor collection, processing, and storage solution: causing
    low quality and unstable productions; (5) low sustainability and limited value-added
    coffee products: the value-added products and types from coffee are limited, and
    the coffee waste and ground are mainly sent to landfill, with no recycling; and
    (6) low applications of smart and sustainable agriculture solutions [1,2,3,4,5,6,7].
    Regards to the last challenge, there are limited applications of smart agriculture
    solutions to enhance the value streams of the coffee supply chain in Vietnam,
    including IoT, smart devices, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), precision agriculture,
    hi-tech solutions for processing and recycling coffee, AI, big data, blockchain
    and source traceability technologies, eco-design, and sustainable manufacturing.
    Compared to Brazil, the productivity of coffee in Indonesia and Vietnam is lower
    but the number of smallholder coffee farmers is higher. The root of the problem
    is the coffee farming practices in Indonesia and most small-scale farms in Vietnam
    are still based on traditional methods with trial and error. Therefore, in order
    to actually change the way of coffee farming practices in Vietnam and Indonesia,
    the digital transformation and the integration of smart and hi-tech agriculture
    for the coffee supply chain and value chain must be considered, and also include
    the sustainable practices that consist of continuous improvement in environmental,
    social, and financial aspects. Application of the IoT through a network of wireless
    sensors in a coffee farm for monitoring and control of its environmental variables
    have currently been studied [8]. The study showed that the management of coffee
    cultivation is quite complex due to the large number of varieties found, the terrain
    and environmental conditions affecting the production process and the final grain
    quality. Also, the development and implementation of wireless sensor networks
    is possible today due to factors such as the reduction of device costs and the
    use of open-source software, avoiding additional licensing values. One of the
    main problems with coffee plants is, however, that high humidity can, in fact,
    impact the activity of the sensors and their monitoring tools. There are numerous
    limitations when harvesting and production processes are optimized. Vietnam has
    a great potential to encourage investment in agriculture. The proliferation of
    new technologies has enabled the enhancement and automation of industrial processes
    in all fields of production such as coffee. Therefore, aided by technology, an
    agricultural sector such as coffee production can strongly improve the country’s
    productivity and give enormous benefits for production processes and the optimization
    of final products [9, 10]. Precision agriculture includes many activities such
    as the management of trees, flowers, crops, and plants. Pest and disease management
    is one of its most interesting applications. By the suitable use of sensors, parameters
    (such as soil temperature and relative humidity, leaf temperature and humidity,
    and solar radiation) can also be measured to quickly detect adverse and appropriate
    situations. In addition, this technology can help to manage the time-based detection
    and the efficiently space-based use of pesticides [2]. Hi-tech solutions for processing
    and recycling coffee have some great benefits and add significant values to the
    coffee value chain. For example, not only does it divert waste away from landfill,
    but the spent coffee grounds can be used to produce some value-added things like
    biofuels, bioactives, and anticancer drugs. It can also help businesses save money
    on their waste disposal [11, 12]. In this paper, the innovative and smart agriculture
    platform for the creation and operation of sustainable coffee value chain, with
    the focus on enhanced quality and added values for key elements of the coffee
    supply chain in Vietnam, taking into account the issues related to sustainability,
    well-aligned with United Nations Sustainable Goals. The platform is designed based
    on the foundations of the key enabling digital transformation and smart agriculture
    technologies: smart devices and Internet of Things, big data, artificial intelligence,
    blockchain and source traceability technologies, and sustainable design and manufacturing.
    2 Development of an Innovative and Smart Agriculture Platform Figure 1 presents
    the research method for development of an innovative and smart agriculture platform,
    called the INNSA platform, with the highlights of the key steps and tools. Firstly,
    the data types and sources are very important for development of the smart agriculture
    systems, in which the real-time data collection and analysis needs to be optimally
    implemented. Then, the latest development of the digital transformation technologies
    needs to be taken into account, when working on data collections and analysis,
    and development of the smart platform and ecosystem of INNSA, including smart
    devices and Internet of Things, big data, artificial intelligence, blockchain
    and source traceability technologies, and sustainable design and manufacturing.
    Finally, value-added products and services in the value chain of the INNSA platform
    and its related ecosystems are developed, with the focus on the cost-effective
    and innovative solutions, including the hardware, software, smart devices, e-commerce
    platform, and innovative products from coffee trees, beans, and wastes. Fig. 1
    Research methods for development of the INNSA platform Full size image 2.1 Data
    Type, Sources, and Collections for Development the INNSA Platform A critical analysis
    and industrial investigations were done, with the use of both primary and secondary
    data, including the journal article data, open-source data about agriculture,
    and farming industry from both governmental and industry reports. The primary
    data from surveys, interviews, and sensor-based supply chain operations was also
    collected for value chain mapping, developing, and validating the INNSA platform.
    The data sources included farm soils, environmental conditions, farm types, products
    from coffee farms and food wastes, and key stakeholders in the coffee supply chain
    and value chain. They also included the information about currently used agriculture
    technologies (robots, temperature and moisture sensors, aerial images, IoT, and
    GPS) and products such as fertilizer for growing plants and precision agriculture.
    The data architecture of the smart database was designed with capability of continuous
    update and co-creation, and automatic updates from smart devices and IoT, with
    options for the IP right licenses and open access. To maximize productivity of
    a coffee farm, certain factors related to soil, weather, and environmental conditions
    must be met. The INNSA platform was designed to collect and analyze farm soil,
    weather, and ecosystem factors, focusing on high-yield variables of coffee plants.
    Based on real-time data monitored and obtained, our platform produced reports
    and suggestions of the best agricultural practices which the users can follow
    to approach the highest productivity. This is based on agronomical science and
    farmers’ experience knowledge to produce these reports and suggestions exactly
    and rapidly. Besides, the INNSA platform also guided the users with farming practices
    to explore their resources in an efficient and effective manner. A sustainable
    concept was developed based on cost-effective and time-saving plans to bring to
    precise agricultural practices. To set up the INNSA platform, two main components
    were designed: IoT devices using LoRa waves [13] and AI [7, 9]. In particular,
    the LoRa plays the role of continuously collecting data such as pH, oxidation
    reduction potential (ORP), electrical conductivity (EC), water temperature, air
    temperature, humidity, light intensity, and NPK. The AI is at the heart of the
    INNSA platform because it provides even more value to the IoT devices and enables
    the platform to comprehend the data it collected by IoT devices. In addition,
    with the use of AI, it also provides the ability to analyze market information,
    such as history coffee prices, to provide reports and predictive analysis for
    suppliers to adjust export plans. Besides, with deep learning-based technology,
    AI recognizes the images via camera to output advice about cultivation, harvest,
    pest, and disease prevention, etc. The data collected was sent back to the computer
    database for processing. This platform provides real-time information about the
    cultivating regions. Last but not least, that information, after being stored,
    analyzed in real time, and fed into the traceability system, helps increase transparency
    about the origin of the product, thereby adding the value of the product. 2.2
    Data Analysis and Collections for the INNSA Platform Big data collected by the
    INNSA platform was used to provide predictive insights in farming operations,
    drive real-time operational decisions, and redesign business processes for game-changing
    business models related to the coffee supply chain and value chain. Based on the
    quality assessment in the coffee supply chain and value chain, a standard quality
    certification for domestic use and export was developed to apply for the INNSA
    platform. In order to make the system smarter to make food production efficiently,
    machine learning algorithms (e.g., neural network, random forest, support vector
    machine, etc.) were used to build the big data analytic models. Firstly, powered
    by AI, the INNSA platform is capable of analyzing the collected data to make assessments
    and suggestions for farmers to make decisions of fertilizing products and irrigations.
    For example, based on weather data, humidity, temperature, and plant care regime
    for each time period, AI can suggest when to water, how much water, and what fertilizer
    according to the growth and development of the coffee tree over time. This helps
    reduce costs and increase coffee production. Besides, with the use of AI to analyze
    and diagnose pests based on images of leaves of coffee trees collected from surveillance
    cameras, the platform can automatically and early detect pests, thereby helping
    farmers not only choosing treatment solutions but also reducing costs when pests
    and diseases have not been spread on a large area. In addition, the IoT system
    combined with an automatically controlled irrigation and care system also helps
    to reduce material and labor costs. Secondly, the AI-based advanced analytics
    of the platform is also used to improve the efficiency of coffee storage, processing,
    and exporting operations. With the use of IoT devices in monitoring, the warehouse
    environment, coffee beans quality monitoring cameras, AI-powered advanced analysis
    INNSA platform uses collected IoT''s data to evaluate, guide, and decision support
    for managers. Moreover, the platform also provides predictive insights such as
    coffee quantity and quality based on coffee growing areas, predicts coffee price
    in the future, and forecasts the demand of the market. That information is analyzed
    and aggregated into final reports to assist suppliers in finding partners and
    estimating the volume of products to sign export contracts in accordance with
    their ability. Additionally, due to the digitization of coffee product related
    information, the INNSA platform is designed to be used not only as a coffee information
    portal but also as an advanced analysis portal of coffee beans quantity and quality
    of each region, each coffee growing area in Vietnam. Thereby helping the coffee
    industry of Vietnam to a higher level, well-recognized in terms of values, branding,
    and sustainability. Finally, the platform was developed based on cost-effective
    equipment and open-source software. This allows easy scaling and system development
    for responding to the actual needs of agriculture in the future. Blockchain-based
    supply chain traceability systems were developed by using radio frequency identification
    (RFID), a non-contact automatic identification communication technology [6] to
    trace products with trusted information in the entire supply chain, and by linking
    with IoT devices and integrating into the INNSA platform to provide digital data
    of production and consumption [5]. A sensor network system consisting of IoT devices
    and application programming interface (API) programmed by NodeJS and deployed
    in the server running Linux operating system (OS) were used to collect data [13].
    Data transmission sensor used a communication protocol type MQTT [14]. By using
    this protocol, the microcontroller and computers or mobile apps were communicated
    wirelessly. Data collection block diagram, including array sensors, connected
    to IoT sensor network, API, cloud, local database, visual modeling, and computation.
    The sensor data from the microcontroller was sent to the LoRaWAN gateway, thus
    the data could be sent to the cloud and stored in a local database. Sensor data
    stored on a local database was used for real-time visualization. To perform computational
    modeling, sensor data was accessed on a local database. 2.3 The Proposed Models
    for the INNSA Platform A solution architecture of the INNSA platform is designed
    as shown in Fig. 2, taking into account the following points: (1) critical investigation
    and reviews of the coffee supply chain and value chain in Vietnam; (2) innovative
    and cost-effective development of the platform with the smart database; (3) construction
    of big data for the platform, the real-world data inputs for a smart database;
    (4) innovative and cost-effective developments of value-added products and services
    in the value chain of the INNSA platform and ecosystems; and (5) systematic integration,
    evaluation, and analysis of the developed platform and products within the ecosystems.
    Fig. 2 Proposed models of the INNSA platform Full size image First of all, the
    data was collected from users, video/PDF files, and IoT systems, to store it in
    a database, called Data Lake. From Data Lake, data was analyzed on demand to create
    business intelligence software, called BI tools. Then, a portal was developed
    to connect and integrate websites and visitors. Mobile applications were also
    created to control IoT devices and recommend farming care procedures. Finally,
    AI and machine learning technologies were used to design, optimize, and predict
    models, from which results are generated via an API gateway. 2.4 A General Workflow
    of the INNSA Platform A general workflow of the INNSA platform was shown in Fig.
    3. In the first step, a critical investigation and reviews of the coffee supply
    chain and coffee value chain in Vietnam is performed on the whole supply chain,
    including production, collection, processing, commerce—import and export, and
    consumption, with the focus on (1) identification of the key factors and stakeholders
    in the coffee supply chain and coffee value chain in Vietnam, and (2) strength,
    weakness, opportunity, and threat (SWOT) analysis. Fig. 3 General workflow of
    the INNSA platform Full size image Based on the critical investigation and reviews
    from the first step, the INNSA platform is designed in the second step, with the
    focus on supply chain traceability systems, as well as management systems. The
    supply chain traceability system is presented in Fig. 4 with a detailed description.
    The management systems have key functions such as farm production area management,
    plant information management system (PIMS), supplier information management system
    (SIMS), and customer and partner relationship management (CRM and PRM). Besides,
    E-commerce systems (web and mobile applications), IoT devices using LoRa waves,
    and API Gateway systems integrated with blockchain and AI are also developed.
    Fig. 4 Detailed workflow of the supply chain traceability system within the INNSA
    platform Full size image In the third step, the construction of big data for the
    INNSA platform is successfully designed and developed. The INNSA platform with
    the designed smart database needs the real-world data inputs, especially the ones
    that can be directly used for smart farming’s applications: farm soils and environmental
    conditions (moisture levels and weather in different times of the year), as well
    as the latest information about the crops and market trends from all connected
    sources. Big data collected by the INNSA platform are being developed to provide
    predictive insights in farming operations, drive real-time operational decisions,
    and redesign business processes for game-changing business models related to the
    coffee supply chain and coffee value chain in Vietnam. We seek and contract reputable
    partners in Vietnam and abroad to provide high quality input supply for coffee
    production as well as products and equipment for each key stakeholder. Information
    of these partners is added to the information portal systems. In addition, the
    platform also provides a quality assessment function of these partners. Based
    on this assessment, the platform will give priority to introducing reputable and
    quality partners to participate in the coffee supply chain and value chain. Based
    on the quality assessment in the coffee supply chain and value chain, a standard
    quality certification for domestic use and export such as UTZ and C4 assessment
    will be developed to apply for the platform. In the fourth step, innovative and
    cost-effective developments of value-added products and services in the coffee
    value chain are added to the INNSA platform and its ecosystems, including: (1)
    products made from coffee beans and wastes, (2) products for sustainable and precision
    agriculture: microbial organic fertilizer for coffee plants; (3) smart devices
    and IoT solutions for continuous and automatic updates of data and information
    to construct big data for the INNSA platform; and (4) E-commerce and commercialization
    of coffee beans and coffee products, with the support of AI, blockchain and supply
    chain traceability technologies. Finally, systematic integration, evaluation,
    and analysis of the developed INNSA platform and products within the INNSA ecosystems
    are designed and implemented. All products, modules, and data resulting from the
    third and fourth steps are integrated into the INNSA platform developed in the
    second step for evaluation and analysis, and related risk and security assessment,
    quality control, and management issues. The evaluation and analysis are based
    on the real-world business models and data, at the laboratory scale first, and
    then in coffee farms and coffee storage spaces. A farm of 500 m2 of White Lion
    JSC (Iced Coffee) in Mdrak district, Daklak province, Vietnam was used for demonstration,
    analysis, and evaluation, with the focus on how the system collect and process
    data to support smart farming, harvest and post-harvest processing, storage, source
    traceability, commercialization, as well as related issues in the coffee supply
    chain and value chain. Finally, the principles of LEAN Industry 4.0 and Sustainable
    Developments [16] are introduced and applied in management and operations of the
    INNSA platform, as well as when developing value-added products and services in
    the value chain of the INNSA platform and its related ecosystems, including the
    hardware, software, smart devices, e-commerce platform, and innovative products
    from coffee trees, beans, and wastes. For future works, the INNSA platform can
    be applied to other agricultural supply chains such as marine culture and shrimp
    farming for a sustainable aquaculture [17, 18]. 3 Summary and Conclusions Under
    the impacts of Industry 4.0 and UN’s sustainable development goals, it is necessary
    to develop an innovative and smart agriculture platform that can be effectively
    used for the creation and operation of a sustainable coffee value chain, to enhance
    the quality and create added values for key elements of the coffee supply chain.
    In this paper, the INNSA platform is introduced, to provide the information portal
    and open-access database for all key factors of coffee supply chain, enabling
    them to join and interact with each other effectively and systematically, with
    the focus on the case of the coffee industry of Vietnam, aimed at enhancement
    of the values, branding and sustainability of the coffee value chain and supply
    chain in Vietnam. The platform is designed based on the foundations of the key
    enabling digital transformation and smart agriculture technologies, with the following
    key features: A smart database with real-time data inputs and updates, cost-effectiveness,
    and open-architectures for effective integrations of the enabling digital transformation
    and smart agriculture technologies. The successful development of the INNSA platform
    will potentially create the significance and impacts in the coffee supply chain,
    and to directly contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Goals. It also directly
    contributes to Vietnam''s Smart Agriculture and Industry 4.0, successful development,
    and applications of the key enabling technologies of digital transformation and
    smart agriculture, including the following ones: smart devices and IoT, big data,
    AI, blockchain and source traceability technologies, and sustainable design and
    manufacturing. It is expected that, for the first time in Vietnam, there is the
    smart platform and ecosystem as the information portal and open-access database
    for farmers, traders, processing companies, import and export companies, retail
    shops, and coffee users, can join to obtain and share information, as well as
    to commercialize coffee products, to specifically meet their needs in both the
    coffee supply chain and coffee value chain. References Abideen, A. Z., Sundram,

    Agriculture Chapter © 2024 1 Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) has significantly
    altered our way of life. From smart wearables to smart refrigerators that adapt
    to our demands, it has permeated every aspect of our life. Additionally, automobiles
    use them (self-driving). Today’s fuel is data. It is currently utilised throughout
    all sectors of society. The three technologies that are closely related to data
    are blockchain, machine learning, and the internet of things. The creation of
    data and services is made possible by the Internet of Things devices, which also
    give computers a way to communicate with the real world. Blockchains offer a mechanism
    to record data and transactions in an unchangeable form. Machine learning is used
    to make sense of the data obtained and use those insights to achieve a larger
    goal. IoT devices and data will be sold as commodities in the market, just like
    cloud services and physical goods, as a result of the IoT ecosystem’s rapid expansion.
    A significant IoT service exchange is creating a trade platform. Attempts have
    been made to create a system where IoT services are traded like commodities. However,
    the primary issues here are data security and privacy [4]. For the reasons outlined
    in the following sections, a centralised system where one must blindly trust a
    third party is no longer a viable option in the current world. A decentralised
    system built on the blockchain is required because it eliminates the requirement
    for a reliable third party by enabling users to independently verify data and
    ensure its immutability [5]. IoT devices can use blockchain to register themselves
    and organize store, share streams of data effectively and reliably. Blockchains
    like Ethereum provide a notion of smart contracts. On the blockchain, smart contracts
    are stored as code or scripts. They are set off by specific circumstances. The
    ability to automate processes on the blockchain is provided by smart contracts
    to developers. Like entities that live on the blockchain, smart contracts. On
    the blockchain, they are connected to their own address and account. The project’s
    goal is to use smart contracts to automate exchanges of goods, services, and data
    between two entities on the blockchain with little to no human involvement. Every
    gadget whose data or service is available for trade or exchange can be given an
    account using blockchain technology. Therefore, by giving the devices access to
    their blockchain, the blockchains deal with the devices as participants in the
    exchange, which prevents fraud in transactions. A basic trading platform for irrigation
    services between farmers and the service providers who have placed IoT devices
    all over the place is constructed as a proof of concept. This platform can be
    very helpful in a nation like India where agriculture is significant. The farmers
    sign up for the site and are given a blockchain-connected account that they may
    use to conduct transactions. They might request that the soil moisture be monitored
    and that it be irrigated when it falls below a certain threshold. These kinds
    of attempts are made utilising the conventional centralised client-server approach,
    which has a lot of issues [3]. With the exception of the farmer’s first request,
    all of these tasks are entirely automated. The fact that the blockchain has cryptocurrency
    associated with it, which can be used for payments, is another benefit of it.
    The moisture level of the soil in the farmers’ fields can be updated in real time.
    When irrigation is required, automatic transactions between the accounts linked
    to the device and the farmer take place. The smart contract is written in Solidity,
    and the prototype is built on the Ethereum blockchain. Section 2 gives the brief
    overview of the works previously done in the field. Section 3 contains information
    about the Approaches and Mechanisms used to build the prototype. Section 4 contains
    information about the results obtained, i.e the working of the prototype. Section
    5 contains discussion regarding the advantages and disadvantages of using blockchain
    as a basis for such a platform and also how the present model can be extended.
    2 Literature Review The project’s objective is to provide a platform where farmers
    can easily and safely access irrigation services from a variety of vendors. This
    entails offering farmers IoT device-based services for tracking the soil’s moisture
    content and also implementing irrigation when the moisture content is low. Farmers
    ought to be able to monitor the soil’s moisture level in real time. Additionally,
    as much as practicable, the actions conducted are to be automated. In order to
    develop such an Internet of Things (IoT) based system for tracking the moisture
    level of the fields, Rao et al. [3] discuss the numerous tools and equipment required.
    In this article, the authors primarily concentrate on the actual tools required
    to monitor and irrigate the field. The authors also provide the fundamental circuitry
    needed to construct such an infrastructure. Hub et al.’s [6] discussion of the
    framework needed to combine the physical IoT infrastructure with the blockchain-based
    platform for managing and monitoring IoT device performance. The mechanism is
    automated through the use of smart contracts and the Ethereum [2] blockchain.
    Additionally, it advises using asymmetric key cryptography to give the system
    the necessary security. The best practises for combining blockchain technology
    with IoT devices are discussed by Fernandez et al. [4] and Christidis et al. [7],
    S. Huh et al. [11]. According to Dogan et al. [5], creating the data marketplace
    utilising blockchains for data produced by IoT devices is discussed. Additionally,
    by developing a prototype for the same on the Ethereum network, this gives a clear
    proof of concept. 3 Approaches and Mechanisms 3.1 Comparison of the Two Model
    - Cloud Based and Decentralized As was already noted, the project’s objective
    is to provide a platform where farmers can easily and safely access irrigation
    services from a variety of providers. In order to do this, IoT device-based services
    are offered to farmers, who can use them to monitor the soil’s moisture level
    and apply irrigation when it is low. Farmers ought to be able to monitor the soil’s
    moisture level in real time. Additionally, the steps conducted must be as automatic
    as possible. In order to build a system or platform where the IoT devices are
    exchanged or are allowed to be used in exchange for money, two approaches can
    be used [3, 4]. Centralized Cloud model: The first system is a centralised one
    that uses cloud computing resources. When IoT device services or transactions
    take place through the platform, the cloud serves as the platform’s trusted third
    party. As a result, attacks like Denial of Service are possible given this centralised
    approach (DoS). A single point of failure exists in the centralised system as
    well. Additionally, a significant number of IoT devices are being used in our
    daily lives, and more are predicted to be added rapidly in the near future. We
    utilise gadgets like wearable smart devices, smart air conditioners, and smart
    refrigerators every day. Therefore, there are too many devices for a single centralised
    system to manage. IoT devices are also available whose services are needed in
    real-time by customers. However, in a centralised system, every data travelling
    must contend with other internet traffic in order to reach its destination, stopping
    at the cloud for any additional processing. This is a slightly inappropriate way
    to establish the market for IoT device services on top of it due to all of these
    problems. Various stakeholders are interested in such a platform, which is centred
    on exchanging or selling IoT services. Five essential primitives (roles), according
    to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, are utilised in actual
    Internet of Things applications [8]. IoT sensors are devices that produce data.
    Data aggregation infrastructure includes edge, fog, and mist. Communication channels:
    services offered by communication service providers for wired or wireless communication.
    eUtility: Cloud-based SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS services. Processes for enacting decisions,
    such as pipelines for data analysis. Each of these services is frequently offered
    by a distinct provider who is unaware of the identity of the other supplier. So
    the only option is to put your trust in a single party. The party which gives
    the sensor data has no idea how the data will be used by the party consuming it.
    Additionally, the entity consuming the data is unaware of the accuracy of the
    data it has received. Thus, we require a different strategy. So we need a different
    approach. Blockchain-based decentralised model: Establishing trust amongst the
    numerous parties participating in such a system is one of the main challenges.
    Users of the cloud-based approach are compelled to believe the centralised cloud
    without question. They lack any other option. But it shouldn’t be like this. The
    blockchain is a novel data sharing mechanism that resolves this problem by doing
    away with the requirement for a reliable third party. It brings in the needed
    trust by maintaining the immutable database or ledger, which cannot be easily
    tampered with. All the participants hold a copy of this, and the system tries
    to maintain consensus among the participants, by using several distributed consensus
    algorithms. As a result, the following benefits [8] can be attained by employing
    the blockchain to oversee the trade of IoT device services: IoT devices may share
    data through the blockchain without relying on a third party. The blockchain entries,
    which keep track of all the transactions, can be used to track the data produced
    by various sources. Better service providers gain significantly more than less
    effective service providers. The supplied data’s integrity is safeguarded. Therefore,
    rather than building it on the cloud, it is preferable to develop the aforementioned
    platform (marketplace for IoT device-based services) on blockchain technology.
    3.2 What is Block Chain? A Blockchain is a distributed data structure, whose copies
    are stored in the nodes of the network. These copies, ideally, are exactly the
    same as each other. The concept of Blockchainwas introduced as part of the Bitcoin
    [1], a cryptocurrency aimed at solving the double spending problem. The blockchain
    is nothing but a linked list that is supposed to be immutable. Blockchain consists
    of a series of blocks that are time-stamped and identified by their unique cryptographic
    hash. Every block references the hash of its previous block. This is one of the
    main reasons for the immutability property of the blockchain. This forms a link
    between the block and its previous one, leading to the formation of a chain of
    blocks, called blockchain. Every node on the blockchain network holds a copy of
    this blockchain. A node can act as an entry point for many users (of blockchain)
    into the network. These nodes form a peer-to-peer network. In this network [7]:
    The users hold private-public key pairs. The private key [10] is used by the user
    to sign his transaction. Therefore the private key acts as the digital signature
    of the user in the blockchain network. The public key, which is accessible to
    other users in the network, is used to verify the signed transactions. The use
    of asymmetric cryptography brings authentication and integrity into the blockchain
    network. Such signed transactions are broadcasted by a users node to its neighbours
    (one-hop peers). The neighbouring peers check the validity of the transaction
    before relaying it to its neighbours. Invalid transactions are dropped. Eventually,
    the transaction is broadcasted to the entire network. The above valid transactions
    are collected and packaged into a time stamped candidate block. This process is
    called mining. The mining node issues this block back to the network. The nodes
    check the broadcasted block for its validity and add it to their blockchain if
    valid. As said before, there is no trusted third party in a blockchain network.
    So a way has to be found to help the network reach consensus, mainly regarding
    the validity of the blocks. So a blockchain network needs a set of rules to which
    all its nodes should oblige. These rules are programmed into the nodes, which
    are used when creating a transaction or while receiving one. When each node in
    the network follows the set rules, it is possible to bring consensus without having
    to blindly believe a third party. Here belief is on the mathematics of cryptography
    used and not on a third party. So a blockchain operates in a trustless environment.
    Using a blockchain provides a convenient billing layer for using the services
    and gives way to the creation of a marketplace of services between devices [7].
    Using this technology, we can allocate an account to every IoT device, treating
    them as participants of the transactions and not just objects that are traded.
    This further helps in the main goal of automating all these transactions. 3.3
    How to Apply the Above-Mentioned Concept to the Problem of Creating a Market Place
    for Sharing Irrigation Service and also Automating It? A blockchain for the platform
    has to be created. The service providers should register every one of their devices
    they intend to use. This creates an account for every device. The consumer should
    also register and create an account in the blockchain. Therefore this blockchain
    is a permissioned one that is not open to everyone but should register with the
    platform before being able to use the blockchain. There can be two types of blockchains.
    Permissionless blockchain: This is an open network that allows anyone to join
    or quit the network. The incentives are provided for being a part of the network
    and mining the blocks. The consensus mechanisms used are mostly Proof-of-Work
    or Proof-of-Stake. Permissioned blockchain: Only the registered participants are
    allowed to participate in the blockchain network. Privacy is preserved as the
    public is not allowed to participate. Consensus mechanisms like Byzantine Fault
    tolerance used. Incentives for participation rarely seen. Once the account is
    created, the service providers create a smart [11] contract on the blockchain
    for every device, which controls the way the device has to behave and the way
    the money (or cryptocurrency) is transferred between the account of the device
    and that of the consumer, who in this case is the farmer requesting the services.
    All the transactions occur according to the rules set by the smart contract. As
    the smart contract is visible to everyone on the network to see, no fraud can
    be done. The block chain will be based on Ethereum, which also provides the needed
    smart contracts. The smart contracts will be run on the EVM (Ethereum virtual
    machine) on the nodes of the Ethereum network 3.4 Ethereum Ethereum [2], proposed
    by Vatalik Buterin in 2013, is a public blockchain-based distributed computing
    platform. Unlike, bitcoin, the original blockchain network, it can work as a computer.
    But the performance is lower compared to normal cloud-based computing. The code
    that is stored on Ethereum is called smart contract and is written in languages
    like Solidity. The code is compiled to bytecode and stored on the Ethereum blockchain.
    Ethereum nodes comprise of three components. The blockchain The peer-to-peer communication
    layer. The Ethereum virtual machine The Ethereum virtual machine is what runs
    the byte code of the smart contract. Ethereum combines the computing system with
    blockchain. Storing the code on the blockchain saves it from malicious tampering.
    Processing code on Ethereum costs gas, which acts as the economic incentive to
    the nodes performing the computation 3.5 Smart Contracts A computerised transaction
    system called a “smart contract” [2] performs a contract’s terms. Smart contracts
    are scripts that are kept on the blockchain in the context of the technology.
    They have a specific blockchain address. They could be seen as autonomous actors,
    or entities that live on the blockchain. As a result, the idea of decentralised
    autonomous organisations is born. The smart contract is activated under specific
    circumstances, which causes the programming it contains to run. Smart contracts
    enable general-purpose computations to take place across the chain. A smart contract
    is a piece of deterministic code that, when executed under identical circumstances,
    produces the same outcome. In essence, a smart contract connects several entities
    to create a system that performs specific activities. We can run general-purpose
    code on the blockchain, more precisely the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) of the
    network’s nodes, thanks to the Turing-complete characteristic of smart contracts
    in Ethereum. 3.6 How to Use the Proposed Marketplace Platform? The consumer (farmer)
    interacts with the blockchain and obtains the services offered by the registered
    devices using the web-based interface. He chooses the necessary instrument and
    instructs it to begin monitoring the amount of moisture in the soil in his field.
    These tools are deployed in the farmers’ fields by the provider and are the providers’
    property, not the farmers’. If the device detects during tracking that the moisture
    level is below the critical level, it begins irrigating the land with the available
    water supply while deducting the appropriate amount from the customer’s account.
    Everything is carried out automatically. The procedure is therefore automated.
    The moisture level of the farmer’s land is constantly visible. As all the transactions
    are saved in the blockchain with the timestamp, it is almost impossible to perform
    any fraudulent activities. 3.7 A Prototype of the Idea as Proof of Concept A prototype
    of the model as the proof of concept to the above idea has been created. The created
    model simplifies the problem statement by providing provision for a single consumer
    and a single device from the given provider. This model can be extended to allow
    multiple users and multiple parallel transactions. The code for the model can
    be seen at https://github.com/govardhangdg/seproject Ganache is used to produce
    the in-memory Ethereum test blockchain needed for the model, which can be accessed
    and interacted with via the JSON-RPC protocol as advised by Ethereum to create
    dApps (decentralized applications). The service’s necessary files are provided
    to the customer’s browser via the prototype, a NodeJS programme that runs an HTTP
    server. The Solidity programming language is used to create the smart contract
    for the code. Web3.js is used to programmatically connect with the blockchain
    from the NodeJS app. An add-on called Metamask, which internally uses the same
    web3.js as mentioned above, is used to transform a standard browser into one that
    can communicate with the blockchain. The official solc compiler is used to translate
    the solidity code into bytecode that the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) can understand.
    Then, as the first block following the genesis block, the byte code is introduced
    to the blockchain. Every subsequent transaction uses the smart contract’s address,
    which is kept. To provide a web-based interface for the software, a simple HTML
    page is created. A process that delivers simulated moisture levels at regular
    intervals is created in order to imitate the sensor readings. When the moisture
    condition is lower than the critical moisture condition, the main app responds
    in response to this. Every time the moisture content falls below the threshold,
    an event is set off, a new blockchain transaction is made, and the moisture content
    is raised by simulated watering (which is just a message from the main process
    to the process simulating sensor readings). Once the time of tracking asked by
    the consumer is passed, the tracking is stopped. 4 Results A prototype is made
    as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate how the suggested model for automating transactions
    between the device and the consumer for the irrigation service will operate. The
    Ethereum blockchain is used to build the prototype, and smart contracts are used
    to automate the transactions. The smart contract keeps track of the two parties’
    transaction’s current state and is programmed to start various actions when certain
    conditions are satisfied, such as when moisture content falls below a threshold.
    The prototype’s smart contract is depicted in the diagram below. Its user interface
    is web-based. The smart contract for the prototype is given in the Fig. 1. The
    web interface shows the address where the necessary contract is set up as well
    as the accounts linked to the customer and the service-providing device. The user
    must specify how long he wants the device to keep an eye on his field. When the
    duration has passed, a smart contract event is triggered, ending the tracking.
    Fig. 1. Smart contract prototype Full size image The contract is initially deployed
    to the blockchain when the app is launched using the code contained in the deploy.js
    and compile.js files. When this occurs, a little amount of ether is taken out
    of the device’s account to cover the cost of deploying the contract. Following
    the contract’s deployment, the customer specifies the number of hours he wants
    to use the service; this generates a transaction that modifies the smart contract’s
    state and adds a new block to the blockchain. The sequence diagram for the proposed
    model as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2. Sequence diagram of the model Full size image
    The expense of the tracking is transferred to the account of the device. The prototype
    also offers the opportunity to view the field’s moisture content. The result is
    as shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3. The graph depicting the performance of the model when
    provided with the soil moisture data from the data hosted Full size image The
    link opens up a graph that shows the moisture in real time. Every time the moisture
    goes below critical level an event is triggered and transfer of funds from the
    consumer to device occurs and the service (irrigation) is provided. 5 Discussion
    The presented simulates the actual functioning of a similar platform in real life.
    Attempts are made in creating a similar system, based on the Cloud-based model.
    The major disadvantages of using a cloud-based model have been discussed in the
    above sections. The project can be extended in directions as mentioned below:
    IPFS: A distributed storage system that is compatible with the Ethereum blockchain
    is IPFS. https://ipfs.io/. It can be used to give the data generated during the
    tracking period a storage facility. Scientists and data analysts can use the generated
    data to gain profound insights into specific issues. The same methodology can
    be utilised to construct a data marketplace where this data is sold as a commodity.
    The real-time data that is gathered can be saved on IPFS as a file (csv). The
    consumer with the proper private key can access the data stored in the IPFS and
    encrypt it using asymmetric key cryptography techniques [5]. The inclusion of
    multiple providers, devices and consumers: To simplify the implementation, The
    simple case of a single provider, a single device and a single consumer is considered
    here. This can be extended to include multiple parties interacting with each other
    in a suitable manner. A system to search providers, who fall under certain conditions,
    can also be implemented. A chat system can also be created between two interacting
    parties with the help of whisper protocol of Ethereum. Addition of the actual
    hardware: To make the implementation simpler, Here, moisture values from the sensor
    are simulated using a method. Instead, the model can be improved by utilising
    a Raspberry Pi and the appropriate sensors to read the soil’s moisture level.
    The new sensor module should merge seamlessly with the current code. The only
    thing that has to be changed is the source of the incoming data stream from the
    readings simulator procedure to the actual sensor data [3]. Including edge nodes
    for computation: Instead of just providing raw data to the consumers, edge nodes
    (fog computing concept) can be added to the platform at the edges (next to IoT
    sensors) to process the data before providing it to the consumers. A RaspberryPi
    may be used to process the data obtained from the sensors before providing it
    to the consumers, in the extension mentioned above [9]. 5.1 Concerns Regarding
    Using Blockchain for Such a Platform Even though using Blockchain as the basis
    for the proposed platform brings a lot of advantages, it is not the silver bullet
    that solves all the problems. Instead, it brings along its own set of concerns
    [4]. Passing ownership of the devices: Suitable steps should be taken when the
    ownership of the device is transferred. This is very important because the trust
    of the consumers on the new provider and hence the device in question can be affected.
    The data possessed by the device can be used by the new owner in a way that is
    not recommended. Bringing about the privacy of transactions: This is really a
    tough problem to solve as even though public keys are used to identify a device
    or a consumer on the blockchain, these devices or consumers can be identified
    in the real world based on the coincidences in the activities on the chain and
    in the real world. So a balance in the privacy and openness in the transaction
    history is to be achieved, which is a delicate matter. Throughput and latency:
    Blockchains deliberately restrict the number of transactions that can be made
    in a given time. This affects the performance of the system when a lot of IoT
    based transactions have to be made simultaneously. Hardcore real-time applications
    suffer from this. Even though the problem cant be completely solved, steps must
    be taken in eradicating the problem. Energy efficiency: Mining nodes with consensus
    mechanisms like Proof-of-Work is computationally expensive. As computing is inevitable,
    something useful is to be com puted. Like the primes etc. Adoption Rate: The blockchain
    enables pseudonymity. Thus people can misuse this privacy given to them. This
    is not a problem in the permissioned blockchains but may turn out to be one if
    public blockchains are to be used for the purpose. Usability: Creating applications
    over blockchain is not as easy as creating one over the traditional and conventional,
    centralized server-client model. As a result, there aren’t many people who are
    interested in taking up such ambitious projects. The problem is expected to be
    mitigated with the formation and development of a community worldwide who are
    interested in creating decentralized applications or dApps. Dealing with forks:
    As blockchain is a distributed system, disagreements regarding the state of the
    blockchain can occur, mainly in the form of the forks. It is very important to
    deal with the forks in a way that doesn’t cause problems to the consumers or providers
    using the platform. Lack of legal governance: Rules regarding the usage of blockchain
    technology are not strict or not even formed in many countries. Lack of such rules
    severely hinders the widespread adoption of the technology 6 Conclusion As discussed
    in the previous sections, there can be two important approaches to building a
    marketplace for the IoT device based services. One is the traditional centralized
    system and the other is the blockchain based decentralized system. As mentioned
    above, the centralized system requires too much of trust to be placed on the third
    party, which can be dangerous and is also subjected to problems like single point
    of failure etc. On the other hand, the blockchain based solution solves most of
    the problems faced by the centralized system. But this comes with its own set
    of problems, which can be solved with proper legal support. In the end, the blockchain
    based solution provides the required security and protection for the proposed
    system. References Nakamoto, S., et al.: Bitcoin: a peer-to-peer electronic cash

    Water is becoming increasingly scarce [1, 2], and unfortunately few people are
    aware of this. According to a report released by the United Nations Children’s
    Fund (UNICEF) in 2021, more than 36 countries are currently experiencing water
    supply problems. Again, according to the UN, the demand for water will increase
    by 50% by 2030 [3], due to the growing needs of industry, agriculture, electricity,
    population growth and especially with the Russian-Ukrainian war. It is in this
    context that our research takes place. In effect, we are interested in smart agriculture
    as an alternative ensuring the water consumption reduction. Farmers used to put
    a lot of emphasis on evaluating soil composition and coming up with novel ways
    to boost crop yields [16]. Farmers aren’t always aware of the water content of
    their fields, the amount of water they need to irrigate them, or the present climatic
    conditions that impact them. In this way, the traditional research on soil moisture
    content is no longer sufficient to boost agricultural yields due to the major
    changes in climate. This is because soil moisture, temperature, and humidity levels
    fluctuate during the day in different places of the planet. Drip farming, sprinkler
    farming and other conventional technologies are examples of traditional methods
    that are manually managed and time consuming. When adopting automated irrigation
    [17], other agricultural operations may be completed at the same time, saving
    time and money. Watering needs change throughout the day, requiring a method that
    acts in real time to take these changes into consideration for irrigation. Because
    of recent developments in sensors for agricultural irrigation systems, as well
    as the evolution of Machine Learning (ML) that can be used in the development
    of these systems [18]. Our proposition IrrigControl aims to improve water resource
    management by offering a smart system that decides on the irrigation process using
    trustworthy devices. Small and medium agricultural producers will be able to monitor
    and gather data on climatic and soil variables, store it, process it using fuzzy
    tools, techniques, and algorithms, and finally manage it over the Internet thanks
    to its three-level architecture. The proposed smart farm system’s privacy will
    be protected using Blockchain technology. The farmer will be able to see data
    in tables and statistical graphs through the IrrigControl system’s interface.
    It will also send out email and notifications about a specific event. Mamdani’s
    fuzzy logic method, designed through the rule base and the modelling of input
    and output variables, allows irrigation decision making. Sensors implemented in
    the field ensure the collection of real-time data. Several users can be connected
    at the same time to control the climate parameters. Each transmission of climate
    parameter value is considered as a transaction between the server and other IoT
    devices. Blockchain is used in its Ethereum version to secure all these transactions.
    The effectiveness of our approach is evaluated not only through the irrigation
    precision in real time but also through privacy preservation and security. The
    main contributions of this work are focused on the following topics. Increase
    irrigation precision and reduce costs: collect environmental data received from
    sensors in real time, using not only temperature but also climatic factors for
    irrigation planning. Based on trusted devices, use the valuable data collected
    to be more efficient while considering the security and privacy preservation aspect.
    Manage Irrigation Events: automated farm events with personalized notifications.
    It is possible to get critical alerts on operational problems as they occur and,
    at the same time, create personalized events. Get insightful data analytics: Analyse
    data with personalized and dynamic graphical reports. The remainder of the paper
    is laid out as follows. The background of the study is found in Sect. 2. In the
    third section, similar research projects will be presented. The proposed smart
    System IoT platform is described in Sect. 4. The experimental results are discussed
    in Sect. 5. Section 6 concludes the paper with a discussion as well as conclusions
    and recommendations for further research. 2 Background Study 2.1 Internet of Things
    Smart agriculture uses the Internet of Things to reduce usages such as duration,
    manpower, and resources. Sensors can talk with one another and transfer signals
    using a web connection. This smart irrigation system is built to monitor production
    using sensors such as humidity sensors, and temperature sensors [7, 8]. 2.2 Fuzzy
    Learning Fuzzy logic is one of the unsupervised techniques of machine learning
    and has emerged alongside big data technologies [13]. The fuzzifier transforms
    input data into linguistic values of fuzzy sets, while the rule base is made up
    of a set of rules that express the expert knowledge control policy as “IF - THEN”
    statements [5, 14] as shown in Fig. 1. In order to determine a fuzzy control action,
    the inference engine must compare the output of the fuzzifier with the fuzzy logic
    rules and conduct fuzzy implication and approximation reasoning. In order to produce
    a nonfuzzy (crisp) control action from an inferred fuzzy control action, the defuzzifier
    completes the operation of defuzzification using preset output membership functions.
    The definitions and ideas of a fuzzy logic controller are described in further
    depth in [5]. Fig. 1. Architecture of a fuzzy logic system [6]. Full size image
    2.3 Blockchain The word “Blockchain” means a chain of interconnected blocks and
    permits the storing of data while generating and updating the distributed ledger
    using consensus procedures, as well as encrypting the data during transmission
    [12]. The meaning of the word “blockchain” is obvious [15]. [5] describes Blockchain
    as a distributed database without a centralized management system. In its peer-to-peer
    network, it controls how its members communicate. Transfer of data cannot be irreversible.
    A node, a computational device, requests a transaction and the other nodes in
    the network receive this via broadcast. A validation algorithm is used to validate
    the transaction before it joins the network. The previously completed transaction
    is updated with the validated transaction(s) They unite to make a block, which
    is then merged into the larger chain. The new block is added to the current Blockchain
    using a consensus mechanism [5]. 3 Related Works To achieve the principles of
    sustainable agriculture, technology, research, and development must be exploited
    to the utmost extent possible. There were three key revolutions in agricultural
    development two years ago, notably machine learning, the internet of things and
    Blockchain according to the artificial intelligence research tool Semantic Scholar.
    The number of published papers presenting irrigation systems during the last two
    years is indicated in the figure below Fig 3. Only 10% of the research has been
    focused on water management, whereas over 61% has been focused on crop management.
    Furthermore, crop management relies heavily on water management, including water
    quality and irrigation [1]. The total number of publications with keywords: “smart
    irrigation” and “IoT” since 2020 is about 346 papers. But as soon as we add the
    keyword “Blockchain” or “security”, in our search, the number is reduced to 11
    i.e., by 97% including 80% of papers submitted in conference. Among 11 papers
    selected, we have chosen the 5 most cited papers to summarise the applied methods,
    the contributions and the limitations. Table 1. Research findings and shortcomings
    of smart agriculture systems Full size table Fig. 2. Number of published papers
    presenting machine learning, IoT and Blockchain systems for smart irrigation.
    Full size image The main challenges faced by automated irrigation systems, as
    shown in the Table 1 above; are mainly summarized in the following points: Limited
    use of knowledge-based ML techniques Filtering of some important agricultural
    parameters Testing of systems only for a few plants Need for expert knowledge
    for manual irrigation Providing medium- and large-scale farmers with precision
    irrigation monitoring and control systems. Many networks security and communication
    performance issues exist in precision agriculture networks, making it difficult
    to build secure IoT networks. Farmers, for example, need to defend their smart
    greenhouse networks from cyber threats by securing supply chain systems for the
    exchange of their crops. They also need a secure environment in which they can
    manage and access their IoT agricultural machines without risking their identity,
    privacy, or the integrity of the data processed by these units. Precision agriculture
    network systems, on the other hand, present network performance issues such as
    communication speed with many heterogeneous devices and sensors, device power
    consumption, bandwidth and latency, and data storage limitations. Therefore, Blockchain
    technology can improve the security, transparency and tamper-resistance of IoT
    communications. In addition, real-time data tracking in faster end-to-end transaction
    processes would boost digital agricultural processes. Therefore, Blockchain technology
    can provide good solutions for security and performance of IoT networks in precision
    agriculture systems. 4 The Proposed Approach This study is conducted to solve
    the irrigation precision and security issues as it was mentioned in previous sections.
    The research solution concept is described as follows: The Fuzzy Learning (FL)
    can be adopted to address the prediction of the valve position. It allows processing
    collected sensors’ data. Such approach guarantees Increasing irrigation precision
    and reduce costs. To ensure data integrity, the Blockchain technology seems to
    be an efficient solution. Its ability to ensure immutable transfer data transactions
    provides a stable environment to safeguard data integrity against manipulative
    attacks. Fig. 3. Block diagram of irrig control. Full size image As shown in the
    diagram, our proposal is built around 4 layers. The first sensor layer is composed
    of the following sensors: The installed sensors’ specs are listed below: Esp32
    DHT11 sensor Humidity sensor Fig. 4. The component of the sensor layer Full size
    image A wireless sensor network of sensor nodes is established for data collection.
    The ESP32 receives the output from these sensors. A Python program is used to
    collect data from sensors on an hourly basis, store it in an SQLite database,
    and transfer it to the server over a web service. The built web service reads
    the projected data and saves it to the server’s MySQL database, which is used
    in the fuzzy prediction method. The study employs Blockchain technology to manage
    the data storage than a centralized server. A smart contract (SC) is used to implement
    the backup procedure. The SC gathers the climatic parameters from the related
    distributed ledgers. The prediction is made using a fuzzy logic inference system.
    This operation requires a large database for learning, something impossible to
    do by saving only half season data corresponding to the duration of our study.
    For this reason, we have resorted to an external database available since 2019:
    http://www.emy.gr/emy/en/climatology/climatology-city The membership functions
    associated to the inputs and outputs are as shown in the Table 2. By combining
    several values of temperature and humidity, we obtain different levels of electric
    valve opening. Example: for a temperature of 25\\(^\\circ \\) and 69% humidity,
    we have an electric valve opening of 58.3%. The result can be displayed in the
    form of the following graph 5: Fig. 5. Window for fuzzy rule viewer: variation
    of valve position (output) depending on the variation of temperature and humidity
    (inputs). Full size image Fig. 6. Water consumption for the time period of 48
    h. Full size image Table 2. The membership functions associated to input and output
    variables Full size table 5 Discussion The major goal of this research is to create
    a smart trusted system including the processing of various climatic information,
    the display, actuator control, and wireless connectivity. Our system’s operation
    is straight-forward; it consists of a settings or control component and a measuring
    component. The system is set to run on autopilot. When the ground is dry, the
    system is activated automatically by the ESP32 sending a signal to the pump in
    response to an alert from the humidity and temperature sensors. The planning of
    this observation framework was made to allow the monitoring of crop parameters
    during field deployment at different locations on the farm. The designed application
    allows storing and retrieving data at any time from any remote location. Its objective
    was to analyse relevant information in real time on weather parameters while helping
    to organize daily irrigation tasks. In addition, data collected through sensors
    are integrated in the Blockchain to provide security so that no one will be able
    to change the values that influence the decision of the valve position. The automatism
    is translated by the recovery of the climatic values of the sensors and to actuate
    the output of the valve. Intelligence manifests itself in the analysis of the
    different parameters and the decision for the output by fuzzy logic. Because of
    its dual significance, fuzzy logic is used in this module. The proposed design
    was shown to effectively control and monitor agricultural conditions while minimizing
    water waste in empirical tests. As a result, establishing an automatic-sensor-enabled
    architecture system could be a viable approach for reducing water consumption.
    As we can see (Fig. 6) after 48 h of testing the reduction in water consumption
    between manual irrigation and irrigation following our proposal is considerable.
    6 Conclusion This paper provides a convenient interface for the development of
    a smart irrigation monitoring and control system based on the Internet of Things.
    A fully functional system was created and implemented. The main objective of this
    work was to enable farmers to analyse relevant real-time insights to meteorological
    parameters while helping organize everyday irrigation tasks and benchmark results.
    Our system is based on secured wired communication. In addition, wireless communication
    allows farmers to view the results and control certain parameters without having
    to move. Experiments have shown that with the suggested smart irrigation system,
    we can get good outcomes such as cheap manual labour costs and efficient water
    utilization for irrigation. We see several perspectives for the work presented.
    One direction of research would consist of testing the system in another area
    such as intelligent transport and Integration of all functionalities and migration
    to an Irrig Control platform. References Singh, D.K., Sobti, R., Kumar Malik,

    Keywords: horticulture; micronutrient; Industry 4.0; SDGs; IoT; blockchain; real-time
    prediction; AR; bigdata 1. Introduction According to the Food and Agriculture
    Organization and World Health Organization State of Food Security and Nutrition
    in the World (SOFI) report,45 million children die from the deadliest form of
    malnutrition under the age of five [1]. A chronic deficiency of essential nutrients
    in their nutrition has also resulted in delayed development and growth in two
    billion children under the age of five. This indicates that there is a need to
    have more emphasis on overcoming food insecurity and malnutrition due to climate
    extremes and economic disruption. Even the SDGs (SDG 2 and SDG 12) of the UN emphasize
    eradicating hunger and enhancing food security with responsible consumption and
    production toward sustainability [2,3]. Healthy micronutrients for overcoming
    malnutrition can be achieved with sustainable farming of fruits and vegetables,
    i.e., horticulture [4]. India is currently the world’s second-largest producer
    of fruits and vegetables, trailing only China. Horticulture comprises fruits,
    root and tuber crops, mushrooms, vegetables, spices, aromatic plants, flowers,
    bamboo, coconut, cashew, and cocoa. Different strategies such as technology promotion,
    research, post-harvest management, and marketing are key for the growth of horticulture.
    Improving horticulture production, increasing farmer income, improving nutritional
    security, and improving productivity by using quality germplasm, planting material,
    and micro irrigation to save water are the key vision of India for the promotion
    of holistic horticulture growth. Horticulture crops significantly contribute to
    the Indian economy by enhancing farm output, generating employment, and providing
    raw materials to various food-processing businesses [5]. The amount of land allotted
    for horticulture is minimal, but the demand for the production of horticulture
    is high. Therefore, meeting the demand with minimum resources is a bit challenging,
    as sustainable practices need to be adopted to meet a sustainable environment
    [6]. It has also been observed that the export rate of Asian countries such as
    India has increased in the past few years; however, there are a few challenges
    such as meeting quality standards set by international countries and payment for
    exports. The main challenge in fruits and vegetables is the short lifetime after
    plucking. Additionally, given that the majority of horticulture cultivation is
    processed in rural areas, it has been determined that horticulture has to be promoted
    in urban areas. 1.1. Problem Statement Ref. [7] discussed the main problems that
    are present in horticulture, including the decline of fertile soil, global warming,
    rising land prices, shortage of water, and lost opportunity of low-cost labor,
    all of which portray serious threats to growth of horticulture. For horticultural
    crops, abiotic stresses like an inundation, temperature extremes, salinity, pH,
    and drought are major obstacles. As an outcome of global warming, there will be
    less precipitation all in all, and the snow cover will melt faster, resulting
    in extreme drought. These circumstances lead to several stress-related problems,
    including the deficit of fertile soil, flooding, increased evapotranspiration,
    low soil-oxygen levels, decreased production, leachate of nutrients, and slow
    planting. Alongside increasing temperatures, global warming had also contributed
    to record-breaking cold weather. Land salinity and irrigation-water salinity are
    also significant concerns for horticultural production. Along with these problems,
    previous studies also discussed that sustainable pest-management methods need
    to be adopted to protect against pathogens and pest resistance. The absence of
    markets to accumulate production, the substantial percentage of middlemen, the
    absence of marketing institutions safeguarding farmers’ interests, the imperfect
    pricing system, and the absence of transparency in market-information systems,
    especially in the export market, is the main marketing problems for horticultural
    produce. 1.2. Motivation, Novelty, and Contribution of the Study As discussed
    above, the traditional approaches lack appropriate monitoring of pest control,
    water management, soil management, light control, and temperature control, as
    these parameters are crucial for the effective production of horticulture with
    a sustainability aspect. The previous study found that the different issues in
    this group highlight the necessity for more environmentally sound processes, in
    addition to a rise in the utilization of automated systems and accurate processes.
    Industry 4.0 technology has proven its capability in various applications through
    the fusion of advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things, artificial
    intelligence, blockchain, robotics, digital twins, and big data. The amalgamation
    of Industry 4.0 and horticulture provides the opportunity to transform industrial
    agriculture into the next generation, namely Horticulture 4.0. Moreover, Industry
    4.0 is capable of achieving sustainable and intelligent ecosystem with real-time
    management of farming, automation, intelligent decisions, real-time processing,
    and analysis [8]. It has proved that Industry 4.0 technologies have already delivered
    exceptional results in greenhouse farming for a sustainable food supply chain
    with the integration of hardware and software algorithms and giving rise to higher
    yields using fewer resources and less water. Although many studies have addressed
    Industry 4.0 technologies individually for fruits and vegetables, they are limited
    studies that merely address multiple Industry 4.0 digital technologies as single
    concepts for discussing their significance in horticulture. Based on the aforementioned
    information, this study analyzed the value and applications of Industry 4.0 technologies
    in horticulture for real-time monitoring of fruit-and-vegetable conditions in
    various environmental settings, intelligent and predictive analytics for fruit-and-vegetable
    growth and disease estimation, and virtual horticulture plants. The contribution
    of the study is as follows: The significance of using Industry 4.0 technologies
    for horticulture is discussed in the study for sustainability. We also discuss
    the significance and applications of the Internet of Things, cloud computing,
    artificial intelligence, blockchain, and big data for horticulture for enhancing
    traditional practices for disease detection, irrigation management, fertilizer
    management, maturity identification, marketing, and the supply chain, soil fertility,
    and weather patterns at pre-harvest, harvest, and post-harvest Finally, the article
    discusses the challenges and suggests recommendations for the wide adoption of
    any future enhancement in the vicinity of horticulture. In horticulture settings,
    robotics, drones with vision technology and AI for the detection of pests, weeds,
    plant diseases, and malnutrition, and edge-computing portable devices that can
    be developed with IoT and AI for predicting and estimating the disease of crops
    are vital recommendations suggested in the study. 1.3. Methodology of the Study
    In this section, the methodology of the study is presented. Based on the limitations
    identified in previous studies, this study framed a research question that was
    employed to carry out the review. The research question was, “What is the progress
    and significance of Industry 4.0 technology integration in horticulture?” This
    research question constructed various keywords with Boolean function operators
    in the Scopus and Web of Science databases. The following strings were considered
    for obtaining publications: “horticulture AND Industry 4.0”, “horticulture AND
    sustainability”, “Industry 4.0 for fruits and vegetables”, “Industry 4.0 AND digitalization”,
    “horticulture AND digitalization”, “horticulture AND IoT”, “IoT AND fruits and
    vegetables”, “disease detection AND horticulture crop”, “blockchain AND horticulture”,
    “artificial intelligence AND horticulture”, “quality assessment AND artificial
    intelligence”, “big data AND horticulture”, “blockchain AND marketing of fruits
    and vegetables”, “blockchain AND energy”, “crop monitoring AND horticulture”,
    and “soil fertility AND horticulture.” During the search for articles, there was
    al ack of articles that merely emphasized the integration of Industry 4.0 for
    horticulture. Therefore, we considered a few conference articles and other supportive
    articles in this study. Based on the obtained articles, the study categorized
    four different sub-sections in which the progress and significance of the previous
    studies that implemented Industry 4.0 for enhancing horticulture from production
    to marketing are assessed. After analyzing the studies, few limitations were identified
    and vital recommendations for future work were suggested. 1.4. Comparative Analysis
    Table 1 provides a comparative analysis of the different studies that focused
    on horticulture that are analyzed within the proposed study. In most previous
    studies, it was identified that the study only focused on some key areas in horticulture,
    like yield monitoring, pesticide monitoring, and quality assessment. A recent
    study emphasized the different issues in horticulture from the perspective of
    industries. Along with this, [9] reviewed the different critical parameters that
    are required for automation with IoT for vertical gardens. Ref. [10] carried out
    a review on the significance of deep-learning models in horticulture for various
    applications. Ref. [11] discussed the implementation of digital twins in horticulture.
    However, there is a possibility of emphasizing the importance of multiple Industry
    4.0 technologies for addressing the different issues of horticulture from production
    to marketing. The current study focused on discussing the different Industry 4.0
    technologies for overcoming the different issues of horticulture within the context
    of sustainability. This study highlights the significance and application of Industry
    4.0 for horticulture. Based on the limitations identified, this study also discusses
    vital recommendations for future work. Table 1. Comparative analysis of the previous
    studies with the current study. The following describes how the study is structured:
    Section 2 discusses an overview of Horticulture 4.0 and Industry 4.0 technologies,
    Section 3 addresses the intervention of Industry 4.0 technologies in horticulture,
    and Section 4 covers the discussion and recommendations. 2. Overview of Horticulture
    and Industry 4.0 High temperatures have two main effects on crop production: they
    inhibit vegetative growth and have a detrimental effect on fruit production. Prolonged
    transpiration along with subjection to extreme temperatures limits vegetable crops
    that are susceptible to considerable transpiration deficits [16,17]. Another problem
    is that the maximum time for the fruit set is proportional to humidity levels.
    Extremely high temperatures can occur. The obvious limitation encountered by cold
    temperatures is the freezing of plant tissues. Rapidly pushing freezing temperatures
    at a phase of rapid growth might cause damage to a variety of plant tissues [18,19].
    Some plants can adapt to cold temperatures provided there is sufficient time and
    the appropriate circumstances, whereas others cannot. Changes in regional precipitation
    patterns may cause an increase in drought conditions in many different parts of
    the world as atmospheric CO2 levels to rise [20]. Although the current belief
    is that leaf photosynthetic responds to high CO2 as well as soil-water deficiency,
    the connections between CO2 enrichment and drought stress remain unexplored [21].
    These are the few problems that have been addressed by previous studies in the
    area of horticulture. Below, we discuss the significance of Industry 4.0 technologies
    and their importance in enhancing practices in horticulture. Industry 4.0, often
    known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, is the phenomenon that results from
    the impact of the IoT on information and communication technology. With the help
    of technologies like the integration of cyber-physical systems (CPS), IoT, and
    the real-time interaction between machinery, software, and people, it aims to
    revolutionize the industry through smart factories that will enable greater flexibility
    in production needs, efficient resource allocation, and process integration from
    device monitoring to final delivery [22]. Figure 1 depicts the technologies that
    can be intervened in horticulture, such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain,
    big data, the Internet of things (IoT), and cloud computing, in industry 4.0.
    Figure 1 illustrates the implementation and application area in which Industry
    4.0 can be adopted for horticulture. In horticulture, there are different stages,
    including pre-harvesting, harvest, and post-harvest. Industry 4.0 technologies
    cover the following parameters for horticulture: automation of actuators, disease
    detection, irrigation management, fertilizer management, maturity identification,
    marketing and supply chain, soil fertility, and weather patterns. Along with these
    applications, Industry 4.0 integration in horticulture enables quality assessment
    and grading of horticulture products. The quality assessment of horticulture products
    is different in the three stages. The following are aspects through which the
    quality and grading of a horticulture product are decided, and they are typical
    cultivar ripeness, absence of defects and blemishes, a non-harmful number of pesticide
    residues, freshness, and other chemicals. Therefore, the quality assessment and
    grading of horticulture products mainly rely on the parameters discussed above.
    The monitoring of each parameter and utilizing the data generated from different
    wireless sources with Industry 4.0 technologies boost the performance of the horticulture
    industry for the future. Figure 1. Horticulture 4.0. Overview of Technologies
    and TheirFunctions IoT is the primary technology that enables the provision of
    real-time information that is required for other technologies to implement their
    functions. IoT is an open network of intelligent devices that may self-organize;
    exchange information, data, and resources; and respond and act according to circumstances
    and environmental changes [22]. Fundamentally, IoT comprises the following layers
    in its architecture: perception layer, access layer, network layer, middleware
    layer, and application layer [23]. The perception layer is a key layer in which
    sensors, actuators, and identification technologies empower the transmission of
    real-time information and also enable control of things from remote locations
    through internet connectivity. The network layer empowers the transmission of
    packets of data with the assistance of communication protocols that are embedded
    in the architecture. Wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi), Bluetooth, and Zigbee are widely
    used communication protocols to establish a wireless sensor network and connect
    it with the internet to form the IoT [24]. The limitations of these communication
    protocols are the short transmission range and high-power consumption. In view
    of the IoT, most IoT devices are resource-constrained (work on battery power),
    so it demands communication protocols that consume less energy and transmit to
    a long range. A low-power–wide-area network (LPWAN) enables these challenges to
    be overcome, as it meets the requirements of the IoT [25]. Long-range (LoRa),
    Sigfox, and narrowband (NB-IoT) are LPWAN communication technologies. As part
    of the application layer, a cloud server is suitable for visualization, real-time
    monitoring, and applying further analytics on the data available in it.AI is the
    science of enabling computers to accomplish intelligent tasks that could only
    be completed by humans. AI is a multidisciplinary technology capable of combining
    machine learning, cognition, human-computer interaction, emotion recognition,
    data storage, and decision-making [26]. The bottleneck of AI was overcome with
    the advancement of processing power, and the development of deep learning and
    enhanced learning based on huge data progressed. With the constant advancement
    of GPUs has come the successful development of customized processors and increased
    computer capacity; this has established the groundwork for AI’s rapid progress.
    Artificial neural networks (ANNs), decision-support systems (DSSs), genetic algorithms
    (Gas), support-vector machines, and computer vision are some of the AI techniques
    that are widely applied in the field of agriculture for the management of soil,
    crops, disease, and weeds [27]. Big data is defined as data sets that are too
    massive or complicated to be acquired, maintained, and processed in a low-latency
    manner by conventional database systems [28]. Big data has characteristics such
    as high volume, high velocity, and high variety. Big-data analytics can ultimately
    enable better and faster decision-making, model, and forecast future outcomes,
    and improve business intelligence [29]. A distributed, unchangeable database called
    blockchain makes it simpler to track assets and record transactions in a corporate
    network [30]. Distributed ledger technology, immutable records, and smart contracts
    are the key elements of blockchain. Each transaction is logged as a “block” of
    data as it occurs. Each block is linked to the ones that come before and after
    it. Transactions are linked in an irreversible chain Horticulture is utilizing
    the IoT to collect data from field planting and horticultural facilities for production,
    management, and service. Robots, drones, remote sensors, and computer imagery
    are used in horticulture as part of the IoT to monitor crops, survey, and map
    fields, as well as to provide data to farmers for logical farm-management strategies
    that will reduce both time and cost [31]. AI is facilitating various sectors in
    agriculture to enhance productiveness and performance and to overcome traditionally
    demanding situations in each field. The intervention of AI in horticulture is
    helping farmers to improve their farming efficiency and reduce hostile environmental
    impacts [32]. Blockchain horticulture empowers information to be traced throughout
    the food supply chain to improve food safety. The ability of blockchain to store
    and manage data creates traceability, which is utilized to enhance the creation
    and deployment of innovations for intelligent farming and index-based horticultural
    insurance. Improved quality control and food safety are advantages of applying
    blockchain to gardening. Increased supply-chain traceability of farmers’ productivity
    will lead to more equitable payments for farmers [33]. Farmers can learn in-depth
    information about topics like rainfall patterns, water cycles, fertilizer requirements,
    and more thanks to large datasets. Companies can utilize this information to choose
    which crops to produce and when to harvest them in order to maximize their profits
    [34]. Data on horticulture are gathered, examined, and stored using cloud computing.
    Farmers can better understand crop conditions by using cloud-connected wireless
    sensors to collect data from the field and machine-learning algorithms to analyze
    that real-time information [35]. Precision horticultural farming heavily relies
    on augmented reality. Farmers can use augmented reality in horticulture to boost
    production, reduce crop waste, and teach other farmers [36]. 3. Intervention of
    Industry 4.0 in Horticulture In this section, we discuss the various Industry
    4.0 technologies in horticulture intending to transform into Horticulture 4.0.
    3.1. IoT Intervention in Horticulture The potential of pests and plant diseases
    is inseparably associated in particular withspecific weather characteristics.
    Previous research concluded that humidity and rainfall have a significant impact
    on pathogen spread and propagation [37]. Pests and diseases are more inclined
    to spread as a result of the wind. According to the information presented above,
    pests and diseases are prevalent in crops, and monitoring of the related parameters
    can be achieved with the IoT. An intelligent monitoring system was proposed on
    the basis of the IoT with a global packet for radio service (GPRS) and Zigbee
    communication protocol for pest warning, planting works, and production-quality
    checks of apples with the assistance of soil sensors, meteorological sensors,
    and cameras [38]. The feasibility, yield, and irrigation water-use efficiency
    of an IoT-based precision-irrigation system with LoRaWAN technology on fresh-market
    tomato production was analyzed [39]. ET, Watermark 200SS-5 soil-metric potential
    sensors, MP40, and a decision-support system were used to design and test four
    irrigation-scheduling treatments. A study was conducted with the integration of
    a camera module, and the images collected were used to analyze the water-management
    system as well as detect plant disease within a green environment [40]. Researchers
    established a technology platform using the IoT for environmental data acquisition,
    disaster warning, transmission, remote control, and an information push in vegetable
    greenhouses in real-time and lessen the influence of climate catastrophes on vegetable
    development [41]. The data collected by an IoT board are expected to be utilized
    to train machine-learning models for the development of intelligent automated
    indoor microclimate horticulture crops [42]. A database contains the results of
    the sensor analysis and it is also linked with data from the Indonesian Weather
    Agency, which contains daily meteorological data from the cultivation location
    [43]. To ensure the proper operation of the greenhouse automation system, multiple
    measuring stations are needed in a modern greenhouse to identify the local climate
    parameters in various areas of a large-scale greenhouse [44]. The IoT paradigm
    is allowing the scientific community to establish integrated settings where data
    could be automatically transferred among many distinctive networks to provide
    consumers with specific relevant information [45]. The security of the foods supplied
    can be ensured by utilizing the provenance data that are kept throughout the supply
    chain of vegetables, including during planting, harvesting, government oversight,
    testing, transportation, customs clearance, warehousing, repackaging, and internal
    testing [46,47]. Every kind of pest and disease is believed to be harmful to plants
    and to have a serious unfavorable effect on horticulture. To decrease the frequent
    use of pesticides and fungicides and to anticipate when pests will arise, the
    IoT system was created [48]. Soft-computing technologies are used to identify
    fruits by combining the three essential characteristics of an object—color, shape,
    and texture. This method reduces the dimensions of the feature vector. As a result,
    the combined and normalized image features produce better classification accuracy
    with fewer training data [49]. Real-time supply-chain monitoring can give stakeholders
    insight into perishable food to better manage to price and take appropriate action
    to uphold quality requirements [50]. Farmers confront a variety of challenges
    when growing vegetables, including issues with seeds, managing pests and diseases,
    commodity costs, and product marketing. Farmers can use the internet and the concept
    of mobile cloud computing to access information and engage in an interactive dialogue
    about vegetable production through mobile learning [51]. A framework for papaya
    grading based on the Artificial Bee Colony algorithm was proposed to classify
    papaya fruits from digital photographs [52,53]. Figure 2 illustrates an architecture
    that was implemented by previous studies for monitoring different parameters in
    horticulture. As discussed in Section 2, one of the key components of the IoT
    is sensors. Sensors such as temperature, soil moisture, humidity, light intensity,
    pH, NPK, and water level are crucial for obtaining important information about
    the soil and environment. Along with these sensors, the camera module is used
    to obtain data from the horticulture field. The sensors remain the same for the
    indoor and outdoor environments of horticulture cultivation. Data on the soil
    and environment are mapped to obtain better productivity by smart controlling
    of irrigation and fertilizer. Based on the soil data, the crop-yield analysis
    is analyzed, and fertilizers can be used as needed. All of these sensors send
    the soil and environment data to the computing unit, at which point the data-sensor
    processor communicates with the cloud server through a wireless-communication
    protocol and gateway. In the cloud server, the data are visualized on the graphical
    user interface. Figure 2. IoT for horticulture. 3.2. AI in Horticulture Fresh
    and wholesome food is essential for feeding the expanding world population, and
    greenhouses and indoor agricultural techniques play a crucial role in this. In
    the past two decades, hyperspectral imaging research has developed, and in the
    decades to come, its use in horticulture is expected to grow. There are still
    challenges to the applicability. The automated detection of pests and diseases
    in plants empowers the effective monitoring of scalable fruit-and-vegetable crops.
    The detection of pests and diseases at the right time enhances pest- and disease-management
    systems [54]. The previous study concluded that AI algorithms can be implemented
    in horticulture for distinct applications, including fruit detection, pest, disease
    detection, weed detection, plant-stress detection, and yield prediction through
    the spectroscopy-and-camera system [55]. A study was implemented to identify common
    pests and diseases in apple fruit using sparse coding. Computer-vision techniques
    can identify pest- and disease-damaged fruits and provide data to assist in the
    detection and treatment of diseases and pests in the early stages [56]. Soil-organic-carbon
    (SOC) monitoring is a crucial characteristic of soil quality because it directly
    determines soil fertility and enables sustainable soil-nutrient management [57].
    To improve SOC prediction, artificial neural networks (ANN), cubist regression,
    support-vector machines (SVM), multiple linear regression (MLR), and random forests
    (RF) were applied to the data of soil-nutrient indicators, total catchment area,
    and the topographic-wetness index. Automatic detection of plant pests and diseases
    can aid in the monitoring of large farms and gardens. The application of AI in
    the drying process of fruits and vegetables has received a lot of attention because
    it can generate better-dried fruit-and-vegetable products when combined with an
    efficient physical field [58,59].An IoT-based tool can determine whether a climacteric
    fruit has been artificially ripened or not. To determine whether the fruit is
    ripened artificially or naturally, machine-learning algorithms are applied [60].
    We discuss these techniques and discuss the significance of combining computer-vision
    techniques with an autonomous robotic system that uses the deep-learning concept
    of artificial intelligence [61]. In order to reduce food waste, one study used
    sensors and analyzed gases produced by certain food products to detect rotten
    food at an early stage and boost accuracy. To forecast how frequently food will
    degrade, the researchers used machine learning, the IoT, and sensors. To assess
    the freshness of food, this study used ML and IoT. The implementation of vision-based
    hardware in robots enables the realization of intelligent spraying, crop-yield
    prediction and price forecasting, predictive insights, and disease diagnosis (Figure
    3). In addition, during the supply chain, the AI-based IoT system enables the
    indoor environment conditions to be adjusted on the basis of external climatic
    conditions and travel time to avoid the spoilage of fruit and vegetables. Figure
    3. AI in horticulture and farming. Table 2 illustrates the different studies that
    implement AI for horticulture crops for disease detection, quality assessment,
    and grading. The table provides the different algorithms that have been implemented
    for feature selection, feature extraction, classification, and regression for
    identifying defects, bruising quality assessment, and grading of the fruit. Different
    studies have used different feature-selection and feature-extraction techniques
    such as random frog, random forest, linear discriminant analysis-based fully convolutional
    networks, competitive adaptive reweighted sampling–successive projection algorithms,
    uninformative variable elimination, successive projection algorithm, gray histograms,
    and gray-level co-occurrence matrices. Classification and regression techniques
    include least-squares support-vector machines, support vector machines, convolutional
    neural networks, logistic regression, random forest, multilayer perceptron, linear
    discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbors, and backpropagation in the neural
    network. Table 2. AI for horticulture crops. Table 3 illustrates AI implementation
    in horticulture with accuracy and data-acquisition parameters. The previous studies
    illustrate that AI has been implemented for multiple applications such as quality
    assessment of fruit by evaluating moisture levels in the fruits. Following these
    studies, AI was used to forecast the yield of fruits such as bananas and blueberries.
    A few studies implemented AI for the detection and segmentation of apple fruits
    and branches in orchards through fused convolutional features, ResNet-101, clustering-RCNN,
    and CNN. The accuracy of different classifiers is illustrated in the table, and
    SVM, KNN, and DT achieved 100%. During the classification of tomato diseases,
    CNN achieved 99.18% accuracy on the dataset formed from 14,828 images. In the
    detection of citrus fruits, the CNN applied to the UAV images achieved 96.24%
    accuracy. Table 3. AI implementation for horticulture with accuracy and data-acquisition
    sources. 3.3. Blockchain Blockchain is a distributed-ledger technology with the
    advantage of being tamper-resistant to information. It is anticipated to be able
    to address the issue of resource allocation for transactions among numerous unreliable
    parties in the supply chain for fresh fruit [76]. One potential method for supply-chain
    traceability in the pineapple industry is blockchain technology. The fruit-chain
    protocol that was introduced has identical consistency and liveliness qualities
    as assuming an honest majority of computer power [77] and is roughly fair with
    an overwhelming probability. Although blockchain might be viewed as a viable option
    for food-chain traceability, it was determined that [78] the goal of the investigation
    was to learn more about blockchain technology and its potential applications in
    the retail industry. Additionally, potential blockchain uses that might help the
    retail sector and the wider industry are foreseen. The study also underlined the
    crucial role that blockchain technology plays in the retail sector for fruit as
    well as the connections between these aspects [79]. Figure 4 shows blockchain
    technology in horticulture. The blockchain enables a distributed network to be
    established among the different entities in the supply chain for real-time monitoring
    and tracking of the activities from any location that is immutable and transparent.
    Blockchain empowers digital and secure trading to be created by incorporating
    smart contracts between entities. In addition, blockchain enables the realization
    of secured transactions of the export of fruits and vegetables in the international
    market. The quality and standards of the fruits and vegetables that are set by
    international bodies can be protected with secured hash cryptography. Figure 4.
    Blockchain technology in horticulture. Consumers are driving an entirely different
    transformation in food procurement as a consequence of the growth in global food
    catastrophes that are triggering health insecurity. Consumers have called for
    transparency, traceability, and attentiveness along the entire fruit supply chain.
    The importance of the supply chain in this industry is increased by the fact that
    the products are perishable and have a limited shelf life. Yields are impacted
    by inconsistent delivery and a lack of fertilizers and insecticides as a result
    of dependence on middlemen, market instability, and other factors. Increased costs
    for input and transportation, post-harvest losses, and problems with safety and
    quality dominating supply-chain losses are key challenges involved in the fruit
    supply chain. Blockchain integration in the fruit supply chain (Figure 5) allows
    for post-harvest and inventory management streamlining, increasing operational
    effectiveness and lowering losses. End-to-end traceability with QR codes on the
    fruits presents the final customer with an honest and reliable narrative. A fair
    price for the producers is ensured by the grouping and collaboration of all stakeholders
    on a single platform, which fosters confidence and transparency. Real-time data
    collection allows for simple tracking and tracing, which helps with recall management.
    In addition to this, blockchain is used for monitoring the pre-harvest process
    for yield and quality. Post-harvest management for monitoring the crucial phases
    to prevent losses and boost output, monitoring a set of procedures for confirming
    sustainable practices, and digital records that cannot be altered and display
    accurate information are necessary to meet legal requirements. Figure 5. Applications
    of blockchain for Horticulture 4.0. 3.4. Big Data in Horticulture A multi-sensor
    network system was established to accumulate smaller ecological statistical data
    on vegetable-growing regions. Researchers were able to identify the critical components
    pushing pest spread using multidimensional information such as environment, soil,
    meteorology of vegetable fields, and ultimately the vegetable-pest warning system
    premised on multidimensional big data [80]. The distinctive nutrition-based vegetable-production
    and -distribution system utilizes the inventive big-data framework and its multiple
    benefits to provide a healthful food recommendation to the end customer as well
    as various predictive analyses to boost system efficacy [45]. The new ICT horticulture
    project will heavily rely on big-data methodologies; therefore, it is important
    to understand how to manage them and how they could affect everyday business [81]
    Big-data intervention in horticulture is presented in Figure 6. Because fruits
    and vegetables are produced in such large quantities, the sensor data that are
    available and can be used in horticulture are now considered big data. The big
    data can be transmitted to the cloud server and made available in a distribution
    box and control box through wireless-communication protocols. Figure 6. Big-data
    overview in horticulture. 4. Results In this section, the results identified from
    the analysis of previous studies based on Industry 4.0 integration for horticulture
    monitoring are discussed. The IoT is predominantly used in horticulture to monitor
    various pests and diseases that are harmful to plants and have a serious negative
    impact on horticulture. The Internet of Things system was configured to minimize
    the frequency with which pesticides and fungicides are used and to predict when
    pests will appear. Along with this, IoT and cloud computing are employed to identify
    fruits by combining an object’s three essential characteristics—color, shape,
    and texture. Farmers face a variety of challenges when growing vegetables, including
    seed issues, pest-and-disease management, commodity costs, and product marketing.
    Farmers can access information and engage in an interactive process about vegetable
    production through the internet and the concept of the mobile cloud. AI in horticulture
    enables the detection of diseases, quality assessment, and grading of horticulture
    crops. Linear discriminant analysis-based fully convolutional networks, random
    forest, competitive adaptive reweighted sampling–successive projection algorithm,
    uninformative variable elimination, successive projection algorithm, and gray-level
    co-occurrence matrix have been used for feature extraction and selection. Least-squares
    support-vector machine, support-vector machine, convolutional neural networks,
    logistic regression, random forest, multilayer perceptron, and k-nearest neighbors
    are the key techniques used for classification and regression. Yields are impacted
    by inconsistent delivery and a lack of fertilizers and insecticides as a result
    of dependence on middlemen, market instability, and other factors. Increased input
    and transportation costs, post-harvest losses, and safety and quality issues dominate
    supply-chain losses. However, the incorporation of blockchain improves pre-harvest
    and post-harvest management through real-time tracing and secure transactions
    in the distributed network. 5. Discussion and Recommendation In this section,
    based on the discussion of the analysis above, we discuss the recommendations
    for applications in horticulture as part of future work. A few vital recommendations
    are as follows: When considering long-term benefits like improved production and
    automation, the use of the IoT in horticulture is strongly advised and very successful.
    The Internet of Drones enables horticulture operations to be improved. The Internet
    of Drones is an architecture intended to focus on providing UAVs, also commonly
    known as drones, with coordinated connectivity to controlled airspace. Drones
    for horticulture are used to monitor fields, plant crops, irrigate fields, spray
    pesticides, and also to assess the health of plants [82,83]. Moreover, drones
    with vision-based technology and AI empower the detection of weeds and identify
    the stages of the growth of plants in pre-harvest, harvest, and post-harvest.
    Drones can be used to monitor the quality assessment and grading of horticulture
    crops to minimize the damage and loss of the product during transportation and
    storage. Robotics leverage AI technology to improve harvest quality and precision.
    In horticulture settings, robotics with vision technology and AI for the detection
    of pests, plant diseases, and malnutrition. Before choosing which herbicide to
    apply in a region, AI can detect and target weeds through the visuals obtained
    from the camera module inserted into robots. A wide range of issues in the farming
    sector can be resolved by using an amalgamation of robots and AI approaches [84].
    In addition to this, currently, different robots with AI technology are used for
    weed removal and plucking, sorting, and packaging of fruits [85]. Globally, horticulture
    supply chains have an exciting opportunity to improve transactional efficiency,
    reduce resistance, and promote traceability thanks to blockchain technology [80].
    Blockchain technology can help the horticulture and food industry deal with and
    control known risks while maintaining affordability across the ecosystem. Blockchain
    in horticulture enables the linking of various horticultural entities for the
    visualization of data from production to supply on distributed-ledger networks.
    Granular information on rainfall patterns, water cycles, fertilizer requirements,
    and more are made available to farmers through big data. This enables them to
    make wise decisions, such as which plants to sow for greater profitability and
    when to harvest. Making the proper choices ultimately increase crop output. The
    fundamental goal of precision horticulture is to guarantee profitability, efficacy,
    and sustainability [86]. In horticulture, edge computing is employed for different
    activities. Edge computing can be utilized to analyze the data at the edge of
    a network for better monitoring and productivity. Mobile edge computing (MEC)
    is an architecture that provides cloud-computing services at the edge of networks
    leveraging mobile base stations [87,88]. Currently, different study areas have
    implemented edge-computing-based portable devices in order to predict what is
    useful for the user in enhancing their practices [89,90]. In the scenario of horticulture,
    an edge-computing-based portable device can be developed with IoT and AI for predicting
    and estimating disease in a crop. Based on the analysis and prediction, it can
    also communicate to the user on the cloud server and the respective horticulture
    authorities to suggest a solution in real-time. Figure 7 illustrates a hybrid
    architecture that is implemented in horticulture with the amalgamation of the
    IoT, cloud computing, AI/ML, blockchain, and big data. This architecture enables
    a smart and intelligent ecosystem to be achieved in horticulture with multiple
    features such as blockchain-assisted marketing, prediction of international markets,
    and the quality of fruits and vegetables based on real-time environmental data.
    The generated output and sensor data can then be distributed in the peer-to-peer
    network of any location. Figure 7. Hybrid architecture for Horticulture 4.0. 6.
    Conclusions Horticulture is the field of cultivation of fruits and vegetables.
    It ensures production and consumption by minimizing malnutrition in the current
    scenario addressed by United Nations. Recently, Industry 4.0 technologies have
    delivered the ability of digitalization and realize the SDGs set by the United
    Nations. The previous studies did not highlight the significance and application
    of Industry 4.0 for distinct issues of horticulture. Based on this limitation,
    the current study addressed the significance and application of Industry 4.0 technologies
    such as the Internet of Things, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain,
    and big data for horticulture to enhance traditional practices of disease detection,
    irrigation management, fertilizer management, maturity identification, marketing,
    and supply chain, soil fertility, and weather patterns at pre-harvest, harvest,
    and post-harvest. The findings of the study are as follows: in horticulture, the
    IoT is primarily used to monitor various pests and diseases that are harmful to
    plants and have a serious negative impact on horticulture. In addition, IoT and
    cloud computing is used to identify fruits by combining three essential characteristics
    of an object: color, shape, and texture.AI in horticulture has enabled the detection
    of diseases, quality assessment, and crop grading. For feature extraction and
    selection, we used fully convolutional networks, a random forest, and a competitive
    adaptive reweighted sampling–successive projection algorithm based on linear discriminant
    analysis. The key techniques used for classification and regression are the least-squares
    support-vector machine, support-vector machine, convolutional neural networks,
    logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, and k-nearest neighbors. Inconsistent
    delivery and a lack of fertilizers and insecticides as an outcome of dependence
    on middlemen, market instability, and other factors have a negative impact on
    yields. Increased input and transportation costs, post-harvest losses, and safety
    and quality issues that dominate supply-chain losses can be overcome with blockchain
    during-harvest and post-harvest management. Finally, the study suggested vital
    recommendations for future works, such as robotics; drones with vision technology
    and AI for the detection of pests, weeds, plant diseases, and malnutrition; and
    edge computing portable devices developed with the IoT and AI for predicting and
    estimating disease in crops. Author Contributions Conceptualization, R.S. (Rajesh

  description: Irrigation is an essential agronomic practice in intensive apple production.
    Under the predicted scenario of climate change and increased pressure for sustainability
    in the future, irrigation is becoming more important. The practical use of soil
    moisture sensors could support farmers in improving irrigation scheduling. Recent
    technical advances in wireless communication, such as Long Range Wide Area Networks
    (LoRaWAN), allow real-time data transfer from field sensors to the user. The management
    of such sensors is facilitated by their low power requirement and absence of direct
    on-site data storage via data loggers. The main goal of the pilot study “Smart
    Land South Tyrol” was to test the implementation of a system of soil moisture
    sensors, data transfer by LoRaWAN, and data visualization on a Smartphone Application.
    The project partners, Research Center Laimburg, Advisory Service Beratungsring,
    and the company Alperia worked since 2019 together to achieve this goal. A sensor
    network of 120 soil moisture sensors was established within the apple growing
    area of South Tyrol near Bolzano, Italy. Data were collected during the growing
    seasons 2019 and 2020. At the same time, the data flow system from the sensors
    to the database backend was technically improved. Finally, the technical basis
    for future DLT/blockchain-based data trails validation has been prepared.

    IEEE Conference Location: Yogyakarta, Indonesia SECTION I. Introduction IoT is
    one of leading technology in industrial era 4.0 which has been implemented in
    various sectors for promoting industrial automation and intelligence such as agriculture,
    environment, health, housing, energy, business, etc. Besides that, agriculture
    has been contributed to an economy in every country [1]. So that, smart agriculture
    is popular nowadays. One of prior issues in agriculture is irrigation. Irrigation
    is process of watering crops with amount of water[2]. In smart agriculture, smart
    irrigation system is an essential solution to monitor the crops by using IoT sensor
    to capture several parameters. IoT is commonly used to transmit the sensing data
    which is then stored in the database. However, when multiple IoT devices track
    different parameters, the variation and the different data format cause the complexity
    increased. So, it can influence the data quality such as missing reading, inconsistency
    and accuracy, and ambiguity in large data [3]. In addition, those factors can
    influence the provenance and the integrity of data. Most existing research focused
    on implementing IoT to monitor any kind of agriculture processes remotely. It
    can maximize profit and reduce cost to manage several parameters in Irrigation
    such as temperature, humidity, etc. By using IoT, the collected data can be observed,
    analysed, and generalized for long time [4]. Many IoT platforms for precision
    agriculture especially in monitoring irrigation have been proposed for different
    kind of scenarios [5] [6]. However, smart irrigation needs lightweight, scalable,
    and security. Furthermore, by storing data from a large number of gadgets and
    enabling the creation of parties even without a governmental fog, blockchain networks
    can track, arrange, and bear out interactions [7]. To overcome these issues, blockchain
    as distributed ledger technology (DLT) present a new paradigm to eliminate any
    failure and increase data transparency and immutability. Blockchain has overcame
    problem in various sector, including health, finance, and energy [8]. The numerous
    agriculture applications connected with blockchain technological such as agri-food
    supply chain traceability [9], agricultural product tracking [10], smart greenhouse
    [11], etc. Furthermore, the use of Blockchain Technology in irrigation structures
    benefited society in a range of methods, including maintaining accountability
    of data and ensure transparency and data security or visibility. This paper proposes
    the implementation of blockchain in irrigation based IoT sensor data by using
    Ethereum to ensure irrigation data security. The rest of the paper organized as
    in Section 1 for introduction. Section 2 describes the related work and issues
    of IoT in agriculture. The architecture proposed is explained in Section 3. The
    experimental result is explained in Section 4, and the conclusion is described
    in Section 5. SECTION II. Related Work IoT has been widely used in various sector,
    including agriculture. In smart agriculture, IoT sensors as parameters are stored
    and processed to monitor soil quality, water management, crop growing condition,
    etc remotely. It can improve the efficiency by reducing time and cost. In smart
    agriculture, smart irrigation system is an essential solution to monitor the crops
    by using IoT sensor to capture several parameters. Several research have been
    conducted to answer issues in smart irrigation. Paper [12] proposed IOT to monitor
    and schedule irrigation through a web page. Furthermore, machine learning and
    IoT are used in Smart Irrigation to enhance farming process [13] [14]. Similarly,
    smart water management and weather condition become one of prior process in agriculture
    [15]–[17] which has been explained in detail. However, that research of agriculture,
    still have security issues like secure processing of the collected data. Besides
    that, Blockchain comes to solve most of the Internet of things challenges related
    to security and reliability. Blockchain technology is a decentralized/ distributed
    network where each is connected to others. A block consists of lots of valid transaction
    and its associated attributes. Blockchain technology has been used to solved challenges
    from different domains such as financial [18] [19], health [20], and energy [21]
    [22], to mention but a few. In the agriculture sector, Blockchain is being applied
    in various sector [23] such as supply chain management systems to provide transparency,
    security, neutrality, and reliability of all the operations in a supply chain
    [24] [25], smart greenhouse farm [16]. The irrigation data can easily be stored
    quickly by the IoT. In addition, this research proposes implementation of blockchain
    in irrigation based IoT sensor data by using Ethereum to ensure irrigation data
    security. SECTION III. Method A. Private Blockchain Network Blockchain is a distributed
    data storage which is a process of interaction between actors that can be used
    in data management in various fields. The blockchain network is divided into three,
    consisting of public, private, and permitted. Public blockchains allow anyone
    to access the blockchain network, private blockchain access is closed only to
    certain users, whereas permitted blockchains allow anyone to access it as long
    as they have permission to do so. in this study we use an Ethereum-based private
    blockchain using a consensus proof of authority. Figure 1. Proposed architecture
    illustration using blockchain ethereum Show All The architecture of our proposed
    research can be seen in Figure 1. There are four entity blocks in the architecture.
    The first is IoT Sensor, which is a node that sends sensor data to the blockchain
    network using the MQTT protocol. Ethereum based blockchain network where software
    can store IoT data sent to the Ethereum Blockchain network. The data repository
    stores all the results of the Ethereum Blockchain network process. then the last
    one is the user is the user who monitors. SECTION IV. Result and Discussion In
    this experiment, private blockchain network is constructed and tested in several
    scenarios. A. Private Blockchain Network Construction API collection is used to
    connect smart farm application and running system to monitor the data. The endpoint
    is stored several parameters in JSON format as shown in Table 1 Table 1. Parameter
    list of rest api MQTT endpoint is adjusted to the gateway which has been determined
    in Smart Farm gateway. This application subscribe data to the specific endpoint
    where the data format has been determined according to the parameter listed. To
    assure the system runs smoothly, web app is constructed to show data saved in
    blockchain as shown in Figure 2 Figure 2. Homepage to show blockchain data Show
    All In this experiment, private blockchain network is constructed based on Ethereum
    with consensus proof of authority by using four nodes namely: two authorized node
    for signer which have authority to write the transaction in block and two unauthorized
    node which does not have an authority as shown in Figure 3. Figure 3. Private
    blockchain network architecture Show All Figure 4. Four nodes of docker container
    Show All Figure 5. Four nodes of memory using Show All Figure 4 shows the implementation
    of four nodes in Docker Container. Besides, Figure 5 shows memory using of four
    nodes. B. Private Blockchain Network Testing There are three scenarios used in
    the experiment testing, namely: software unit testing, smart contract testing,
    and data integrity testing. a. Software Unit Testing Software unit testing monitors
    the performance of IoT and Blockchain reading and writing process. As shown in
    Table 2. There are four scenarios used to test the functional performance. Experimental
    result shows that four scenarios are successfully run. Table 2. Software unit
    testing scenarios b. Smart Contract Smart contract testing is used to prevent
    any fault after deploying process. In this experiment, assertion library chai
    is used. In addition, there are three scenarios used to test the performance.
    Experimental result shows that three scenarios are successfully run as shown in
    Table 3. Table 3. Smart contract testing scenarios c. Data Integrity Testing From
    the previous discussion, data integrity testing can be done by checking the hash
    chain from the block that stores transactions to the first block or whether the
    genesis block is connected. Furthermore, ten datasets are created using the generator
    program and stored the data then. For each block, network creates a new block
    with an interval of 15 seconds. Figure 6. Ten transaction is generated in fifteen
    seconds interval Show All Therefore, the data will be stored at 15 second intervals
    to ensure each data is stored in a different block. After storing the blocks,
    hash is going to be checked by looking the hash data in the block that stores
    transaction data. Furthermore, the application checks whether it can be verified
    that the block is connected to the first block or genesis block as shown in Figure
    7 Figure 7 Shows one of example of last blocks transaction. Show All There are
    10 transactions in block which is written from block 5 to block 16. Figure 8.
    Result data Show All Figure 8 shows result of private blockchain network. Table
    4. Comparison of hash and previous hash Table 4 shows that hash of each block
    is connected from block 0 to 14. So that, the implementation of blockchain as
    a media to store integrity of agriculture data based on IoT becomes one of solution
    which can be implemented. SECTION V. Conclusion This paper was taken up to build
    an integration of Block chain and IoT to ensure the integrity of Irrigation sensor
    data. Ethereum-based blockchain with using consensus proof-of-work as a blockchain
    network is used to ensure integrity data. Experimental result shows that the data
    integrity is safely stored in private blockchain network 100%. For the future
    work, the process can be integrated with machine learning to achieve better performance
    in managing irrigation data. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research has been supported by

    as the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, big data, artificial intelligence,
    decision support systems, etc. Wearable sensor technologies, real-time monitoring
    systems tracking whole conditions of animals in livestock, the IoT-based irrigation
    and fertilization systems that help enhance the efficiency of irrigation processes
    and minimize water and fertilizer losses in agricultural fields and greenhouses,
    blockchain-based electronic agriculture, and solutions based on drones and robotics
    that reduce herbicide and pesticide use are handled systematically. Moreover,
    renewable energy technologies to be provided synergy between technologies such
    as agrivoltaics and aquavoltaics combining food and energy production in rural
    are explained, besides solar-powered pivot and drip irrigation systems and environmental
    monitoring systems. As a result, for a sustainable future, technological innovations
    that increase crop productivity and improve crop quality, protect the environment,
    provide efficient resource use and decrease input costs can help us facing in
    agriculture of today overwhelm many the economic, social, and environmental challenges.

  description: A large amount of freshwater is consumed to irrigate crops. IoT-based
    automatic irrigation systems are needed to reduce water consumption. Security
    and privacy issues, factors concerning climate conditions, and real-time soil
    and air features that affect irrigation control make the development of such system
    challenging. This study introduces a cloud-connected, secure multi-crop smart
    irrigation system (SMCSIS) to address the excessive irrigation problem caused
    by precipitation after irrigation and to reduce water consumption. SMCSIS makes
    real-time watering decision on the basis of soil moisture predicted at the time
    of precipitation. The prediction depends on the data captured from soil moisture
    sensor and climate prediction-based estimated evaporation. An artificial neural
    network is developed and trained using five factors (air temperature, wind speed
    and direction, UV, and humidity) captured from online weather forecasting to obtain
    the estimate evaporation. A database containing the characteristics and irrigation
    information for each crop is also developed for multi-crop irrigation. Access
    control and blockchain technologies are used to maintain privacy and data integrity
    in the system. A prototype has been developed to simulate the system for small
    farms. Experimental results indicate that SMCSIS is functional, and it provides
    an effective solution to overcome excessive irrigation.

    sources and pathways (PSP) is crucial to ensure both environmental and food safety.
    This study uses an integrated framework based on the Internet of Things (IoT)
    and the blockchain technology that incorporates a directed acyclic graph (DAG)-configured
    wireless sensor network (WSN), and GIS tools for real-time water pollution source
    tracing. Water quality sensors were installed at monitoring stations in irrigation
    channel systems within the study area. Irrigation water quality data were delivered
    to databases via the WSN and IoT technologies. Blockchain and GIS tools were used

    (EC) and copper (Cu2+) polluted sources and pathways in upstream irrigation water.
    With the BPST process, the WASP model effectively simulated EC and Cu2+ concentration
    data to identify likely EC and Cu2+ pollution sources. The study framework is
    the first application of blockchain technology for effective real-time water quality

    with the PSP are immutable. Keywords: Internet of Things; pollution source trace;
    blockchain; GIS; pollution pathway; wireless sensor network 1. Introduction Illegal
    wastewater discharge due to rapid industrialization has resulted in heavy metal
    contamination in farmlands via irrigation channels. It is a severe threat to the
    environment, agricultural production, and public health [1,2,3]. Although rapid
    identification of irrigation water pollution sources and pathways (PSP) is key
    to managing irrigation water quality for agricultural production, it is an extremely
    difficult task in agricultural areas that are located within industrialized areas
    [4,5,6]. A real-time water quality monitoring network can collect water quality
    information at set (or at network) locations in real-time (or at regular intervals)
    and can provide monitoring data for both current status analysis and water quality
    trend forecasts. Potential pollution sources can then be identified [7,8], enabling
    the emergency disposal of pollutants in contaminated areas [9]. Moreover, a system
    that allows PSP tracing is essential to providing authorities with real-time documentation
    that narrows the scope of likely pollution sources for rapid identification and
    isolation of irrigation water pollution and pathways; and for protecting agricultural
    production environments. Furthermore, real-time identification and isolation of
    PSP are necessary for water quality management and control actions [6,8]. Pollution
    event data should be secured for further actions such as tracing and recording
    PSP without risk of data tampering. Recently, blockchain technology has been widely
    utilized in many fields such as healthcare for medical data [10,11]; food production
    tracing [12,13]; and has been proposed for application to irrigation water resource
    management [6,14]. Blockchain technology provides significant security advantages
    such as user authentication through public keys and digital fingerprints, data
    immutability, and transaction transparency with traceability characteristics [15,16].
    Since all transactions use hash functions and use hash values as fingerprints,
    a blockchain ensures that data cannot be changed. Critical information storage
    (e.g., pollution event data) and transactions can be delegated to the blockchain,
    while endpoint devices or platforms can remain ‘dumb’, untrusted, and require
    very little maintenance [17]. Blockchain technology’s robust consensus-based security
    architecture that does not require a central certifying authority also renders
    it particularly suitable for the authentication of ownership rights [17,18]. Accordingly,
    blockchain transaction records can reference uploaded and secured data [19,20].
    Currently, the two most used blockchain transaction models are the unspent transaction
    output (UTXO) model and the account-based model. Just as blockchain technology
    used with Internet of Things (IoT) technology provides a way to trace a product’s
    lifecycle from raw materials used, to end production [21]; these technologies
    can be used to trace a pollution event from the pollution source, through its
    pathways, to the polluted area. Blockchain technology used with IoT and sensor
    networks, however, can potentially identify PSP. Moreover, pollution event data
    can be secured by blockchain technology. Integrating effective real-time tools
    with real-time water quality monitoring data can improve the identification of
    irrigation PSP. Wireless sensor networks (WSN) have been developed using various
    sensors in different fields in order to provide high-quality real-time remote
    monitoring data [22] since traditionally conducted field investigations are often
    time-consuming and labor-intensive. In agriculture studies, WSN has been used
    for monitoring environmental conditions; scheduling irrigation based on real-time
    network data; controlling environmental conditions and parameters to improve cropping
    processes, and improving production quantity and quality [23,24]. A water quality
    simulation program using WSN data, however, can also be a useful tool to effectively
    predict point source pollution in irrigation channels since the location, time,
    and source (i.e., source tracing) of water quality contamination can be determined
    using sensor data [6,25,26]. Furthermore, a water quality sensor network with
    WSN can collect application-oriented data, and provide real-time information for
    agricultural and environmental monitoring [6]. Wireless sensor networks with blockchain
    technology then provide an effective way to identify and isolate PSP. Still, a
    real-time irrigation water quality monitoring system with WSN, which is also a
    geographic information system (GIS), could simultaneously monitor irrigation water
    quality and quantity, spatially identify pollution sources, and track source locations.
    Recently, GIS, Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, and WSN have been utilized
    in various fields such as agriculture systems monitoring, flood risk analysis
    prediction, and urban systems monitoring [27,28]. This is because GIS technology
    is a powerful tool for spatial and temporal data analysis that has already been
    widely applied to identify contaminants in surface water [29,30,31]. Once a likely
    pollution area is identified with GIS, authorities can focus their investigation
    on the sources within the vicinity of the polluted wastewater discharge (e.g.,
    specific factories). Additionally, different deterministic, stochastic, and statistical
    models have also been used, at regionally and local scales, to identify various
    PSP through agricultural irrigation channels [4]. For example, the Water Quality
    Analysis Simulation Program (WASP), developed by the US Environmental Protection
    Agency, is a dynamic compartment-modeling program for aquatic systems. In the
    last two decades, WASP has been applied in several environmental studies to estimate
    impacts of nutrient loads on agricultural activities; or to examine the fate and
    transport of environmental pollutants [25,32]. The model, however, has been widely
    used in water quality simulation including surface water heavy metal concentration
    simulations [33,34,35]; and can be used to structure one-, two-, and three-dimensional
    models to help users interpret and predict water quality responses to natural
    phenomena and man-made pollution, for various pollution management decisions [36].
    Users can also use the model to develop new kinetic and reactive structures. Industries
    have been occasionally implicated in discharging wastewater into irrigation channels
    in some of Taiwan’s agricultural areas [1]. Expressly, Lin et al. indicated that
    pollutants, such as heavy metals, may be delivered through irrigation channels
    into certain paddy fields in Taiwan. The aim of this study then is to develop
    a GIS integrated blockchain-based traceability system in order to identify PSP
    with a “blockchained” irrigation WSN. Furthermore, we simulated pollution concentration
    using WASP to trace wastewater discharge concentrations from highly likely pollution
    sources at irrigation units within our study area. The computational complexity
    analysis was done by using the big O notation. 2. Materials and Methods This study
    employs a “backward pollution source tracing (BPST)” process to identify PSP.
    We developed a framework for pollution source tracing comprised of an IoT real-time
    monitoring system with sensors which form a WNS (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3
    and Figure 4) arranged as a directed acyclic graph (DAG); a blockchain real-time
    data tracing platform; a GIS spatial tracing tool; and a WASP model (Figure 1).
    Real-time water quality data are monitored and delivered by the IoT system, as
    shown in Figure S1 (see Supplementary). If the monitored water quality exceeds
    the regulation standard, then blockchain tracing processes are triggered, and
    real-time monitoring data are used to trace the pollution pathway. The GIS spatial
    tracing tool then uses a GIS-based irrigation channel system data to verify and
    spatially trace the pollution pathway. Finally, the WASP model simulates pollution
    concentrations along the pathway, from the sensor intake location to the pollution
    source. Figure 1. Flowchart of the data uploading process for the identification
    of pollution events and potential sources. Note: Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG);

    between monitoring stations as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with the corresponding
    topological sort order (a) stream system, (b) DAG, (c) Sort. The concentrations
    of pH, temperature, Electrical Conductivity (EC), Cadmium (Cd), Copper (Cu2+),
    Zinc (Zn), Nickel (Ni), and Lead (Pb) in irrigation water have been measured by
    the sensors. The proportions of the above measurements greater than the regular
    standards are presented in Figure S1. The EC and Cu2+ concentrations were frequently
    greater than the regulation standards during our study period (Figure S1). Moreover,
    high EC and Cu2+ concentrations have also been reported in previous investigations
    that include the local irrigation association in the study area [6]. Accordingly,
    EC and copper ion (Cu2+) concentration data from April 2018, indicating irrigation
    water quality in excess of the regulation standards, were selected as real-time
    monitoring system examples for the proposed framework. The data were subjected
    to the BPST process in order to identify potential pollution sources. The blockchain-based
    system was developed using G-Coin [37] The system issues a license to an address
    which becomes a pollution coin issuer in this study. If the water concentrations
    are greater than the standard allows, the pollution coin issuer “mints” a digital
    coin and sends the coin to the station address. Since EC and Cu2+ were considered
    the two focal pollutants for this study, two types of pollution coins were issued
    in the system. Transaction inputs and outputs with regard to the blockchain real-time
    tracing platform are shown in Figure 1. In the blockchain transaction records,
    an “address” refers to one of two kinds of addresses used, namely “station address”
    and “collection address”, both of which either send or receive “pollution coins”
    at each transaction. A station address receives pollution coins and sends coins
    to upstream station addresses that are polluted. There is a one-to-one relationship
    between a monitoring station and its station address so that each monitoring station
    refers to a unique station address. When a monitoring station’s real-time water
    quality concentration data exceeds the regulation standard, a transaction between
    its downstream monitoring station (or coin issuer) and its station address is
    generated: the datum is time-stamped, thereby marking the collection address (and
    point in time hereafter “time point”) that all issued “pollution coins” were sent
    to the station address for future analysis. Collection addresses are stations
    that receive pollution coins and record the time point for the pollution event.
    That is, when a time point is triggered, thus marking a collection address, a
    station address is then generated. Figure 1 is a flow chart of the transaction
    process, which is divided into two stages: pre-processing and station operations.
    The system completes a full round of this uploading process for each time point
    generated. In the pre-processing phase, station addresses are sorted. When a time
    point is triggered, pollution coins are issued, thus linking pollution coins to
    the station address (hereafter, “coin address”), and sha256 hash values are generated
    and recorded in UNIX time as private keys that correspond to the coin address.
    Sorting is a necessary first step since the system runs from downstream stations
    to upstream stations. For this reason, a DAG of the stations is made according
    to the upstream-downstream station relationships. The DAG is defined as follows:
    ‘if there is an edge (u, v) that exists in graph G, then u will be prior to v’
    [38]. The vertices of the DAG are monitoring stations, and the edges are the irrigation
    waterways that connect two stations, with the directed edge in the opposite direction
    of water flow. The resulting outcome sorts downstream stations first. The WSN
    is also a DAG. Finally, computational complexity of the proposed approach is evaluated
    using Kahn’s algorithm of the big O notation [38,39]. An example of multiple pollution
    sources using our blockchain with a DAG approach is also provided in the Supplementary
    section. Details of the big O notation can be found in Avigad and Donnelly [39]
    and Chivers and Sleightholme [40]. 2.1. Study Site and Experiment Design The study
    area is the Taoyuan irrigation district, as shown in Figure 3. The heavy metal
    sensors were installed and working with the other regular sensors in the network
    based on all pre-investigation information and communications with the local irrigation
    society. Moreover, all information on the industrial plants in the study area
    was investigated before the installations of the sensors. Two types of sensors
    were installed in the study area, automatic heavy metal sensors (M) and regular
    sensors (R). The WSN consists of seven sensors: M02, R04, R06, R07, R09, R10,
    and R12 (Figure 3). The irrigation water quality standards for EC and Cu2+ are
    750 µS/cm 25 °C and 0.2 ppm, respectively. The “regular monitoring stations” referred
    to in this study are PRO series monitoring stations equipped with basic water
    quality analyzers including pH, conductivity, ORP, dissolved oxygen, turbidity,
    and suspended solids. The devices connect directly via an RS485 communication
    interface and provide simple, reliable, cost-saving process data with remote monitoring,
    calibration, configuration, and diagnostics capabilities. The devices are housed
    in a robust IP68 proof enclosure, with a 1500 N tensile-strength Kevlar reinforced
    cable, and can support up to a 1.2 km digital data transmission. The transmitter
    is ideal for use in the water/wastewater industry. The basic principle for measuring
    EC, pH, temperature, and liquid level are briefly described as follows: (1) Conductivity:
    two plates (cells) are placed in the sample, a potential is applied across the
    plates and the current is measured. Generally, the potential is in the form of
    a sine wave. Conductivity is determined from the voltage and current values according
    to Ohm’s Law: 𝐺= 1 𝑅 = 𝐼 𝐸 (1) Since the charge on the ions in solution facilitates
    the conductance of electrical current, the conductivity of a solution is proportional
    to its ion concentration. There is a potential difference between the signal produced
    and measured by the sensing and reference electrodes. The theoretical potential
    at pH 7 is 0 mV, and the slope of the line is −59.16 mV/pH at 25 °C. This means
    that, in theory, the pH sensor will change its output by 59 mV for every change
    in a pH unit. The relationship between the potential and hydrogen ion activity
    in the sample is described by the Nernst equation: 𝐸= 𝐸 0 +0.05916×𝑝𝐻 (2) where
    E0 is Reference potential. The temperature was measured by a Resistor Temperature
    Detector (RTD) sensor. In an RTD, the resistance is proportional to the temperature.
    RTD also requires an external current source to function properly. However, the
    current produces heat in a resistive element causing an error in the temperature
    measurements. The error is calculated by this formula: Δ𝑇=𝑃×𝑆 (3) where T is temperature,
    P is I squared power produced, and S is a degree C/mill watt. The liquid level
    was determined using a submersible pressure transducer by taking a continuous
    pressure measurement from the bottom of the tank. The pressure is proportional
    to the height of the liquid directly above it. In addition to the regular monitoring
    stations, the Modern Water OVA 7000 was used as heavy metal monitoring stations
    to analyze the concentration of Cu, Pb, Cu, Zn, and Ni; based on the operations
    of the voltammetry principle, with a detection limit down to μg/L level, similar
    to ICP-MS. Furthermore, the Modern Water OVA 7000 (London, United Kingdom) accuracy
    avoids the interference of watercolor, turbidity, and conductivity, in order to
    meet the requirement of the Taiwan Council of Agriculture’s ‘Irrigation Water
    Standard’. This method had been approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection
    Agency (EPA). The basic principle for measuring heavy metals is briefly described
    as follows. The anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) method was used for measuring
    heavy metals. Generally, ASV is considered the most sensitive electroanalytical
    technique and suitable for the determination at trace levels of many metals and
    compounds in clinical and industrial environmental samples. In brief, the principle
    of ASV is based on the measurement of current signals associated with molecular
    properties or interfacial processes of the chemical species and is used in the
    detection and quantitative determination of metals or metal complexes, especially
    heavy metals in water. The framework of the monitoring system with the proposed
    approach is shown in Figure 1. Moreover, the blockchain and GIS frameworks are
    also shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. 2.2. Structure of the Blockchain Traceability
    System Used in This Study Blockchain is a relatively new technology and the basis
    for many cryptocurrency transactions such as Bitcoin (https://bitcoin.org). A
    blockchain is a distributed ledger allowing all users to record transactions in
    a decentralized data log built on a peer-to-peer internet. The data in this ledger
    cannot be tampered with since all transactions are approved by consensus and are
    also encrypted. The user accesses the blockchain network and uploads information
    to the blockchain where it is also stored, via a node. This study developed four
    nodes in a blockchain network using a UTXO-based approach, where outputs of one
    transaction are the inputs of another information set. Each information set can
    be viewed as either a transaction input (TxIn) or transaction output (TxOut),
    thus making transactions trackable. A blockchain is a distributed ledger of transactions
    maintained by a network of untrusted nodes in which each block of the blockchain
    contains a list of transactions organized in a Merkle tree, as new blocks are
    added to the blockchain by users [6,16]. Information in the blockchain ledger
    consists of numerous transactions, so that transaction histories are disclosed.
    In this study, recording water quality and tracing a pollution source is similar
    in principle to a Bitcoin transaction. A coin representing pollution is sent from
    the affected downstream location to upstream locations, where the pollution events
    might have originated. In this way, the pollution data at one location, in relation
    to another location, is stored as an ordered transaction. Specifically, when a
    monitoring station detects pollution, the station is issued a “pollution coin”.
    If pollution is detected at an upstream location, coins from downstream locations
    are sent to the upstream monitoring station. This transaction process records
    the marked pathway of pollutant transportation and identifies the pollution source.
    In addition, based on the time when the pollution is initially detected, pollution
    coins are issued and sent to station addresses as recorded and time-stamped transactions.
    We used the Gcoin (GCoin, 2017) blockchain in our traceability system application.
    The letter G in Gcoin refers to ‘global governance’ of the blockchain network.
    The Gcoin programming code is rewritten from Bitcoin and uses a UTXO-based blockchain
    network. Importantly, Gcoin can track transactions similar to the way that Mint
    (https://www.mint.com) can track Bitcoin transactions. Gcoin-client offers a remote
    procedure call (RPC) protocol to send queries. Therefore, we use Python programming
    language to connect Gcoin-client and to complete data upload and extraction processes.
    2.2.1. Uploading Water Quality Data to the Blockchain Traceability System Figure
    4 illustrates the locations of stations at both upstream and downstream areas
    in the upper and lower parts of the Figure, respectively, as well as the DAG of
    station locations. For example, though water flows from C to D, the DAG edge along
    this pathway is from D to C (Figure 3). While the graph illustrates the topological
    sort calculated with Kahn’s Algorithm [41], one should note that the topological
    sort depicted is not limited to only one solution (Figure 3). After the pre-processing
    phase, based on the sorting order, water quality monitoring data of each station
    are read to verify if values have exceeded the regulation standard. If values
    have not exceeded the regulation standard, then the operation proceeds to the
    next station. If values have exceeded the regulation standard, however, then the
    following steps are executed: (1) Determine if there are coins in the station
    address ledger. If there are coins in the ledger, areas downstream of this station
    are polluted as well, and the pollution coins in the station address ledger can
    then be used directly rather than for sending additional coins to other stations;
    (2) If there are no coins in the station address ledger, then this station is
    downstream of the pollution event, and will be sent coins by the station address
    that was initially issued a pollution coin; (3) If stations upstream of the station
    address that was initially issued a pollution coin are polluted as well, then
    the pollution event is assumed to originate in the upstream area, and pollution
    coins are sent to the upstream stations; (4) If the upstream stations are not
    polluted, then this station address is considered the origin of the pollution
    event, and coins from this station address are sent to the collection address
    for the recording time point of the event and pollution pathways. The data uploading
    procedure is shown in Figure 1. For each transaction, an “OP_RETURN” output is
    included that records 75 bytes of information string. It is via this mechanism
    that the actual observed values (i.e., high EC and Cu2+ concentrations) and generated
    time points are transformed into information strings stored in the blockchain.
    2.2.2. Extracting Information from the Blockchain Traceability System Pollution
    conditions at specific time points can be inspected using the following steps:
    (1) Identify the collection address of the time point; (2) Examine the list of
    pollution coins associated with the identified station address, and (3) Analyze
    the transaction records of these coins. An advantage of using blockchain is that
    it allows us to easily search the transaction history of every pollution coin.
    Because of this, we can rapidly identify pollution sources and affected areas.
    Figure 4 illustrates the mechanisms involved in a blockchain transaction record
    of pollution coins. In this example, our blockchain traceability system issues
    two coins associated with the same time point once pollution data are detected,
    which are then passed to the station addresses. The transaction record of the
    first pollution coin issued progresses from the coin issuer → Station C (station
    address) → Station B (station address) → collection address. The transaction record
    of the second pollution coin issued progresses from the same issuer → Station
    F (station address) → collection address. Stations B, C, and F are station addresses
    in the traceability system. Since the two pollution coins originate at Stations
    B and F, the transactions can be interpreted as follows: “two pollution events
    occurred at a specified time point in the upstream area of Stations B and F”.
    The pollution coin sent from Station B to the collection address, however, actually
    originated from Station C. The transactions are therefore interpreted as: “the
    pollution event occurred at Station B, then affected Station C which is downstream
    of Station B”. Furthermore, since pollution coins originating from Station C were
    sent from Station C to Station B; and since pollution coins originating from Station
    F were sent to the collection address, then “Station C and F are at the bottom
    of the downstream area affected by this pollution event.” The collection addresses
    are final addresses for the pollution events (Figure 5). Therefore, pollution
    pathways can be identified by the above procedure. Figure 5. Example of the blockchain
    transaction record of pollution coins. 2.3. Tracking Pollution Sources with GIS
    In the Taoyuan irrigation district study area, the local water utility administration
    is the responsible authority for irrigation water resources management. Due to
    a limited number of sensors, after using blockchain to trace monitoring station
    transactions, we mapped the Taoyuan irrigation district irrigation unit with GIS
    as a first step to track the pollution source with GIS. Upstream and downstream
    relationships were determined by the direction of flow through the irrigation
    channels, based on the DAG analysis. Mapping the study area’s local water utility
    administrative area with GIS allowed us to identify nearby administrative areas
    along the irrigation canal, as well as relevant irrigation and farmland information,
    such as drainages and other hydraulic structures (Figure 6). Second, we mapped
    factories that were identified as likely pollution sources according to information
    derived from our blockchain traceability system. Third, we mapped additional spatial
    layers of information on water monitoring stations, soil survey data, and factory
    characteristics to conduct further analysis of the industrial factories identified
    as likely pollution sources and their related polluted areas. Lastly, we compared
    the type of pollution detected by our blockchain traceability system, with the
    factory characteristics of the industrial factories screened in the last step,
    to eliminate irrelevant industrial factories. Figure 6. Spatial distributions
    and irrigation flow with monitoring stations in the study area. Note: R is a regular
    water monitoring station; M is a heavy metal monitoring station. In this study,
    we integrated a blockchain traceability system with GIS to track pollution sources
    in the San–Kuai–Tsuo irrigation channel, the 3rd branch of the Taoyuan Canal within
    the Taoyuan irrigation district study area (Figure 6). Figure 7 shows the pollution
    pathways using the traceability system. Using a drainage tracking function on
    the internet platform (Figure 1), we designated impacted areas (orange color)
    and upstream areas (purple color) based on irrigation units (Figure 8). Figure
    S2 shows the DAG of the study. Figure 7. Procedure trees for four monitoring stations

    2.4. Simulation of Wastewater Discharge Quality The Water Quality Analysis Simulation
    Program model is a mass balance equation developed by the US EPA [36].for dissolved
    constituents of the water body, which accounts for all the material entering and
    leaving through direct and diffuse loading; advective and dispersive transport;
    and physical, chemical, and biological transformations [36]. We used WASP (US
    EPA) Version 7.3 to simulate EC and Cu2+ concentration in wastewater discharge
    from industrial factories within the Taoyuan irrigation district study area. The
    data used for the WASP simulation were collected by field investigation and water
    quality monitoring stations. We used Manning’s equation to calculate the flow
    rate in the irrigation canal, and incorporated Cu2+ concentrations that were measured
    in water and sediment, to conduct the simulation. The partial differential equation
    with the Runge–Kutta method was used for the simulation: Water quality control
    equation [36]: ∂𝐶/∂𝑡+∂𝑈𝐶/∂𝑥−∂( 𝐸 𝑥 ∂𝐶/∂𝑥)/∂𝑥−∂( 𝐸 𝑍 ∂𝐶/∂𝑧)/∂𝑧= 𝑆 𝐿 + 𝑆 𝑘 (4) Sediment
    control equation: ∂𝐶/∂𝑡−∂( 𝐸 𝑧 ∂𝐶/∂𝑧)/∂𝑧= 𝑆 𝑘 (5) where U is flow velocity of
    the x-direction (m/s); C is contaminant concentration (g/m3); Ex and EZ are x-
    and z-direction dispersion coefficients (m2/s); SL is external load (g/m3/s);
    and SK is source and sink (g/m3/s). The San–Kuai–Tsuo irrigation channel was divided
    into 32 segments (Table S7). The length of the channel is 3838 meters, with a
    slope of 0.002. The WASP model irrigation channel parameters for model calibration
    were established based on field survey results (see Supplementary). Heavy metals
    emitted from likely sources in the upstream area are traced by utilizing the heavy
    metal monitoring station data on EC concentration, Cu concentration, and water
    level. Model parameters are listed in Table S1 (see Supplementary). Given real-time
    measurements of EC and Cu2+ at the identified water intake (downstream), the WASP
    model simulates the EC and Cu2+ concentrations at all segments along the above
    irrigation channel by using an iteration procedure. The iteration procedures are
    not stopped until the simulated concentrations of EC and Cu2+ at the intake of
    irrigation water are close to those of the measured concentrations. The Mean Absolute
    Percent Error (MAPE Equation (S1) see Supplementary) values of model validations
    for EC and Cu2+ were 9.58% and 3.74%, respectively. Moreover, the R2 values of
    model validations for EC and Cu2+ were 0.9986 and 0.9682, respectively (Figure
    S2 in Supplementary). The MAPE and R2 values show that the simulation model has
    the ability to simulate EC and Cu2+ concentrations. 2.5. Computational Complexity
    In this study, we assumed that the total monitor station number is V (R + M, R:
    number of regular water monitor stations, M: number of heavy metal water monitor
    stations). The total number of edges (which connect the stations) is E. Additionally,
    assume that the DAG is using an adjacency list in which each node stores the outgoing
    edges. By using Kahn’s algorithm: Step 1: Make an AdjList with the current in-degree
    of each node and initialize the count of visited nodes as 0. Step 2: Make a queue
    of the set of nodes with in-degree 0 (Enqueue operation). Step 3: Remove a vertex
    from the queue (Dequeue operation) and then: Increment count of visited nodes
    by 1. Reduce in-degree by 1 for all nodes adjacent to it. If the in-degree of
    an adjacent node is reduced to zero, then add it to the queue. Step 4: Repeat
    Step 3 until the queue is empty. Step 5: If the count of visited nodes is not
    equal to the number of nodes in the graph, then the topological sort is not possible
    for the given graph. In addition, pollution conditions at specific time points
    can be inspected using the following steps: (1) Identify the collection address
    of the time point; (2) Examine the list of pollution coins associated with the
    identified station address, and (3) Analyze the transaction records of these coins.
    The Algorithm 1 for the above pollution analysis algorithm is as follows. Algorithm1:
    Pollution Analysis Algorithm. Pollution Analysis { Identify the collection address
    of the time point //step 1 Sc = set of all pollution coins; For each c ∈ Sc {//step2
    & step 3 Generate pollution pathway Pc for c’s transition record. Analyze Pc to
    determine which is the pollution source //the pollution source is at the upstream
    of the sources in Pc, // the other is pollution path. } } 3. Results 3.1. Uploading
    Water Quality Data to the Blockchain Traceability System Figure S3. Shows the
    DAG of the stream system. The EC and Cu2+ results for 14 water monitoring stations
    are categorized as either “exceeding” or “non-exceeding” regulation standards,
    for which there are 30 combinations (Tables S8 and S9). In this study, there were
    ten instances (Tables S10–S19) in which water monitoring stations were categorized
    as exceeding regulation standards for EC and Cu2+ concentrations (Tables S8 and
    S9). The water quality data upload procedures for these ten cases are shown in
    Tables S10–S19 (Supplementary). The blockchain results for the ten cases of pollution
    pathways (Tables S10–S19) are summarized as the following four types of pollution
    pathways: Type I are cases 1–2 (based on Tables S10 and S11); Type II is case
    3 (based on Table S12); Type III is case 4 (based on Table S13); and Type IV are
    cases 5–10 (based on Tables S14–S19). For the above four pathway types for which
    pollution coins were issued, Figure 7 shows the pollution pathways based on the
    blockchain transaction data as procedure trees. Blockchain transaction data in
    Figure 7 can be read from right to left--downstream stations on the right-hand
    side of the procedure tree are sent to upstream stations on the left-hand side
    of the procedure tree, along various pathways comprised of irrigation channels
    (Figure 7). In Figure 7, water monitoring stations are represented as circles,
    and color-filled circles represent water monitoring stations that detected irrigation
    water pollution concentrations exceeding the regulation standard. For instance,
    since the EC concentration detected at Station R04 was greater than the regulation
    standard, Station R06 received pollution coins from Station R04 in the blockchain
    traceability system (Figure 7). At the same time, Station M02 received pollution
    coins from Stations R10 and R12, since the EC concentrations detected at Stations
    R10 and R12 exceeded the regulation standard. Moreover, Station R09 also issued
    a pollution coin since the detected EC concentration exceeded the regulation standard,
    though no pollution coins were sent to or from Station R09 (Figure 7). These transaction
    “data pathways” cannot be tampered with in the blockchain traceability system.
    With respect to heavy metal results, during our study period, there were ten cases
    in which Cu2+ concentrations exceeded regulation standards and were recorded as
    having concentrations of 0.358 ppm, 0.595 ppm, 0.482 ppm, 0.429 ppm, 0.299 ppm,
    0.271 ppm, 0.209 ppm, 0.226 ppm, 0.393 ppm, and 0.316 ppm, respectively. Detailed
    data uploading procedures for each case can be found in the Supplementary Materials
    (Tables S10–S19). Since only two heavy metal monitoring stations were installed
    in the study area, heavy metal results from these two water monitoring stations
    were categorized as either “exceeding” or “non-exceeding,” for which there are
    two combinations representing two pathway types (Table S9 and Figure 7). For each
    combination, Type II (Table S9) occurs most often. Occurrence times for each combination
    are presented in Figure 7. Unknown pollution sources were detected in the upstream
    area of the study area using downstream monitoring data. For Type II, only Station
    M02 exceeded the Cu2+ concentration regulation standard. According to the operation
    order (i.e., topological sort order), the pollution progresses along the following
    pathway: R04, R06, R07, R10, R12, and M02 (Figure 7). In this study, an example
    of multiple pollution sources was provided in the Supplementary section. Figure
    S4 shows the network of the example with two types of pollution sources, and consists
    of 11 heavy metal sensors (see Supplementary). Figure S4 also shows the upstream-downstream
    relationships between monitoring stations with the corresponding topological sort
    order. Using our approach (Figure 1), pollution progresses along the following
    pathways presented for the multiple pollution sources displayed in Figure S5 (see
    Supplementary). The pollution type #1 has a simple pathway through Station D that
    leads to the pollution source, but the pollution type #2 has three pathways that
    lead to pollution sources (Figure S5). 3.2. Mapping Industrial Factories Identified
    as Likely Pollution Sources with GIS After mapping local water utility administrative
    areas with GIS, we mapped pollution sources identified by the blockchain traceability
    system with real-time monitoring data. To reflect the current irrigation system
    delineated with GIS, upstream irrigation units are depicted in red (Figure 8).
    Since we used a limited number of wireless sensors to monitor irrigation water
    intake, we pinpointed the polluted irrigation units located within the administrative
    area instead, and marked these irrigation units with violet-colored water drop
    symbols in GIS (Figure 8). For instance, Station M02 received pollution coins
    from Stations R10 and R12 in the blockchain traceability system (Figure 8a) when
    the EC concentrations at Stations R10 and R12 exceeded the regulation standard.
    We then identified highly likely sources of pollution at target irrigation units
    within the Taoyuan irrigation district, by narrowing down the likely sources along
    the pollution pathway (i.e., from downstream water monitoring stations to the
    originating stations); and then to the industrial factories in this vicinity (Figure
    8a). Using GIS tools, upstream irrigation units and pollution intake locations
    are thus identified (Figure 8a). Moreover, we can further identify the likely
    pollution sources—specific industrial factories—from various GIS graphic layers
    with aerial photography and farmland monitoring data. The GIS mapped results for
    the ten cases are summarized in Figure 8 as five types of spatial pathways. That
    is, these ten cases are the same spatial pathway types depicted in Figure 7. Specifically,
    Type I are cases 1–3 (based on Tables S10–S12); Type II is case 4 (based on Table
    S13); Type III are cases 5, 7, 9, and 10 (based on Tables S14, S16, S18 and S19);
    Type IV is case 6 (based on Table S15); and Type V is case 8 (based on Table S17).
    3.3. Simulation of Wastewater Discharge Quality A water monitoring station was
    located 200 m downstream from one of the likely pollution sources. Data collected
    from this station was used for simulating wastewater discharge quality. During
    the field investigation, we found that the shape of the irrigation channel was
    an inverted trapezoid, with a total length and head loss of 3838 m and 19.89 m,
    respectively. We input all required measured data (e.g., flow and water depth)
    from the ten abovementioned cases into WASP, to simulate wastewater discharge
    quality. Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the WASP model-simulated trends for EC and
    Cu2+ concentrations. The simulations show that increasing concentration trends
    are potentially caused by a likely pollution source (Figure 9 and Figure 10),
    since concentrations rapidly jump in all cases where the irrigation water quality
    exceeds regulation standards for EC and Cu2+. Figure 9. Reverse prediction of
    EC concentrations along the channel for each case at heavy metal monitoring station

    (i) 0.393 ppm, and (j) 0.316 ppm. 3.4. Computational Complexity In this study,
    we conducted a simple complexity analysis for our pollution analysis algorithm
    with the following. By using Kahn’s algorithm, the time complexity of sorting
    the DAG is O(V + E). Step 1 takes O(V) time to identify the collection address
    of the time point. We need O(V × E) for executing Step 2 and Step 3 of our approach
    (Figure 1), i.e., there are V nodes and, for each node, we need to spend O(E)
    for examining the pollution pathway and identify the pollution source. Therefore,
    the total time complexity of our pollution analysis algorithm is O(V × E). For
    the case of Figure 3, there are 12 monitor stations in the stream system. Since
    there are 12 nodes and 12 edges in the DAG, the computational complexity is O(12
    × 12). If there are n polluted stations, the computation complexity is O(V × E
    + n). In the real case, computational complexity was done and discussed for the
    DAG, Blockchain transaction and WASP modeling by using the big O notation to analyze
    time complexity. The total time complexity of our pollution analysis algorithm
    is O(14 × 10 + n) in the study case. The relationship between Blockchain transactions
    and the number of polluted stations (sensors with concentrations greater than
    the regulation standards) show increasing linear trends (Figure 11). Once n stations
    are polluted, the least number of transactions is n + 1, and the maximum number
    of transactions is 2n (Figure S3). In the two pollution sources designed case,
    the total computational complexity is O(11 × 10 + 7) since the number of polluted
    stations is 7. Figure 11 indicates that the number of transactions strongly relies
    on the number of sensors with concentrations greater than the regulation standards.
    Since the WASP model is a deterministic model, the computation is the model computation.
    The computational times of the model increased from 4, 137, 142, and 180 min for
    the cases with numbers of segments increased from 32, 93, and 128, respectively.
    Figure 11. Big O notation analysis of the relationship in the number of Blockchain
    transactions and the number of polluted stations. 4. Discussion 4.1. Uploading
    Water Quality Data to the Blockchain Traceability System This study is the first
    to utilize blockchain technology with a WSN in a DAG configuration to identify
    pollution pathways and to trace pollution sources based on real-time irrigation
    water quality data. Pollution tracing in this way was possible only with blockchain
    technology’s characteristic immutability, traceable transactions, and transparency
    [6,10]. As a result, the real-time pollution data used in this study cannot be
    altered. Additionally, pollution dispersion can be identified with this study’s
    use of pollution coins, issued by the blockchain traceability system, so that
    transactions can be traced through the irrigation systems with a DAG to identify
    polluted pathways in our study area. Although the issued pollution coins were
    not actual commercially-traded currency, the concept of pollution coins can be
    further utilized in water quality management schemes. Our approach differs from
    traditional WSN uses, in that the proposed blockchain-based approach uses a WSN
    as a DAG to sort the network, based on the spatial relationships between water
    monitoring stations in the study area. While our traditional client-service model
    was developed based on a time series of the water monitoring data from a station
    suited for Structured Query Language (SQL) protocols, the water quality measurement
    data that exceed regulatory standards have been recorded in this study’s blockchain
    and should not be altered since the data are verifiable evidence that can be used
    for further actions. Moreover, blockchain encryption prevents any data manipulation
    of the monitoring data in this study, even when water quality data and events
    are transferred among monitoring stations. That is, the historical and real-time
    events used in this study were transferred as hash values (i.e., digital fingerprints)
    because the data are managed by a peer-to-peer network for inter-node communication,
    making it immutable. The recorded blockchain events in this study are transparent,
    traceable, and secured data that can then be utilized for water quality management.
    Future studies employing our blockchain tracing procedure should include additional
    sensors set at suitable upstream channels within the irrigation unit to overcome
    any issues due to a lack of upstream water monitoring station data if there are
    no budgetary issues. On the other hand, the proposed approach can be a tool to
    reduce the number of sensors and cost for the installation of too many sensors.
    Our results in the example case also indicated that the proposed approach could
    be utilized for multiple types of pollution. 4.2. Mapping Industrial Factories
    Identified as Likely Pollution Sources with GIS Unlike other relevant studies
    using GIS to identify potential pollution or risk zones [29,32,33], this study
    developed a blockchain-based GIS system for real-time identification of polluted
    upstream irrigation units, via a WSN within irrigation channels in the study area.
    Due to a limited number of sensors in the study area, the upstream to downstream
    irrigation units were fixed in a basic spatial relationship, using GIS tools (Figure
    8). Our method, however, can be applied to complex networks as a cost-effective
    method for determining sensors within a network. The upstream unit used in this
    study, for the cases in which EC and Cu2+ concentrations exceeded the regulation
    standard, is a real-world upstream unit. Although copper is essential to the growth
    of plants, soil copper concentrations in excess (i.e., beyond a threshold of 400
    mg/kg for rice) have inhibitory effects on crop growth and development [42], suggesting
    a need for real-time water pollution monitoring. GIS techniques used in this study
    differ from other blockchain WSN techniques used to spatially identify polluted
    irrigation units reported by [31,43]. Our use of a GIS tracking procedure, initiated
    directly after the blockchain process, effectively identifies polluted upstream
    irrigation units and irrigation water intake locations in the study area for real-time
    water quality modeling. Furthermore, using GIS tools can reduce sensor installation,
    sensor maintenance, and water monitoring station costs if operating under a limited
    budget. 4.3. Simulation of Water Quality for Real-Time Pollution Source Tracking
    Water quality models or indices that are GIS-based have been widely developed
    to assess water quality and to identify potential pollution source risk and risk
    areas [44,45]. In the last two decades, the WASP has been successfully used to
    simulate the arrival time of pollutants from various locations and concentrations
    after water pollution accidents, as dynamic GIS layers [32]. This study utilized
    the WASP model for successful reverse prediction of EC and Cu2+ concentrations
    with real-time water quality monitoring data and real-time pollution source tracing
    via a WSN in the study area. In order to trace pollution sources in real-time,
    our proposed approach auto-initiates once EC and Cu2+ concentrations exceed regulation
    standard allowances. Unlike studies that only use a WSN approach [46,47], this
    study used blockchain technology transaction functions and a DAG. Although we
    readily concede that our model traced a pollution source that was within relatively
    proximity to a monitoring station (within a 200 m radius), increasing the sensor
    amount and performing model calibrations based on a longitudinal data set will
    improve traceability of large-scale unknown pollution sources when using the proposed
    framework. However, overcoming potential modeling challenges may require clarification
    on the flow directions between upstream and downstream drainage areas, water monitoring
    station locations, and irrigation facility and channel information. 4.4. Computational
    Complexity As far as we know, our study is the first study using a DAG and Blockchain
    to identify PSP. Complexity evaluation of an algorithm is essential for algorithm
    design [48]. Our computation analysis indicates that the computational time of
    the Blockchain transactions, and the number of sensors with high concentrations
    can be estimated. Moreover, the maximum transaction number, 2n, is not influenced
    by the upstream-downstream relationship once all sensors detect concentrations
    greater than the regulation standards. The computational time of DAG relies on
    the number of sensors and edges of irrigation networks. The least transaction
    number, n + 1, occurs once all pollution is detected by sensors along the same
    irrigation channel. The computational time of the DAG is essential for our proposed
    approach. Once the number of pollution types detected by stations increases the
    computational time will increase additionally. However, a DAG-based approach has
    been recently discussed as a way to revolutionize the blockchain technology [49,50].
    The advantage of our study is that a DAG was utilized to order the transaction
    and realize the computational time. 5. Conclusions Real-time identification of
    PSP is essential for ensuring irrigation water quality. While blockchain’s distributed
    ledger technology allows all users to record transactions in a decentralized data
    log built on a peer-to-peer internet, a WSN provides real-time remote monitoring
    data for high-quality production and processing systems with various sensors that
    are applicable in different fields of study. This study’s novel framework uses
    blockchain-based technology, a WSN in a DAG configuration, and GIS techniques
    to trace pollution pathways from irrigation water intake data. We then simulated
    irrigation water quality using a WASP model to successfully identify PSP for ten
    case studies. Since blockchain encrypts data and prevents data manipulation as
    water quality data are transferred among monitoring stations, the secured data
    used in this study can be useful for further real-world water quality management.
    Pollution sources and pathways of irrigation units can be targeted for further
    field investigation using the proposed blockchain traceability system with GIS
    tools. Once a monitored polluted irrigation unit is mapped with GIS following
    the blockchain tracing procedure, a WASP water quality simulation provides information
    for real-time identification of highly likely pollution sources that engage in
    illegal wastewater discharge. The computational complexity of the Blockchain transactions
    shows a linearly increasing relationship with the number of polluted stations.
    The proposed framework can be utilized in complex water quality monitoring networks
    with multiple pollution sources to identify PSP. The computational complexity
    of the transactions in the proposed framework should be evaluated. Supplementary

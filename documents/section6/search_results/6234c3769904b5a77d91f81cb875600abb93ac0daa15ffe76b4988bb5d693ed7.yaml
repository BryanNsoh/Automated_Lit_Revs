    in agro-industry and environment during 2006–2016. • Clustering of IoT applications
    into four domains: monitoring, control, prediction, and logistics. • Visualization
    of key technologies used to develop the IoT applications. • Discussion of trends
    and open challenges. • Proposal of an IoT architecture for agro-industrial and
    environmental applications based on the research findings. Abstract This paper
    reviews agro-industrial and environmental applications that are using Internet
    of Things (IoT). It is motivated by the need to identify application areas, trends,
    architectures and open challenges in these two fields. The underlying survey was
    developed following a systematic literature review using academic documents written
    in English and published in peer-reviewed venues from 2006 to 2016. Selected references
    were clustered into four application domains corresponding to: monitoring, control,
    logistics, and prediction. Implementation-specific details from each selected
    reference were compiled to create usage distributions of sensors, actuators, power
    sources, edge computing modules, communication technologies, storage solutions,
    and visualization strategies. Finally, the results from the review were compiled
    into an IoT architecture that represents a wide range of current solutions in
    agro-industrial and environmental fields. Previous article in issue Next article

    literature review 1. Introduction The widespread of Internet in the last two decades
    brought countless benefits to citizens and organizations around the world. Arguably
    the most important benefit was the ability to consume and produce data and services
    in real time. Recently, the Internet of Things is promising to bring the same
    benefits to everyday objects, giving us a way to extend our perception and our
    ability to modify the environment around us. In this context, agro-industrial
    and environmental fields are ideal candidates for the deployment of IoT solutions
    because they occur in wide areas that need to be continuously monitored and controlled.
    At the same time, IoT opens new opportunities beyond ground floor automation when
    the collected data are used to feed machine learning algorithms to provide predictions
    (Saville et al., 2015), easing decision planning and decision making for owners,
    managers, and policy makers. IoT can be used at different levels in the agro-industrial
    production chain (Medela et al., 2013). It can help to evaluate field variables
    such as soil state, atmospheric conditions, and biomass of plants or animals.
    It can also be used to assess and control variables such as temperature, humidity,
    vibration, and shock during the product transport (Pang et al., 2015). It can
    be used to monitor and predict the product state and its demand on shelves or
    inside refrigerators. In addition, it can provide information to the final user/consumer
    about the origin and properties of the product. The IoT applied to the agro-industry
    can contribute to create an informed, connected, developed and adaptable rural
    community. Under the IoT paradigm, low-cost electronic devices can improve human
    interaction with the physical world, and the computing power and software available
    on the Internet can provide valuable analytics. In summary, IoT can be an important
    tool in the years to come for people interacting within an agro-industrial system:
    suppliers, farmers, technicians, distributors, business men, consumers, and government
    representatives. IoT can be incorporated into environmental applications to produce
    dense and real-time maps of air and water pollution, noise level (Torres-Ruiz
    et al., 2016, Hachem et al., 2015), temperature, and harmful radiation among others.
    It can be used to collect and store environmental records, check the compliance
    of environmental variables with local policies, trigger alerts, or send recommendation
    messages to citizens and authorities (Liu et al., 2013). Once the data reach the
    cloud, governments can feed predictive models to forecast environmental variables,
    and identify and track pollution sources over time and space, ultimately leading
    to faster and better decisions to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all
    citizens. Based on the potential of IoT applications in agro-industrial and environmental
    fields described in the previous paragraphs, this paper aims to identify the current
    state of solutions in these fields, as well as the trends, architectures, technologies
    and open challenges. This paper uses a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) based
    on a methodology proposed by Kitchenham and Charters (2007), in order to make
    it unbiased in terms of information selection, processing, and presentation of
    results. The paper is structured as follows. Sections 2 Planning, 3 Conduction,
    4 Results describe the stages of planning, conduction, and results of the SLR.
    Section 5 outlines some recent works that were published online after the SLR
    was concluded. Section 6 includes a discussion of the obtained results, and Section
    7 presents the conclusions from this study. 2. Planning During this stage of the
    SLR, the protocol was defined. This included: research questions, search strategies,
    selection criteria, data mining and synthesis methodologies. For this study, the
    two research questions considered were: 1. What are the main technological solutions
    of the Internet of Things in agro-industrial and environmental fields? 2. Which
    infrastructure and technology are using the main solutions of IoT in agro-industrial
    and environmental fields? To collect information, authors performed an Internet
    search using various academic digital libraries and search engines. Obtained results
    were manually compiled in order to select the best information sources to answer
    the two research questions. After analyzing the results, digital libraries and
    search engines described in Table 1 were chosen based on their scientific and
    technical content, as well as their close relationship to areas of knowledge associated
    with the objective of this paper. Table 1. Information sources used for the search

    Search Engine https://scholar.google.com/ The next step was to define search terms
    and a consistent procedure to seek scientific and technical documentation in the
    digital libraries and search engines. To define the search terms, a set of keywords
    was selected from the research questions to create two groups of words which are
    shown in Table 2. Each group contained consolidated expressions with synonyms
    or terms with related meaning. Group 1 included words associated with the Internet
    of Things, while Group 2 contained a set of terms related to the agro-industry
    and environment. Logical operators supported by the advanced search of digital
    libraries were used to construct search strings, based on the two research questions,
    combining terms from Groups 1 and 2 of Table 2. The general structure of the search
    queries that were applied to the information sources is presented in Table 3.

    order to ensure the quality of papers, only those that passed the following criteria
    were considered in the reviewing process. • Documents published in peer-reviewed
    conferences, peer-reviewed journals, papers from computer science or engineering
    organizations, patents, or technical reports. • Documents published in English.
    • Documents published between 2006 and 2016 (both years inclusive). If the main
    topic of a given paper was irrelevant or if it was outside the scope of this study,
    it was deleted. Then, a selection criterion was applied in order to reduce the
    number of papers found during the search and to get a small number of high-quality
    sources that could be used to answer the research questions. This involved using
    inclusion criteria (IC) and quality criteria (QC), which were defined in a three-phase
    process. • IC based on abstracts: in this phase, authors discarded papers found
    in the search stage based on the information provided in their abstracts. Papers
    that satisfied the first inclusion criterion were kept for further processing,
    i.e. papers that discussed IoT solutions applied to agro-industry and environment.
    Papers with little relevant information in their abstract were temporarily kept
    in the list and were processed in the next stage. It is important to highlight
    that quality criteria were not considered in this phase. • IC based on full reading:
    in this phase, papers that did not address the search terms shown in Table 2 were
    removed. This means that even though those papers contained the search terms in
    their abstract, they only represented minor aspects of them. • IC based on quality
    analysis: in this phase, a quality analysis was applied to remaining papers and
    those that did not comply any of the following four quality criteria (QC) were
    discarded: – QC1: Does the study present a comprehensive solution of IoT for agro-industry
    or environment? – QC2: Does the paper show details of the infrastructure and/or
    technologies used to implement the proposed solution? – QC3: Does the paper present
    a state of the art or related work? – QC4: Does the paper present an analysis
    of the results? The next stage of the SLR was data mining and synthesis. The goal
    here was to extract the information needed to answer the research questions in
    an objective manner. The information fields extracted for each study are presented
    in Table 4. Table 4. Form used to extract data for each study. Data retrieved

    in the previous section was used to search, select and evaluate preliminary papers.
    For the search process, the query defined in Table 3 was passed to information
    sources given in Table 1. The search was limited to title, abstract and keywords.
    Fig. 1 illustrates the conduction process discriminated by the academic database
    and search engine used, highlighting the key steps followed to select relevant
    studies for this review. Initially, 3578 studies were recovered from electronic
    databases. Firstly, duplicates were excluded, i.e. studies available in more than
    one database, eliminating 849 copies. Out of the 2729 remaining studies, 2652
    were initially screened based on inclusion and exclusion criteria applied to the
    title, abstract, and keywords. These papers were marked to be downloaded, and
    references that could not be retrieved were discarded. Afterward, these studies
    were evaluated using quality criteria obtaining 720 studies. These studies were
    used to extract the data defined in Table 4. Finally, only 72 main studies were
    selected based on their quality for the final conduction phase and used to extract
    results presented in the next section. Download : Download high-res image (236KB)

    main studies. It is worth to note that more than 90% of included papers were retrieved
    from two sources: IEEExplore (76.4%) and Scopus (13.9%). In contrast, the least
    effective sources of information were Microsoft Academic Search and Microsoft
    Academic. They retrieved 668 papers during the first stage of the conduction phase
    (representing 25.2% of all retrieved papers, and only behind IEEExplore with 45%).
    However, only 3.1% of them were included for the next reviewing phase, a number
    well below the 39.8% of papers included from IEEExplore. These facts can be explained
    because IEEExplore and Scopus have complete and usable advanced search systems
    and they have been operating continuously unlike Microsoft’s counterpart (Sinha
    et al., 2015a). Fig. 2 enumerates the number of primary studies classified by
    publication year. It can be seen that most of the selected papers were published
    between 2012 and 2016. It should be highlighted that the small number of papers
    shown in 2016 can be explained because the initial search was made in April of
    that year. Download : Download high-res image (127KB) Download : Download full-size

    results of the SLR in order to answer the two research questions based on the
    information extracted from main studies selected. 4.1. Answer to the first research
    question To identify the main technological solutions of IoT in agro-industry
    and environmental fields, studies were grouped into four technological domains,
    corresponding to: (1) monitoring, (2) control, (3) prediction and (4) logistics.
    Results are summarized in Table 5 and illustrated in Fig. 4. From this figure,
    it can be seen that most of the selected studies were focused on monitoring (62%),
    followed by control (25%), logistics (7%), and prediction (6%). Table 5. Clustering

    image Fig. 4. Distribution of papers selected by application domain. Selected
    papers grouped in the monitoring domain dealt with remote sensing of physical
    and environmental parameters gathered in scenarios such as crops and farms using
    a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). The main goal of this domain was the acquisition
    of information without an operator and its transmission to a server or data center
    for processing and visualization. Integrated monitoring tools made it possible
    to maintain a continuous communication with the deployed WSN, and access stored
    data through the Internet. Hence, smart agriculture based on IoT adds value to
    farmers by helping them to collect relevant data from crops and farms using sensor
    devices. Some IoT setups could display, process and analyze remote data applying
    cloud services in order to provide new insights and recommendations for better
    decision-making. IoT solutions categorized in monitoring domain can be divided
    into three architectural layers (Zou, 2014): (i) a perception layer supported
    by a WSN; (ii) a network layer where the sensor information travels a long distance
    using different protocols and Gateways, and (iii) an application layer that includes
    a web server and a database. Moreover, IoT solutions grouped in this domain are
    interested in monitoring several types of physical variables depending on the
    subdomain to which they belong. Specifically, the following subdomains were identified:
    air monitoring (34.5%), soil monitoring (27.3%), water monitoring (16.4%), plant
    monitoring (10.9%), and others (10.9%) which include areas such as aquaculture
    and animal monitoring. It is worth to highlight that most of the selected studies
    retrieved in this SLR can be categorized in more than one subdomain. For instance,
    the system proposed in Zou (2014) is used for online crop growth monitoring and
    it captures different types of variables such as: temperature, humidity, soil
    moisture, CO2, luminosity, pH of water, and images. Some representative examples
    of IoT applications categorized in the monitoring domain are described below.
    • Air monitoring: this subdomain aimed to provide periodic or continuous measurements,
    evaluating and determining environmental parameters or pollution levels in order
    to prevent negative and damaging effects. It also included the forecasting of
    possible changes in the ecosystem or the biosphere as a whole. For instance, in
    Watthanawisuth et al. (2009) authors described an agricultural IoT solution which
    can be categorized in the air monitoring subdomain. In this solution, authors
    proposed a real-time monitoring system of micro climate based on a WSN. The solution
    included temperature and relative humidity sensors (SHT15) powered by solar panels
    and supported by ZigBee communication technology. Another air monitoring IoT solution
    is GEMS (Lu et al., 2010), which proposed an environmental monitoring system based
    on GPRS technology for monitoring apple orchards. This system was tested on five
    different regions of China over a 2-year period by monitoring variables such as
    relative humidity, temperature, and radiation. • Soil monitoring: papers classified
    in this subdomain such as (Chen et al., 2014, Mafuta et al., 2012) proposed systems
    for monitoring multi-layer soil temperature and moisture in a farmland fields
    using WSN. These systems are supported by communication technologies such as ZigBee,
    GPRS and Internet, where user interaction with the system is handled by a web
    application. • Water monitoring: primary studies categorized in this subdomain
    intend to monitor water pollution or water quality by sensing chemicals, pH, and
    temperature, which can alter the natural state of water. An example of this subdomain
    is presented in Postolache et al. (2013), where authors proposed an IoT solution
    for water quality assessment through the measurement of conductivity, temperature,
    and turbidity. The solution is based on a WSN architecture that combines low-cost
    sensing devices and monitoring of multiple parameters of water quality of shallow
    waters (lakes, estuaries, rivers) in urban areas. Similarly, (Xijun et al., 2009)
    proposed a WSN system for monitoring water level and rainfall in irrigation systems.
    • Plant monitoring: The LOFAR-agro Project (Langendoen et al., 2006) is an example
    of plant or crop monitoring. This project aimed to protect a potato crop against
    phytophthora (a genus of water mold) by monitoring the microclimate (humidity
    and temperature) using a large-scale WSN. The system intended to generate a policy
    to protect the crop against the fungal disease based on the collected data. In
    Fourati et al. (2014), authors propose a Web-based decision support system communicating
    with a WSN for irrigation scheduling in olive fields. For this purpose, authors
    use sensors to measure humidity, solar radiation, temperature, and rain. • Animal
    monitoring: This subdomain referred to animal tracking for both wildlife and animal
    husbandry activities. A research belonging to this subdomain was a delay-tolerant
    WSN for the monitoring and tracking of six horses presented in Ehsan et al. (2012).
    For this purpose, authors developed necklaces that acquired information about
    horses’ position and speed at a given time, and transmitted such logs to fixed
    nodes when they were close to its coverage area. Another example of animal monitoring
    was given by Jain et al. (2008), where an IoT solution was responsible for monitoring
    the behavior and migration patterns of Swamp Deers, obtaining information of the
    animal position and the climate at the same time. Papers selected and grouped
    under the domain of control use remote actuator devices deployed on-site. Unlike
    monitoring domain applications, which handle information in one-way, applications
    categorized in control use a two-way information channel. This means that a new
    level of communication was added, and commands could be sent back to the field.
    In this case, information from the server or data center traveled to a Wireless
    Sensor and Actuator Network (WSAN) in order to control a set of actuator devices
    to modify the state of the process or environment. Commands were sent through
    a human–computer interface or as a result of a decision algorithm supported by
    analytic modules. Actuator devices included valves, pumps, humidifiers, and alarms
    among others. Many of these systems aimed to optimize the usage of water, fertilizers,
    and pesticides based on information provided by weather prediction systems and
    on-site WSN. Solutions in this domain could help farmers to reduce water consumption
    and waste by scheduling irrigation times and quantities according to the state
    of the crop and its growth cycle. Control systems were programmed to be adaptive,
    for instance, switching off sprinkler if rain was detected. Overall, solutions
    with control systems could save money to the farmer and provide at the same time
    valuable insights about the consumption of water, fertilizers, pesticides, and
    electricity. Actuator devices used by IoT solutions grouped in the control domain
    depended heavily on the subdomain to which they belonged. In this paper, the following
    subdomains were considered: irrigation (72.22%), fertilizers (5.56%), pesticides
    (5.56%), illumination (5.56%), and access control (5.56%). During the review,
    it was found that some studies used actuators in the domain of logistics (5.56%).
    Representative examples of IoT applications categorized in the control domain
    are described next. • Irrigation control: A precision irrigation solution based
    on wireless sensor network was proposed by Kanoun et al. (2014). The main challenge
    of that study was to create an automated irrigation system which could reduce
    water waste, saving energy, time, and money. This system was built using three
    nodes based on the TelosB mote: (i) a node to measure soil moisture and soil temperature;
    (ii) a node to measure environmental parameters such as air temperature, air humidity,
    wind speed and brightness; and (iii) a node that was connected to a valve for
    irrigation control. Data were transmitted to a base station for storage and were
    sent to the farmer’s PC to allow him to take action. Another precision irrigation
    IoT system was proposed by Jiao et al. (2014). This included an environmental
    monitoring system for agricultural management, as well as the implementation of
    precision dripping. The system considered an IoT ecosystem divided into three
    layers corresponding to sensing, transmission, and application. A WSN was used
    to perceive environmental information in real time within a tomato greenhouse,
    to later transmit the data to a remote server management system. In Shuwen and
    Changli (2015) researchers described a remote farmland irrigation monitoring solution
    based on ZigBee. The system included a solar-powered irrigation control system
    that also monitored air temperature, humidity and soil temperature. • Fertilizer
    and pesticide control: IoT solutions categorized in this subdomain applied conservation
    practices to improve nutrient usage, efficiency, crop quality, overall yield,
    and economic return while reducing off-site transport of nutrients. In Pahuja
    et al. (2013), authors developed an online micro-climate monitoring and control
    system for greenhouses. The system was supported by a WSN to gather and analyze
    plant-related sensor data to produce actions to control the climate, fertilization,
    irrigation, and pests. • Illumination control: authors in Yoo et al. (2007) described
    an automated agriculture system based on WSN for monitoring greenhouses used to
    grow melons and cabbages. The system monitored the growing process of crops and
    controlled the greenhouse’s environment. Some of the variables measured included
    ambient light, temperature, and humidity. For the greenhouse with melons, the
    system could control the illumination by changing the light state through a relay.
    • Access control: An agricultural intrusion detection system was presented in
    Roy et al. (2015). The proposed system generated alarms in the farmers house and
    sent a text message to the farmer’s mobile phone when an intruder entered the
    crop field. Selected papers categorized in the prediction domain were focused
    on providing knowledge and tools to farmers to support decision making. They had
    specific modules for these tasks in their architecture, and their predicted variables
    were grouped as follows: environmental conditions (42.86%), production estimation
    (42.86%), and crop growth (14.29%). • Environmental conditions: A representative
    example of environmental condition prediction is proposed in Khandani and Kalantari
    (2009), where authors described a design methodology to determine the spatial
    sampling of humidity sensors for the soil within a WSN. They used a historical
    database of dense soil-humidity measurements to determine the behavior of the
    2D correlation that exists between the measurements of nearby sensors. This was
    used later to find the largest spatial sampling that ensured a user-defined variance
    for the estimation on any given point of interest in the space. Authors found
    that the spatial correlation function decays exponentially with the distance between
    sensors. Another example of the prediction of environmental conditions was presented
    in Luan et al. (2015), which described a system that integrates drought monitoring
    and forecasting as well as irrigation prediction using IoT. • Production estimation:
    Authors in Lee et al. (2013) presented an IoT-based agricultural production system
    for stabilizing supply and demand of agricultural products. They achieved this
    goal by sensing environmental variables and by developing a prediction system
    for the growth and yield of crops. In a different application, (Saville et al.,
    2015) introduced a real-time estimation system for fixed-net fishery using ultrasonic
    sensors and supervised learning. • Crop growth: a dynamic analysis of farmlands
    using mobile sensors was presented in Lee et al. (2012). The developed system
    aimed to establish growth-control plans for grapes, and viticulture activities.
    The last domain used to categorize selected studies was logistics. Logistics in
    agriculture refers to the physical flow of entities and related information from
    producer to consumer to satisfy consumer demand. It includes: agricultural production,
    acquisition, transportation, storage, loading and unloading, handling, packaging,
    distribution, and related activities. Some objectives of logistics in agriculture
    include: adding value to agricultural products, saving money in distribution costs,
    improving shipping efficiency, reducing unnecessary losses, and to some extent,
    avoiding risks (Liping, 2012). Primary studies in logistics were further divided
    in: production (55.6%), commerce (22.2%) and transport(22.2%). The next paragraphs
    include representative studies of each subdomain. • Production: in Feng et al.
    (2012) researchers proposed an intelligent system for monitoring an apple orchard
    that implemented suggestions based on data. The system aimed to reduce management
    costs of apple orchards, improve apple quality, and provide detailed, comprehensive
    and accurate electronic information for planting works, pest warnings, and production-quality
    tracking of apples. The system included WSN using Zigbee, GPRS, and IoT providing
    detailed monitoring data of apple growth for agricultural cooperatives, to support
    for decision making in farming. • Commerce: (Li et al., 2013) presented an information
    system for agriculture based on IoT which used a distributed architecture. In
    that study, tracking and tracing of the whole agricultural production process
    were made with distributed IoT servers. Moreover, an information-discovery system
    was designed to implement, capture, standardize, manage, locate, and query business
    data from agricultural production. The system also allowed consumers to query
    information of agricultural products to verify their authenticity and quality.
    • Transport: A representative example of this subdomain is presented in Pang et
    al. (2015), where an IoT architecture was proposed for the food-production and
    commercialization chain. This paper dealt with logistics involved in the transportation
    of melons from Brazil to Sweden in a journey that takes 46 days. Sensor nodes
    measured conditions in the environment including oxygen, carbon dioxide, ethylene,
    temperature, humidity, and mechanical stress, such as vibrations, tilts, and shocks.

    selected by application subdomain. 4.2. Answer to the second research question
    Infrastructure and technology used by selected IoT solutions in agro-industrial
    and environmental fields were organized in seven groups, corresponding to: (i)
    sensing variables, (ii) actuator devices, (iii) power sources, (iv) communication
    technologies, (v) edge computing technologies (Shi et al., 2016), (vi) storage
    strategies, and (vii) visualization strategies. • Sensing variables: about 26%
    of analyzed studies sense temperature, followed by humidity, physicochemical properties,
    and radiation with 16%, 11%, and 10%, respectively. Particularly, temperature
    and physicochemical sensors are distributed in all subdomains as it can be seen
    in Fig. 6. Similarly, 55% of sensors are used for air monitoring. Thus, air temperature
    and humidity, soil moisture and solar radiation, can be considered universal variables
    in agricultural applications. Download : Download high-res image (324KB) Download

    studies is shown in Fig. 7. It can be stated that there are far fewer actuator
    devices than sensors currently being used in these studies and that most of them
    are concentrated in applications of control and logistics. In fact, more than
    60% of actuators reported were found in irrigation processes. Download : Download

    device used. • Power sources: currently, most monitoring applications prefer rechargeable
    batteries connected to solar panels, which offer a simple but sustainable energy
    supply. In contrast, control applications that typically have demanding energy
    requirements prefer the electrical grid. These trends can be appreciated in Fig.
    8. Recent power sources, such as electromagnetic or vibration harvesters were
    not found in selected studies showing that these approaches must mature and gain
    popularity for agricultural and environmental applications. Download : Download

    • Communication technologies: Fig. 9 shows that most studies (40%) used Wireless
    Personal Area Network (WPAN) protocols such as Bluetooth and ZigBee, followed
    by Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN) with 36% of the studies mainly supported
    by cellular technologies (GPRS/GSM/3G/4G). Meanwhile, the near-field communication,
    which is relatively new, has started to emerge in some field applications. Download

    technologies. • Edge computing technologies: microcontroller platforms were chosen
    in more than half of the applications reviewed. Interestingly, Single Board Computers
    (SBC) are not yet appropriate for edge computing in IoT agricultural applications.
    The complete distribution of edge computing technologies is shown in Fig. 10.

    it is clear that even though Cloud storage represents a key service for IoT systems,
    only 7.32% of selected studies used it. This shows that most researchers preferred
    their own data-storage implementation. Download : Download high-res image (78KB)

    strategies: Fig. 12 shows the distribution of three different visualization strategies:
    web, mobile and local, in four subdomains: monitoring, control, prediction, and
    logistics. It can be stated that web-based solutions were the preferred strategy
    to visualize reports in all subdomains of applications. Download : Download high-res

    Most of the selected works do not address security issues explicitly and leave
    them on a side. However, some efforts in this domain were found. For instance,
    (Jardak et al., 2009) described the design of a WSN that implemented a RANdom
    SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) filter to eliminate inconsistent sensor-node data due
    to the presence of faulty or malicious nodes in the network. Sun et al. (2012)
    presented a dam monitoring system where users needed to sign in through the main
    interface in order to validate their credentials. Tao et al. (2014) selected AppWeb
    as the embedded Web server for the IoT Gateway of an intelligent granary management
    system because it could add the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to enable
    encrypted data connection. This was valuable because the network information was
    vulnerable as it came from a wireless channel. Kuroda et al. (2015) proposed a
    WSN with easy-to-use secure communication that was implemented using Zero-admin
    encrypt/decrypt functions at the MAC level with the Advanced Encryption Standard
    (AES-128), which enabled automatic encryption/decryption of messages between each
    sensor node and the coordinator node. 5. Recent works The following paragraphs
    are devoted to introducing some recent and representative works that were available
    online between May 2016 and July 2017, beyond the initial scope of the SLR process
    described so far. They cover areas such as communications, energy management,
    monitoring and logistics for agro-industrial and environmental applications. 5.1.
    Communications Low-power WAN (LPWAN) technologies such as SigFox, LoRa, narrowband
    IoT and others are becoming popular within IoT applications due to its reduced
    energy requirements, wide coverage range, and low-cost when compared to other
    long-distance technologies according to Barrachina-Muñoz et al. (2017). For example,
    in a recent survey by Sinha et al. (2017), authors found that LoRa is the best
    option for smart agriculture applications. In Lukas et al. (2015), authors designed
    a long-range water level monitoring system for troughs using a WSN based on LoRa
    transceivers, allowing the cattleman to observe water availability for livestock
    even when the barn was 1 or 3 km away. In a different application, (Pham et al.,
    2016) proposed an IoT framework to contribute to rural development implementing
    agricultural applications supported by open-source hardware and long-range communication
    devices. The first deployment of this solution used LoRa transceivers since rural
    villages were located in remote areas and it was convenient to have a low-cost
    and non-proprietary infrastructure. 5.2. Energy management One of the main requirements
    for devices used in IoT projects is that they must be energy-efficient according
    to Borgia (2014). This is particularly important for pervasive solutions deployed
    outdoors that can not be powered from the electric grid nor regularly maintained
    because they are installed in difficult or remote environments. In WSN scenarios,
    the current challenge is to develop multi-source energy harvesters and ultra-efficient
    sensors to create battery-free solutions, (Shaikh and Zeadally, 2016). These considerations
    are very important for IoT solutions for agro-industrial and environmental problems
    as recharging batteries is not practical and ambient energy sources are usually
    available. In terms of smart energy control for IoT projects, (Wang et al., 2016)
    proposed a novel energy management strategy for solar powered devices that intend
    to power the load directly from the solar cell, avoiding power converters and
    energy storage elements that contribute to energy losses, greater weight/volume
    ratio, and higher price. Another trend that is likely to continue is the development
    of self-power devices, such as the soil water content sensor for an autonomous
    landslide surveillance system designed by Lu et al. (2016). In this case, the
    sensor used the soil moisture to power itself making it suitable for large scale
    deployments. Marjanović et al. (2016) described a cloud-based decision-making
    mechanism for managing sensor data acquisition that is applicable to collaborative
    sensing solutions using distributed sensors, like mobile devices, to efficiently
    monitor large geographical areas. The system selected which sensors had to upload
    the information to the cloud to prevent the acquisition of redundant information
    from other nearby sensors for a specific coverage area, maintaining a spatial
    sampling quality and reducing in this way the battery depletion of the devices.
    5.3. Monitoring Recent environmental monitoring solutions are now offering additional
    capabilities in terms of decision making and management. For example, (Giorgetti
    et al., 2016) proposed a custom-made landslide risk monitoring system based on
    a WSN that allows fast deployments in hostile environments without human intervention
    because the system is able to deal with node failure and poor-quality communication
    links reorganizing the network by itself. Wong and Kerkez (2016) presented a Web
    service and real-time data architecture that includes an adaptive controller that
    updates the parameters of each sensing node within a WSN based on a previously
    defined policy. Zheng et al. (2016) proposed an IoT management system to protect
    the ecological and environmental quality while building an artificial river where
    nature and city converge. The system monitored key elements like soil, water,
    atmosphere, and wind at a high spatial resolution over a large area. Edwards-Murphy
    et al. (2016) introduced a beehive monitoring system that collects internal and
    external data to describe the status of the bee colony from a set of possible
    states using a classification algorithm based on decision trees. This information
    was used to determine if a visit to the beehive was required or not. As an additional
    result, authors found a strong correlation between the beehive status and the
    short-term rain forecast. Overall, this study is relevant for agriculture because
    crop pollination depends on honey bees. Sarangi et al. (2016) presented a framework
    for an automated crop-disease advisory service that integrates the interoperability
    of an IoT web repository with an agricultural advisory call center. The implemented
    system processes images of the diseased plant sent by the farmer, and then it
    provides the plant diagnosis and the corresponding management recommendation for
    the disease. 5.4. Logistics Food safety and quality control in logistics are emerging
    as IoT agribusiness areas in response to the demand from businesses and end consumers
    to obtain real-time information about food supply chain and “farm-to-fork” traceability.
    For instance, (Ruan and Shi, 2016) presented an IoT framework to assess the fruit
    freshness on e-commerce deliveries, which is a non-traditional retail service
    that faces unique challenges in transportation due to the product perishability
    and expensive logistics. Similarly, (Liu et al., 2016) introduced a pilot project
    using IoT to monitor food safety throughout the product life cycle, helping authorities
    and consumers to trace the food and make better decisions before buying it. In
    a related work, (Wang and Yue, 2017) proposed an early-warning system for food
    safety that automatically warns about product quality risks and incidents by sharing
    and centralizing information among supply chains. Lastly, (Capello et al., 2016)
    developed a business-to-business monitoring service based on IoT that provides
    geo-located information (humidity and temperature) about food storage and transportation
    without a vendor lock-in infrastructure. 6. Discussion 6.1. Limitations and open
    challenges After analyzing the difficulties and limitations described in selected
    papers from the SLR, the following list summarizes a few insights that aim to
    contribute to the mass adoption of IoT solutions in agricultural and environmental
    fields. • Stronger standardization: it will help to improve compatibility among
    different vendors and to ensure stronger security measures across the entire IoT
    stack, starting from field devices all the way up to cloud providers and end-user
    interfaces (Pang et al., 2015). • Better power management: it will increase the
    endurance of IoT solutions because nowadays the main factor limiting the lifespan
    of IoT deployments is energy depletion (Jain et al., 2008, Chen et al., 2014,
    Islam et al., 2014, Diedrichs et al., 2014). The lifespan can be improved by lowering
    the power consumption of each electronic module, including energy harvesters,
    and using alternative power storage mechanisms as replacements of rechargeable
    batteries, which affect the expiration date of deployed devices. • Security: a
    major challenge in the realization of the IoT in agriculture is the security problem
    (Jiang and Zhang, 2013), and the few works that consider it only incorporate fragmented
    strategies to mitigate it. Therefore, it is evident that there is a need for agro-industrial
    and environmental IoT solutions that address end-to-end information security and
    physical integrity of field devices. • Design using modular hardware and software:
    it will enable a greater degree of reuse and customization for the end user (Pang
    et al., 2015). • Improve unit cost: even though the cost of embedded computing
    platforms have been decreasing sharply, the same is not true for high-quality
    sensors and actuators. In order to deploy IoT solutions with hundreds and possibly
    thousands of nodes, the overall hardware, Internet access and international data
    roaming costs have to be reduced even further (Pang et al., 2015). • Aim for a
    good compatibility with legacy infrastructure: similarly to what has happened
    in industrial automation, it is important to deliver IoT solutions that can be
    integrated with the customer’s existing infrastructure such as specialized equipment,
    field machines, and software. • Consider scalability early on: with an increasing
    number of devices in large deployments, data synchronization and data reliability
    become critical (Diedrichs et al., 2014). • Adopt good practices of software engineering:
    as the scale and endurance of deployed IoT solutions grow, the time and effort
    devoted to analyzing generated data, refining the code, and adding new features
    will explode unless the software is well designed and documented (Hussain et al.,
    2006, Jayaraman et al., 2015a). • Improve robustness for field deployments: commercial
    IoT solution should be able to handle strong changes in temperature, humidity,
    and illumination to deal with seasonal changes and worldwide climate variability.
    • User-centered design: the installation and management of corresponding IoT nodes
    should be straight forward for non-expert users. Additionally, the hardware must
    require very little or none human maintenance during its lifespan, and the underlying
    communication network should be intelligent enough to reconfigure or heal itself
    in the case of a node failure. • Contribute to the IoT the ecosystem: there is
    a noticeable void in the literature on how to improve and adapt IoT solutions
    for real-world applications beyond simple prototypes (Chen et al., 2015). • Sustainable
    practices: even if the most humble predictions about the worldwide adoption of
    IoT devices become a reality, recycling strategies will have to be taken into
    account for new solutions deployed on the field, as an integral part of the product
    life cycle to reduce the environmental impact. 6.2. Proposed architecture To summarize
    the findings of this study, authors proposed the IoT architecture for agro-industrial
    and environmental applications that is illustrated in Fig. 13. This encapsulates
    most of the studies analyzed in this paper. The architecture has four main layers:
    physical, communication, service, and application. The physical layer includes
    perception and control. In perception, the main objective is to produce valuable
    data sensing field variables using a WSN. Data produced are sent to the communication
    layer through field gateways. Devices in the perception layer can be powered by
    batteries for short-term deployments or by solar panels because of their low-power
    consumption. In contrast, the control layer acts as a data sink, receiving information
    from a communication layer or a perception layer in the simplest case. Information
    received in the control layer alters the state of field actuators frequently requiring
    power from the electrical grid. In the middle of the perception and control layers
    there is a mobile robot that can be used when fixed devices are not the best option.
    In the communication layer, the objective is to move the information from the
    physical layer to the Internet, collecting data from IoT gateways based either
    on Ethernet or mobile networks (e.g: GPRS/3G/4G/NB-IoT and eventually 5G). This
    layer includes field gateways acting as interfaces between IoT gateways and transceivers
    using ZigBee, Bluetooth, NFC, WiFi, LoRA, or Sigfox. The service layer handles
    data ingestion from the communication layer, as well as their storage, analytics,
    visualization, and security. Finally, the application layer consumes services
    from the previous layer in the architecture and allows the user to handle monitoring,
    control, prediction, and logistics. Download : Download high-res image (717KB)

    review of IoT applications for agro-industrial and environmental fields. It was
    guided by a systematic literature review, and therefore the methodology and intermediate
    results obtained during the stages of planning, conduction, and results were reported
    in great detail. From 3578 initial studies extracted from electronic sources,
    72 main studies were selected based on their relevance to answer two research
    questions. Selected studies came from five continents, and Asian countries contributed
    to more than half of them. During this study, it was discovered that most of the
    research still focuses on monitoring applications (62%); however there is a growing
    interest in closing the loop by doing control (25%), and there are some preliminary
    solutions in logistics and prediction (13%) for agro-industrial and environmental
    applications using IoT. The temperature and humidity of the air, as well as the
    soil moisture and solar radiation can be recognized as universal variables measured
    in agricultural applications based on selected studies. Similarly, actuators such
    as valves, pumps, motors, sprinklers, humidifiers, and lamps were widely used
    in irrigation, fertilization, pesticide management, and illumination control.
    It was also observed that new energy sources and Cloud storage have not been widely
    adopted, showing that there are opportunities for research and development in
    these areas. Studies included in this paper provide a compact view of solutions
    proposed for agro-industrial and environmental problems during the last decade.
    It was found that most of them relied heavily on heterogeneous components and
    wireless sensor networks. However, it seems reasonable to assume that future solutions
    will need to fully embrace Cloud services and new ways of connectivity in order
    to get the benefits of a truly connected and smart IoT ecosystem. Acknowledgements

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction The importance of environmental
    monitoring is undoubted in our age. This is the field where wireless sensor networks
    (WSNs) have been first used, their primary purpose consisting in the observation
    of the physical world and the recording of physical quantities characterizing
    it [1]. WSNs are large networks of resource-constrained sensors with processing
    and wireless communication capabilities, which implement different application
    objectives within a specific sensing field. They can also be used for ambient
    monitoring, a topic of great interest nowadays as well, indoor air quality representing
    an important factor affecting the comfort, health, and safety of building occupants
    [2], [3]. Finally, the use of wireless ambient sensors can lead to more energy-efficient
    buildings [4]. The constant attempts of social and economic bodies for the development
    of technologies for improving energy efficiency and reducing pollution and for
    the more efficient use of national infrastructure along with the needs of decreasing
    the cost of computation, networking, and sensing had lead to the emergence of
    a new generation of digital systems, called cyber-physical systems (CPSs), less
    than a decade ago. These include embedded systems, sensor networks, actuators,
    coordination and management processes, and services to capture physical data and
    to act on the physical environment, all integrated under an intelligent decision
    system [5], [6]. In this context, wireless sensors can be used to collect physical
    information that is further exploited by CPSs [7]. This will lead to CPSs composed
    of interconnected clusters of processing elements and large-scale wired and wireless
    networks of sensors and actuators gathering data about and acting upon the environment
    [8]. These newly appeared systems have a lot of similarities with the Internet
    of Things (IoT), an enabler of ubiquitous sensing, that envisions a world in which
    many billions of Internet-connected objects or things, with sensing, communication,
    computing, and potentially actuating capabilities, will coexist, allowing an uninterrupted
    connection between people and things [9]. This paper presents a system for environmental
    and ambient parameter monitoring using low-power wireless sensors connected to
    the Internet, which send their measurements to a central server using the IEEE
    802.11 b/g standards. Finally, data from all over the world, stored on the base
    station, can be remotely visualized from every device connected to the Internet.
    This overcomes the problem of system integration and interoperability, providing
    a well-defined architecture that simplifies the transmission of data from sensors
    with different measurement capabilities and increases supervisory efficiency [10].
    Until recently, Wi-Fi technology has not been considered for implementing wireless
    sensing solutions because of its inability to meet the challenges in these types
    of systems, with the major drawback consisting in the unsatisfactory energy consumption.
    However, this has changed, since new power-efficient Wi-Fi devices have been developed
    and new solutions can benefit from several advantages offered by this technology,
    namely, the reduction of infrastructure costs while improving total ownership
    costs, native IP-network compatibility, and the existence of familiar protocols
    and management tools [11]. Furthermore, high transmission rates, which are required
    in industrial applications, are achievable and the access to the network in this
    case is easy and no special wireless adapters are required [12]. The rest of this
    paper is structured as follows. The next section presents the context of the present
    work, while Section III talks about the current trends and also the motivation
    of using wireless sensors in the context of CPSs and of the IoT. Section IV gives
    a description of the developed CPS, with its two main components, the Wi-Fi sensors
    and the data-center. The general structure of the system and the main characteristics
    of the two types of devices are presented here. Section V presents the experimental
    results of the proposed system, highlighting the performances characteristics
    in terms of reliability influenced by package losses. Finally, Section VI gives
    the concluding remarks and the directions for future work. SECTION II. Related
    Work and Contribution The literature contains a large number of efforts for developing
    monitoring solutions that benefit from the advantages provided by wireless sensing
    technology. Reference [13] presents an automated irrigation system based on a
    distributed wireless network of soil moisture and temperature sensors that achieves
    water savings of 90% compared with traditional implementations. Sentinella is
    a smart monitoring solution for the assessment of possible causes of power inefficiency
    at the photovoltaic panel level based on WSNs [14]. The employment of WSNs in
    smart grid applications and electrical energy monitoring solutions for large buildings
    was also investigated [15], [16]. A series of industrial WSNs achieving the acquisition
    of heterogeneous sensor signals, higher sampling rates, and higher reliability
    levels has been developed as well [17], [18]. However, most of the proposed solutions
    are based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard and ZigBee applications, and they rely
    on gateways when the data has to be sent to the Internet [13], [16]–[18]. Furthermore,
    in this case, additional applications have to be developed for encapsulating the
    data in Internet protocols, such as user datagram protocol (UDP) or transmission
    control protocol (TCP). Another promising technology providing high power efficiency
    is Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), which was first introduced in 2010 with the goal
    of expanding the use of Bluetooth to power-constrained devices such as wireless
    sensors [19]. However, a lot of research work still has to be performed in this
    direction, for finally being able to receive relevant information from remote
    BLE-enabled devices requiring small amounts of data communication and energy.
    Furthermore, gateways are also required for sending the data to the Internet.
    Therefore, the use of Wi-Fi sensors, as the ones in the system presented in this
    paper, which connect directly to the existing IEEE 802.11 b/g infrastructure seems
    to be a better, more straightforward, and less expensive solution. This is beneficial
    especially for applications deployed in indoor spaces or urban areas, where there
    is a high probability that access points are present. The main contribution of
    this paper, a continuation of [20] and [21], consists in the development of a
    reliable, stand-alone, low-cost, and low-power scalable system, with reduced total
    cost of ownership (TCO), allowing the remote visualization of environmental and
    ambient data in places where IEEE 802.11 b/g network coverage exists. Reference
    [20] presents a complete solution for temperature and relative humidity monitoring
    using low-power wireless devices, allowing a battery lifetime of 2 years when
    a 20-min measurement cycle is used. Here, a data viewer and data processing application,
    running on a personal computer, is included. This provides functionalities for
    alarming the user by e-mail or SMS. Reference [21] describes the development of
    compact battery-powered systems allowing the monitoring of carbon dioxide levels,
    temperatures, relative humidity, absolute pressure, and light intensity, which
    send the data using the existent wireless infrastructure based on the IEEE 802.11
    standards. A LabVIEW application that gathers the data from the sensors and places
    them on a public cloud for the IoT was also developed, demonstrating the possibility
    of recording and visualizing data from every place where an Internet connection
    is available. The work presented here leads to a ubiquitous network architecture,
    where the sensors are part of the Internet [22]. The developed monitoring solution,
    a CPS that incorporates all the developed Wi-Fi sensors and a cloud platform,
    allows the acquisition of data from every place where a wireless IEEE 802.11 network
    exists and the visualization of recorded data from every terminal connected to
    the Internet, without any additional hardware and software application other that
    an Internet browser. The novelty of the hardware and software implementation in
    the case of the proposed system consists in the development of a reliable stand-alone
    solution with a reduced power consumption of all its components, namely, the wireless
    sensors and the cloud platform. The choices regarding the used components and
    their hardware and software design lead to a low-cost system with reduced TCO.
    The previous work showed that the developed sensors can operate for approximately
    3 years on a single 3 V battery [21]. Although the development of IEEE 802.11-based
    sensors may not be new, the power efficiency of the developed sensors represents
    a significant contribution, achieving a battery lifetime similar to the one provided
    by more power-efficient solutions, based on IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee communication.
    The proposed monitoring system takes advantage of the existing IEEE 802.11 infrastructure,
    which currently has a coverage exceeded only by the one provided by cellular networks.
    SECTION III. Wireless Sensors in Cyber-Physical Systems The advances in embedded
    systems and information communication technologies had led to the development
    of sensors, which are continuously getting more powerful, smaller, and cheaper.
    These offer a range of advances over traditional wired sensor applications, the
    most important consisting in the cost reduction and simplification of deployment
    through the elimination of wires. All the aforementioned facts encourage the adoption
    of wireless sensor networks at a scale never encountered before and it is expected
    that in the future, this trend will not only continue but also become even more
    accentuated. Furthermore, the development of CPSs brought new demands and opportunities
    for the use of WSNs, the combination of advanced sensing, measurement and process
    control having applicability across a wide range of domains, such as transportation,
    energy, civil infrastructure, environmental monitoring, defense, smart buildings,
    manufacturing and production, and others. There is no single well-established
    definition for the term CPSs in the literature, but almost all of the descriptions
    given start from the fact that these systems represent the intersection between
    computations and physical processes, and not their union [23]. A complex definition
    of CPSs was given by S. Shankar Sastry who states that a CPS integrates computing,
    communication, and storage capabilities with monitoring and/or control of entities
    in the physical world, and must do so dependably, safety, securely, efficiently,
    and in real time. In addition, CPSs can be defined as follows: CPSs refer to Information
    and Communications Technology (ICT) systems (sensing, actuating, computing, communication,
    and others) embedded in physical objects, interconnected including through Internet,
    and providing citizens and businesses with a wide range of innovative applications
    and services [24]. All of the definitions in the literature emphasize a strong
    relationship between computational (cybernetic) and physical resources in order
    to exceed the nowadays ICT systems in terms of autonomy, efficiency, functionality,
    adaptability, dependability, and usability. According to these statements, the
    system presented in this paper represents a CPS that employs wireless sensors
    for gathering and presenting data about the environment. The connection between
    the components in large-scale systems leads to the IoT, a concept similar to CPSs,
    which represents a new step in the evolution of the Internet [25]. The IoT is
    defined as a vision that allows people and things to be connected anytime, anyplace,
    with anything and anyone, ideally using any path/network and any service [26].
    This represents a major domain that relies on sensor networks, their presence
    being essential here, where they can collect surrounding context and environment
    information. In this case, the data generated by sensors are sent to sink nodes
    and, finally, reaches the cloud, where they will be stored, shared, and processed
    accordingly to its relevance. Besides the advantages brought by this novel use
    of wireless sensors connected directly to the Internet, a set of challenges that
    have to be addressed, such as security and privacy, the management of huge amounts
    of data, quality of service, network configuration, and others, emerge. SECTION
    IV. System Architecture A. General Overview A graphical representation of the
    entire CPS used for monitoring the environment in indoor or outdoor spaces, where
    IEEE 802.11 b/g network coverage exists, is presented in Fig. 1. Fig. 1. CPS for
    environmental monitoring. Show All The two main system components consist of the
    following. Wi-Fi Sensors: Low-power wireless sensors based on the programmable
    system-on-chip 3 (PSoC 3) device [27] and on the RN-131C/G wireless local area
    network (WLAN) module [28]. IoT Platform: A BeagleBone Black embedded computer
    [29] running the server application. The detailed description of the hardware
    and software of the two system components will be given in the remainder of the
    section. B. Wi-Fi Sensors 1) Node Architecture: The Wi-Fi sensors are represented
    by low-power multifunctional devices, having the three basic capabilities encountered
    in wireless sensor nodes, which consist in sensing, data processing, and communication.
    Several models of the Wi-Fi sensors were developed, employing the RN-131C/G WLAN
    module, using two main architectures: one in which the Wi-Fi module is used at
    its full potential (Fig. 2), being the central part of the node, and the other
    one in which an external processor is used for controlling the RN-131C/G component
    through serial commands sent over Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter
    (UART) (Fig. 3) [20], [21]. Fig. 2. Wi-Fi sensor hardware architecture—the first
    model [20]. Show All Fig. 3. Wi-Fi sensor hardware architecture—the second model
    [21]. Show All The embedded application stack of the devices using the architecture
    in Fig. 2 is implemented on the Wi-Fi chip and uses the Embedded Configurable
    Operating System (eCos) operating system and the services provided by the software
    development kit for specifying the measurement and communication actions [20].
    The sensors that can be attached to the node measure the temperature (analog—PT1000
    and digital—DS18B20 [30]) or temperature and relative humidity (DHT22 [31]). While
    the PT1000 sensor is read through an analog input, the protocols implemented by
    the WLAN module for communicating with the digital sensors are 1-Wire for the
    DS18B20 sensor and a proprietary protocol for the DHT22 sensor. The measurement
    application running on the node starts at predefined time intervals, performs
    the measurements, sends the recordings, and goes back to sleep for minimizing
    the power consumption. Depending on the sensor attached to the device, different
    ranges for the temperatures are available. The use of the WLAN module as the central
    processing component of the node reduced the communication latency and costs for
    the node, but the need of adding other sensors communicating on different protocols
    lead to the development of a second architecture, which is presented in Fig. 3.
    This second architecture is based on a CY8C3246PVI-147 [32] programmable system
    on-chip microcontroller produced by Cypress Semiconductor, the part that initiates
    all the actions performed by the wireless node. The devices in this category can
    measure CO2 (carbon dioxide) levels, temperatures, and the relative humidity in
    the air, the absolute pressure, and the light intensity using the following digital
    sensors: a Cozir ambient sensor [33], a DHT22, an MPL115A2 barometer [34] and
    a TSL2561 [35], respectively. These sensors can appear in any combination attached
    to a Wi-Fi device, with or without an LCD for the local visualization of the measured
    values. The communication with each one of the components is performed through
    using different protocols: serial data transmission for the carbon dioxide sensor
    and for the Wi-Fi module, a proprietary protocol for the DHT22 sensor, and I 2
    C with the barometric pressure and light sensors. Being a wireless sensing node,
    with constraints regarding its power supply, the device stays most of the time
    in sleep mode and wakes up only when measurements and result transmissions have
    to be performed. This is one of the most efficient strategies for minimizing energy
    consumption in these kinds of systems [18]. Furthermore, because the power consumption
    of all the attached transducers in sleep mode does not allow long battery lifetimes,
    a separate power supply was developed and included in this second design. It uses
    a chip that provides high efficiency while using small amounts of power, consuming
    less than 1 μA in shutdown mode. These, coupled with the use of a high-capacity
    (1500 mAh) battery, only slightly influenced by temperature variations and loads,
    lead to periods of continuous operation of up to three years without its replacement.
    2) Models: Finally, more than ten types of sensors are present in the proposed
    CPS. Table I presents 12 different device configurations for a sensor node, noting
    that when more than one sensor is present, they operate in the same time. TABLE
    I Wi-Fi Sensors in the CPS 3) Configuration and Operation: All the developed sensors,
    built using either one of the two architectures, have the same lithium CR123A
    3 V battery as the power supply and transmit data through the same protocol, the
    only difference consisting in the configuration mode, which uses different menus.
    However, the procedure is similar and it is performed through the serial interface
    using an RS232 cable and a telnet client. The menus allow the specification and
    the display of the parameters required for the proper operation of the wireless
    sensors, namely, the period between measurements, which can be set to have a value
    between several seconds and 60 min; the information for connecting to WLANs, namely,
    the channel used, the Service Set Identifier, and passwords; the data server information,
    which includes the server port and the IP; the node IP; the gateway and the subnet
    mask, which are important in the case in which data is sent outside the local
    area network (LAN) to which the sensor is connected; and the CO2 sensor’s configuration,
    if this is present in the design. The presence of the carbon dioxide sensor significantly
    affects the design of the device’s hardware and software components, requiring
    the use of a separate power supply, a dc/dc converter, in the case of the model
    based on the PSoC 3 device. The carbon dioxide nondispersive infrared sensor requires
    special routines for calibration also and additional recordings in the menu are
    added for setting the parameters of different types of supported calibration routines:
    autocalibration, calibration using a gas containing no CO2, calibration using
    a known gas concentration, and calibration using fresh air. The calibration routine
    for nondispersive infrared carbon dioxide sensors has to compensate for the sensor
    drift that appears after long operation times. It implies the addition of an offset
    value to all readings. This is computed as the difference between the readings
    when a sensor is exposed to a known gas concentration and the original calibration
    value and is performed through sensor specific commands issued by the core microcontroller.
    These types of sensors also require a warm-up period, which significantly affects
    the power consumption of the device. This is proportional to the digital filter
    that can be set to a value between 2 and 32 instant measurements for attenuating
    the noise in the carbon dioxide level readings. Besides the CO2 sensor and the
    PT1000 probe, no other sensor requires calibration actions, this being performed
    at the factory. The entire system is a duty-cycled one, so the components are
    powered only for short periods of time, depending on the action they perform and
    on the period between measurements set by the user [36]. This leads to the low-power
    operation of the device and to the possibility of using the same 3 V battery for
    several years. After each measurement, the Wi-Fi module is woken up, and specially
    formatted messages are sent to the previously set IP address. In the design including
    the microcontroller core and the WLAN module on the same printed circuit board,
    communication between the two is performed through the UART using an advanced
    application programming interface software, called WiFly [37]. Here, the RN-131C/G
    module automatically connects to a specific access point and acts as a pipe, sending
    serial information over UDP, after being powered. 4) Data Transmission: For minimizing
    the power consumption, a unidirectional data transmission scheme was used, and
    the sensors waking up periodically, powering up the attached sensors, taking the
    measurements, and sending the data using the Wi-Fi module and the UDP protocol.
    The choice of the protocol was motivated by the lower packet size, increased speed,
    and low latency compared with that of TCP/IP and by the fact that it offers connectionless
    communication. These contribute to the reduction of the power consumption with
    disadvantages regarding the security and reliability of the transmission. The
    reliability could be very easily improved by sending more than one measurement
    each cycle, so that packet losses are compensated for, and the addition of a cyclic
    redundancy check for signaling data alterations. A simple at hand solution in
    the case of the security would be the addition of a simple cryptographic scheme
    for the data transmission [38]. However, environmental monitoring does not require
    high sampling rates and tight deadlines and does not manage sensitive information.
    This is the reason why these aspects were not approached until now, only standard
    WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access II) encryption or the security protocol in the wireless
    computer network to which the sensor node is connected is used. All the sensors
    send data packets having the same structure. They consist of opcodes preceded
    by a hexadecimal number specifying the device model, which is read and processed
    by the server for the proper interpretation of the message. The opcodes consist
    of fixed-size numerical codes representing pairs of hexadecimal numbers associated
    with a specific function, with the first element being the function code and the
    second its associated value. Table II presents some examples of opcodes sent by
    the Wi-Fi sensors. The message structure depends on the device model and on the
    type and number of sensors attached to the device. TABLE II Message Components
    5) Node Power Consumption: The device consuming the largest amount of power was
    tested for determining the lifetime of a 3 V battery powering up the system. For
    granting proper operation, a minimum operating voltage of 2.4 V is specified,
    although the system operates event at smaller voltages (minimum 1.8 V). During
    one cycle, the values of the carbon dioxide concentration in the air, the temperature,
    the relative humidity, the absolute pressure, and light intensity are measured
    and sent to the server. The wakeup period in this case is determined by the warm-up
    period of the CO2 sensor and it is larger than in the case of all the other devices
    that do not include it. Therefore, it is expected that all the other models will
    operate for longer periods of time with the same measurement cycle. The battery
    discharge curve (Fig. 4) was generated for a sensor with the aforementioned characteristics,
    each message containing also the voltage of the power source. For this experiment,
    the node including all the sensors (CO2, T, RH, P, and light intensity) was set
    to take the measurements every 10 s, with a wake up period that lasts for 6 s.
    The battery voltage is sent with every measurement and the discharge curve was
    generated using this data. This has a characteristic similar to the ones given
    by CR123A 3 V battery manufacturers for a given load. Table III presents the estimation
    of the battery lifetime for a node with a wake up period of 6 s, during which
    it consumes 42–78 mW, depending on the performed action: measurement, association
    with the AP, and data transmission [21]. The power consumption during sleep is
    less than 30 μW . By knowing these values, the leakage currents, and by modifying
    the sleep/wake-up ratio, the data in Table III are resulted. Fig. 4. Battery discharge
    curve for the 10-s measurement cycle. Show All TABLE III Battery Lifetime C. IoT
    Platform The IoT platform is, in fact, a BeagleBone Black single-board computer
    based on the ARM Cortex-A8 processor running at 1 GHz [29]. This choice was motivated
    by the advantages provided by this device when the development of a reliable stand-alone
    low-cost platform is targeted. Moreover, the use of the BeagleBone Black as part
    of the proposed solution leads to low power consumption and to a reduced TCO.
    A server application runs on the IoT platform. This listens to the UDP port, interprets
    the messages received from the sensors, and saves the data in a database in the
    device’s internal memory or on a microSD card. A Web server is installed on the
    platform for providing access to the data requested by authenticated users for
    further analysis. 1) UDP Port Listener and Message Interpreter: This component
    is in charge of listening the UDP port to which the sensors transmit the packets
    containing the measurement data. The data received are stored into a buffer and
    processed for being saved in a database. A benchmark program was written to compute
    the average processing time for each received message. This includes message interpretation
    and data saving into the database. An average period of 1.5 ms was observed for
    each data packet that was received and saved on the local memory. When the microSD
    card is used for storing the information, the time increases to about 120 ms for
    each recording. This is important because the application stores the received
    packets in a queue and processes them one by one. Therefore, every message should
    be handled as fast as possible and this raises problems when a large number of
    sensors send data in the same time, as Section V shows. 2) Database: The SQLite
    software library was chosen for storing the data received from the Wi-Fi sensors
    in a database [39]. The motivation for choosing this solution consists in the
    changes and queries that are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable, not being
    affected by crashes, whatever their cause. SQLite is suitable for embedded applications
    and for implementing a website database, the case of the proposed solution. 3)
    Web Server: An open source licensed small memory footprint Web server, namely,
    lighttpd, was installed on the IoT platform for remote data visualization (Fig.
    5) [40]. Fig. 5. Monitoring application. Show All Fig. 6 presents a simple Web

    As an example, a Web client application displaying the temperature, relative humidity,
    and carbon dioxide charts for the data sent by a sensor having a specific MAC
    address was created (Fig. 7). Fig. 6. Web client application showing temperature

    V. Experimental Results A number of experiments were performed for providing data
    related to the reliability and performance of the proposed system. The first two
    sets of experiments consisted in the testing of the server’s capabilities of processing
    large numbers of messages received from sensors in a short period of time (named
    from here on also as time window). First, a desktop PC was used for sending UDP
    messages formatted as the ones sent by the two types of sensors to the server
    platform, and then four notebook PCs using wireless communication were used to
    send the same messages through UDP. The first experiments aimed to determine the
    maximum number of packages that can be processed in a short period of time for
    a single IoT platform. This required the development of a C application sending
    UDP messages similar to the ones generated by the two types of sensors, which
    ran on a desktop computer in the same LAN as the server. The fact that no wireless
    connectivity was used here does not affect the test’s validity because the object
    of interest is represented by the server’s capability of processing the received
    messages without losing any package. Therefore, the best connection for sending
    the messages, where the risk of package collision is considered to be the lowest,
    was used. The database was then queried for finding out the ratio of package losses
    (Figs. 8 and 9). The tests revealed that the IoT platform can process 80 messages
    sent from a single source in 0.025 s without losing any package. If the number
    of packages increases and the time window remains to a value smaller than 40 ms,
    the package loss percentage increases. After this, a number of 100 packages were
    sent (Fig. 9) and the time window length was increased. Fig. 9 shows that the
    losses are reduced in this way and more data can be saved. The point in which
    90 messages are transmitted in 90 ms, when there are no package losses, is also
    represented on the plot. When 100 messages are transmitted in roughly the same
    period, 15 are not saved in the local memory. This is caused by the buffer of
    the UDP socket on the server platform, which is filled as the messages arrive
    at the port, and it is emptied as fast as the application can process them. If
    the buffer is full and new packages are received, they are discarded. However,
    the application running on the IoT platform manages the messages in a sequential
    manner, and the performances can be improved by paralleling the tasks here. Fig.
    8. Packages lost when receiving data from one source at a time window of 40 ms.
    Show All Fig. 9. Packages lost when receiving data from one source having 100
    packages. Show All For the second set of experiments, four computers in the same
    network as the IoT platform were programmed to send data in the same time. The
    four computers were not using wired connections, sending UDP messages through
    wireless communication. Figs. 10 and 11 present the results obtained in this case.
    It can be seen that for each number of packages, two time windows were used, showing
    that when the period increases, the package loss ratio decreases. It can be seen
    that there are no losses when each of the four applications sends ten messages
    (40 messages) during a 0.001-s period. Fig. 11 indicates that when the time increases
    to 230 ms, the server platform can successfully process 80 packages. As the number
    of sent packages increases, the losses also increase, because of the inability
    of the server application to process messages and to prevent the filling of the
    the UDP buffer. Of course, having multiple messages sent in the same time, collisions
    can also occur. Fig. 10. Packages lost when receiving data from four sources at
    a time window of less than 20 ms. Show All Fig. 11. Packages lost when receiving
    data from four sources at a time window of more than 120 ms. Show All These experiments
    show that the developed server can process a number of approximately 40 packages
    received in a time frame of 1 ms. If this number is not exceeded, the packages
    that never reach the server platform and that are dropped are caused by collisions
    within the network. Another set of experiments used actual nodes for evaluating
    the operation of the system in a scenario as close as possible to a real one.
    Fig. 12 shows the package loss ratio of two sensor nodes connected to the same
    access point. The architecture of one of the sensors is the one described first
    in this paper, while the second sensor’s architecture is the one based on the
    PSoC device. The IoT platform is also in the same network. For the first set of
    data, the devices were set to measure the environmental parameters using a period
    of 30 s for the first model, the one based on the RN-131 WLAN module and a period
    of 60 s for the device having the PSoC microcontroller as core. During this test,
    the devices sent approximately 6000 and 3000 measurements, respectively. The second
    set of data was obtained by setting the measurement rate to 10 min, each device
    sending approximately 400 messages. The percentage of single packages and bursts
    of packages that were lost are presented here. However, this loss of reliability
    in the case of slow dynamic processes such as temperature can be tolerated in
    the vast majority of environmental and ambient monitoring applications. The package
    losses in this experiment are not caused by the concurrent arrival of large numbers
    of sensor messages but by the communication within the network. The results in
    the first column of the figure can also be caused by the software running on the
    RN-131 module. Being an event driven application running on an eCos operating
    system, it is possible that the acquisition of data from the sensors or their
    transmission is prevented from happening in some cases at the node level. This
    leads to the need of further testing the nodes based on the stand-alone WLAN module.
    These tests show that if the message structure is modified so that six consecutive
    measurements are sent at a time, there are no losses at the server part. It is
    true that this requires more processing and storing resources at the node location
    and an increase in the complexity of the server application. Fig. 12. Package
    loss for two sensor nodes. Show All Fig. 13 presents the data sent by a 4xT+RH
    wireless sensor during one day, highlighting the package losses. Fig. 13. Temperature
    and relative humidity chart, for a 1-day interval. Show All SECTION VI. Conclusion
    The development of a CPS, which monitors environmental parameters based on the
    existent IEEE 802.11 infrastructure, was presented. It employs sensors measuring
    the ambient or the environment, which send messages to an IoT platform using UDP.
    The communication protocol and the design of the nodes help in achieving low power
    consumption, offering battery lifetimes of several years. The system eliminates
    bulky solutions, provides the possibility of logging data where Wi-Fi network
    coverage exists, and can be used in a wide range of monitoring applications. Future
    work intends to enhance the reliability and security of the proposed system. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    Abstract Information about human social activities and relationships are exploited
    by an ever increasing number of proposed applications and protocols in several
    scenarios, given the consequent increase in the system performance. Examples are
    data transmission over delay tolerant networks, content recommendation in search
    engines, and advertisement of products and services. An emerging field where social
    networks are being exploited is the Internet of Things, where smart objects connect
    to the network to bring the real world into the virtual dimension. Objects capable
    to communicate on social network sites are able to enter into their owners’ social
    loop so as to automatically publish information of interest for selected communities
    of people and to perform some related automatic actions. In so doing, not only
    can objects be part of the human social networks but they can also build their
    own social network. As a consequence, interactions among them can be fostered
    towards the development of complex services for the direct benefit of people.
    Accordingly, objects mimic the human behavior towards a scalable and effective
    service discovery and composition as well as trustworthiness management. On the
    basis of the importance achieved by this trend in the last couple of years, in
    this paper we intend to review the adopted approaches towards the exploitation
    of social network concepts by the Internet of Things, the technologies behind
    these, and the potentialities. Previous article in issue Next article in issue
    Keywords Internet of ThingsSocial networksSmart objects 1. Introduction The number
    of objects that are currently accessing the Internet, side-by-side to human beings
    to advertise, search for, and accessing enhanced services is growing exponentially.
    Among them are sensors, actuators, wireless and mobile devices, or simply every-day-life
    objects enhanced with capabilities to interact with the external world through
    the Internet. This is a clear signal that the much-vaunted (and sometime abused)
    Internet of Things paradigm is already turned into a reality on which there is
    a strong convergence of the interests of researchers, users, and industries. As
    a main effect, we have today a new approach available to build enhanced applications
    and services involving the communications among objects on the Internet to the
    service of the human beings. Several studies have focused their attention to the
    definition of architectural models and solutions towards the use and the inter-connection
    of Web-enabled objects using open protocols and well-known architectural styles,
    REST and SOAP based Web services (such as, [1], [2]). As a consequence, the obvious
    evolutionary step of the IoT is the so called Web of Things (WoTs) that envisages
    new scenarios and applications where Internet enabled objects become active actors
    and peers in the Web. Sample services, applicable to Smart Cities or Smart Homes,
    are given below: • The car driver knows about the status of her car and of the
    roads on the path towards her destination. Such awareness is achieved by accessing,
    through her mobile phone (or through any communication technology in her car),
    web services that are fed by data collected from sensors scattered both in her
    car and in the areas of interest. • The domestic appliances may be accessed by
    the owner through web services from remote sites and some actions can be performed
    on them to prepare comfortable conditions for a better welcome home. • Eco-compatible
    houses may be equipped with controllers and sensors able to measure the local
    energy production and consumption and manageable through web services towards
    a reduction of the environmental impact. Besides the obvious advantages of the
    depicted sample scenarios, one cannot hide the doubts on the ability of the proposed
    solutions to effectively harness the full potential of the new paradigm without
    colliding with the limitations of the current Web service platforms in the presence
    of trillions of additional actors (objects, precisely). In our opinion, Web of
    Things is a paradigm which goes in the right direction but is not the solution
    to the cited issues. To foster resource visibility, service discovery, object
    reputation assessment, source crowding, and service composition in a Web populated
    by people and countless things there is the necessity to strongly push towards
    solutions that exploit concepts directly derived from the sole platforms that
    currently seem to be able to effectively allow peer-to-peer exchanges among huge
    numbers of actors, i.e., Social Networks. Even if several aspects of the social
    networking among humans cannot be directly applied to the objects’ world due to
    the specific distinctive characteristics (e. g., high heterogeneity and limited
    intelligence), such a need has brought to a substantial convergence of the “Internet
    of Things” and “Social Networks” domains. Interesting ideas have recently appeared
    in the IoT arena, which testify to the interests in Social Network oriented solutions
    for the Internet of Things. People at the User Experience Lab at Ericsson Research
    started from the idea that the complexity of network solutions that underlie the
    Internet of Things are hardly understood (and mentally accepted) by all users.
    Thus, it is wise to make this complexity completely transparent during the user-thing
    interactions. Differently, the concept of “friendship” and ‘social relations’
    are understood by virtually everyone, as they are intuitive concepts. As a consequence,
    they proposed a solution to both the practical scalability and understand-ability
    issues which is simply “dressing” a network of things as if it was a social network
    [3]. They have been the first to introduce the concept of “Social Web of Things”
    and also made some applications’ prototypes. Further studies and implementations
    of this concept have been carried out around the world. An example is given by
    the work in [4], where the authors propose a Social Web of Thing Framework based
    on the Restful Web Service and Social Networks, discuss the relevant key technologies
    and use cases, and introduce a case study named MagicHome. Furthermore, even a
    prototype of a scalable architecture for a large scale social Web of Things for
    smart objects and services, named Paraimpu, has been developed [5]. In line with
    this evolutionary path, but from a different perspective, the authors of [6],
    [7] introduce the concept of Social Internet of Things. In analogy with the social
    networks of human beings, they (i) define of a notion of social relationship among
    objects, (ii) design a reference architectural model implementing a social Internet
    of Things based on codified inter-object relationships, (iii) analyze the social
    network structure, which derives from the objects interactions based on the defined
    social relationships. The examples above make us realize that the time is ripe
    for a serious reflection on the possible ways of integrating objects into social
    networks, whether they are shared with those of their owners or they are independent
    and autonomous. Aim of the present paper is to analyze the potentials of a synergic
    use of Social Networks and Internet of Things concepts towards the deployment
    of effective service platforms able to face the future challenges of a future
    world of trillions of inter-connected objects. We will illustrate the main solutions
    that are appearing in the IoT arena to let things enter the so called “social
    loop” and compare their points of strength and their weaknesses by also highlighting
    their technological requirements and architectures. This paper is organized as
    follows. In Section 2 we present the technologies behind the Web of Things as
    one of the prevailing approaches towards the integration of the objects into the
    Internet. In Section 3, we describe how this paradigm can be extended by providing
    the things with the capabilities to take part to the human social activities on
    relevant social network websites. In Section 4 we describe a complementary approach
    that allows objects to build their own social networks, so that interactions among
    them can be fostered towards the development of complex services. In Section 5
    we present the ongoing projects that come out from the concepts described in the
    previous sections. Finally, in Section 6 we draw final conclusions. 2. Web of
    Things paradigm and technologies The ongoing evolution of the Internet of Things
    towards the Web of Things (WoTs), where Web-enabled smart objects connect and
    communicate with each other by using the Web, has raised several research issues
    ranging from the adoption of the right protocol and communication paradigms to
    the choice of the most suitable architectural styles. WoT was not born as a field
    in academic research but rather as the attempt to build an ecosystem from an heterogeneous
    variety of services and products, often not conceived in a way to interoperate.
    Several efforts have focused their attention to the definition of architectural
    models and solutions, towards the use and the interconnection of Web-enabled objects,
    which exploit open protocols and well-known architectural styles, such as Representational
    State Transfer (REST) and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) based Web services.
    In [8], an architecture is defined for the development of composite applications,
    to interconnect physical devices, on top of the open and simple standards that
    made the success of the Web (REST, XML, HTTP, or Atom). The layered architecture
    is composed as follows: • Device accessibility layer: a layer that from the application
    point of view enables consistent access to all kinds of connected objects. • Find-ability
    layer: a layer that, given an ecosystem of billions of smart things, allows for
    finding their services. • Sharing layer: although device accessibility and find-ability
    can technically allow for sharing data too, this layer is specifically designed
    to manage a social circle authentication, based on accounting and authorization
    procedures. • Composition layer: a layer that enables users to create composite
    applications on top of smart things. The overall goal of this layered architecture
    is to facilitate the integration of smart things with existing services on the
    Web and to facilitate the creation of Web applications by using smart things.
    The layers above are not directly mapped onto the ISO OSI model, but are rather
    useful to understand the foundations of WoT as an ecosystem. The next subsections
    analyze the main aspects relevant to the design choices for architecting the WoT.
    These include: the architectural style (SOAP/REST), the degree of centralization,
    the device/thing degree of accessibility to the network, and the ways in which
    data, services and objects can be composed together. 2.1. SOA(P) vs. REST The
    choice between the SOAP and the REST software architecture styles deserves a deeper
    investigation. In [9] the authors go towards the definition of an architecture
    where devices are viewed as services, in order to integrate a wide range of physical
    devices into distributed IT enterprise systems adopting a Service-Oriented Architecture
    (SOA). In a similar way, the projects WS4D7 and SOCRADES [10] apply a SOA approach
    to the context of embedded networks. Moreover, existing standards for Web Services
    (WSs), focused on embedded devices, such as Device Profile for Web Services (DPWSs)
    [11], confirm a real consensus and effort towards a SOAP-based WoT. On the other
    side, some recent research works (i.e. [12], [13], [14]) adopt REST for IoT/WoT
    architectures. According to the experience documented in [13], the programmatic
    complexity of SOAP based services is not well-suited for the end-user to create
    ad hoc applications, while the authors of [14] state that, in many cases, the
    SOAP complexity becomes superfluous whereas RESTful services can support “a la
    Mash-up” integrations. In a RESTful architecture, the main resources, such as
    entities, collections, or anything else that is worth being represented in the
    application domain, are uniquely identified by its own URI. The reference methods
    - in this case, the HTTP verbs - are mapped onto application semantics in a very
    simple and straightforward way. Many new Internet companies (see the trends in
    Fig. 1) that face the market, often prefer to provide their services through a
    RESTful API rather than a solution based on SOAP. This suggests that, probably,
    REST is more immediate and less expensive for rapid prototyping. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. REST API vs. SOAP API in Google trends. The main advantages
    of REST web services can be summarized as it follows: • Lightweight – not a lot
    of extra XML markup. • Human Readable Results – in some cases (i.e., a GET request
    of a resource representation), RESTful services can be directly invoked by typing
    the URL in a common web browser. • Easy to build – no toolkits required. SOAP
    also has some advantages mainly related to the formal definition of service interfaces:
    • Easy to consume – clients can be automatically generated on the basis of the
    exact specification provided in the WSDL document. • Rigid – type checking adheres
    to a programming contract and XML schemas are provided for data exchanged to filter
    unacceptable inputs/outputs. • Development tools and business process definition
    (e.g., BPEL language). Even if the locution “Web Service” was often associated
    to the SOAP stack, this is not the way the Web works. Whereas SOAP is aimed at
    the next phase of Internet development defining a set of brand new specifications,
    REST is more the realization that the existing principles and protocols of the
    Web are already there to create robust Web services. Summarizing, even if the
    strong type checking of SOAP based Web services is a plus, in the context of the
    IoT, the RESTful Web Services have some advantages over SOAP such as less overhead,
    less parsing complexity, statelessness, and tighter integration with existing
    HTTP. Moreover, the RESTful protocol called CoAP [15] is similar to HTTP but re-designed
    especially for devices with small footprint and constrained computing environments.
    According to the recent studies mentioned in this paper it seems that the use
    of standards like CoAP and EXI and web paradigms are the key factors for extending
    the Internet making the vision of the IoT become reality. 2.2. Device accessibilty
    It is useful to explore how things can be classified according to their computation
    and communication capabilities. The following list provides a coarse classification:
    • Virtual Things. Like web sites, e-mail boxes and social networks, just to mention
    some. These “objects” can be easily wrapped and then referenced in a HTTP addressing
    space like resources (REST) or like services (WSDL) or they already provide such
    abstractions and interfaces. • HTTP-enabled Smart Appliances. Like wireless printers,
    networked screens, and smartphones. These are already equipped with a network
    connection and a complete HTTP stack but usually do not provide a WS stack; thus,
    it is necessary to deploy a proxy or to install a minimal WS stack in the device,
    where possible. Usually, HTTP-enabled objects are not able to receive incoming
    requests from outside. In many cases, they are deployed under firewall restrictions
    and only can act as clients. One possibility is to deploy in the middle a relay
    like YALER [16], which enables secure Web access to embedded systems behind a
    firewall/NAT/network gateway. A simple HTTP handshake makes a Web service running
    on the hidden device accessible from any HTTP client. Another option is WebSocket,
    which provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
    The WebSocket API is being standardized by the W3C, and the WebSocket protocol
    has been standardized by the IETF as RFC 6455. • Internet-enabled Things that
    are not equipped with a complete HTTP stack but can still communicate at the TCP/IP
    or UDP/IP level. For those objects it is straightforward to build a HTTP wrapper
    and a WS stack as a proxy. A viable protocol alternative to HTTP is CoAP [15].
    CoAP could be viewed as a compression or redesign of HTTP by taking power, memory,
    and computation constraints into account. Just like HTTP, which is designed as
    a transfer protocol for traditional web media content, CoAP is redesigned as a
    transfer protocol for devices to implement interoperations. • Network-enabled
    Things that cannot communicate over IP networks, but still can communicate with
    different protocols like ZigBee, Bluetooth or X10. For those objects a proxy can
    be deployed to present them in the HTTP addressing space, by also using WS technology
    standards. A viable solution to extend IP also to small devices that usually are
    not equipped with IP-stack is 6LoWPAN [17]. • Things not digitally enabled, bare
    physical objects. For these objects a digital counterpart must be built and published
    online. RFID or barcode sticks can be used to interface these objects with devices
    and networks. 2.3. Centralized vs. decentralized Decentralized architectures have
    a number of theoretical advantages, such as single-point-of-failure robustness
    and privacy/anonymity enforcing capability. When analyzing the Web, one discovers
    that (i) the degree of decentralization is quite low, (ii) the prominent topology
    is client–server, and (iii) even if P2P networks have gained popularity in some
    application areas, the idea to move computation at the boundaries of the Internet
    is more a niche than a main stream. The distinction between client–server and
    P2P architectures is no longer a technological distinction, but a matter of governance.
    The so-called “clouds” often adopt their own solutions of P2P load-balancing and
    fault tolerance, but the control is centralized in the hands of one provider.
    Cloud computing and Software-as-a-Service demonstrate that large IT companies
    are concentrating computation inside large globally distributed infrastructures;
    thus, transforming personal computing in a mere user interface to remote computing
    services. Also, in the new field of Internet-enabled objects, we foresee that
    P2P connections between objects are unlikely to occur unless hard real-time and
    multimedia communications are involved. A centralized online service can speak
    multiple protocols and data formats on top of HTTP and can act as a broker to
    let services meet in a logical space; it can be a proxy of data coming from sources
    and can be a relay of data to consumer services; moreover, it can make data format
    adaptation where required. In other words, it can operate at all the layers described
    above, from device accessibility to composition. In a centralized WoT tool the
    workload is put at the extreme. Some applications need to have samples on every
    second, and even only one thousand sensors connected to a central server would
    produce 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 = 86400000 events per day. The load is structured
    in many small HTTP POST messages with a keep-alive connection. The requirements
    for a cloud-based Web of Things architecture (see Fig. 2) can be summarized as
    it follows: • C10 K+[18] capable web servers (C10 K + stands for 10,000 or more
    HTTP connections handled simultaneously, i.e. non-blocking servers that do not
    map every connection to a system thread); • database engine able to be horizontally
    partitioned over a grid of machines in a transparent way (sharding); • event handling
    and data processing delegated to a pool of worker processes distributed among
    multiple processors and even different machines. Download : Download full-size

    but insightful benchmark between a non-blocking web server, like Nginx, versus
    a thread-based server, like Apache, is presented. The plots show (Fig. 3, Fig.
    4) how the throughput of Nginx are still high even with a large number of connections
    and with a very low memory usage. Nevertheless, the WoT system designer must consider
    that to fully gain an advantage from a non-blocking Web server, all the components
    in the backend must be designed to be non-blocking as well. Download : Download

    (threaded) web servers [19]. 2.4. Smart objects in service orchestrations A big
    issue in composing objects/services to form an application logic, is how to ensure
    that data coming from a data source can be properly read and processed by a recipient
    data sink. The intuitive, but not widely practicable solution, is to adopt a rigorous
    set of data schemas shared by all participants. In this way connections could
    be handled with no pains because every object that consumes data is able to receive
    and to decide what to do with the data. Unfortunately, having a common set of
    data types defined and shared for all interconnected objects is far to be realistic.
    Objects are built from different manufacturers for vertical applications, often
    inside walled gardens or with small capabilities to interoperate with external
    entities. A more realistic assumption is to consider objects able to produce data
    in a format among those commonly encapsulated into HTTP messages. So we can expect
    that a data source can push a string containing either numbers or alphanumeric
    values, or more structured data like JSON objects or XML instances. As an example,
    Paraimpu [20] implements the concept of mapping as a couple of expressions in
    the form of (cond, repl), where cond is a boolean expression while the repl expression
    is a valid instance of the data type expected by the sink (the actuator). This
    approach can be subsumed in the more general IF-THEN paradigm applied to events,
    data and actions in the IoT. The online service called IFTTT (IF This Than That),
    although initially conceived for social networks and not for physical mashups,
    is the immediate proof-of-concept of how this mechanism can work. Also other sensor
    data collectors like COSM (former Pachube) implements the concept of trigger (IF
    condition on datum THEN post datum on URL). A more versatile approach is to use
    business process definition to declare a more complex composition logic. In the
    case of SOAP-based WoT mashups, interactions can be described in two ways: executable
    processes and abstract processes. Both can be modeled by BPEL. Executable processes
    model the actual behavior of a participant as interactions, while abstract processes
    describe the observable behavior and/or process template. BPEL extends the WS-∗
    interaction model to enable business transactions. BPEL defines an interoperable
    composition model that enables the extension of automated process integration
    both within and between businesses. Pintus et al. [21] also propose a SOA framework
    where smart things are described by using the WSDL standard, while logical connections
    between smart things are modeled as web services orchestrations by using the BPEL
    language. The availability of an API to be consumed by clients, of course, opens
    also the possibility to write third-party programs or scripts in arbitrary programming
    languages and build applications as a result of the composition of data coming
    from source objects, processed and transformed into actions for other smart objects.
    3. Adding the social aspect to WoT To date, IoT has been conceived as a top-down
    technology that silently takes the control of objects in a machine-to-machine
    internetworking with large benefit for logistics, manufacturing, and business
    productivity. On the other hand, the point we stress here is that for IoT/WoT
    to acquire some socialization value, end-users should be enabled to be active
    and creative in the definition of new relationships where smart things become
    either an instrument or a toy to share or to play with collaboratively. In this
    respect, it is important to provide users with enabling platforms, based on known
    and understandable metaphors, to manage, control and personalize the composition
    between sensor data and actions in the real life. In order to enable a wide adoption
    of WoT in all sectors of the society, the WoT architecture and its protocols should
    motivate every citizens to contribute to a growing number of devices and smart
    objects in order to build new streams of information available to the community.
    We can identify at least two generic use cases. The first one is the participatory
    sensing and the second one is the “device in a circle”. Participatory sensing
    applications use data of mobile sensor nodes collected in collaboration with the
    device owner. With the right tools, community groups may participate in campaigns
    to collect data on highly-focused topics, such as traffic patterns, pollution-safe
    routes for school buses, without waiting for an institutional body or private
    agency to perform the detection. For example, the NoiseTube project [22], started
    in 2008 at the Sony Computer Science Lab in Paris and currently hosted by the
    BrusSense Team at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, proposes a participative approach
    for monitoring noise pollution by involving the general public. For users to become
    active in the bottom-up construction of a participatory sensing scenario, aspects
    like trust, reputation, control of distributed devices and tracking of information
    flows must be appropriately adjusted to control what is happening with the information
    and devices contributed. The identities of users are not harvested and should
    be kept anonymous while on the other hands the management of reputation of the
    data produced must be deployed to allow the participatory sensing to become effective
    and discard malicious or irrelevant data. In the “device in the social circle”
    use case the social-ability is a key element to share and collaboratively use
    the smart things in the Web. Device accessibility layer and findability layer
    can technically allow sharing as well, but to manage physical objects in a social
    circle, features like authentication, accounting and authorization need to be
    properly designed and implemented. Integrating smart objects and main-stream social
    networks is another key aspect. Every WoT system who aims to become popular and
    adopted by users, should integrate and communicate with social media in some way.
    In some extent, existing social media are the precursor of the future social IoT
    because they have already faced a number of issues like privacy concerns, content
    moderation, insights visualization and so forth. The integration of Social media
    and Web of Things can occur in many ways: • User login/authentication: users can
    access a system by using existing credentials without building a brand new profile.
    Thanks to the Oauth protocol, the user is redirected to her/his preferred social
    tool to perform the login. This leads to the immediate benefit to have contacts/friends
    imported in the new system. In this way, it would be possible for a generic WoT
    site to connect its users with their Facebook or Twitter counterparts. • Social
    network as monitoring tool, for instance the IoT portal [23]: it allows users
    to quickly connect sensors and actuators to the system, and then create dashboard
    visualizations as Facebook applications. These applications allow users to share
    and monitor sensed data and control actuators in the real world. • Sensors/actuators:
    a social entity, such as user’s Facebook wall and the Twitter flow associated
    to an hashtag, can be considered a sensor or an actuator (or both) just like physical
    things in the implementation of virtual-to-physical mashups. For instance, the
    “device in the circle” could be a set of parking sensors and the social circle
    could be the list containing the customers’ contacts of a restaurant keeper. As
    an example, the restaurant manager can build a geographical selection of parking
    sensors in the neighborhood saving this selection as a datasource in her work
    space called “parkingSlots”. Then she can create a link between the selected datasource
    and her customer list using for instance his Facebook profile. In so doing, her
    customers will receive the number of free slots directly on their mobile or PC
    and decide to go there by car or by other means. As dual example, the “device
    in the circle” can be a device shared and controlled by means of social media,
    like for example, a multimedia installation, even on a large scale (e.g., night-time
    lighting of a skyscraper). The social circle may be the set of users of a certain
    social network that post messages to a certain topic (for example, a topic with
    a hash tag on twitter). Analytics based on text recognition (or even mood recognition)
    on tweets may trigger different actions on the installation (for example, the
    ignition with certain colors or with certain choreography). • The social dimension
    is useful for device/thing find-ability: the navigability of users’ profiles enables
    to discover objects shared by friends, but also to find new friends and new devices/things.
    4. Evolution of social Internet of Things 4.1. Objects that handle social relationships
    In the IoT, everything real becomes virtual, which means that each person and
    thing has a locatable, addressable, and readable counterpart on the Internet.
    These virtual entities can produce and consume services and collaborate toward
    a common goal. The car driver might know about the status of her car and of the
    roads towards her destination, thanks to the autonomous communications of the
    sensors and actuators in her car with those installed in other vehicles and along
    the road. The embedded system in a swimming pool could share its state with other
    virtual entities. All these scenarios are possible with an intense interaction
    between objects and related services, enabling the most powerful and fascinating
    applications. For instance, in [24] the authors introduce the idea of objects
    able to participate in conversations that were previously only available to humans.
    Those envisioned are objects aware of dynamic community structures, thus being
    able to develop a spontaneous networking infrastructure based on the information
    to be disseminated other than information on the objects themselves. Analogously,
    the research activities reported in [25] consider that, being things involved
    into the network together with people, social networks can be built based on the
    Internet of Things and are meaningful to investigate the relations and evolution
    of objects in IoT. Again, IoT and social network technologies and concepts are
    jointly exploited towards the development of tools that can make people’s lives
    easier. This time the idea is to use social networking elements in the Internet
    of Things to allow objects to autonomously establish social relationships. The
    driving motivation is that a social-oriented approach is expected to put forward
    the discovery, selection and composition of services and information provided
    by distributed objects and networks that have access to the physical world. The
    proposed social-oriented approach is characterized by the capabilities of the
    objects to autonomously establish social relationships of different kinds [24],
    [26], [7]. Within the resulting object social network, a key objective will be
    to publish information and services, find them, and discover novel resources to
    support the implementation of complex services and applications. This can be achieved
    in a trusty and efficient way by navigating a social network of “friend” objects,
    instead of relying on typical Internet discovery tools that cannot scale to billions
    of future devices. Indeed, social networking concepts have proven to be of great
    importance for handling the relationships among humans and, in the same way, these
    are expected to have a great impact on the management of services in the IoT.
    Specifically, in [7] the Social Internet of Things (SIoTs) has been proposed.
    According to this model, a set of forms of socialization among objects are foreseen
    as shown in Fig. 5. The parental object relationship is defined among similar
    objects, built in the same period by the same manufacturer (the role of family
    is played by the production batch). Moreover, objects can establish co-location
    object relationship and co-work object relationship, like humans do when they
    share personal (e.g., cohabitation) or public (e.g., work) experiences. A further
    type of relationship is defined for objects owned by the same user (mobile phones,
    game consoles, etc.), which is named ownership object relationship. The last relationship
    is established when objects come into contact, sporadically or continuously, for
    reasons purely related to relations among their owners (e.g., devices/sensors
    belonging to friends); it is named social object relationship. These relationships
    are created and updated on the basis of the objects features (such as: object
    type, computational power, mobility capabilities, brand) and activity (frequency
    in meeting the other objects, mainly). The parental and ownership relationships
    are determined by just the static characteristics of the object (or slowly varying
    characteristics): type, brand, ownership. The others are determined by the movement
    of the object and by the other nodes it encounters. The relationships’ management
    is implemented in the cloud, in the object gateways, and in the objects themselves,
    if capable of supporting the relevant logic. Clearly, the configuration of these
    functionalities is controlled by the object owner; accordingly, the resulting
    links are asymmetrical. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Sketch of
    the five types of relationships defined in the SIoT paradigm. To manage the resulting
    network and relationships, the foreseen SIoT architecture is made of four major
    components (among others). The Relationship management introduces into the SIoT
    the intelligence that allows objects to start, update, and terminate relationships.
    The selection of which friendship to accept is based on human control settings.
    Service discovery is finalized to find which objects can provide the required
    service in the same way humans seek for friendships and information. Indeed, to
    discover the service, the object queries its social relationship network. Service
    composition enables the interaction among objects. The service discovery exploits
    the object relationships to find the desired service, which is then activated
    by this component. Both a reactive and a proactive approach to service composition
    are envisaged. This component will also include the functionality of crowd information
    processing, to process the information obtained from different objects and obtain
    the most reliable answer to a query on the basis of different visions. Trustworthiness
    management is aimed at understanding how the information provided by other members
    has to be processed. 4.2. The SIoT architecture In [6], a possible SIoT architecture
    has been proposed, which follows the simple three-layer architectural model for
    IoT. In this model, the sensing layer is devoted to data acquisition and node
    collaboration in short-range and local networks. The network layer is aimed at
    transferring data across different networks. Finally, the application layer is
    where the IoT applications are deployed together with the middleware functionalities.
    The application layer is the key part in the SIoT, making this architectural proposal
    distinctive with respect to alternative solutions. It consists of three sub-layers,
    with the base sub-layer devoted to the database for the storage and management
    of the data and relevant descriptors, which record the social member profiles
    and their relationships, as well as the activities carried out by the objects
    in the real and virtual worlds. The component sub-layer works on top of the base
    sub-layer and implements the functionalities described in the previous subsection,
    i.e., relationship management, service discovery, service composition, trustworthiness
    management. The application layer is where the application are located, relying
    on the social-oriented behavior of the objects. With the intent to highlight the
    distinctive features of the SIoT architecture, in Fig. 6 we provide a mapping
    of the major SIoT components into the reference model provided in [27] by the
    IoT-A European research project, which represents a major effort in defining a
    reference architecture for the existing and future IoT solutions. In this figure,
    we show the five functional layers with the main functionalities in gray-colored
    boxes. In the upper layer are located the applications that are built on top of
    an implementation of the IoT-A architecture. This represents instances of the
    process execution and service orchestration, which indeed is used to combine different
    services (also provided by different system implementations) to implement complex
    services. The relevant APIs are also a key part of this layer. The virtual entity
    (VE) and information is the layer that maintains and organizes information related
    to physical entities, enabling search for services exposing resources associated
    to physical entities. Accordingly, it is intended to response to queries about
    a particular physical entity by providing with addresses of the service related
    to the physical entity. The lower layer, i.e., the IoT service and resource, links
    specific services to the related resources. It also notifies application software
    and services about events related to resources and corresponding physical entities.
    The Device connectivity and communication layer provides the set of methods and
    primitives for device connectivity and communication. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. Major functionalities of the SIoT system (in blue color) in the
    IoT-A reference architecture. In Fig. 6, we have highlighted the main features
    of the SIoT solution. At the second layer, the SIoT system may require the extension
    of the object descriptions to support the creation and management of the social-oriented
    behavior and relationships, such as: owner ID; object position, which can be changing
    over the time depending on the object mobility features; power supply status,
    that defines whether the object is either battery-powered (and the battery power
    level is provided), socket-connected (and whether is currently connected or not),
    or it harvests power from the environment; amount of traffic generated in terms
    of number of connections and overall bit-rate. The objects could also be grouped
    into different classes, depending on their main characteristics, such as mobility,
    computational and communication capabilities, interfaces, sensing capabilities,
    power supply. At the third layer, the major part of the SIoT functionalities needs
    to be introduced. These also call for the definition of specific ontologies and
    semantic engines. The ontologies are used to represent a semantic view of the
    social activities, which is extracted through appropriate semantic engines. The
    objective is to provide a machine interpretable environment for representing attributes
    and operations of the IoT devices. Many works have already been conducted in this
    area, which could be partially used in the SIoT scenario, e.g., Ontology Web Language
    for Services (OWL-S) model, which has already been used as the basis of a semantic
    service modeling framework for the IoT [28], [29]. Accordingly, services are used
    as an interface that represents the IoT resources (i.e., the physical world devices)
    and provide an access to the functions and capabilities of these resources. Ontologies
    to manage and control heterogeneous systems have also been investigated in [27].
    This highlights that an automatic discovery will be impossible without ontological
    classification and semantic annotation processes. In [30], the importance of the
    ontology has been analyzed from a social network perspective as a format to represent
    the object information which is relevant to end users. Other approaches for creating
    semantic service descriptions could be used as described in [31]. These include:
    Semantic Annotations for WSDL (SAWSDL), Unified Service Description Language (USDL),
    Web Service Modelling Language (WSML), Web Service Modelling Ontology (WSMO),
    and Semantic Annotations for Representational State Transfer SA-REST [32]. The
    relationship management module is the one responsible to establish, update, and
    terminate the relationships among the objects in their virtual representation.
    It also elaborates the social network to facilitate the discovery of the services
    by identifying different clusters of resource relationships. Possible approaches
    are to make use of similarity measures and multi-scale renormalization and synergetic
    – self organization techniques. These should be embodied into the SIoT learners
    and adaptors of virtual resources following the cognitive networks paradigm. Consequently,
    an object social graph is built with objects that are linked by edges representing
    the established relationships, each one weighted by its computed degrees. This
    module is also responsible for calculating several topological features of the
    resource social graph such as: between-ness, closeness, degree/eigenvector hubs
    and authorities centrality measures. This allows for determining the most “central”
    nodes/resources, which is a key activity because the identified “central” nodes/resources
    will be those that control the data flows in SIoT and influence the rest of nodes/resources.
    By doing so, the “central” nodes will be marked as landmarks, representative for
    their local neighborhood. The service discovery functionality is key in the third
    layer, since it is needed to find which objects can provide a service requested
    in the target application. This functionality should be implemented into the SIoT
    system by following the rules the humans adopt to seek for friendships and for
    any information in the social networking services. The discovery will be guided
    by the object social graph as described above. The trust management module is
    the one responsible to address the inherent risks in transactions with no prior
    experience with regard to the reputation of every other node. In doing this, it
    exploits the resource social graph to build a reputation-based trust mechanism
    for the IoT that can effectively deal with certain types of malicious behavior
    that intend to mislead other nodes [33]. In such a scenario, two possible models
    for the implementation of the Trustworthiness management can be followed. One
    is the subjective trustworthiness, derived from a social point of view, where
    each node computes the trustworthiness of its friends on the basis of its own
    experience and on the basis of its friends’ experiences. If two nodes are not
    friends, then the trustworthiness is calculated by word of mouth through a chain
    of friendships. The other is the objective trustworthiness, obtained from P2P
    scenarios, where the information about each node is distributed and stored by
    making use of a DHT (Distributed Hash Table) structure. This information is visible
    to every node but is only managed by special nodes that we call Pre-Trusted Objects
    (PTOs). Finally, the service composition component enables the interaction between
    services provided by different objects to achieve complex services and applications.
    Most of the time, the interaction is related to an object that wishes either to
    retrieve an information about the real world or to find a specific service provided
    by another object. In fact, the main potential we see in deploying SIoT is its
    capability to foster such an information retrieval. 5. On-going projects The projects
    listed here bring together the technological aspects, related to the functionality
    offered by the so-called smart objects, with the social aspects. Projects in this
    list mainly fall into one of the three scenarios emerged from the previous sections:
    participatory sensing, device-in-the-circle, and devices-that-socialize. The tools
    to compose and build personalized and social application that merges together
    data from different sources belong to a field in continuous evolution and such
    tools are often the basis for other projects: they are mainly cloud-based because
    the cloud is always there, up and running, it is reachable from everywhere, and
    a large amount of application complexity can be moved from the target devices
    to the cloud components. Among these tools are: Ninja Blocks [34], IFTTT [35]
    and Paraimpu [36]. Ninja Blocks is a project started in 2012 from the crowdfunding
    platform Kickstarter.com. Ninja Blocks are cloud-based devices that can sense
    their environment and can act by controlling lights, power sockets, and other
    actuators. The system provides a tool to compose actions and sensing with common
    social web sites like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram. Among the sensors there is
    also a camera. IFTTT is a San Francisco based startup whose service enables customers
    to create and share within minutes very simple applications that fit the “if this
    then that” rule. An example of application can be IF “someone tags me on Facebook
    picture” then “put the picture on my Dropbox”. IFTTT was initially conceived for
    Internet services and social media and only later, in June 2012, the service crossed
    over to the physical world by integrating with Belkin WeMo [37] devices allowing
    IFTTT rules to compose social media events with home automation. Paraimpu is a
    cloud-based research prototype from CRS4, which provides the functionality to
    manage smart Things and to compose them with services already on the Web to create
    personalized applications. Common DIY (Do It Yourself) boards like Arduino, can
    be easily integrated as the system automatically generates the code for these
    boards to produce/receive data. Paraimpu allows people to share smart things and
    devices in their social circle enabling social physical-virtual Web mash-ups.
    The availability of such tools is fostering the development of personalized and
    interesting installation. At the moment these are generated by a small niche of
    geeks and early adopters but, to some extent, pave the way for a future diffusion
    and adoption of smart things in everyday social life. Among the installations,
    here are reported three “device-in-the-circle” cases: • Jardimpu [38] (based on
    Arduino and Paraimpu) is an automated irrigation system based on the sensing of
    temperature, humidity, soil moisture, light conditions, which is then used to
    control the level of water in some plant’s saucers (e.g. Dionaea Muscipula). This
    system is not an absolute novelty in the field of sensors-based garden irrigation,
    but it is one of the first examples of “social” gardening: people in the social
    circle can activate the drippers, can see plants in a live streaming, and can
    monitor their parameters. • TLight is a permanent installation created by the
    Quit group [39] and connected to the web thanks to Paraimpu, which allows everyone
    to change the color tones and the behavior of the lights placed on the top of
    the big glass tower of the T-Hotel in Cagliari. To interact with the lights, a
    twitter user can post a message on with hashtag:#thotel followed by any phrase
    containing one of the following words: red, blue, green, orange, yellow, white,
    cyan, purple, wave, different, couple, full, pulse e random. • Natural Fuse [40]
    is a social IoT game based on COSM [41]. Participants get a Natural Fuse unit
    which consists of a houseplant and a power socket. The amount of power available
    to the socket is limited by the capacity of the plant to offset the carbon footprint
    of the energy expended. If people cooperate on energy expenditure then the plants
    thrive (and everyone may use more energy). But if people do not cooperate, then
    the network starts to randomly kill plants. The electricity depends on the plants
    just as the plants depend on the electricity. The work carried on in the field
    of Social Web of Things by Ericsson also deserves a citation as “devices-that-socialize”
    use case. Researchers at Ericsson in fact are working on methods for connecting
    device into a social media platform for nodes that are not people. Recently they
    have presented at the Connected House exhibit, a social network interface that
    linked all of the different connected nodes in a home as well as trusted points
    in the public sphere. Another very popular project is Waze. Waze is a company
    based on Israel which developed a service called social-GPS. The service is aimed
    at avoid traffic, and it is based on a large community spread all over the world.
    It allows, through a smart phone equipped with GPS, to share real-time traffic
    information and help everyone to save time and fuel. Even if it does not make
    use of any exotic hardware but it totally relies on the smartphone functionalities,
    it is a perfect example of tool for participatory sensing. At the same time, it
    is also a case of “device-in-the-circle” because the connection with Facebook
    allows participants to see their friends on the map to coordinate arrival times
    to give or get rides or meet up with other participants. In the field of Smart
    Cities, the project CityScripts [42] is an experiment built on top of the SmartSantander
    [43] platform (with a base of 12,000 urban sensors deployed in the city of Santander).
    The CityScripts project is aimed at integrating and experimenting a Web of Things
    scenario in which sensors and actuators in the city have a digital counterpart
    and can be used by citizens to compose personal applications integrating sensor
    data with social networks and other online data sources. 6. Conclusions In this
    paper, we have reviewed the main approaches followed during the last years to
    make objects part of the human social loop and grant them a role within the human
    social network sites. This objective has been achieved by extending the paradigm
    of Web of Things to give things the capabilities to automatically post information
    on the social network sites and to be reached through these as well. A complementary
    approach is the one according to which objects have their own social network,
    which is independent from those of the humans but still controlled by them (albeit
    progressively less, as technologies progresses). The two approaches can be combined
    so that part of the information and actions of relevance for one social network
    type, that is the one where humans rule, can be exported/imported to/into the
    other one, where objects rule. Certainly, the objective of these approaches is
    to address the complexity in the management of the trillions of objects that will
    be connected to the network in a couple of years and to exploit their major potentialities.
    Through the presented survey of ongoing projects, we learned that the implementations
    deployed so far are limited in their potentialities. These only focus on specific
    applications and do not converge on an interoperable platform where social networking
    concepts are adopted as the major principles that drive the object interactions.

    currently experiencing a significant deterioration because of its dependence on
    oil revenues, which drops in prices recently. Therefore, it is necessary to revive
    the Algerian economy with other important sectors, mainly agricultural sector
    especially in the south of Algeria. The southern Algeria Contain all necessary
    conditions for agriculture, which are the large agricultural areas, water resources
    and good illumination (sunlight).The mismanagement of irrigation water affects
    negatively the agricultural production of Algeria because of the shortage of irrigation
    water. Thus, with the benefit of the Internet of Things and the smart technologies,
    we will propose in this paper a new strategy for smart irrigation in southern
    Algeria regions, to optimize the water consumption, and to provide a remote control
    and monitoring for the irrigation system. Tests were realized to prove the validity
    of our proposed system by using Contiki-Cooja simulator. Published in: 2015 Fourth

    IEEE Conference Location: Luton, UK SECTION I. Introduction Recently, the Algerian
    economy starts to decline due to the drop in oil prices. The decline in oil prices
    shows the dependence and vulnerability of a system built on the only resource
    of the hydrocarbon sector. In this case, it is urgent to develop other sectors
    of the economy to reduce the dependence on hydrocarbons. Agriculture is a strategic
    and important sector for economic development, especially in southern Algeria.
    This Saharan and semi-arid region has all conditions required for agriculture;
    there are wide agricultural surfaces, sun light and large water resources. Agricultural
    production, including livestock production, consumes more fresh water than any
    other activity in the world. Agricultural irrigation accounts for 85% of the consumed
    fresh water over the planet, and this percentage will continue to be dominant
    in water consumption due to population growth and the increasing of demand for
    food [1]. In general, poor irrigation management affects agricultural production,
    for this purpose it is necessary to develop strategies to optimize irrigation.
    An automated irrigation system is designed to monitor and control the various
    factors derived from an agricultural field such as humidity, water level, temperature,
    and human interaction. This system is generally composed of controllers and a
    wireless sensor network using ZigBee as the transmission technology for detecting
    values of an agricultural field. The sensors gather the various agricultural factors
    in real time and transmit them using Internet of Thing (IoT) applications [2].
    The control architecture of smart agriculture based on cloud computing and IOT
    is presented in [3]. The integration of modern technology in irrigation management
    system is one of the ways to improve the irrigation processes to optimize the
    use of water, electricity consumption and labor costs. In this regard, with the
    new technology and the development of the Internet and the Internet of Things,
    we will propose in this paper a strategy for smart irrigation in southern Algeria
    regions based on the use of the Internet of Things and new communication technologies.
    In this paper, this new scheme proposed for intelligent irrigation using IoT is
    an extension of our already attendant solution [4]. This new mechanism allows
    the farmer to monitor and manage agricultural area using smart phones via Internet.
    The rest of paper is organized as follow: in section 2 we will present generality
    about basic notions of Internet of Things, the section 3 presents current state
    of information and communication technology (ICT) in Algeria, our proposed approach
    will be presented in section 4 and finally, a conclusion and proposed perspectives
    of this work will be presented in section 5. SECTION II. Generality A. Internet
    of Things (IoT) The term “Internet of Things” was first used by the Massachusetts
    Institute of Technology in the year 1999[5]. There are several definitions of
    the Internet of Things. Definitions focus on technical aspects of IoT when the
    other based on the applications and functionalities. Some definition defined IoT
    as “an extension of the current Internet to all objects that can communicate directly
    or indirectly with electronic equipment and connected to the Internet”[6]. Other
    defied as “a novel paradigm that is rapidly gaining ground in the scenario of
    modern wireless telecommunications. The basic idea of this concept is the pervasive
    presence around us of a variety of things or objects - such as Radio-Frequency
    IDentification (RFID) tags, sensors, actuators, mobile phones, etc. - which, through
    unique addressing schemes, are able to interact with each other and cooperate
    with their neighbors to reach common goals”[7]. B. The Application Domains of
    IoT According to the definition of IoT, this technology can be applied in all
    domains possible but in reality IoT applied in specific domains. We categorize
    this application into four application domains: 1) Daily Life A Smartphone become
    a necessity in our life, several application for Apple iOS, Google Android and
    Windows Phone operating can be used for interfacing sensors measuring various
    parameters, which implies that facilitate the use of the concept of IoT in our
    daily life [8]. The use of IOT in daily live appear in several application such
    as control of home equipment such as air conditioners, refrigerators, washing
    machines, etc [8]. Sensors and actuators distributed in houses and offices can
    make our life more comfortable in several aspects, and domestic incidents can
    be avoided with appropriate monitoring and alarm systems, etc. [7]. Other application
    necessary of IoT like for losses, IoT can be helped to find objects that we don''t
    remember where have been left. Or in thefts an application similar to the previous
    one may leave the user to know if some objects are moved from a restricted area
    which would indicate that the object is being stolen [7]. 2) Transportation and
    Mobility Transport domain is one of most important domains, and one of the most
    complicated domains. Urban traffic is the main contributor to traffic noise pollution
    and a major contributor to urban air quality degradation and greenhouse gas emissions.
    Traffic congestion directly imposes significant costs on economic and social activities
    in most cities [8]. Advanced cars, trains, buses as well as bicycles along with
    roads and/or rails are becoming more instrumented with sensors, actuators, and
    processing power. Roads themselves are also equipped with tags and sensors that
    send important information to traffic control sites to better route the traffic,
    provide the tourist with appropriate transportation information. In this domain
    exist several applications such us assisted driving offer collision avoidance
    systems and monitoring of transportation of hazardous materials, or mobile ticketing
    and augmented maps [7]. 3) Work Environment In this domain they are several uses
    of IoT such us Industrial plants, enterprise, logistics, etc. Sensors have always
    been a part of the factory setup for security, automation, climate control, etc.
    Which ultimately will be replaced by a wireless system giving the opportunity
    to make changes to the configuration whenever necessary? It is nothing but a subnet
    IoT dedicated to the maintenance of the plant [8]. In industrial plants, IoT also
    contribute to improving the automation of industrial plants with a massive deployment
    of RFID tags associated with production parts. An event is generated by the reader
    with all the necessary data, such as RFID number, and stored on the network. The
    machine / robot is notified by the event and picks up part of the production [7].
    Logistics is a work domain but also attached to the transport domain including
    the management of transport offers good logistics management. With the application
    of IoT can improve these domains to offers the best customer services. 4) Others
    Utilities Other domains are necessary need the IoT as a Healthcare domain, military
    and smart environment, etc. In the military domain smart objects can protect the
    lives of people. In another side many benefits of IoT technologies in healthcare
    and resulting applications can be grouped essentially of: tracking objects and
    people, the identification and authentication of people, automatic data collection
    and sensing of sickness [7]. One of the major IoT application areas that are already
    drawing attention is Smart Environment IoT. There are several test beds being
    implemented and many more planned in the coming years. Other use of the IoT is
    Smart museum and gym and Monitoring environmental parameters. Smart museum and
    gym as to smart leisure environments, the museum and the gym are two representative
    examples where the IoT technologies can help in exploiting their facilities at
    the best. Monitoring environmental parameters perishable goods such as fruits,
    fresh-cut produce, meat, and dairy products are vital parts of our nutrition.
    From the production to the consumption sites thousands of kilometers or even more
    are covered and during the transportation the conservation status need to be monitored
    to avoid uncertainty in quality levels for distribution decisions. Pervasive computing
    and sensor technologies offer great potential for improving the efficiency of
    the food supply chain [3]. C. The Protocols Layer of the IoT Protocols layer of
    the IoT consists of 4 main layers: a) Physical and Data Link Layers The most common
    physical layer protocols used (10,100, 1G) WiFi (802.11b, g, n), GSM, 3G, LTE,
    4G, IEEE 802.15.4, PLC, etc. b) Network Layer The protocols of this layer are
    IPv6, RPL. • Routing Protocol for Low and Lossy Networks (RPL) The Internet Engineering
    Task Force (IETF) formed a new Working Group called ROLL (Routing Over Low-power
    and Lossy networks) in 2008[6] which was defined a new protocol RPL to solve de
    problem of Low power and Lossy Networks (LLN). Algorithmic and protocolary foundations
    of RPL described in RFC 6550[10]. RPL was developed from four sets of requirements
    that represent the four main foreseen uses of WSN: Home Automation, Building Automation,
    Industrial and Urban environments [15]. RPL is a Distance Vector IPv6 routing
    protocol for LLNs that specifies how to build a Destination Oriented Directed
    Acyclic Graph (DoDAG) using an objective function and a set of metrics/constraints
    [9]. The objective functions to adapt the generic behavior to a particular environment
    and specify more precisely the rules of construction of DoDAG [11]. RPL is based
    on the topological concept of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). The DAG defines
    a tree-like structure that specifies the default routes between nodes in the LLN.
    However, a DAG structure is more than a typical tree in the sense that a node
    might associate to multiple parent nodes in the DAG, in contrast to classical
    trees where only one parent is allowed. More specifically, RPL organizes nodes
    as Destination-Oriented DAGs (DODAGs), where most popular destination nodes (i.e.
    sinks) or those providing a default route to the Internet (i.e. gateways) act
    as the roots of the DAGs. A network may consist of one or several DODAGs, which
    form together an RPL instance identified by a unique ID, called RPLInstanceID.
    RPL defines three types of nodes: Low Power and Lossy Border Routers (LBRs): it
    refers to the root of a DODAG that represents a collection point in the network
    and has the ability to construct a DAG. The LBR also acts as a gateway (or edge
    router) between the Internet and the LLN. Router: it refers to a device that can
    forward and generate traffic. Such a router does not have the ability to create
    a new DAG, but associate to an existing one. Host: it refers to an end-device
    that is capable of generating data traffic, but is not able to forward traffic
    [14]. c) Transport Layer There are two protocols: TCP, UDP. d) Application Layer
    There are several protocols in this layer but the most important protocols are:
    HTTP (TCP), CoAP (UDP). Appear of IoT and the limits of IP architecture obliged
    to define new protocols and an adaptive layer. • Constrained Application Protocol
    CoAP The IETF Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is an application-layer
    protocol designed to provide a REST-like interface [16]. The CoAP protocol can
    remove HTTP limitations constrained environment while ensuring high compatibility
    with existing. It is relatively easy to turn HTTP requests in CoAP queries. A
    old device connected to an IPv4 network may well request access to a resource
    on a connected server to an IPv6 network and gateway translates between the two
    worlds [11]. Thus the side of a sensor network, we can use the protocol stack
    CoAP / UDP / 6LoWPAN for IPv6 auto configuration properties and the small size
    of the battery, and it will keep the Internet side HTTP stack / TCP / IPv4 which
    is present on all devices. If, for example, an iPhone wants to know the temperature
    measured by a sensor, it will send its HTTP request, it will be transformed into
    CoAP by a bridge, and the answer may be stored for a period specified by the sensor
    in the gateway. If another device on the Internet requires the same value during
    this time interval, it will not be necessary to propagate the query to the sensor
    [11]. • CoAP vs HTTP CoAP is network-oriented protocol, using similar features
    to HTTP but also allows for low overhead, multicast, etc. As HTTP protocol is
    a long-term successful standard, it can use small script to integrate various
    resources and services. Interoperation provided by HTTP is the key point of IoT,
    for this, http is employed in application level. However, HTTP is based on TCP
    protocol using point to point (p2p) communication model that not suitable for
    notification push services. Also, for constrained devices, HTTP is too complex.
    Unlike HTTP based protocols, CoAP operates over UDP instead of using complex congestion
    control as in TCP [12]. CoAP is based on REST architecture, which is a general
    design for accessing Internet resources. In order to overcome disadvantage in
    constrained resource, CoAP need to optimize the length of datagram and provide
    reliable communication. On one side, CoAP provides URI, REST method such as GET,
    POST, PUT, and DELETE. On the other side, based on lightweight UDP protocol, CoAP
    allows IP multicast, which satisfies group communication for IoT. To compensate
    for the unreliability of UDP protocol, CoAP defines a retransmission mechanism
    and provides resource discovery mechanism with resource description [13]. e) A
    Version of IPv6 Adapted to Constrained Networks 6LoWPAN In 2005, the IETF chartered
    the IPv6 over Low Power, Wireless Networks (6LoWPAN) working group to standardize
    adaptations oflPv6 over mesh networks composed of low-power, wireless links [9].
    The difference in size of the package IPv6 and datagram of IEEE 802.15.4 obliged
    6LoWPAN group to define encapsulation and header compression mechanisms that allow
    IPv6 packets to be sent to and received from over IEEE 802.15.4 based networks.
    SECTION III. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in Algeria Algeria
    wants to position itself as one of the strongholds of the wireless Internet in
    the Maghreb. The development of Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity), WiMax (Worldwide Interoperability
    for Microwave Access) is a wireless data transmission standard, with a theoretical
    speed of 70 megabits per second, the equivalent of hundreds of ADSL (Asymmetric
    Digital Subscriber Line) connections with range of 50 kilometers. This wireless
    radio technology that aims to connect any wireless equipment: access points Wi-Fi,
    IP phone, mobile phone. The commercialization of wireless telephony in fixed mode
    (4G LTE) has just started through all the capitals of the 48 provinces of the
    country with a gradual roll in each province. This new generation of wireless
    technology used in the majority of developed countries to provid users a remote
    and speed access to the Internet that not depend on fixed phone lines as ADSL
    and with a higher performance, as the incumbent Algeria Telecom has launched this
    technology. Choosing the 4G LTE was motivated to its flexibility, easy to deploy
    and competitiveness. SECTION IV. Our Approach A. The System Design The communications
    technologies in the Internet of Things is developing rapidly in recent years so
    it can meet the demands of the connections between the physical world “things”
    and “human”. Thus, the use of smartphones helps to handle remote objects via Internet.
    Our approach proposed in this paper is mainly based on our system for irrigation
    shown in [4]. The difference is that here we have used the technologies of the
    Internet of things for smart irrigation management in southern Algeria via the
    Internet, and using smart phones. As shown in figure 1, this system consists of:
    wireless sensor network system, the 6LoWPAN smart gateway that connects the Zigbee
    network with the internet via mobile communication network (4G LTE). The sensors
    placed in the agricultural field, measure continuously the soil moisture values,
    the water tank level and the water well level, then send these values through
    a ZigBee mesh network to a smart gateway (Generic IoT Border Router Wireless Br
    1000), those information are then sent via a mobile data communication 4G LTE
    network to a web service that uses intelligent software application to automatically
    analyze the data and act according to the obtained results, by selective activation
    of controllers as needed. The routing protocol used in this proposed design is
    the RPL protocol. The outputs results and irrigation recommendations are presented
    to the user on a smart phone web application using CoAP or HTTPs interfaces. Our
    system focuses on the following performance objectives to ensure its widespread
    adoption by farmers: The system is easy to deploy, to use, and facilitates planning
    of irrigation tasks. The system is modular and flexible, making it easy to maintain
    The system design is robust and reliable. Fig. 1. The system design. Show All
    The Smart gateway connects the two parts of our system (the first part: the wireless
    sensor networks and controllers, the second parts: is the internet and smartphones),
    it is the 6LoWPAN Border Router translates between the two standardized protocol
    stacks. In addition it is an application level gateway for other IoT protocols
    such as Bluetooth Low Energy, Thread, and ZigBee. WLAN or LTE may be used for
    the uplink to the Internet [17]. B. Communication in Our System The network of
    our system consists of several tiny devices (sensors, microcontrollers, smart
    gateway) that communicate with themselves via a Low and Lossy networks (LLNs),
    using the routing protocol dedicated to this type of network called RPL (Routing
    protocol for Low and Lossy networks). This LLN network is connected to the internet
    by a smart 6lowpan gateway that represents the root of the RPL, as it shown in
    figure 2. The construction of DODAG involves two phases. Phase 1. Creating the
    up paths (from the root to the nodes): The smart gateway sends a DIO message (DAG
    Information Object) to its neighbors which are (coordinators nodes, sensors detection
    of the water level and the controller of the electric pump) for the construction
    of DODAG. Each one of these neighbors in turn send a DIO message to its neighbors
    in each irrigation area for the creation of the DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graph).
    Phase 2. Creating the down paths (from the nodes to the root): Each node in the
    network when receiving the DIO Message send a DAO message (Destination Advertisement
    Object) to its root for creating paths to the root and filling tables routing.
    The soil moisture sensors measure soil moisture, these values must be sent to
    the root nodes of sub-DAGs (coordinators nodes). Each soil moisture sensor sends
    the measured values to his favorite parent until the reception of these values
    by the coordinator node, this latter calculates the average of the received values
    and send them to the smart gateway. Fig. 2. The system communication. Show All
    The sensors detection of the water level measure the water level in the well and
    in the tank, also send these measured values to the smart gateway. The smart gateway
    sends the received values (soil moisture values and water level values) via a
    mobile communication network (4G LTE) to the farmer. The farmer can check the
    soil moisture values, and also water level in the tank and in the well with smart
    phone application that connect directly to the smart gateway using http or CoAP
    protocols. Therefore, the farmer may decide either the irrigation of dry areas
    or filling the tank by sending a response to the gateway, which represent an intermediate
    that send this response to the coordinator node in order to control the opening
    and closing of the solenoid valves or to electric pump controller in order to
    activate or deactivate the electric pump in the well according to the specific
    needs. In the case where the values of soil moisture or the values of the water
    level in the tank are critical which means that areas are dry or the water level
    in the tank is minimum, our system will automatically pass to standalone mode
    (our proposed system in [4]), which makes our system tolerant to faults. SECTION
    V. Simulation and Discussion of Result In order to validate the Performance of
    our approach by simulation, we use Cooja simulator provided by Contiki, which
    unlike most simulators also allows real hardware platforms to be emulated [18].
    This simulation is about how the network converged and stabilized using the RPL
    protocol and OFO implementation of ContikiRPL. The simulation scripts consists
    of RPL sender nodes and LLN Border Router (LBR) programs which are emulated as
    Tmote sky nodes and derived from Cooja and uIPv6 module including UDP, ICMPv6,
    IPv6, SICSLoWPAN and Rime of the Contiki kernel [19] [20]. With the help of the
    CollectView tool [21] provided by Cooja, the following metrics could be observed:
    The time taken to find the first source-destination pair in the whole network;
    The time taken for the network to fully converge when all nodes join the network
    tree; The time taken for the network to fully stabilize after convergence, the
    time taken for the Estimated Transmission Count (ETX) value for each node. As
    shown in figure 3, our network consists of 15 RPL nodes; deployed in an irrigation
    land which composed of 3 areas, where each area consist of 4 RPL sender nodes,
    and the RPL sender nodes in the tank and in the well, all these nodes are connected
    to The RPL border router, and this router is used in order to interface a regular
    IP network with an RPL 6LoWPAN network. Fig. 3. The network simulation in cooja.
    Show All Figures 4 and 5, presents the network tree and the communication between
    DAGs roots (node 2.2, node 3.3, node 4.4, node 5.5, node 6.6) and DODAG root (RPL
    border router node 1.1). Fig. 4. Communication between nodes. Show All Fig. 5.
    The network tree. Show All All data collected by the wireless sensor network are
    used by the system to handle an intelligent, automated irrigation of vegetation
    (by saving water and energy use) and can be accessed in real time via a web application
    in smartphones, which can also send alerts and commands when the ground is too
    dry or a lack of water in the basin and offer suggestions to maximize plant health.
    These first results obtained by simulation using the Cooja simulator are satisfactory,
    especially in routing information by RPL and COAP protocols. This will encourage
    us to go further towards creating a web application in smartphones to complete
    all the proposed system and facilitate the tasks of the farmers for a good monitoring
    of their agriculture. Also, we hope that this approach will be very beneficial
    if we can experiment it in the fields of agriculture especially in Saharan and
    arid areas such as the south of Algeria. SECTION VI. Conclusion The intelligent
    technologies play a very important role for an effective management of irrigation,
    we have proposed in this article a smart irrigation system for a Saharan area
    like the south of Algeria. This proposed system is based on ICT and IoT technologies.
    Using these technologies, the control of irrigation will be ensured at low cost
    and high accuracy. Our proposed system facilitates the irrigation tasks and optimizes
    the costs in term of minimizing the water consummation and reducing the cost of
    the working force. The validation of the proposed approach by simulation showed
    us the value and the importance of the adoption of WSN and IoT technologies in
    precision farming. As a perspective we plan to complete the implementation of
    our system using the CoAP protocol and web application for monitoring the irrigation
    via the internet using IoT, and also to apply this system in real world. Authors

    has paved the way for the optimization of traditional industrial practices. Agriculture
    sector continues to serve as the backbone of the global economy. Moreover, it
    is required to cater the ever increasing demand for the food products arising
    due to rapid growth of global population. This urges for the modernization of
    traditional agricultural methodologies. Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential
    to become the key enabler for realizing the vision of Smart Agriculture. This
    paper proposes a user-centric IoT architecture for addressing the various issues
    faced in the agricultural domain. The proposed system allows the farmers to monitor
    their agricultural fields in real time and receive recommendations for producing
    good quality crops. The proposed architecture also optimizes the food supply chain
    in a manner that allows the farmers to maximize their overall profit on the sold
    goods. The applicability of the proposed architecture is evaluated using multiple
    uses cases encompassing the different aspects of the agriculture process. The
    paper also proposes a novel framework for smartphones that would facilitate the
    software engineers to develop applications required for implementing various functionality

    1. Introduction Agriculture is one of the most important sector round the globe.
    In developing nations like India, agriculture contributes to about 15% of the
    GDP and is a vital source of the Indian Economy [1]. Few other countries that
    depends highly on agriculture for their GDP are Sierra Leone (60%), Chad (49.1%),
    Central African Republic (39.6%), etc. [52]. The World Bank data clearly depicts
    that more than one-fourth of the total employment at the global level relies on
    the agriculture sector [53]. The significance of the agriculture sector in terms
    of employment is more in the developing countries like India where approximately
    two-third of the population rely on agriculture for their income source. It is
    responsible for creating more than 50% of employment either directly or indirectly
    [1]. As per the prediction of the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United
    Nation (FAO), the population of the world is expected to reach 8 billion by 2025
    and 9.6 billion by 2050 [2]. This is a clear indicator of the increase in the
    requirement of food production by 2050 at the global level. It is also required
    that the food products should be of high quality. This urges for the industrialization
    of the agricultural sector and employment of advanced technology for modernizing
    the agricultural process. The agricultural process comprises of multiple sub processes
    ranging from the production of crops to the delivery of the end products to the
    consumers. Several works in the existing literature have addressed the issues
    prevalent in the current agricultural practices. For instance, one of the key
    requirements for producing healthy crops is that of apt and timely supply of nutritional
    and water content in the agricultural fields [109]. This has been made possible
    through the real-time monitoring ability of the solutions equipped with sensors
    and actuators. The sensors are deployed in the agricultural fields where they
    continuously sense the environmental and soil conditions and transmit this information
    to the intelligent softwares residing either on the cloud or at the local level.
    These softwares are responsible for taking suitable decisions and controlling
    actuators like sprinklers, etc. so that the field conditions can be maintained
    in an automated fashion. Table 1 highlights the technology adoption scenario in
    the agriculture sector by some of the countries. Table 1. Technology Adoption
    Scenario in Agriculture. Region Technology Adoption Scenario Reference Argentina
    • Increasing employment of yield monitors, global positioning system (GPS) and
    satellite data. • Ranks second country with respect to the usage of yield monitors
    and fifth in terms of yield monitor density. [54,55] Australia • Employs GPS guidance
    for spraying or sowing of broad acre crops. • Increasing use of yield monitors.
    • Wide scale application of automatic guidance technology by the grain growing
    farmers • Approximately 20% increase in the technology adoption rate post 2008.
    [54,[56], [57], [58]] Brazil • Large scale adoption of Precision Agriculture by
    domestic (58%) and foreign (38%) sugar and ethanol firms. • Preferred technologies
    are GPS guidance with auto and manual control, satellite imaging, yield maps,
    variable rate fertilizing and liming, and georeferenced soil sampling. [[59],
    [60], [61]] Canada • 98% of surveyed farmers used GPS guidance, 84% at least one
    PA technology, 84% had combine with yield monitoring capability, 73% used auto
    section control, 75% intend to use more PA in the future [62] China • Tractor
    auto guidance was the most accepted technology and about 25% of the farmland was
    managed using PA [63] Europe • Fertilizing and spraying machines are equipped
    with PA technologies and smart or ISO-Bus enabled equipment. • Ratio of farms
    using GPS increased from 14% to 22%, soil mapping from 14% to 20%, variable rate
    application from 13% to 16% and yield mapping from 7% to 11% in 2009 compared
    to 2012. • Between 6.6% and 11.0% of surveyed farmers used PA mainly for data
    collection techniques such as GPS-based area measurement and soil sampling • Nitrogen
    sensors are used in about 20% of wheat fields primarily for nitrogen fertilizer
    application • Around 60% of UK farmers already use some sort of precision agriculture
    on their farms, although for the most part this simply means using GPS tractor
    steering [[64], [65], [66], [67], [68], [69]] Japan • In rice farming, ground
    vehicles spray about 22% (in 2014) and the proportion of large-scale UAV plant
    protection has reached 36%. [70] South Africa • The number of yield monitors increased
    to more than 600, variable rate lime applications to 244, manual guidance systems
    to 200, and auto guidance to 60. [54,71] Turkey • About 310 combine harvesters
    are equipped with yield monitors. About 110 automatic steering systems and 25
    steering assistance systems were sold to the farmers. Number of variable rate
    applicators is less than 20. • GNSS-based auto guidance systems in Adana province.
    [[72], [73], [74], [75]] United States • Three most popular technologies were
    GPS guidance with auto control / auto steer (83%), GPS-enabled sprayer section
    control (74%) and GPS guidance with manual control (63%); 82% of the dealers offered
    PA services. • About 25% of peanut farms adopted GPS soil mapping and over 40%
    used auto steering; variable rate fertilizing had a higher adoption rate in peanut
    production at over 20% of farms than for many other crops. • In the 2005 survey,
    23% of cotton producers used GPS guidance as in 2013 survey, about 31% adopted
    auto section control and 59% auto guidance systems. • Until 2000s, adoption of
    different PA technologies varied up to 22% across major field crops. Tractor guidance
    grew faster than variable-rate application for all major field crops over the
    last 10 years. [[76], [77], [78]] Another key process in the agricultural domain
    is the selling off the grown products in the market. This is widely known as the
    food supply chain and involves a number of entities that act as intermediaries
    between the farmer and the final consumer. These intermediaries are responsible
    for about 75% of the total net margin accruing to the entire supply chain [1].
    Fig. 1 depicts a general food supply chain scenario. The complete process can
    be subdivided into a number of transactions. Farmers receive seeds and fertilizers
    from the suppliers required for the production of crops. The agro products produced
    by the farmers need to be sold in the market. The farmers have the choice of selling
    the food products either directly in the market designated as distribution centres
    or they can dispose of their produce to a local trader. The local traders act
    as the aggregators of the fresh food products acquired from different farmers.
    They arrange for all the necessary transportation vehicles and sell the aggregated
    food products at the distribution centres. The retailers procure these food products
    from the distribution centres and sell them to the end consumers. A study performed
    by Sidhu et al. in [35] deduced that farmers sell more than 90% of the grown crops
    to the local traders or the distribution centres while a small portion is sold
    to the retailers and consumers directly. Download : Download high-res image (291KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Food Supply Chain Scenario. The food
    supply chain has a number of shortcomings from the farmers’ point of view. As
    most of the farmers do not have sufficient resources for the storage and transportation
    of the produced crops, they tend to sell them to the local traders at a very low
    margin. Moreover, the farmers usually do not sell their crops directly in the
    market at the distribution centres. This can also be attributed to the fact that
    the rates at the distribution centres are not standardized and these farmers can
    be cheated and may be forced to sell their products at low cost. However, if the
    products are sold as per the favorable marketing condition, the farmers are expected
    to get a high return for their products. The work done in this paper is an attempt
    to minimize the various difficulties faced by the farmers in the agricultural
    sectors. This work proposes a user-centric Internet of Things (IoT) based architecture
    for facilitating the farmers to make use of the advanced technology for improving
    their crop production and increasing their profits in selling the products. IoT
    refers to a network of interconnected heterogeneous smart devices for delivering
    value added services to the society. The term “Internet of Things” was initially
    coined by Kevin Ashton in 1999 in the context of supply chain management. IoT
    ecosystem encompasses a wide variety of uniquely identifiable devices communicating
    using standard protocols and delivering value added services to the users [3].
    The contemporary applications of these IoT networks include a variety of domains,
    ranging from personalized applications like smart home, smart meeting room, etc.
    at one end to services such as smart healthcare, intelligent transportation, precision
    agriculture, etc., at the other end [4,5]. This rapid growth and adoption of the
    IoT technology is clearly visible in the Gartner estimates, which states that
    there will be nearly 26 billion devices on the IoT by 2020 [6]. IoT has been proved
    to be a vital component for implementing dynamic workflow adaptions [7,8]. The
    dynamic nature of the agricultural sector makes IoT the most suitable enabling
    technology for addressing various challenges prevalent in the current agricultural
    practices [[110], [111], [112],114,116]. The use of sensors in conjunction with
    the intelligent algorithms can provide smart recommendations to the farmers regarding
    the maintenance of the field quality in order to have high quality crops [9,108,113].
    Moreover, apart from the data generated by the IoT devices, user generated data
    can be a key player in transforming the traditional food supply chain to be more
    farmer friendly [115,117]. This can be realized from the fact, that if market
    rates along with the demand are made available to the farmer in real-time, he
    can make apt decision regarding the selling of the food products. This will save
    the time and effort of the farmer which would otherwise be invested in visiting
    different markets in person. This will also benefit the farmers in terms of profit
    by recommending the most favorable market for his products. The work proposed
    in this paper provides a base architecture for facilitating the incorporation
    of social dimension to the IoT based solutions for agriculture. The proposed work
    further proposes a conceptual framework for smart devices that can be used for
    leveraging the social aspects of the humans. The focal point of most of the existing
    works in the literature is limited to only certain aspects of the agricultural
    process. They either focus upon the real-time monitoring of the fields and crops
    along with the provision of providing quality control methods or they attempt
    to optimize the food supply chain component of the agricultural process. The work
    proposed in this paper, however, considers the agricultural process as a conglomerate
    of field and crop monitoring, food supply chain, transportations and logistics
    as well as optimized service recommendations. This research also in line with
    the previous works that suggest for a comprehensive conceptualization of spanning
    sustainability, perceived value and knowledge creation [79] in contrast to conceptualization
    of the perceived value as an indicator of only overall products benefits and value
    for money [80,81]. The proposed work also provides a conceptual framework for
    smart devices that can be utilized by the application developers for building
    socially aware IoT based solutions. Multiple use-case descriptions have been provided
    for demonstrating the applicability and efficiency of the proposed work. The employment
    of intelligent methodologies for optimized service recommendations in the proposed
    architecture shall, further, guide to researchers to develop more smart algorithms
    relevant to the agricultural domain. The rest of the paper is organized as follows:
    Section 2 provides the highlights of the related works present in the existing
    literature; Section 3 discusses the proposed work in detail outlining the analogy
    between the proposed architecture and the IoT ecosystem and providing a detailed
    description of the proposed system; Section 4 presents few uses cases encompassing
    the different aspects of the agricultural process; and finally, Section 5; concludes
    the paper and provides research directions to further improve the work proposed
    in this paper. 2. Related works The employment of technologies in the agriculture
    practices has been attributed to the Green Revolution in Mexico in the 1940s that
    catalyzed the increased use of high-yielding crop cultivars and inputs such as
    fertilizer and irrigation for meeting the rising demands of food [82]. There exists
    multitude of works in the literature that attempt to identify the potential factors
    of affecting the technology adoption in agriculture [[83], [84], [85], [86], [87],
    [88], [89]]. The identified factors can be summarized as: farm size, land tenure
    arrangements, access to credit and extension services, land and labour availability,
    human capital (education, gender, demographics), and farmer attitude towards risks
    and uncertainty. Results of few empirical studies [90,91] underscore the potential
    of improved agricultural technologies in enhancing productivity, income, and overall
    economic growth. The advancement in the sensing technology coupled with the reduction
    in the size of the devices as well as their cost can be considered as the most
    significant enablers of precision and micro-precision agriculture [10]. Several
    researchers have proposed different types of IoT based solutions to address the
    issues in the existing agricultural practice [11]. The ability to sense and analyze
    the production environment is critical for making precise decisions in order to
    optimize the agricultural practices so as to enhance the cultivars’ quality [12,108].
    The application of WSN techniques in the farming domain is proposed in [92]. The
    authors present a comprehensive study regarding the applicability of WSN in agriculture
    along with the various associated challenges. The authors in [13] proposed a fault
    tolerant and energy efficient WSN architecture for real time monitoring of the
    agricultural field conditions and for enhancing the crop quality and yield. The
    authors in [93] propose the employment of Photosynthetically Active Radiation
    (PAR) sensors fo non-destructive in-situ Leaf Area Index (LAI) assessment. Multiple
    researchers have proposed intelligent systems for greenhouse environment monitoring
    to reduce farming cost and energy consumptions [[14], [15], [16]]. Their proposed
    architectures encompassed wireless based remote intelligence for greenhouse control
    as an alternative to the traditional wired infrastructure. The authors in [15,17]
    proposed WSN based automated irrigation systems. The crux of their works is to
    determine the apt frequency and time of watering the fields depending upon the
    soil moisture conditions. This ensures efficient use of water and high quality
    crops. In order to address the energy consumption issue in the deployed systems,
    the low power Zigbee protocol is employed for communication. The applicability
    of the IoT concepts for controlled environment agriculture has also been explored
    in several works such as [[18], [19], [20], [21], [22]]. The authors in [94] proposed
    a framework for remotely monitoring the crops using wireless and internet communication.
    The main aim of their work is to emphasize upon the advantages of cultivating
    plants in a greenhouse instead of open fields. Several IoT based commercial platforms
    have been developed with the vision of modernizing and enhancing the effectiveness
    of farming process. These platforms have been summarized in Table 2. Table 2.

    activities and crops health status The IoT based solutions rely upon the data
    obtained from the end nodes (sensors/actuators) which needs to be analyzed in
    real-time. Storing such data locally and then transmitting it to the remote servers
    for analysis involves appreciable amount of time and the analysis and actuations
    may be delayed. To overcome such issues the authors in [[23], [24], [25]] proposed
    the use of cloud based infrastructure for real-time analysis of the collected
    data in a reliable, faster and efficient manner. The use of cloud infrastructure
    also reduces the storage cost at the local level. The benefits of using cloud
    computing techniques in conjunction with IoT for agriculture process is presented
    in [95]. The authors in [96,97] highlights the significance of precision farming
    systems. The study of authors in [97] attempts to identify the adoption aspects
    of precision farming constrained to various factors and farmers demographics.
    The obtained results clearly indicate the potential of the identified factors
    in increasing the rate of precision agriculture adoption by the farmers. A system
    for online precise irrigation scheduling (OpIRIS) for greenhouses is proposed
    in [26]. The proposed system includes a web-based application that communicates
    with the sensors installed in the greenhouses. The web application embeds intelligence
    for predicting the water requirements of the crops and providing information to
    the farmers regarding the irrigation and further nutritional requirements. The
    author in [27] used RFID devices in conjunction with the IoT and cloud infrastructure
    for load balancing and distributing the resources dynamically. The obtained results
    demonstrates significant improvement in the efficient use of resources. Balducci
    et al. in [98] focused upon the management of heterogeneous data obtained from
    multiple sensory sources. Their study also presented the potential profitability
    aspects of logging and exploiting the continuously generated dataset for achieving
    subjective goals. The authors specify the use of Regression Models and Neural
    Networks for data handling and decision making. The use of smartphones for obtaining
    various types of agricultural information is proposed in [99]. The authors also
    proposed the demonstration of advanced agricultural techniques through videos
    in order to create awareness with respect to the adoption of Precision Agriculture.
    IoT technology has the potential to become a key player in realizing the food
    supply chain traceability systems. Various issues pertaining to the food supply
    chain and their resolution using IoT has been discussed extensively in existing
    literature [28,29]. The most commonly used IoT device in food supply chain is
    the RFID which are enhanced barcodes and can be used for tracing the tracking
    the agricultural logistics. The contemporary researches have employed multiple
    sensors to augment the product status information recorded through the RFID [30,31].
    Owing to the heterogeneity and distributed architecture of the IoT, naming has
    been considered as an important aspect for real-time tracking of the food supply
    logistics [32]. The authors in [100] presented a framework for highlighting the
    technological drivers of IoT. They further proposed a methodology that employs
    IoT for facilitating the farmers to deliver the crops directly to the nearby customers.
    Virtualizing the food supply chains using the IoT concepts eradicates the need
    of physical proximity [11]. The amalgamation of advanced hardware technology and
    intelligent software agents has contributed a lot in the development of automated
    food supply chain management systems [[33], [34], [35], [36], [37]]. 3. Proposed
    methodolgy This section presents a detailed description of the proposed solution.
    The complete solution has been discussed in two parts: (i) First, an analogy of
    the solution with respect to the IoT topology has been provided, and (ii) Second,
    a detailed description of the proposed framework for achieving the required functionality
    has been discussed. A summarized view of the involved entities and the communication
    between them is provided in the latter part of this section. 3.1. Analogy of the
    proposed solution with the IoT ecosystem The complete IoT ecosystem has been divided
    into three main components viz. (i) Perception Layer, (ii) Communication Layer,
    and (iii) Intelligence or Control Layer [38]. Fig. 2 shows an overview of the
    IoT ecosystem with respect to these layers. The components of the proposed solution
    comprising each of these layers have been discussed in detail in following sub-sections.

    Fig. 2. IoT Ecosystem – Layered Representation. 3.1.1. Perception layer The Perception
    Layer is mainly responsible for acquiring data from the environment with the help
    of sensors. However, information gathering in the IoT ecosystem cannot be restricted
    to only sensory data. Users are an indispensable entity of the IoT ecosystem and
    are a rich source of data generation. Such data may correspond to either textual
    or graphical posts on the social media or even sharing of information such as
    user’s location in an explicit or implicit manner. The concept of the perception
    layer, hence, can be further extended to the data acquisition from the users through
    their smart devices, such as smartphones, smartwatches, etc. This work classifies
    the data gathering mechanisms into two broad categories depending upon the data
    source: (i) sensory data; (ii) user data. This section discusses the various types
    of information that can be obtained through various entities of the IoT Ecosystem.
    3.1.1.1. Sensory data Data obtained using sensors is termed as sensory data. Sensors
    are tiny electro-mechanical devices and can be used for obtaining information
    regarding: • Field and Weather Conditions: The quality of the crops depends mainly
    upon the soil and the atmospheric conditions in which they are being cultivated.
    The knowledge about the soil nutrients, moisture content, density of weeds and
    other factors responsible for the production of crops can help in reducing the
    use of chemical products such as herbicides, pesticides and other pollutants thereby
    reducing the environmental impact and increasing the productivity. Such type of
    information can be obtained using appropriate sensors such as meteorological sensors,
    photometric sensors, water sensors, dendrometers, biological sensors, weed seekers,
    Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), optical cameras, photosynthesis sensors,
    soil respiration or moisture sensors, hygrometers, Leaf Area index (LAI) sensors,
    etc. [39]. Sensors are resource constrained and low power devices that collect
    data from the surroundings. Data collected by these sensors is transmitted to
    a local gateway or coordinator which in turn would forward the data to cloud or
    other data centers for analysis and other services that need to be provided. •
    Logistics tracing and tracking: Another important aspect that can be addressed
    using sensors is that of logistics tracing and tracking. Logistics refer to the
    commercial activity of transporting goods to the customer and is a vital component
    of the food supply chain. The traceability of logistics is classified into three
    main categories: viz. linear, centralized and distributed [40,41]. The linear
    approach involves the sharing of the traceability data among the partners involved
    in the logistics transportation process. Every user involved in the supply chain
    captures the traceability information of the immediate buyer and supplier for
    each product. European General Food Law identifies this process as the “one step
    forward and one step back” principle [42]. The centralized approach for logistics
    tracing involves the use of shared databases for storing the traceability data.
    The national bovine animal registration systems in Europe [42] follows this centralized
    approach. The distributed approach requires the involved users to exchange the
    traceability data throughout the network of interconnected individual traceability
    systems. Information regarding the transport of raw materials from suppliers to
    the farmers, crops and pre-processed food items from farming fields to distribution
    centres and to the customer can be made available using the technology offered
    by the IoT paradigm. The “Electronic Product Code Information Services” (EPCIS)
    standard is used extensively in the food supply chain for implementing the distributed
    traceability systems [40,41,[43], [44], [45]]. The tracking systems based on EPCIS
    record the events of supply chain network and store them in either single or multiple
    repositories. These events can be retrieved upon requirement based on appropriate
    security policy [41,46]. The contents of these events comprise of product identity,
    the reason and the location of occurrence along with the timestamp. Such events
    are usually generated using AutoID technologies, such as RFID, bar codes, Optical
    Character Recognition (OCR), smart cards, etc. [47]. The architecture of the proposed
    solution employs a distributed approach for tracing and tracking mechanism. Vehicles
    used for transportation or the transported goods themselves may carry RFID and
    other devices for providing real-time information regarding the logistics. Tracing
    the logistics through user shared information is another aspect of the proposed
    system. 3.1.1.2. User data Users are an important component of the IoT ecosystem.
    Apart from the sensors, users themselves are an important source of information
    that can be utilized to enhance the quality of service being provided by the IoT
    based solution. These users have their social circles (professional and personal)
    that can be leveraged for efficient delivery of services. The addition of this
    social dimension to the IoT ecosystem allows for collaborative sharing of user
    data. The proposed system comprises of five major entities namely: (i) Supplier,
    (ii) Farmer, (iii) Transporter, (iv) Distribution Centres, and (v) Consumers.
    Information shared by each of these entities can be utilized to provide them with
    value added services using the proposed solution. • Information sharing by suppliers:
    The food supply chain initiates with the suppliers providing the necessary materials
    (fertilizers, pesticides, seeds, etc.) required by the farmers for growing crops.
    The suppliers can, as such, share information regarding the type of the products
    they are selling along with their estimated costs. This would help the farmers
    in identifying the suitable supplier for their requirements in less time. Moreover,
    even if the suppliers do not wish share the quotes publicly for the materials
    being sold, they may share their contact details which would help the farmers
    to connect with them for their enquiries in minimum time. • Information sharing
    by farmers: The type and quantity of the produced crop can be shared by the farmers
    so that intelligent recommendations may be shown to the consumers as per their
    requirements (discussed in Section 3.1.3). The availability of data such as field
    size along with the other sensory data corresponding to the field quality can
    be utilized for providing predictions regarding the types of the crops that can
    be sown and other measures required for ensuring the quality of the crops being
    produced. • Information sharing by consumers/distribution centres: Distribution
    centres and consumers may share their demands in terms of required quantity of
    the products, location of delivery, delivery deadlines, etc. Real-time availability
    of such information would benefit the farmers in deciding the distribution centre
    and consumer to whom they may sell their products. The consumers can share their
    contact details so that in case the farmer is capable of supplying the required
    goods may contact directly to the consumer, thereby eliminating the need of the
    intermediaries and getting apt prices for their products. • Information sharing
    by transporters: Transporters are indispensable part of the food supply chain
    as they are responsible for carrying the required products to the destination.
    Transportation incurs significant cost and as a result, adds to the final cost
    of the product being sold. Further, the availability of the transporters offering
    logistic services is in abundance and the rates charged by them vary among different
    transporters. Hence, it is required that the farmers or the shipment consignee
    must survey multiple transporter before selecting any. Manual survey in such cases
    becomes infeasible as it requires a lot of time and effort. As an alternative,
    the transporters can share the information regarding the services they are offering
    along with the rates being charged through electronic means so as to facilitate
    the farmers in selecting the best choice. • Location information: The information
    shared by all the user entities must be augmented with the location information
    for uninterrupted services. For instance: data shared by the farmers should include
    the location of the site/field from where the goods need to be picked. Similarly,
    consumer should provide the location of the site where the goods need to be delivered.
    Moreover, the locations of different distribution centres can help the farmers
    to decide where to sell their goods considering the distance of the distribution
    centre, cost incurred in transportation, demand quantity of goods and the rates
    being provided. Such location information can be manually shared by the concerned
    entities or can be obtained using GPS of their smart phones. Table 3 summarizes
    the various types of information obtained by the perception layer along with their
    source. Table 3. Information obtained in Perception Layer. Information Type Source

    service 3.1.2. Communication layer This layer is mainly responsible for transmitting
    the data in the IoT network and mainly deals with the protocols that need to be
    employed for local as well as global communication. The proposed solution classifies
    the communication layer into (i) Physical Communication layer, and (ii) Virtual
    Communication sub-layer. The role and responsibilities of these sublayers are
    discussed further in this section. 3.1.2.1. Physical communication sub-layer This
    sub-layer is concerned with the underlying protocols required to transmit the
    data from various sources across the IoT network. As discussed in Section 3.1.1,
    data obtained in perception layer comprises of sensory data and user data. User
    data can be shared using smartphones that are rich in computational power and
    energy and hence legacy protocols for the wireless networks can be employed for
    transmitting such type of data. The application layer data can be shared using
    suitable protocols such as REST, HTTP, etc. Sensors, in contrast, are resource
    constrained and low power devices. Protocols such as Zigbee, Bluetooth Low Energy,
    etc. that have been designed for such devices operating in a Personal Area Network
    (PAN) can be used for sharing data generated by these devices. Table 4 presents
    a highlight of the protocols for IoT based communication. Table 4. Protocols for

    devices; (i) Reduced Functional Device (RFD), and (ii) Fully Functional Device
    (FFD) [48]. RFDs are the end devices comprising of sensors/actuators while FFDs
    can play the role of Coordinator that is responsible for starting and managing
    the personal area network. FFDs may also be used as routers to extend the range
    of the personal area networks. Data collected by the end devices are sent to the
    coordinator via a router. The coordinator further transmits the data to a gateway
    device that is responsible for computation, analysis and further transmission
    of the data to the cloud. Computation and data analysis can be performed at a
    local level (Coordinator/Gateway) or at remote site or cloud. Fig. 3 represents
    the communication topology of the proposed solution. Download : Download high-res

    for the Proposed Architecture. 3.1.2.2. Virtual communication sub-layer The virtual
    communication sub-layer acts as an overlay network superimposed over the physical
    network. This implies that even though the users may think that they are directly
    connected to a remote user (virtual connection), however, in practice the communication
    between these two users may involve multiple routers, switches and other network
    components. The virtual connection between the different entities involved in
    the proposed system is shown in Fig. 4. For simplicity, the figure omits the networking
    details and focusses mainly upon the communicating entities. Download : Download

    between the IoT entities. Data from the sensors can be processed locally at the
    gateway or remotely at the cloud or remote data centres. This data is required
    to provide intelligent services and notifications to the users. Information shared
    by the suppliers is stored on the cloud and is used for recommending the most
    suitable supplier to farmers depending upon their requirements. Similarly, depending
    upon the customer demands or distribution centres requirements and quotes, intelligent
    notifications and recommendation services can be provided to the farmers. The
    location information of the customers and distribution centres can be used to
    provide suggestions regarding the shortest route available to them. These services
    have been discussed in detail in Section 4. 3.1.3. Intelligence layer This is
    the most vital layer and is responsible for providing intelligent services to
    the users based upon the data acquired in the Perception Layer and transmitted
    in the Communication Layer. Intelligence capability can be embedded at local or
    global level. The proposed solution is capable of delivering a number of intelligent
    services to the users in the context of agriculture and food supply chain. The
    services provided by the proposed architecture has been discussed below: • Crop
    Prediction: Data regarding the quality of the farming fields such assoil nutrients,
    moisture content, density of weeds, etc. along with the weather conditions is
    used for predicting the type of the crops that can be sown. Prediction can be
    further enhanced by incorporating the details of the requirements of the market.
    For instance, if the demand for a particular type of food product is high and
    if the agricultural fields has the potential to grow good quality of the required
    product, the predictions can recommend that particular product to the farmer with
    high priority. Further, real-time data regarding the status of crops can be utilized
    to develop predictions regarding the time of harvesting as well. • Real-time monitoring
    of agricultural fields: Sensors fixed at predefined locations at the fields, unmanned
    arial vehicles UAVs such drones mounted with sensors or even sensor mounted vehicles
    are capable of providing the real time information about the field conditions.
    For instance, flame sensors can be placed to issue warning message to the farmers
    if fire is detected. An accompanying mounted camera can also click a picture of
    the situation when fire was detected. The warning messages should be sent to the
    smartphones of the farmers so that the necessary measures can be taken to avoid
    the impact of the adverse conditions. Farmers can also receive the real-time data
    about the conditions of their crops and agricultural fields so as to prevent unwanted
    pests hampering the quality of the crops. • Intelligent Recommendation Services:
    These services refer to the intelligent recommendations as per the requirements
    of the user. For instance, data shared by the suppliers can be used to recommend
    the most apt choice to the farmer as per their requirements. Similarly, manually
    visiting the distribution centres is not feasible for the farmers due to a number
    of reasons. One of the prominent being non-standardized rates of the goods offered
    by the distribution centres. Farmers are usually unware of the rates fixed for
    each type of the crops and as such there is a chance that the farmer gets cheated
    by the people at distribution centre. Moreover, different distribution centres
    provide different rates for the same product. Another important factor that prevents
    the farmers from visiting different distribution centres is their distance. Farmers,
    usually, reside in rural areas while the distribution centres are in the cities.
    Manually visiting each distribution centres would require considerable amount
    of time, effort and money. Hence, online availability of such information would
    facilitate the farmers to select the most appropriate distribution centre for
    selling their good. The use of intelligent algorithms that consider factors such
    as demand, cost, distance, etc., to suggest the most suitable choice to the users
    further helps in saving the decision-making efforts of the farmers. The end consumers
    can also be provided with appropriate recommendations for procuring the goods
    directly from the farmers. Depending upon the required quantity and type of the
    products by the consumer, algorithms can be employed to mine and filter suitable
    farmers that are willing to sell their goods. This is made possible due to the
    information shared by the farmers about their crops and locations. Upon selecting
    a suitable choice the consumer can directly contact the farmer using the contact
    details provided by them. • Shortest Route Prediction: Considering that the location
    of the destination is available different mechanisms can be employed to suggest
    the shortest route to users for delivering the goods. Such mechanism may include
    use of web APIs such as Google Maps [49], Distance Calculator [50], GeoDataSource
    [51] and others. • Logistics Tracing and Tracking: Tracing and tracking services
    for the transported goods is an essential mechanism. Vehicles and goods equipped
    with RFID sensors can provide real time location information. This information
    is made available to the dispatcher and other stakeholders on demand. The proposed
    solution also provides the mechanism for implicit sharing of location using smartphones
    or other GPS embedded devices mounted on the goods or vehicles. 3.2. Proposed
    system model This section discusses the proposed framework for smart devices to
    realize the intelligent services for the agriculture practice. Fig. 5 provides
    a detailed overview of the proposed framework. The proposed framework can be utilized
    by the application developers for designing applications pertaining to specific
    use cases. The proposed framework allows the developers to leverage the functionalities
    required for achieving the concept of smart architecture. The different components
    of the framework have been discussed below: • User Profile Manager: This module
    is responsible for maintaining the user profile information, such as name, contact
    details, user location, and so on. The information is stored in the User profile
    database and is retrieved during recommendation services. • Contact List Manager:
    Contact list management refers to the addition of new contacts and updation or
    deletion of the existing contacts. The module offers the functionality similar
    to the contact management in smart mobile phones. Data entered through this module
    is stored in Phonebook database. • Contact Group Manager: This module is responsible
    for grouping the contacts as per the user preference. For instance, all the contacts
    of different logistic operators may be clubbed into one group. This would facilitate
    the information dissemination to the required group as per the user’s requirement.
    For instance, if the farmer wishes to hire a transport vehicle for the delivery
    of food product, he can upload his requirements on the mobile application which
    would in turn send this data as notifications to all the logistic operators existing
    in the group. • User Data Requirements Module: This serves as an interface to
    add the user requirements which would eventually be either uploaded on cloud portal
    or sent to specific users or groups. Adding a requirement may include the group
    name to which the user wants to send the information. The user can also specify
    the requirements as public indicating that the requirements will be published
    on the cloud portal from where every user can view the published information.
    This data is also saved in the User Requirements database for a specified period
    of time. • Notifications Module: This is unified module for displaying the notifications
    received on the mobile application. Notifications can be classified into different
    categories, such as (i) Field Conditions: Data received from sensors deployed
    in the agricultural field; (ii) Requirement Notifications: Information regarding
    the market demand or the demand of the consumers; and (iii) Recommendations: Suggestions
    obtained from the intelligent recommendation module. • Intelligent Recommendation
    Module: This serves as the intelligence core for the proposed framework. The intelligent
    services discussed in Section 3.1.3 is realized through this module. The module
    is responsible for providing intelligent recommendation so as to facilitate the
    decision making process of the users, such as the best option for selling the
    produced crops, or suggestion regarding improving the field quality in terms of
    nutrients or moisture, etc. The module interacts with the notification module
    for retrieving real time requirements received on the mobile applications and
    provides suggestions to the users as per the requirements. • Network Interface:
    This serves as an interface to the network and is responsible for the transmission
    and reception of the messages to and fro the network. • Cloud Portal: The cloud
    portal refers to a web-based application portal for storing the various types
    of data submitted by the user. Any information published on the cloud portal can
    be either for public or specific users. Users can synchronize their mobile application
    to fetch the latest requirements posted by the distribution centres in the market
    regarding the cost of the products and their demand or the customers regarding
    their requirements. Real-time rates and the product demand in the market can be
    obtained from this portal and can be used to provide intelligent recommendations
    to the user. Download : Download high-res image (406KB) Download : Download full-size

    network of things can benefit the stakeholders in a number of ways. This section
    discusses the various scenarios where the proposed concept can facilitate the
    users in terms of effort and time. The scenarios discussed in this section covers
    the different aspects of agriculture ranging from procurement of raw products
    from the supplier to the selling of the agriculture product to the customers.
    4.1. Use Case 1: procuring raw materials from the farmers The initial stage of
    farming starts with the decision of the type of crops that can be grown and the
    materials required for good quality crops. Decision regarding the type of crops
    to be grown depends upon a number of factors including the climatic and field
    conditions, demand of the crop in the market, etc. The sensors installed in the
    fields acquire different types of information regarding the field conditions,
    the weather conditions can be obtained by either using sensors or the third party
    services. This information is aggregated by the coordinators and transmitted through
    the gateway to both the service running on the cloud as well as to the smartphones
    of the farmers. The Notification Module is responsible for displaying the received
    information as notifications on the smartphones. The demand of various crops in
    the market is availed from the information shared the distribution centres and
    stored in the repository residing on cloud. The Intelligent Recommendation Module
    uses relevant algorithms for data aggregation and service composition for recommending
    the type of the product most suited as per the conditions. This information is
    directly made available to the farmers through the Notification Module of the
    proposed framework. The recommendation algorithms can either be executed on the
    cloud or on the users’ smartphone. Once the type of crop has been decided, the
    next stage is to procure different materials required for growing the crop. This
    includes seeds, fertilizers, etc. A farmer can upload his requirements regarding
    the material type and the quantity required on his mobile application using the
    User Data Requirements Module. This information is shared among the different
    raw material suppliers and they are presented with an option to quote their rates.
    The quoted rates are displayed on the farmer’s smartphone application through
    the Notification Module. The farmer can then select the most suitable supplier
    as per his preference and contact him using the details shared by the raw material
    supplier. This would not only save the farmer’s time and effort for procuring
    the material but would also enable them to get the best rates for the procured
    goods. 4.2. Use case 2: farmer and customer Getting directly in touch with the
    end customer can be a boon for the farmers since the cost incurred by the intermediaries
    will be avoided leading to an overall increase in the farmer as well as customer
    benefits. Fig. 6 shows the information exchange between the farmers’ and the customer’s
    smart device. Initially, consider Farmer 1 made a transaction with a Customer
    XYZ. Upon successful transaction, the information of the Customer XYZ is added
    to the contact list maintained in Farmer 1′s smartphone using the Contact List
    Manager module. Similarly, upon interacting with different farmers, the information
    of the Customer XYZ is stored in all the corresponding farmer’s smartphone device.
    All the customers whose details are stored in the farmers’ mobile application
    is grouped under the Costumer Tag using the Contact Group Manager. Similarly,
    when a customer saves the information of different famers in his mobile application
    they will be grouped under the Farmer Tag by the Contact Group Manager. In future,
    if the Customer XYZ decides to purchase agricultural goods, he may upload the
    requirements along with other details in the application installed in his smartphone
    device using the User Data Requirements Module. This information regarding the
    requirements of the customer is used by the Intelligent Recommendation Module
    for providing the list of potential farmers capable of supplying the required
    product. The module shall fetch the details of farmers stored under the Farmer
    Tag from the Contact Group Manager. The application will then mine the relevant
    farmers capable of supplying the required goods and those farmers existing in
    the contact list of the customer shall receive a notification on their mobile
    application through the Notifications Module informing them about the requirements
    of the Customer XYZ. Fig. 6 shows an instance of the scenario where Farmer 1 and
    Farmer 2 receive the notification about the Customer XYZ requirements and are
    provided with an option to quote their rates. When the farmers quote their corresponding
    rates for the required goods using the Submit Requirement Notification Response
    module, Customer XYZ can view the rates quoted by the different famers on his
    mobile application. The customer can then manually select a farmer to view his
    details, and can contact him directly for further confirmations. If the farmer
    agrees to supply the required products, he needs to confirm the deal on his mobile
    application portal after which the customer will receive a success acknowledgement
    of the transaction, as shown in Fig. 6. This would allow the farmer to sell their
    products directly to customer without going through the distribution centres.
    This would also allow the customer to get goods at cheaper price than the retailer
    rates. Download : Download high-res image (406KB) Download : Download full-size

    case 3: farmer and logistics operator Once the farmer has finalized the deal with
    the customer, he needs to transport the goods to the customer. The transport facility
    can be arranged by the customer as well as the farmer depending upon the terms
    agreed in the deal. Fig. 7 depicts the scenario where the transportation is arranged
    by the farmers themselves. As in case with the customers, the farmers can have
    a separate group for storing the contact details of various logistic operators
    using Contact List Manager and Contact Group Manager. A farmer uploads his requirements
    regarding the quantity of the goods that need to be transported along with the
    location details and the date by which the goods should reach the designated locations.
    Different logistic operators receive the notification about the requirements of
    the farmer through Notifications Module and they are required to quote their rates
    using Submit Requirement Notification Response module of the proposed framework.
    The Notifications Module on the farmer’s mobile application displays the rates
    quoted by different logistics operators. He may then select the most suitable
    operator and can contact him using the contact details uploaded by the logistics
    operator in the User Profile Manage component of the framework. Upon successful
    confirmation of the logistics operator, the operator sends the details of the
    vehicle to be used for transportation as well as that of the driver responsible
    for transporting the goods. The contact details of the farmer and the customer
    is sent to the driver as well. The application will automatically add the driver’s
    information in the friends list of the farmer and the farmer’s information in
    the friends list of the driver. When the driver starts from the source location,
    the real time location sharing of the vehicle will be automatically turned on
    and the farmer can receive the location information the transported goods. When
    the consignment is received by the customer the real time location sharing of
    the vehicle is automatically turned off for the stakeholders involved in this
    transaction. This application of the social network of thigs concept clearly eliminates
    the requirement of having extra RFIDs or other sensors installed on the vehicles
    for location tracking. The concept of location sharing is applicable between the
    customer and the vehicle driver as well. This implies that the customer will also
    receive the real time location of the transported goods. Download : Download high-res

    interaction using the proposed framework. 4.4. Use case 4: intelligent recommendations
    The agricultural product, once harvested, is sold in the market for the consumption
    by the customers. This process, in its current state, involves multiple entities.
    For instance, the farmer sells the goods to the local broker who will arrange
    for the transportation and will sell the goods to the distribution centre. These
    distribution centers quote rates for the products as per the demand in the market.
    The standard rates of the goods are not available with the farmers. This allows
    the local brokers to purchase the goods from the farmers at a meagre expense and
    they sell the same goods at higher price to the distribution centers. It is also
    not feasible for the farmer to manually visit the different distribution centres
    to sell their goods, since these distribution centres are located in urban areas
    far from the farmer’s field. The proposed system is capable of recommending various
    services to user as per the requirement. An important application of the proposed
    solution is to facilitate the farmers to sell their goods directly at these distribution
    centres. A farmer is required to upload the product information such as crop type,
    crop quantity, etc. which he wants to sell at the distribution centre using the
    User Data Requirements Module. The Intelligent Recommendation Module of the proposed
    framework will capture the location of different distribution centres, demand
    of the agricultural goods and their quoted rates. This data can be then used to
    recommend the most suitable distribution centre to the farmer where he can sell
    his goods. The location information adds one more level of intelligence to the
    recommendation service by suggesting the most apt distribution centre in terms
    of cost as well as the distance of the distribution centre from the farmer’s location.
    Once the farmer finalizes the distribution centre, live traffic conditions can
    be utilized to suggest the shortest route to the distribution centre. Fig. 8 shows
    an instance where Farmer 1 needs to sell crop type X at the distribution centre.
    The farmer uploads the crop type and the quantity to be sold. The Intelligent
    Recommendation Module searches and suggests the list of different distribution
    centre in the order of their suitability index. Once the farmer selects a particular
    distribution centre, the module recommends the shortest route to the distribution
    centre as per the live traffic conditions. Download : Download high-res image

    5. Discussion There exists a plethora of research regarding the applicability
    of IoT based systems for improving the traditional agricultural practices. However,
    the work proposed in this paper is an improvement over the existing works since
    it does not only relies upon the sensory data for providing the services to the
    user but it also incorporates the user centric data in terms of requirements and
    preferences of the user. Moreover, the proposed work also attempts to incorporate
    a certain level of social relations of the users in order to provide the right
    information at right time and at right place. The social relation refers to the
    type of relations that a humans share with other humans in the professional or
    personal domain. The conceptual architecture and framework proposed in this paper
    for incorporating social dimension to the IoT ecosystem has wide scope of application
    in the agricultural domain. This can be inferred from the various use case descriptions
    provided in Section 4. This section further presents logical justifications for
    the proposed work. Consider a farmer who has to sell his produce in the market
    say 50 kg of food product and that the invested amount by the famer is Rs. 5000.
    In the current scenario, where multiple intermediaries are involved in the food
    supply chain, the farmer is tempted to sell this product to local broker at say
    Rs. 6000. The broker will arrange for the transport facility and will sell this
    product at the distribution centre at a higher price say Rs. 10,000. These distribution
    centres will further sell this product to the retailers at a price that will be
    higher than 10,000. For simplicity, let us consider the distributers sell the
    product at Rs 15,000. This makes the Rs 5000 food product worth of Rs 15,000,
    i.e. Rs 300 per kg which was initially produced in Rs 100 per kg. Moreover, the
    farmer gained only Rs 1000 by selling 50 kg of product, i.e. Rs 10 per kg even
    when the consumer is paying Rs 300 per kg of the same product. In this context,
    the proposed architecture shall help the farmer to maximize his profit while allowing
    the consumers to purchase the product at a reasonable cost. This can be attributed
    to the fact that the proposed architecture shall allow the consumers to purchase
    the products directly from the farmer. Obviously, the required amount of product
    that needs to be purchased cannot be too small, since it would be infeasible for
    the farmer to ship a small quantity of the product to the customer place at low
    price. However, if it is feasible for the consumer, he can directly visit the
    famer for collecting the product. The proposed architecture also enables the farmer
    to select the most appropriate distribution centre for selling their products
    without investing too much effort and time in the process. Consider a famer needs
    to sell 50 kg of product at the distribution centre which can be 50 kms from his
    place. The rate at which the farmer will sell its product will vary from one distribution
    centre to another. Let us consider that distribution centre A is 50 km from the
    famer’s place and is will to purchase the product at Rs 100 per kg while distribution
    centre B is 70 km from the farmer’s place but is expected to purchase the product
    at Rs 150 per kg. This problem further elevates when the number of distribution
    centres increase with each having different price and distance. The amount of
    effort and time that the farmer has to invest for visiting each of these distribution
    centre before he makes his decision regarding the choice of distribution centre
    where he can sell the product is very high. In this context, the proposed work
    in this paper shall facilitate the farmer to obtain this information without having
    the need to visit each centre individually. Moreover, the proposed work will also
    assist the farmer in selecting the best option since the intelligent algorithms
    shall provide the farmer with a list of distribution centres ranked according
    to the farmer preferences, i.e. whether he needs to maximize the cost or minimize
    the distance. Another important contribution of the proposed work is that it will
    provide the farmers with the real time assessment of the agricultural field conditions
    that will help him in maintain the quality of the field and eventually the quality
    of the grown crops. Moreover, this information can also be analyzed for recommending
    the farmers with the type of food products that he can grow as per the conditions
    of the field. The demand of the crops in the market shall allow the farmer to
    grow the right type and quantity of product in order to minimize the wastage and
    loss which would otherwise incur if the products are in excess than the demand.
    6. Conclusions and future works The exponential rise in the global population
    has created an increased demand for the quantity as well as quality of the food
    products. This demand can be catered by modernizing the agricultural sector. IoT
    has the potential to optimize the traditional agricultural practices. The conjunction
    of smart devices with the intelligent algorithms can be a boon to the farmers.
    This paper proposes an IoT architecture for adding the smartness component to
    the agricultural sector. The proposed architecture relies upon the data obtained
    from the end devices comprising of not only sensors/actuators but also the farmers
    and other personnel involved in the agricultural process. Information regarding
    the quality of the agricultural fields is helpful for growing good quality crops.
    The architecture proposed in this paper provides real time monitoring of the agricultural
    fields so as to facilitate the farmers to supply the required nutrients to the
    crops in a timely manner. User generated data comprising of product demand and
    cost helps the farmers as well as consumers to obtain good quality products at
    optimal rates. The proposed architecture also takes care of the real-time tracing
    and tracking of the food supply logistics. The data being shared by the different
    entities involved in the proposed system can be collaborated to provided critical
    and value added recommendations for enhancing the efficiency of the agricultural
    practices. The discussed use cases clearly depicts the applicability of the proposed
    architecture in the various agricultural process scenario. However there are certain
    limitations of the work presented in this paper that needs to be addressed for
    enhancing the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. The architecture proposed
    in this paper relies upon the user generated data and as such storage of these
    large volumes of data is a key concern. Moreover, intelligent algorithms for searching
    relevant information in the IoT needs to be designed in order to minimize the
    delivery time of the services. Other aspects of the proposed architecture that
    require critical attention is that that security, privacy and trust management.
    This can be attributed to the fact that smart devices such as smart phones owned
    by the users are the storehouses of multiple types of personal and important information.
    These devices are assumed to work autonomously in the proposed architecture and
    hence are vulnerable to various types of security attacks. Further, the trust
    credentials of the shared information is also a significant concern since false
    information can misguide the users and reduce the efficiency of the recommendation
    services. Moreover, the heterogeneity of the devices in the IoT ecosystem needs
    to be addressed in order to ensure interoperability between the devices. References

    and their citizens have led the largest changes that have been taking place continuously,
    especially since the transition from an agricultural economy to an industrial
    one. This phenomenon is especially significant from the mid-eighteenth century
    and it will become more intense if the predictions that establish that, around
    the year 2050, approximately 70% of the world population will concentrate in some
    type of city finally come true. With these boundary conditions, it is evident
    that the achievement of more efficient and sustainable cities is an unavoidable
    objective for which politicians, managers and technicians must work in order to
    guarantee the quality of life of their citizens. Although this paradigm of sustainability
    and efficiency has always been present in the managers of cities, it has not been
    until very recently that technology has made available to the responsible parties
    a plethora of possibilities that, when properly employed, translate into significant
    savings. At the same time, the day-to-day improvement of the citizens is consolidating
    a new urban concept in which the different processes and systems that occur in
    it are continuously monitored in both time and space. This paper reviews the evolution
    of one of the pioneering examples of such cities, Santander, where an Internet
    of the Things infrastructure was deployed a decade ago. In this time, multiple
    technologies and services have been developed and deployed in smart city pilots.
    The paper discusses the key lessons learnt from the digitalization of the city
    and the new challenges that have arisen as we were paving the way for a smarter
    and more liveable city. Similar content being viewed by others The Importance

    by Internet of Things (IoT)—a Silent Revolution in China Article 27 July 2017
    Internet of Things and the Public Sector Chapter © 2020 1 Introduction The smart
    city market is still largely fragmented, with vertical solutions dominating and
    horizontal solutions more mirroring experimental petri dishes rather than solutions
    to real problems. This results in below-critical mass efforts in standardisation
    and commodity solutions. Vendor lock-in thus dictates the landscape, resulting
    in lowering cities’ confidence that smart city strategies can achieve a major
    change. Conversely, the fragmentation of emerging IoT-enabled city platforms makes
    it difficult for entrepreneurs and SMEs to achieve economies of scale by replicating
    innovative solutions from one city to another. In this sense, planning to effectively
    meet the conditions and realities of a post-carbon, climate responsible world
    will require a shift in our current understanding of what constitutes good urban
    design and planning. Many of the practices that we now take for granted, such
    as planning cities around automobile transportation and zoning for single uses,
    will no longer be economically, environmentally, or culturally viable. Smart cities
    hold the potential to be a key driver and catalyst in creating a large-scale global
    IoT market of services and hardware [1]. However, the emerging smart city market
    faces specific challenges that act as barriers to growth, impeding rapid innovation
    and inhibiting widespread market adoption. In this paper we are reviewing the
    key lessons learnt gathered from the experience of a decade of developing and
    deploying smart city services in the city of Santander, Spain. Based on this,
    we are proposing some of the key challenges that should be addressed in order
    to bring the smart city paradigm a step forward. In this sense, we are foreseeing
    four key objectives that should be pursued: (1) Scaling city platforms without
    vendor and/or city lock-in; (2) Developing services that really meet citizens’
    needs; (3) Guaranteeing resilient wireless connectivity in massive 5G scenarios;
    (4) Encouraging new high-value data sources beyond open data. The remaining of
    the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes the history of the SmartSantander
    ecosystem consolidation by briefly sketching the projects that have been carried
    out and presenting how they have contributed to the evolution of the city. In
    the path that these projects have opened some fundamental lessons have been learnt,
    which are also summarized. In Sect. 3, the way forward is outlined by identifying
    the crucial challenges that have to be addressed in order to fulfil the aforementioned
    key objectives. The high-level framework for addressing these challenges is also
    presented. Finally, existing related work and initiatives already developing innovative
    solutions for these challenges are also reviewed in Sect. 3. Last but not least,
    some concluding remarks are highlighted in Sect. 4. 2 SmartSantander Lessons Learnt
    This section presents the three key pillars of the SmartSantander evolution and
    the three key lessons learnt that we have concluded. These lessons learnt are
    based on our developments around the SmartSantander concept evolution as a successful
    case of the implementation of the smart city paradigm. 2.1 SmartSantander Evolution
    The objectives of SmartSantander’s developments are two-fold as well as concurrent.
    As a testbed, it enables experimental assessment of cutting-edge scientific research.
    However, this testbed goes beyond the experimental validation of novel IoT technologies.
    It also aims at supporting the assessment of the socio-economical acceptance of
    new IoT solutions and the quantification of service usability and performance
    with end users in the loop. For instance, it simultaneously supports the trial
    and subsequent provisioning of smart city services. In the following subsections,
    a brief summary of three key factors that have structured the evolution of the
    SmartSantander approach is presented. 2.1.1 Massive Deployment of IoT Devices
    The deployment, influenced by Santander Municipality’s strategic smart-city service
    requirements, intentionally provided a concentration of IoT devices in the city
    centre (a 1 km2 area) in order to achieve the maximum possible impact on the citizens.
    Nonetheless, other city areas are also covered. Figure 1 shows an excerpt view
    of the deployment. The different markers represent the deployed nodes (e.g. illuminance,

    sensors). Fig. 1 Santander IoT infrastructure deployment excerpt view Full size
    image The SmartSantander testbed is composed of around 3000 IEEE 802.15.4 devices,
    200 GPRS modules and 2000 joint NFC tag/QR code labels deployed both at static
    locations (streetlights, facades, bus stops) as well as on-board mobile vehicles
    (buses, taxis). Moreover, smartphones belonging to citizens who have downloaded
    the Pulso de la Ciudad App [2] are also part of the testbed infrastructure. To
    attract the widest interest and demonstrate its usefulness, the deployment of
    the IoT experimentation infrastructure has been undertaken to create interesting
    use-cases that will generate an impact. In this respect, application areas have
    been selected based on their high potential impact on the citizens. Diversity,
    dynamics and scale of the IoT environment are also taken into consideration in
    the selection of application use cases: Environmental Monitoring: Around 2000
    IoT devices installed (mainly in the city centre), on lampposts and facades provide
    measurements of different environmental parameters, such as temperature, CO, noise
    or light). Mobile Environmental Monitoring: In order to extend the aforementioned
    environmental monitoring use case, apart from measuring at static points, devices
    located in vehicles retrieve environmental parameters (related to air pollution).
    Sensors are installed in 150 public vehicles, including buses, taxis and police
    cars. Outdoor Parking: Almost 400 parking sensors (based on ferromagnetic technology),
    buried under the asphalt, have been installed in the main parking areas of the
    city centre in order to detect parking site availability in these zones (Fig.
    2). Fig. 2 Smart City services examples at Santander Full size image Traffic Intensity
    Monitoring: Around 60 devices have been deployed at the main entrances to the
    city of Santander to measure the main traffic condition parameters, such as traffic
    volumes, road occupancy, and vehicle speed or queue length. Parks and gardens
    irrigation: In order to make irrigation as efficient as possible, around 50 devices
    have been deployed in two green zones of the city to monitor irrigation-related
    parameters such as moisture temperature and humidity, rain precipitation or wind
    conditions. NFC/QR tags: More than 2000 tags have been deployed and distributed
    throughout different strategic locations. These tags are mainly at transportation
    points (bus stops, taxi ranks, etc…), points of interest (monuments, etc…) and
    shops. All the information provided is online and can be updated at any time.
    Every time one of these tags is read, an observation is generated including information
    relating to the reader. Participatory sensing: In this scenario, mobile phones
    are used as sensing devices automatically feeding information from the device’s
    built-in sensors such as GPS, compass, noise or temperature into the SmartSantander
    platform. Users can also participate by manually reporting events or incidences
    occurring in the city, which will subsequently be propagated to other users who
    are subscribed to the respective type of events (Fig. 1). The deployment of IoT
    devices to compose the SmartSantander infrastructure has been motivated both by
    requirements for ‘in-situ’ experimentation and by the aforementioned smart city
    services. The details of the SmartSantander’s IoT devices regarding hardware specifications,
    deployment locations and network organization have been thoroughly described in
    [3, 4]. 2.1.2 Service Provision One of the instruments of the strategy of Santander
    for sustainable development has been starting and performing a progressive enhancement
    of its Smart City dimension. The SmartSantander project [5] has been a clear milestone
    that has opened a wide variety of research lines converting the city in a kind
    of urban laboratory. Within the objectives of this initiative, the improvement
    of the quality of municipality services is paramount but also the contribution
    to the reactivation of the regional economic fabric is a heavyweight aim. The
    facility was conceived not only to act as a testbed for research with IoT technologies,
    but also for the development and evaluation of IoT enabled Smart City services
    and applications. To build such facility, the project analysed, designed and developed
    several services that were ranked as a priority by the local authorities, regional
    government and end users, which are described next. Environmental Monitoring:
    Due to global warming, governments around the world are devoting significant effort
    and resources to the management of the environment. The city of Santander, likewise,
    is involved in this activity and it is trying to carry out an effective policy
    for environmental management. Parking Management: With the aim of reducing CO
    emissions and other pollutants, as well as petrol consumption, ICT are becoming
    a transversal enabler. Drivers looking for available parking places within the
    city may use both smartphone applications as well as panels installed in the city.
    Traffic intensity: The assessment and classification of vehicles in road traffic
    is mainly accomplished by inductive loops placed under the pavement. These inductive
    loops allow monitoring vehicle passing and provide us information on several parameters
    of the traffic (vehicle speed, traffic congestion and traffic accidents, among
    others). The information is sent to the SmartSantander platform. Parks and gardens
    irrigation: The service is aimed at complementing the automated irrigation systems
    currently deployed at parks and gardens within the city of Santander. It offers
    a wide data set acquired in a distributed way, gathering the information of interest
    from multiple locations within each area. Agricultural IoT devices and weather
    stations have been deployed in three major parks of Santander. All the information
    captured by the sensors is sent to the SmartSantander platform and merged on an
    application that provides parks management technicians with accurate information
    on the green areas status. Tourist and Cultural information: In the majority of
    cities, there is a huge amount of information that may be of interest for tourists
    and citizens, but it is not readily accessible because it is so disperse. To avoid
    that, a service has been implemented to unify the way to access all data sources
    and presenting them in a context-sensitive, location-aware manner to the end users
    using Augmented Reality (AR) technology (Fig. 2). The service includes information
    about more than 2700 places in the city of Santander, classified in different
    categories: beaches, parks and gardens, monuments, buildings, tourist offices,
    shops, art galleries, libraries, bus stops, taxi ranks, bicycle hire points, parking
    lots and sports centres. Furthermore, it allows real-time access to traffic and
    beach cameras, weather reports and forecasts, public bus information and bike
    hire service, generating a unique ecosystem for end users when moving around the
    city. Participatory Sensing: The service aims at exploiting the use of citizens’
    smartphones to make people to take an active role in the generation of data for
    the SmartSantander Platform. Citizens, Santander City Council and the local newspaper
    are connected through the SmartSantander platform so that they can report, share
    and be notified of events happening in the city. Users also utilise their mobile
    phones to send physical sensing information, e.g. GPS coordinates, compass, environmental
    data such as noise, temperature, etc., feeding this information into the same
    platform. Municipal services were reorganized to adopt this application as the
    main way to report incidences. This has permitted to improve the response time
    to the citizen claims reducing the time to find out a solution for an incidence
    from 40.76 to 13.2 days. 2.1.3 Co-creation Co-creation as a strategy where diverse
    stakeholders collaborate and produce a mutually beneficial product/service together
    was a crucial element of SmartSantander development. The SmartSantander facility
    provides the possibility that different stakeholders within the smart cities can
    co-create new services and innovative applications that can be tested and validated
    under real conditions in the urban landscape. SmartSantander has accomplished
    the concept of co-creation by opening its infrastructure and platform to third-party
    developers, entrepreneurs and companies for them to try their novel ideas over
    a real-world environment where not only a real infrastructure is available but
    also a complete living lab has been created (i.e. real users, real policies, real
    impairments, etc.). The SmartSantander experimentation tier consists of various
    components (deployed services and applications, template applications or libraries)
    that facilitate the building of applications and services for experimentation
    with them. At this level, any experimenter might develop and deploy its own services
    (e.g., a website, a web service, a desktop application or a smartphone application)
    that interact with the platform through the Experimentation as a Service (EaaS)
    Application Programming Interfaces (API). All applications at this tier have to
    be authorized and users utilizing them (either experimenters or services’ users)
    can be authenticated and authorized to interact with the various services/assets
    exposed by the platform. On this level, SmartSantander’s facility provides a set
    of user interfaces that aims to facilitate the experimentation and co-creation
    activities: (1) a User Interface (UI) for discovering assets and the corresponding
    metadata associated to them like ranking and comments; (2) a portal for defining,
    managing and monitoring experiments during their life cycle; (3) Web and Smartphone
    Applications or Services for gathering annotations or any other data provided
    by the users; and (4) another UI for interacting with the different communities
    participating in each experiment. 2.2 Lessons Learnt From the experience that
    have been gathered throughout the years of evolution of the SmartSantander ecosystem,
    we discuss in the following sub-sections three aspects that are crucial for the
    development of smart cities. 2.2.1 Necessary Infrastructure Deployment The baseline
    fabric of a smart city is surely the infrastructure that it has deployed. In this
    respect, what is meant with a smart city is the creation of a system of systems
    that is conscious about itself and that can adapt to the situation dynamically.
    Basically, we want the city to behave as a smart living entity. For this to happen,
    it is necessary to have sensors that makes the system aware of what is going on
    in the city. Also actuators that receives the commands and modify its behaviour
    to optimize their performance. It is likewise necessary to have the networks that
    bring the information back and forward in a secure and reliable way and respecting
    the quality and grade of service required. Without this sensing, actuating and
    communicating infrastructure deployed, developing a smart city is simply not possible.
    However, as we have learnt from the experience gathered in Santander, two important
    aspects have to be observed during the necessary infrastructure deployment. Firstly,
    there is already a lot of infrastructure deployed in the city. It is possible
    that some of it could already be useful as the aforementioned smart city fabric.
    Other, might only need some adaptations to be part of it. In other words, most
    of the times it is not a clean-slate start when a city embarks itself into its
    smart transformation, thus, it is sensible to create a portfolio of “sensors”,
    “actuators” and “networks” that the city has. Secondly, it is not necessary that
    all the systems that encompass the city are equally smart (or even smart at all).
    Making all the city services smart at the same time is plainly non-sense. Gradual
    and cyclical infrastructure deployment is much more sensible. The infrastructure
    should be deployed according to the city priorities. Indeed, the procurement and
    physical deployment processes have a learning curve that is not negligible. 2.2.2
    Multi-stakeholder Ecosystem Creation Cities are complex ecosystems participated
    by many actors with heterogeneous backgrounds, interests and/or expertise. Thus,
    while the main responsible and policy regulator is the city administration, the
    deployment of a smart city has to observe this multi-stakeholder nature of the
    city. Moreover, in general, cities’ challenges are analogous globally. Thus, the
    ecosystem created for one city should be reproducible in another widening even
    more the scope and multilateralism of potential stakeholders. In the creation
    of this multi-stakeholder ecosystem, the adoption of a Smart City Platform (cf.
    Fig. 3) is fundamental. It should leverage interoperability technologies to aggregate
    the underlying heterogeneous infrastructure and enable service and application
    development independently of the information providers and the technologies that
    they use. Fig. 3 Smart City multi-stakeholder platform deployed at Santander Full
    size image The existing utilities and municipality infrastructures provide a first
    abstraction level in terms of resource management and data handling. Making use
    of IoT technologies [6], advantage is taken from the pervasive presence around
    the city of information sources and actuators belonging to the utilities. These
    elements interact with each other and cooperate with their neighbours to reach
    common goals. In this sense, by generating virtual instances of real physical
    objects, it is possible to deploy services and applications, characterized by
    a high degree of autonomous data capture, event transfer, network connectivity
    and interoperability [7]. However, they are mainly vertical systems that are exclusively
    tailored to the city service they are supporting. Hence, it is necessary to provide
    adequate mechanisms for added-value services creation and execution. In the city
    utilities application domain, this should enable new business opportunities for
    3rd parties that can reuse available city assets and existing services to create
    new ones with added value and thus generate new forms of revenue. The later requires
    changing data sharing policies and making data generated seamlessly available
    to 3rd parties. To facilitate such development and deployment, an open API [8]
    framework is included in the envisioned ecosystem as one of its integral parts
    of our architecture. On top of this abstraction level, a service information model
    (described through a service catalogue) is provided to allow extending the traditional
    utility use cases towards new business scenarios. Different services can be combined
    through the service federation concept either by service re-use (by sticking to
    modular service development practices) or through creation of service mash-up
    resulting in relevant savings in terms of the Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) and
    Operation Expenditure (OPEX). Further on, the service framework can be supported
    over cloud-enabled technologies thus allowing assignment of resources in an elastic
    way, driven by demand, meeting Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and providing flexibility
    in the business requirements (e.g. the end user only pays for actual use or ICT
    resources). 2.2.3 Open Ecosystem Openness have been addressed on two main axes
    that are critical for the success of the deployment of smart city solutions with
    a global scope in mind. Firstly, standardization is crucial in the sense of breaking
    vendor lock-in as well as city lock-in. The first lock-in situation avoidance
    refers to the need for usable standards and an interoperable vendor ecosystem
    for IoT-enabled smart city solutions so that cities do not have to commit to a
    specific solution so there are no dependencies on a single vendor. The latter
    one refers to the necessity of APIs for accessing streamed data from IoT infrastructures
    that homogenize the availability of data sources and underlying data formats.
    This way developers and providers of IoT-based smart city services can deploy
    and operate a service, which has been initially developed for one city, to another,
    thus getting benefit from the opportunities that come from economies of scale.
    Secondly, open APIs are equally important to guarantee that no lock-in situation
    is produced. FIWARE [9] is a large ecosystem providing standardized APIs used
    in open-source implementations of generic enablers based on open specifications.
    FIWARE is now at the centre of the Open and Agile Smart Cities (OASC) initiative
    [10]. oneM2M [11], on the other hand, provides a global standard for IoT common
    service functionalities that are used by the emerging IoT services and products.
    oneM2M and FIWARE are two powerful existing ecosystems that are worth the effort
    to make them interoperable [12]. Indeed, in Santander this interoperability has
    been granted and it is possible, nowadays, to develop applications [13] that can
    transparently consume data from platforms that use any of this technologies as
    baseline. 3 Future Challenges Despite the advances in the implementation and deployment
    of novel technologies towards the realization of the smart city paradigm, globally,
    and in the city of Santander in particular, this is not a completed endeavour.
    Surely, the current scenario has addressed some of the original objectives, but
    it has become evident that there are large possibilities of enhancement for creating
    smarter cities. Figure 4 summarizes the high-level framework to address the foreseen
    challenges and the establishment of novel business models based on the valuable
    data-streams that emanate from a full-blown smart city. The framework identifies
    the main tiers in which IoT-based smart city platforms are typically structured,
    namely IoT Infrastructure, IoT and Data Management and Data Marketplace. For each
    of these levels, key challenges and enabling technologies have been highlighted.
    Fig. 4 Smart City challenges high-level framework Full size image At the bottom
    layer, the IoT Infrastructure will be characterized by the heterogeneous communication
    technologies that will be available for best fitting the plethora of application
    domains. Additionally, muti-tenancy must be supported as the IoT deployments will
    come from both public and private domains and they should be handled under a common
    framework. Finally, distribution of infrastructure and intelligence is the only
    option to manage the complexity at this bottom layer. The second tier deals with
    the infrastructure management and more importantly with the data organization.
    On the one hand, it is of utmost importance that the underlying infrastructure
    is kept in good working order and guaranteeing this is not trivial considering
    its dimension and composition. On the other, the data produced has to be homogenized
    and its quality also guaranteed in order to make it easy and valuable to consume.
    Finally, the top layer handles the interaction with the services and applications
    that are based on the context information retrieved. The creation and maintenance
    of a data marketplace where data is organized in straightforwardly accessible
    offerings whose provenance and quality are systematically registered and guaranteed.
    Additionally, it has to provide the mechanisms to enable value exchanges among
    data providers and data consumers. These mechanisms have to be flexible enough
    to facilitate the adoption of different business models. Some of the challenges
    and development paths to implement this framework are depicted in the following
    sub-sections. 3.1 Adoption of Common APIs and Common Data Models Worldwide cities
    are involved in a digital revolution that will transform the way in which existing
    and new city systems are operated. However, optimizing the behaviour of any specific
    urban service has to be carried out taking into consideration the service itself
    as well as its interaction with adjacent services. This means that any solution
    aiming at achieving the autonomous city management paradigm is tightly coupled
    with the adoption of common frameworks, among in-city systems, which are able
    to guarantee systems interoperability. Furthermore, cities themselves are not
    isolated systems. They will interact one to the each other depending on different
    attributes. This implies that, eventually, optimizing some processes in one city
    without having in mind the adjacency to the others might result in inefficiencies
    [14]. Hence, interoperability among inter-city systems will become necessary.
    Not just in terms of pure optimization but also in terms of replicability. Moreover,
    it is necessary to highlight the multitude of actors that participate in the smart
    city services provision. This leads to heterogeneous service models and underlying
    infrastructure. In order to maximize the efficiency, exportability and horizontality
    of the cities digitalization, it is of utmost importance that the access to the
    data supporting the city services is homogenized, not only from a procedural viewpoint,
    but also from a syntactic and even semantic perspective. Standardization initiatives
    [15] as well as front-runner actors in the smart city ecosystem [9] are working
    on setting common APIs and data models that shall enable the necessary grounds
    for seamless data exchanges among data producers and data consumers. 3.2 Data,
    Network and Communications Reliability The next generation of communication networks
    and services, so-called 5G, will not only be an evolution of mobile broadband
    networks but it will also bring new unique network and service capabilities. Specifically,
    5G will be a key enabler for the Internet of Things by providing a platform to
    connect a massive number of sensors, rendering devices and actuators with stringent
    energy and transmission constraints. However, it is still open how to model these
    scenarios (mainly at the access network level), and which technologies (or combination
    of them) will be part of the future communication systems. 3.3 Data Marketplace
    In order to exploit data, the platform is required to provide data providers with
    means to decide and enforce how and with whom data is shared. In this sense, the
    data market place has to let data providers to define access policies based on
    both the particular data assets and the data consumer. In addition, considering
    the growing importance of data, such marketplace needs also to provide charging
    mechanisms, so that the data assets can be monetized. In this respect, pricing
    models are needed to assign cost to data assets. An appealing starting point can
    be the Black-Sholes model [16] used for options pricing modelling. Along with
    the different possibilities of sharing data, it is also necessary to provide different
    licensing levels and means for the data provider to ensure that a particular data
    asset is exploited under the negotiated conditions. Finally, it would be also
    desirable that the platform brings mechanisms to provide feedback concerning data
    quality, in order to implement reputation raking that can be afterwards exploited
    to better define the data sharing policies. 3.4 Opportunities Creation The vision
    of smart cities has been shaped, for long, by sales pitches of larger technology
    vendor and system integrators. Early “smart city 1.0” examples such as Masdar
    or Songdo have been technology- or marketing- driven rather than addressing typical
    operational and citizen needs. Other services often take the perspective of the
    city authorities, which is in many cases different from the one of the citizen.
    While there are significant cultural differences globally, from a European perspective,
    there is a lack of citizen voice in the current debate about IoT instrumentation.
    If smart city services are to make a real difference to citizens, and be accepted
    by the public, then citizens must play a strong role in their creation and design.
    Moreover, the smart city has to be promoted as a scenario where new business models
    are created around the exchange of data and the services that arise from this
    sharing. For example, cities are becoming the playground for the sharing economy
    [17]. The concentration of economic activity and ubiquity of technology in cities
    facilitate the rapid, location-based exchange of services and products among citizens
    (P2P), among businesses (B2B), and businesses to the crowd. Novel business concepts
    like the Commons Collaborative Economy [18] characterized by using data as the
    new key good for trading in the newly created digital marketplaces shall be able
    to: 1. Favour peer-to-peer relations -in contrast to the traditionally hierarchical
    command and contractual relationships. 2. Settle new value distribution and governance
    among the community of peers where profitability is not its main/unique driving
    force. 3. Leverage privacy-aware public infrastructure that results in the (generally)
    open access provision of commons resources that favour access, reproducibility
    and derivativeness. 3.5 Blockchain Technologies and its Impact on the Smart City
    Paradigm The first wave of smart city services have been predominantly developed
    around open data. Such data is in most cases shared if not considered sensitive,
    and the success of services developed on top is often only modest. Proprietary
    data sets such as IoT-generated data, closed organisational data or personal data
    have the potential to offer higher value for richer smart city services, but are
    not released for exploitation or not readily available. There is a lack of incentives,
    market confidence and trust for organisations and individuals to share new data
    sets as licensing models are not yet properly understood and developed, and key
    ecosystem foundation for such a market place are still missing. It is necessary
    to develop a security-by-design approach increasing the transparency of all the
    IoT asset governance flow shifting from the current paradigm of discrete centralized
    trusted authorities to a paradigm of liquid and decentralized trust of the network
    as a whole. In this shift, the creation of Blockchain platforms that can be employed
    following the “as a Service” paradigm will enable fully decentralised solutions
    delivering certified mechanisms to support the management of IoT devices, during
    their whole lifecycle. Blockchain-based distributed ledger concept offers provenance
    and quality of data guarantee, as well as reputation mechanisms for qualification
    of assets shared in a participatory fashion. The shifting from the current paradigm
    of discrete centralized trusted authorities to a paradigm of decentralized trust
    of the web as a whole responds to the consumers’ needs and to the providers’ demands.
    The first because they require reassurance of the data’s quality. The latter because
    they are reluctant to share some datasets due to uncertainty of how and for what
    purposes the data is used. 4 Conclusions Worldwide cities are involved in a digital
    transformation focused on sustainability and improving citizen’s quality of life.
    This digital transformation will make a reality the paradigm of an autonomous
    city meaning that relying on the massive amount of data as well as the appropriate
    machinery the city management platform will be able to run it near to the optimal
    operating point predicting any unexpected event making daily citizen''s life easier.
    While this paradigm of sustainability and efficiency has been always present for
    city administrators, digital transformation is opening new opportunities besides
    the optimization of the urban services that have been traditionally offer to its
    citizens (mobility, lighting, water distribution, waste management, etc.). Among
    these new opportunities, there is one, co-creation, with a large transformative
    potential from the economic and social viewpoint. Co-creation paradigm stands
    for the participatory creation of solutions and services among multiple stakeholders.
    In order to enable this scenario, cities have to set up a platform equipped with
    a set of highly intuitive tools and enablers that allow the design and implementation
    of novel services and, why not, so-called killer applications. For the platform
    to be valuable, it has to be fed by as many city assets, and the information that
    they generate, as possible. Moreover, it is of utmost importance to scale up the
    concept and federate such platform with other cities so that the creative process
    can be enriched and its impact enlarged. Another crucial aspect that has been
    highlighted is the need to include enablers associated to the incentives and rewards
    of participating, not only during the trial phases but also considering the long-term
    sustainability of the whole platform and smart city ecosystem. In this paper,
    we have reviewed the status of the SmartSantander ecosystem and the key features
    and lessons learnt through its evolution from a testbed for IoT experimentation
    to an open platform for co-creative innovation that is federated with other front-runner
    cities towards unleashing the potential of smart cities as social innovation hubs.
    Additionally, the challenges that have to be addressed in the short and medium
    term have been sketched. The path defined by these challenges is meant to establish
    a new economic model around the cities, bound to innovative exploitation of data
    exposed in a digital single market. References Balaji, S., Nathani, K., & Santhakumar,

    • A mapping framework is built connecting ReSOLVE with 4 IoT capabilities and
    6Rs. • IoT-enabled tracking and monitoring capabilities dominates Loop model.
    • Optimize model is related to ‘Reduce’ by monitoring and optimization of IoT.

    Abstract In recent years, circular business models (CBM) have become an inevitable
    requirement to foster improvements in environmental performance. However, the
    current literature rarely discusses the link between Internet of Things (IoT)
    and CBM. This paper first identifies four IoT capabilities including monitoring,
    tracking, optimization and design evolution for improving CBM performance based
    on the ReSOLVE framework. In a second step, a systematic literature review using
    the PRISMA approach analyzes how these capabilities contribute to 6 R and CBM
    through the CBM-6R and CBM-IoT cross-section heatmaps and relationship frameworks,
    followed by assessing the quantitative impacts of IoT on potential energy saving
    in CBM. Finally, challenges are analyzed for the realization of IoT-enabled CBM.
    The results show that the assessments of Loop and Optimize business models dominate
    current studies. IoT plays a significant role in these business models respectively
    through tracking, monitoring and optimization capabilities. While (quantitative)
    case studies for Virtualize, Exchange and Regenerate CBM are substantially needed.
    IoT holds the potential to reduce energy consumption by around 20–30% for referenced
    applications in the literature. However, the IoT hardware, software and protocol
    energy consumption, interoperability, security and financial investment might
    become main obstacles for the wider use of IoT in CBM. Previous article in issue

    concepts and a brief history of the IoT Since the birth of the internet in the
    early 1980s, attempts have been made to connect “Things” with the internet. In
    1990, John Romkey created the first Internet ‘device’, a toaster that could be
    turned on and off via the Internet (Romkey, 2017). Paul Saffo gave the first brief
    description of sensors and how they could be used in connection with the internet
    in 1997 (Saffo, 1997). To describe this growing connection of sensors and similar
    devices providing real-time information via the internet, in 1999 the term “Internet
    of Things” was coined by Kevin Ashton, who was working in supply chain optimization
    and invented a new technology called Radio-frequency identification (RFID)-based
    item identification in the same year (Suresh et al., 2014). In 2003, Walmart deployed
    RFID in all its shops across the globe to measure product stocks and sales and
    support supply chain management (Harold, 2007). In 2005, International Telecommunication
    Union (ITU, 2005) regarded the IoT as a third wave of the world''s information
    industry transformation. In 2008, the Federal Communications Commission approved
    the usage of the “white space spectrum” (Suresh et al., 2014). Later, IT giants
    like Cisco, IBM and Ericsson took a lot of educational and commercial initiatives
    with IoT. Some countries, like China, listed the IoT as a strategic emerging technology
    in their long-term plans (MIIT, 2012). The IoT technology can be simply explained
    as a connection between humans - computers - things. It uses RFID, infrared sensors,
    global positioning systems, laser scanners and other information-sensing equipment
    to connect any item under internet protocol (IP) with a unique IP address for
    information exchange and communication, which can achieve intelligent positioning,
    tracking, monitoring and management of items. The systems architecture can, for
    instance, be based on the context of operations and processes in real-time scenarios.
    For instance, in a smart home, every electrical switch box could be connected
    with a smart phone so that it could be operated remotely. The HarmonyOS system
    recently created by Huawei uses full stack decoupling architecture that could
    even solve constraints issues on the boundary of software and hardware, thus making
    it possible for other collaborators to join the system (Chen and Matt, 2021).
    Altogether, the application boundary of the IoT has been expanded considerably.
    Such a scenario does not need a processor and a storage device installed in every
    switch box. It just needs a sensor to capture signals and process them (mostly
    switching ON/OFF). 1.2. Potentials by IoT technologies in CE in a finite world
    Avoiding overshooting of planetary boundaries for climate change (Rockström et
    al., 2009) and switching to more sustainable practices are among the greatest
    challenges of the 21st century. Any approach to reduce pressures requires simultaneous
    consideration of economic, social, and especially environmental aspects of industrial
    processes, as well as respective interactions along cradle-to-grave value chains
    of products and services (Ren et al., 2013). Important strategies to reduce critical
    raw material use are sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) and circular usage
    of products and materials (Manavalan and Jayakrishna, 2019). Seuring and Müller
    (2008) defined SSCM as “the management of material, information and capital flows
    as well as cooperation among companies along the supply chain, while taking goals
    from all three dimensions – environmental, economic and social into account which
    are derived from customer and stakeholder requirements.” Circularity adds a different
    perspective to SSCM as it tries to keep substances in closed loops. Unlike a linear
    economy that is based on a “take-make-dispose” model, CE promotes longevity, reparability,
    durability and recyclability of products with the aim of a full re-use of resources
    (Elisha, 2020). It therefore symbolizes a linear to loop transition for supply
    chains in sustainability (Schröder et al., 2019). In the industry 4.0 (I4.0) era,
    the IoT offers opportunities to foster CE in value chains through real-time monitoring
    of the resources inventory (Mohammadian, 2019). It can support the minimization
    of waste flows through product lifetime detection. As consequence material reuse
    and recycling processes can be optimized. In summary, IoT promotes a highly accurate,
    efficient and sound use of resources aimed at the shift from disposable to renewable
    resources paradigm, and facilitates the born and development of CBM (Ghisellini
    et al., 2016; Nižetić et al., 2020). Therefore, progress of IoT-enabled CBM has
    attracted academic researches, which have recently assessed the impact of I4.0
    technologies such as IoT on CBM with different conclusions (Rosa et al., 2019,
    2020). They discussed CBM and IoT from economic, social and environmental perspectives
    (Govindan and Hasanagic, 2018; Ding et al., 2023). Rejeb et al. (2022) reviewed
    how the IoT provides contributions and challenges in the CBM domain. They identified
    important drivers and provided a structured framework that exploring business
    and management-focused CE strategies based on IoT technologies. However, there
    is still a large gap between theory and practice (Gorissen et al., 2016). In particular,
    most small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are encountering unprecedented pressure
    to improve environmental performance. Since the adoption cost of the IoT could
    be tremendous, they might hesitate to seize IoT-enabled emission reduction opportunities
    based on their specific status (Ding et al., 2023; Awan et al., 2022a). This requires
    an in-depth understanding of the IoT capabilities and the characteristics of different
    CBMs to find their best intersection point. Besides, the circularity of IoT devices
    themselves should also be considered (Beier et al., 2018). Given these research
    gaps this paper addresses the following research questions. i) What are the (synergy)
    contributions of IoT capabilities under different CBM? ii) What are the carbon
    emission reduction potentials of the IoT in different CBM? iii) What are the obstacles
    for SMEs to adopt IoT in promoting circular strategies? The contributions of this
    paper are as follows: We used a pre-defined circular business framework (ReSOLVE)
    developed by Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF, 2015) to analyze the CBM-IoT context
    and linked it to 6 R principles to specifically map the IoT capabilities into
    each business practices. This visualizes how IoT contributes differently in each
    business model and provides information for us to describe the relationship between
    IoT capabilities, 6 R and CBM. Additionally, we quantitatively review the literature
    on how IoT can contribute to reducing environmental impacts under CBM and identify
    their obstacles. This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 introduces the Prisma
    methodology we used as the method for the literature review, and the reasoning
    of paper selection. Section 3 reviews IoT''s role in CE, introduces the capabilities
    of IoT correlated with CBM and identifies its environmental opportunities. Section
    4 reflects on potential obstacles for IoT adjustment in CBM. Section 5 comprehensively
    summarizes our findings and concludes. Finally, section 6 outlines limitations
    and gives recommendations for future research. 2. Review approach: Prisma 2.1.
    Introduction of Prisma In June 2022, we conducted a literature search based on
    the checklist framework provided by the PRISMA-P guidelines (Moher et al., 2015).
    PRISMA was initially used in the medical field. Although other methods for conducting
    literature reviews and meta-analyses are available (Horvathova, 2012; Luederitz
    et al., 2016), PRISMA guidelines have become widely accepted as an approach to
    conduct transparent literature reviews. Recently they have been applied in the
    field of sustainability and CE research (Blanco et al., 2020; Jin et al., 2019;
    Zalk and Behrens, 2018; Aguilar-Hernandez et al., 2021). The latest PRISMA Abstract
    2020 (Page et al., 2021a, Page et al., 2021b) suggests discussing 5 main items
    in relation to 10 subcategories in a review. We refer to the checklist items listed
    in Table 1. Table 1. Major steps in Prisma Abstract 2020 (Page et al., 2021a,
    Page et al., 2021b). Section and Topic Item # Checklist item TITLE Title 1 Identify
    the report as a systematic review. BACKGROUND Objectives 2 Provide an explicit
    statement of the main objectives or questions. METHODS Eligibility criteria 3
    Specify the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the review. Information sources
    4 Specify the information sources (e.g., databases, search terms) used to identify
    studies. Risk of bias 5 Specify the methods used to assess risk of bias in the
    studies included. Synthesis of results 6 Specify the methods used to present and
    synthesize results. RESULTS Included studies 7 Give the total number of studies
    included and participants and summarize relevant characteristics of the studies.
    Synthesis of results 8 Present results for main outcomes, preferably indicating
    the number of studies included and participants for each. If a meta-analysis was
    carried out, report the summary estimate and confidence/credible interval. If
    comparing groups, indicate the direction of the effect (i.e., which group is favoured).
    DISCUSSION Limitations of evidence 9 Provide a brief summary of the limitations
    of the evidence included in the review (e.g., study risk of bias, inconsistency
    and imprecision). Interpretation 10 Provide a general interpretation of the results
    and important implications. These categories explain the search objectives and
    eligibility criteria, including the methods and reasons for including and excluding
    certain records (i.e. some papers do not contain the keywords checked for but
    have keywords with similar meanings, some papers contain the keywords but do not
    explain them in detail). Second, it describes the steps of the quantitative analysis,
    which includes collecting data from selected publications and harmonizing their
    values. Based on this framework, this literature review was conducted. 2.2. Classification
    of papers We use the 6 R concept (Joshi et al., 2006) to initially classify circularity
    strategies and related business models, as shown in Fig. 1. The 6 R concept discerns
    Reuse, Recycle, Reduce, Repair, Remanufacture and Redesign. Sihvonen and Ritola
    (2015) regarded the 6 R framework as the operational approaches and core principles
    of CE. Report of Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF, 2013) pointed out that discovering
    new paths to support CE under 6 R guidance – “an industrial system that is restorative
    or regenerative by intention and design” is becoming more and more vital against
    the background of Industrial 4.0 era. From a systems perspective, the combination
    of six operational approaches (6 R) enables new business models of CE at the macro
    level (Kirchherr et al., 2017). Download : Download high-res image (451KB) Download

    Based on these characteristics, the ReSOLVE framework further explains CE -- Preserve
    and enhance natural capital, optimize resource yields and foster system effectiveness,
    and classifies circular models based on the economic and resource impacts of major
    sectors (EMF, 2015). It offers a tool for generating circular strategies and growth
    initiatives. Jabbour et al. (2018) then connected Industry 4.0 technologies to
    six CBM proposed by the ReSOLVE framework, namely Regenerating, Share, Optimize,
    Loop, Virtualize and Exchange, to guide organizations through implementing the
    principles of the CE (EMF, 2015), as shown in Table 2. Most technologies own opportunities
    in specific areas, while the IoT can play a significant role to make such business
    models viable (Jabbour et al., 2018). Table 2. Explanation of six business models
    in ReSOLVE framework. Business models Explanation Regenerate This business model
    is based on a shift to renewable energy and materials. Biological cycles are used
    to enable the circulation of energy and materials, and to convert organic waste
    into sources of energy and raw material for other chains. Share Assets are shared
    between individuals (peer-to-peer sharing of privately owned products or public
    sharing of a pool of products). As a consequence, products should be designed
    to last longer by the producers, and maintenance should be available to allow
    the re-use and extension of product life. Optimize This business model requires
    organizations to use digital manufacturing technologies, such as IoT, automation,
    and big data to reduce waste in production systems across supply chains. As a
    result, organizations will benefit from increased performance. Loop This business
    model aims to promote the circularity of raw materials and energy. The design,
    production, and supply chain therefore have to be adjusted from the perspective
    of the entire life cycle. Virtualize This business model is service-focused which
    replaces physical with virtual and dematerialized products. Exchange It involves
    substituting old and non-renewable goods for advanced and renewable ones. While
    the exact terminology to describe IoT-related capabilities varies under different
    scenarios, we synthesized core capabilities of the technology as found in literature.
    Ingemarsdotter et al. (2019) suggests that IoT''s can support the development
    of circular business models via capabilities such as tracking, monitoring, control,
    optimization and design evolution, and stated that optimization often relies on
    the use of control capability. Therefore, we incorporated the control capability
    into optimization to reduce the list of relevant IoT capabilities to four, as
    shown in Table 3. Table 3. IoT capabilities that can support implementation of
    the ReSOLVE framework. IoT capabilities Definition of functions Tracking Available
    information for products'' identity, location, or unique composition. Monitoring
    Available information for products'' real-time condition, or environment. This
    includes alerts and notifications. Optimization Goal-based improvements of operations
    are controlled and optimized by using advanced algorithms. Design Evolution The
    design of a product can be upgraded based on data feedback from other lifecycle
    phases. This includes functional or routing upgrades. 2.2.1. Selection of papers
    On the basis of the discussion above, in order to systematically review the contribution
    of the IoT to circular economy business models, we used the following terms as
    a basis for the literature search in a Boolean operation -- Title, Abstract, Keyword
    = [“internet of things” AND (“circular economy” OR “circular business model” OR
    “sustainable supply chain”)]. In total, there were 432 papers available on Scopus
    and 142 papers available on Web of Science (WoS). We excluded duplicate records
    and papers that have no relation to any elements of the 6 R through browsing abstracts.
    Then, we further excluded papers with non-CBM descriptions discerned in the RESOLVE
    framework after browsing the full texts. In this way, 59 papers were retained
    to explore the contribution of the IoT to CBM, see Fig. 2. Download : Download
    high-res image (615KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Flowchart of
    selected publications in the review (status in June 2022). Then, a quantitative
    analysis of how the IoT reduces environmental impacts in CBM was conducted. For
    this, from the included papers we acquired 23 results that a) quantified impacts
    on energy-related indicators in circular economy (e.g., energy use or CO2 emissions)
    and b) compared these impacts before and after using IoT technology. 3. Review:
    impacts of the IoT on CBM 3.1. Descriptive results The retrieved 59 papers used
    for describing the contribution of the IoT to CBM can be categorized by journal,
    year of publication, and sector/application. Fig. 3 shows the number of articles
    published in different journals under the given search term and constraints. The
    number of papers published in the Journal of Cleaner Production, Sustainability
    and Computers in Industry appears to dominate. These journals make up 25.5% of
    the total share, which is much higher than that of other journals. The core fields
    covered by these journals include computer science, engineering and environmental
    science. The number of papers has increased significantly over time. Publications
    in the last 3 years occupy exceed 2/3 of the total share, which indicates a growing
    interest on this topic. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. Numbers of IoT publications in different types of journals.
    Next, we use the framework developed by Maroli et al. (2021) to classify 59 papers
    into 4 major categories: reviews, theory studies, new designs and case studies.
    Reviews include pure review articles that classify and summarize previous studies.
    Theory studies generally analyze and discuss the proposed new framework for specific
    issues mainly based on surveying experts (Delphi) or questionnaires. New designs
    imply the development of a new mathematical model or a new protocol design for
    an IoT solution but without a real case to verify factual feasibility. Case studies
    further calculate or simulate the case and obtain reference results based on real
    or defined cases compared with the new design. A brief supplementary description
    of each article is also attached to this table to provide an overview of each
    research division. These classified papers are then categorized into six business
    models suggested by ReSOLVE framework (EMF, 2015). As shown in Fig. 4. Download

    Division of publications into the 6 ReSOLVE categories of CE business models.
    Over 60% of the papers describe the contribution of IoT to Loop and Optimize models.
    Both of these two models have higher potential impacts on manufacturing, transportation
    and storage, and IoT could thus promote significant business transformation within
    these sectors (EMF, 2015). As for Optimize, IoT helps to realize smart manufacturing
    and SSCM through improving decision-making plans to reduce the consumption of
    energy and resources. Most of the theoretical studies here explored and developed
    frameworks for low carbon footprints in different industries based on IoT capabilities
    of collecting, processing information more efficiently (Gružauskas et al., 2018;
    Chit et al., 2021; Ghoreishi and Happonen, 2022; Jagtap et al., 2021). The limited
    number of cases and new designs are usually process optimizations in enterprises,
    where IoT is used to develop intelligent production scheduling and logistics delivery
    models to promote green and sustainable development of intelligent manufacturing
    (Liao and Wang, 2019). In the Loop business model, most studies focused on waste
    management. Here, IoT is mainly used to realize waste collection optimization
    and more accuracy of decision support system for end-life products recycling (Bányai
    et al., 2019; Velvizhi et al., 2020; Al-Masri et al., 2018). Some theoretical
    studies designed CE–IoT-enabled ecosystems based on key enabling IoT technologies
    (Miaoudakis et al., 2020). Others combined it with LCA model to aid their processes
    of designing new products with low environmental impact (Zhang et al., 2020; de
    Oliveira and Soares, 2017). New designs and case studies validated IoT-enabled
    solutions based on products with different technical route characteristics, such
    as plastic waste and scrapped cars (Plakas et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2018), etc.
    Though the proportion of case studies is relatively low, only 11%. The remaining
    four business models account for only a small part of the articles. Among them,
    the sharing model generally relies on online platforms or apps supported by IoT,
    which brings the channel for products or information sharing between different
    stakeholders (Mastos et al., 2020). Virtualize and Exchange models usually demands
    extra technologies such as virtual world tools, digital twin (DT) and 3D printers
    to realize (Gustafson-Pearce and Grant, 2017; Despeisse et al., 2017; Rocca et
    al., 2020). 3.2. Connection of ReSOLVE framework with 6 R and IoT capabilities
    We further classified the papers in a number of matrices, considering the 6 R,
    IoT capabilities and Circular Business Model (CBM) categories discussed in section
    2. This results in a ‘heat map’ of the occurrences of CBM-IoT and CBM-6R cross-sections
    within the sample of 59 papers, see Fig. 5. Many papers describe multiple CBM-IoT
    and CBM-6R cross-sections. It should further be noted that while the categories
    are uniquely defined, they are not mutually exclusive. Below, we explored patterns
    for each of the CBM. 1. Loop business model Download : Download high-res image
    (399KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Heat map of the CBM-6R and
    CBM-IoT cross-section occurrences. The findings show that IoT-enabled ‘Recycle’
    dominates, followed by ‘Remanufacture’ and ‘Repair’. Papers displaying Loop usually
    rely on tracking or monitoring capabilities, while optimization and design evolution
    are relatively unexplored. In terms of recycling, remanufacturing, and repairing,
    the adoption of novel Internet-based transactions can exploit information for
    faster and more sustainable collection of post-consumption products, they can
    be tracked using sensors, RFID tags, and barcodes (Al-Masri et al., 2018). As
    a consequence, organizations are able to remanufacture, or recycle components
    of products and packaging (Vanderroost et al., 2017; Gligoric et al., 2019). In
    line with the Redesign prospect, product designers need to incorporate environmental
    criteria into their design decisions. They can obtain data from an IoT-based product
    life cycle management system to aid their processes of sustainable design and
    development (Zhang et al., 2020; Chit et al., 2021; de Oliveira and Soares, 2017).
    Typical cases are listed in Table 4. 2. Optimize business model Table 4. Illustration
    of the use of IoT capabilities in the Loop model. IoT capabilities Representative
    examples Tracking A research project called POIROT, which exploits IoT technologies,
    aiming to realize a platform for the traceability of organic waste and transform
    it into inert, odorless and sanitized material (De Fazio et al., 2019). Monitoring
    An IoT-enabled decision support system for a CE model that addresses the uncertainty
    of a product''s residual value based on the life cycle monitored from the IoT
    sensors (Mboli et al., 2020). Optimization A system that combines intelligent
    transportation systems (RFIDs, sensors, cameras, actuators and surveillance systems)
    and an advanced decision system (incorporating data sharing between truck drivers
    in real time to perform dynamic route optimization) for efficient waste collection
    (Velvizhi et al., 2020). Most of the papers exploring Optimize models are highly
    related to IoT-enabled ‘Reduce’, which is mainly realized by monitoring and optimization
    capabilities, as shown in Appendix figure A1. Through data monitoring from processes
    and agents such as machines, the IoT increases the possibility of identifying
    potential failures, and predictive maintenance can reduce the waste of non-performing
    products (Venkatesh et al., 2020; Laskurain-Iturbe et al., 2021). Additionally,
    based on the demands of the production and consumption of resources, managers
    could monitor and Optimize production rates and the use of sensors as well as
    algorithms would enable them to automatically intervene in processes to reduce
    intermediate inventory (Ghoreishi and Happonen, 2022; Roy and Roy 2019; Awan et
    al., 2022b). The IoT with the combination of cloud computing and machine learning
    provides potential for complex and integrated data-driven process manufacturing
    models in terms of robustness and accuracy (Fisher et al., 2020). Typical cases
    are listed in Table 5. 3. Share business model Table 5. Illustration of the use
    of IoT capabilities in the Optimize model. IoT capabilities Representative examples
    Tracking RFID technology to tag and track fresh milk could reduce the amount of
    product shrinkage (Bottani et al., 2014). Monitoring Based on IoT sensors, energy
    and cost savings will be achieved as long as the state of the ideal ball mill
    is specifically analyzed and extended to the other ball mills. (Ma et al., 2020).
    Optimization Each node (including suppliers, wholesalers and retailers) could
    be involved in managing and optimizing its own performance in terms of production,
    deliveries and environmental compliance by using RFID tags and wireless sensor
    networks (Hofmann and Rüsch, 2017; Hasanova and Romanovs, 2020). Monitoring and
    tracking are main capabilities of IoT that contribute to sharing business model,
    they help in the product ‘Resign’ and ‘Recycle’ in order to achieve product lifetime
    extension, as shown in Appendix figure A2. Information on consumers'' behavior
    is collected through websites and apps, organizations can therefore both improve
    product design and provide a digital service for better utilization or replacement
    of equipment, and increase customer satisfaction (Rymaszewska et al., 2017; Ingemarsdotter
    et al., 2020). Moreover, the use of sensors in products allows performance monitoring
    - for instance, monitoring maintenance requirements - thereby allowing organizations
    to proactively provide a high quality of service to customers. As a consequence
    of monitoring products during consumer use, organizations can invest in extending
    product life spans by applying the 3Rs strategy (repair, reuse, and recycle).
    Typical cases are listed in Table 6. 4. Virtualize business model Table 6. Illustration
    of the use of IoT capabilities in the Share model. IoT capabilities Representative
    examples Tracking Cranfield University launched a shoe recycling project: it includes
    the design of an intelligent component (IoT) that tracks the condition of the
    shoes and identifies the need for replacement/upgrading. The modular design of
    the shoes allows them to be easily disassembled for refurbishing or recycling
    (Nobre and Tavares, 2017). Monitoring A cross-company IoT communication protocol
    has the potential to offer an automated negotiation ecosystem between scrap metal
    producers and waste collecting companies based on cost, demand etc. (Mastos et
    al., 2020). Optimization IoT helps to achieve a mutual visible inventory under
    business-to-business e-commerce models in real time, where average food inventory,
    amount of food waste, frequency of lateral inventory share and ordering from the
    main depot; customer service level in the network is optimized (Ekren et al.,
    2021). Since service is a core focus of Virtualize, using real-time data to monitor
    supply activities is important to enhance the customer experience. It also triggers
    the potential of IoT-enabled “Redesign” of the product or service with the help
    of design evolution capability. Through virtually designing, simulating, and optimizing
    the system and converting it on the real world, it is possible to achieve system
    reconfigurability through a change of both specific hardware (i.e., change of
    robot tools for disassembly activities), and software resources (i.e., robot program
    coding) (Sassanelli et al., 2021). The IoT enables connections between organizations,
    suppliers, and customers in order to offer services rather than physical products
    (Jabbour et al., 2018). In addition, the IoT is able to collect information on
    consumers’ behavior and features of past designs, which designers can use to improve
    service quality. Typical cases are listed in Table 7. 5. Exchange business model
    Table 7. Illustration of the use of IoT capabilities in the Virtualize model.
    IoT capabilities Representative examples Monitoring Gustafson-Pearce and Grant
    (2017) tested 3D Virtual World tools with multiple sources of ‘streamed’ data
    generated by IoT, to discover whether knowledge sharing and learning within a
    horizontal supply chain was effective and reduced greenhouse gas emissions related
    to business travel. Design evolution A platform that combines hybrid IoT and blockchain
    to provide interactive innovation in prefabricated housing construction among
    shareholders, who were involved in life-cycle value co-design via online channels
    (e.g., mobile apps) (Li et al., 2021). A platform installing IoT devices in a
    smart building to measure energy consumption and provide energy optimization consulting
    services for end-users and building managers (Sharma et al., 2021). IoT could
    provide a scenario of experience shopping from a mirror image, aiming to solve
    the distortion of consumer''s experience in traditional online shopping (Gao and
    Han, 2021). IoT integrates the manufacturing execution system (MES) to the DT
    by using a communication protocol, which is able to give commands to the MES from
    external sources and digitalize the CE practices (Rocca et al., 2020). This model
    could acquire strength by adopting additive manufacturing and IoT systems with
    monitoring capability (Despeisse et al., 2017). 3D printers are able to process
    renewable and sustainable production. Based on interaction between organizations
    and customers, some companies are able to manufacture customized products by using
    databases incorporating 3D printers, where IoT helps to save time and material
    use in additive manufacturing. These kinds of functions make IoT easier to achieve
    CE principles. Typical cases are listed in Table 8. 6. Regenerate business model
    Table 8. Illustration of the use of IoT capabilities in the Exchange model. IoT
    capabilities Representative examples Monitoring The additive manufacturing leads
    to reduced use of material, IoT-enabled 3D printers enable the recycling of small
    quantities of waste (Despeisse et al., 2017). Optimization IoTs are used for the
    identification of engineered disassemblers as well as the real-time status of
    reproducible resources to build efficient multi-target production planning in
    real-time by the seed swarm optimization algorithm (Chau et al., 2021). The model
    could benefit from IoT in the form of sensors and networks. The design, production
    and supply decisions of CE could be adjusted based on data provided by IoT (EMF,
    2016). This would make it possible to reduce unnecessary resource consumption
    to improve the productivity of harvests, and to extend the life cycle of the land
    use. Typical cases are listed in Table 9. Table 9. Illustration of the use of
    IoT capabilities in the Regenerate model. IoT capabilities Representative examples
    Monitoring To monitor, and control factors related to land management between
    crop rotation, to automate irrigation systems based on weather conditions in real
    time, and to manage the use of pesticides according to the health of plantations
    (EMF Report of Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2016). Optimization IoT allows real-time
    measurement of ceramic tile production, providing the capability to modify the
    composition of the ceramic bodies and the transport mix to maximize the use of
    local raw materials, reducing the distances between mines and the factory and
    by favoring rail transport (Garcia-Muiña et al., 2019). In all, the concept of
    6 R is gradually supported by IoT technology. It promotes the combination of 6
    R in different circular business practices (Kirchherr et al., 2017; Spaltini et
    al., 2021), and each business model represents a major circularity opportunity
    enabled by the IoT technology that is quite different from growth in the linear
    economy. Therefore, we selected main contributors of 6 R and CBM from the ‘heat
    map’ results, and then constructed a relationship framework that containing the
    conceptualization of 4 IoT capabilities, 6 R and ReSOLVE framework, as shown in
    Fig. 6. Download : Download high-res image (341KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. Relationship framework for IoT enabled 6 R and CBM. As for IoT capabilities,
    the monitoring plays a significant role, which promotes most circular business
    models by jointly facilitating all 6Rs, followed by the optimization capability.
    And for the intermediate nodes of 6 R actions, Recycle and Redesign are the core
    CE principles linking upstream IoT capabilities and downstream circular strategies.
    In different ways, these actions all increase the utilization of physical assets,
    prolong their life, and shift resource use from finite to renewable sources. They
    potentially reinforce and accelerate the performance of the other actions, creating
    a compounding effect. 3.3. Quantitative analysis of how the use of IoT in CBMs
    reduces energy-related environmental impacts Within the collected papers, 20 papers
    provide quantitative data on how the use of IoT in CBMs can reduce environmental
    impacts. These papers provide 23 cases. We included them in our quantitative analysis
    for they mainly use energy savings as the primary measurement. Fig. 7 depicts
    how much energy is saved by using IoT in the six ReSOLVE business model categories
    (Virtualize is missing due to lack of data). The X-axis shows the ReSOLVE business
    model categories and their number of samples in each. The Y-axis represents the
    relative energy savings compared to a baseline scenario without IoT enhancement
    (i.e., the energy use in the baseline is set on 100%). Supplementary Table 2 contains
    a list of cases and their references. 1. Optimize business model Download : Download
    high-res image (240KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Relative energy
    saving under different IoT-enabled CBM (CI = 95%). Most results show quantitative
    data from the Optimize business model (11 results). Here, big data of related
    resource objects is collected using IoT sensors. The resource allocation framework
    is then optimized using heuristic algorithms for specific consumption habits to
    prevent any unwanted negative environmental impact in scheduling issues (Liao
    and Wang, 2019). 2. Loop business model 6 results consider the Loop business model.
    IoT solutions enable the transition to a cyber-physical1 waste management system,
    and provide real-time information on waste generation, treatment, transportation,
    and material handling capacity in big random systems. Carbon emissions from collected
    and transported waste have been significantly reduced due to enhanced recycling
    (Velvizhi et al., 2020). 3. Share business model 4 results discuss the Share business
    model, where IoT lowers energy and resource waste in corporate processes by sharing
    information, products or services (Ekren et al., 2021). For instance, IoT facilitates
    the recording of food expiration dates and facilitates communal food sharing (Phiri
    and Trevorrow, 2019). 4. Regenerate and Exchange business model The Regenerate
    and Exchange models each have a single case. In Regenerate model, IoT is utilized
    for the identification of engineered disassemblers and the real-time status of
    regenerable resources in order to construct effective multi-target production
    planning (Garcia-Muiña et al., 2019). While in Exchange model, IoT assists in
    modifying the composition of the ceramic bodies and the transport mix to maximize
    the utilization of local raw materials (Chau et al., 2021). The effects of relative
    energy savings in the Optimize and Loop business models are evident and comparable,
    with corresponding mean value of 30% and 25%. It may be attributed to the parallels
    of the two models in leveraging IoT capabilities. With the difference that Optimize
    model utilizes more on the optimization capabilities, which may provide it with
    higher energy saving potential. Some measures in the Optimize model could even
    achieve energy savings of up to 70%. But the effect of the Share business model
    is highly variable, ranging from less than 20%–80%, with the majority of results
    falling closer to the lower end. The results of the remaining three models are
    limited. Nevertheless, they present oppotunities for further investigation. 4.
    Environmental drawbacks and other obstacles to the use of IoT in CBMs While reviewing
    the literature, as described above we found many ways of how IoT could support
    the implementation of circular CBMs. However, some of these references also highlighted
    environmental risks of IoT, or other obstacles to implementing and using IoT.
    These findings including related references are discussed below, and Table 10
    summarizes them. Table 10. Environmental drawbacks and other obstacles to the
    implementation of IoT. Type Drawbacks and obstacles Environmental Use of harmful
    substances and non-degradable resources Hardware power consumption IoT node software
    energy consumption IoT protocol energy efficiency Other Lack of standardization
    and technological knowledge among partners Data availability High financial investment
    Security of virtual platform Inadequate internet connectivity 4.1. Environmental
    drawbacks One of the drawbacks of IoT-enabled business models includes the energy
    use of IoT and related carbon emissions, such as IoT hardware, node software and
    protocol energy consumption (Fraga-Lamas et al., 2021). Hardware is the basis
    for the IoT network, and both hardware and software needs to be optimized together
    to re duce environmental burdens. Such optimizations are particularly important
    for certain digital signal processing tasks, including compression, feature extraction,
    or machine learning training. The IoT is also dependent on protocols that enable
    communicating between the various nodes and routing devices involved in an IoT
    network. In terms of software implementation, these protocols must be energy-efficient
    and should minimize the use of communication interfaces. Next to this, IoT equipment
    may result in difficult to process electronic waste. An example consists of RFID
    tags that are hazardous to the environment and are difficult to recycle (Yu et
    al., 2022). Another concern is that IoT enables mass customization. Customization
    makes it more difficult for another user to reuse or recycle an item (Birkel et
    al., 2019). A key observation is that many studies do not take into account such
    environmental drawbacks of implementing IoT technology (i.e., the impact of producing
    or using IoT devices, etc.). Some preliminary analyses have been presented in
    the literature. For instance, Mataloto et al. (2019) discovered that IoT devices
    (LoRa) for energy management systems require an annual energy usage of 5.2 kWh
    if applied in small buildings (16–40 m2). Bottani et al. (2014) assessed the environmental
    performance and burdens of the use of RFID tags in a fresh milk supply chain based
    on life cycle assessment (LCA) and found that the environmental costs of 1 million
    RFID tags are 32,900 kg CO2-eq in climate change potential, 23.9 kg P-eq in freshwater
    eutrophication, and 156 molc H + -eq in acidification potential. Comparatively
    to the existing studies, there is a dearth of papers that examine the positive
    and negative contributions of IoT to CBM via case studies or simulations. This
    involves not only a full examination of its production, transportation, disposal,
    and reuse synergies, but also an evaluation of the LCA of IoT components. 4.2.
    Other obstacles Next to environmental drawbacks the literature we reviewed gave
    some more general implementation obstacles with regard to the use of IoT in CBMs.
    Firstly, there is often a lack of structured data management processes to ensure
    the acquisition of high-quality data for industrial analysis (Ingemarsdotter et
    al., 2020). Due to the limited availability and variety of industrial data, evaluating
    and validating representative models of real-world systems can be difficult, i.e.,
    determining when sufficient data has been acquired to ensure the representativeness
    of a simulation framework. (Fisher et al., 2020). Secondly, the absence of standardization
    and guidance in implementing IoT across various businesses poses a concern. There
    can be a lack of regulations addressing data ownership among stakeholders (Astill
    et al., 2019). The wide implementation of CE strategies is contingent upon solving
    such data ownership issues. Thirdly, ensuring privacy and data security poses
    a challenge (Roy and Roy, 2019). End-users as intermediate nodes in the manufacturing
    and remanufacturing cycle and vulnerable firewall nodes can be susceptible to
    botnet assaults (Tuptuk and Hailes, 2018). One typical case is the IoT botnet
    Mirai, a malware that could target consumer electronics and home routers, turning
    them into a zombie remotely controlled bots that can be used in large-scale network
    attacks (Antonakakis et al., 2017). Such challenges may be solved by IoT projects
    funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research program, it includes the
    European Cloud Initiative, the GAIA-X initiative, as well as public-private partnerships
    such as the Smart Networks and Services JU and the AI, Big Data and Robotics (Calisti,
    2020). These projects are expected to use distributed AI, address security, privacy
    and trust requirements by design and allow for new de-centralized topologies and
    governance. In addition, it is challenging to rapidly design IoT-enabled products
    for interoperability, adaptability, and upgradability (Ingemarsdotter et al.,
    2020). Currently, potential solutions tend to point at blockchain technology.
    However, integrating blockchain within the IoT framework will also pose technical,
    infrastructure, energy consumption, interoperability and social regulatory issues
    (Feng et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Venkatesh et al., 2020). The last impediment
    are the limited resources small-scale enterprises can invest systematically in
    IoT technologies throughout their entire supply chains (Tan et al., 2020). 5.
    Conclusion and outlook This review has assessed the state-of-the-art relation
    of IoT and CBM from several perspectives. Based on the Prisma approach, this article
    reviews the literature on the IoT and CBMs that has been expanding significantly
    in recent years. Through the classification of their methods and contents, this
    paper constructed a mapping framework connecting the ReSOLVE concept with four
    IoT capabilities and the 6 R framework. It depicts the current research status
    of IoT supported CBMs and explains their contribution for enterprises from the
    perspective of 6 R with representative cases. IoT by its support of joint interoperability
    for system optimization, timely monitoring and tracking, has contributed to the
    enhancement of industrial efficiency, recycling, and the reduction of unnecessary
    material and energy use. These characteristics of IoT support the implementation
    and success of CBMs, particularly the Loop and Optimize CBMs. These conclusions
    are similar to those of previously published studies. However, the dynamic feedback
    potential of the IoT also proves to be vital for the “Redesign” of product or
    service concepts, especially for Virtualize, Share and Exchange models which have
    not been fully explored before. Therefore, we revealed potential directions based
    on these preliminary studies: For instance, in the Share approach, IoT helps to
    provide a sharing platform that enables consumers to share products, essentially
    providing the same amount of final services with a smaller product pool. The IoT
    also provides virtual and dematerialized options as service solutions rather than
    physical products with similar functions to achieve design evolution capability,
    supporting the “Redesign” CE strategy through the combination of other I4.0 technologies
    such as DT. The review of quantitative assessments suggests that IoT has the potential
    to reduce the energy consumption of the Optimize and Loop business model by about
    20–30%. By redesigning and integrating IoT and IoT-based algorithms into business
    operations, the energy efficiency of the system can be greatly increased. In addition,
    IoT can help to minimize waste generation and enhance efficiency of resource use.
    However, the widespread usage of IoT and related data processing activities in
    itself can lead to higher energy use and generation of e-waste, which often is
    difficult to recycle. IoT also poses a number of obstacles for its cross-business
    applications, including the difficulties of establishing universal standards for
    data processing, cybersecurity liability issues, and relatively high investment
    costs. These assessments of strengths and challenges of IoT can provide more intuitive
    information for SMEs investors who are interested in innovative technologies and
    circular development. 6. Limitations and recommendations This research has limitations
    as well. Firstly, given the fact that the research on the interaction between
    the IoT and CE is still in its infancy, most of the references discuss conceptual
    frameworks, models and theoretical evaluations, and just a few case studies. Most
    case studies only explore one or a few technical applications of IoT, these limits
    the value of meta-analyses as attempted in this paper. Particularly for the Virtualize,
    Exchange and Regenerate CBMs the number of available cases was low. We hence recommend
    a more systematic, quantitative analysis of case studies on how IoT can contribute
    to CBMs and environmental improvements. Secondly, the literature gives just limited
    information on the environmental drawbacks of IoT. Some studies on e.g., RFID
    suggest that their production and use generate just limited environmental damage
    (Jia et al., 2012). However, to analyze the environmental benefits and drawbacks
    of IoT comprehensively, further research is needed that should consider specific
    IoT application scenarios, material choices and future improvement potentials
    that may be available due to scale and learning effects. These could become the
    focal points of the future phase of IoT research. Declaration of competing interest

    \ \n  \nAbstract: The agricultural sector is of great importance to fulfill food\
    \ resources need of the country. Precision Agriculture \n(PA) with Internet of\
    \ Things and Wireless Sensor Network is a transformation from traditional farming\
    \ to smart farming. \nWireless sensor networks and Internet of Things are considered\
    \ as drivers to develop system which can change agriculture \nsector from manual\
    \ to automatic. Advancement in the technology have pushed the growth of precision\
    \ agriculture to very large \nextent despite of several challenges faced in this\
    \ area. System for precision agriculture relies on hardware components mainly\
    \ \nwireless sensors which act as a source for gathering of real time data. Depending\
    \ upon the real time date retrieved by sensors \nautomation in agriculture is\
    \ done by adopting decision-based system. With Precision agriculture productivity\
    \ is optimized by \nmaintaining sustaniability as crop receives what is acutual\
    \ requirement on the basis of new techniques and software platforms. \nThis review\
    \ article includes Inernet of Things (IoT), Wireless Sensors, Wireless communication\
    \ and challenges faced in this \narea. \n \nKeywords: Precision Agriculture, Wireless\
    \ Sensor Networks, Internet of Things \n___________________________________________________________________________\
    \ \n  \n1. Introduction  \nIndia has 16% of world papulation but have 4% of world’s\
    \ fresh water resources out of which 80% is used \nfor agriculture [1]. India\
    \ is known as agricultural country as 80% of its rural papulation have agriculture\
    \ as their \nsource of livelihood [2]. Many states of India have their agriculture\
    \ totally dependent on rainfall due to very less \navailability of freshwater.\
    \ This shortage of freshwater supply demands paradigm shift to productivity per\
    \ unit of \nwater. In various economic surveys done in past five years it is indicated\
    \ that adoption of advancement in \ntechnologies is required to make agriculture\
    \ sector sustainable for small and marginal farmers. Climatic changes \nthat are\
    \ affecting country in various ways, are going to lower farmer’s income further\
    \ by 25%. Three factors \nunder climate change pointed are decline in average\
    \ rainfall, rise in temperature and more dry days. India’s 73.2 \nmillion hectares\
    \ area is still unirrigated area and only rainfall dependent out of 141.4 million\
    \ hectares net sown \narea. Economic Survey alerted and recommended the requirement\
    \ for “dramatic” improvement in irrigation by \ninvolving new technologies [3].\
    \ In traditional farming irrigation is either done by manual observation of farmer\
    \ \nor it is scheduled irrigation. Additionally, water overuse can cause water\
    \ shortage, often occurs in areas of \nirrigation agriculture, and harms the environment.\
    \ Present scenario demands novel technology for increasing the \ncrop productivity,\
    \ and a technology to reduce the water consumption for irrigation. This is clearly\
    \ indicating a \ntransformation of traditional farming to Precision agriculture.\
    \ Precision Agriculture (PA) not only increases crop \nyield and revenues but\
    \ also involves methods which are very environment friendly. Precision agriculture\
    \ is a way \nof farming which is done by considering all the elements related\
    \ to soil moisture and temperature, environment \ndetails like temperature, humidity\
    \ and rate of evaporation measured by technology-based devices. Precision \nagriculture\
    \ is done more precisely on the basis of what is required, when is required and\
    \ where is required in the \nfarm. Precision farming is a technique of farming\
    \ that changes the use of pesticides and fertilizers to evaluate the \nvariation\
    \ in the growth conditions within the agriculture field. This way of practice\
    \ is termed as Site Specific \nManagement (SSM) [4]. This way it reduces the amount\
    \ of chemicals released into the environment. Precision \nagriculture also helps\
    \ in reducing the requirement of man power which further helps farmers to have\
    \ more \neconomic benefits. Advancement in Cloud Computing, Big Data Analytics,\
    \ Artificial Intelligence and Internet of \nthings are very helpful to attain\
    \ Precision agriculture. This review paper is focused on Internet of things and\
    \ \nvarious techniques used in this field to agriculture technology based. \n\
    \  2. Precision Agriculture \nPrecision agriculture is management of farming on\
    \ basis of observation, measurement and decision-based \nsystem. First revolution\
    \ of precision agriculture started with use machinery in place of manpower and\
    \ farming \nwith help of animals. This revolution happened in early 19s (1900-1930).\
    \ Second wave started with green \nrevolution which enhanced agriculture on the\
    \ basis genetics which led to precise plantation. Presently, third wave \nof revolution\
    \ is going on which came into implementation in 1980 with the advanced technologies\
    \ in agriculture \n[5]. The main focus of the review article is to study various\
    \ methods opted by different researchers in past five \nyears for smart farming.\
    \ Various technologies that are helping different researchers are Big Data Analytics,\
    \ Cloud \nComputing, Internet of Things, Wireless sensor network, Artificial intelligence,\
    \ Image processing using \nRana Gill  a, and Dr. Paras Chawla b \n \n132  \nComputer\
    \ vision and many more. These technologies are helping to transform traditional\
    \ farming to precision \nagriculture at very fast pace. Various technologies used\
    \ in precision agriculture are shown below in figure1 [6]. \n \nFig. 1.  Overview\
    \ of Precision Agriculture Technologies \nThis article is framed to cover only\
    \ those research article which Internet of things based. The survey presents \n\
    the idea of Precision agriculture with various innovations from its cause, various\
    \ technologies and their up-\ngradations ideas. Precision Agriculture utilizes\
    \ Internet of things (IoT) arrangements to increase productivity \nwhile reducing\
    \ water consumption, manpower required and saving environment. In the early stages,\
    \ Precision \nagriculture consisted mostly of map-based technologies using geo\
    \ statistical methods such as GIS and satellite \nbased remote sensing. And main\
    \ focus was to apply to control fertilizer use. Earlier sensors were not commonly\
    \ \nused because of high cost, unreliable or unavailable for necessary applications.\
    \ Precision agriculture got started \nin its third wave during 1980s but till\
    \ early 2000s not adopted by many farmers. The key obstacles to the adoption \n\
    of such approaches were the lack of technology, lack of scientific evidence, no\
    \ training and high cost [7]. \nDecreased sensors cost and rapid Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) and Big data growth lead to development and testing \nof more PA system.\
    \ IoT works in form of cycle that firstly do monitoring with the help of sensor,\
    \ analysis of \ninformation gathered and then control [8]. Further by involving\
    \ Big data Analytics and machine learning decision \nmaking system can be designed\
    \ [9].  \n2.1 Internet of Things \nIn agriculture the Internet of Things is about\
    \ cameras, sensors and other smart devices to get data from every \naction in\
    \ farm. Internet of things helps to build smart farming in various forms like\
    \ sensing, watermanagement to \nincrease crop yield, determine fertizer requirement,\
    \ finding optimal time for planatation and harveting and \nweather conditions.\
    \ IoT is a type of enviornment in which objects can transmit data over internet\
    \ without or with \nminimal human interventation [10]. The IoT is designed around\
    \ various wireless radio standards which are \nresponsible for interaction of\
    \ different devices with each other through the Internet. It comprises many standards\
    \ \nlike Zigbee, Bluetooth, LoWPAN, Wi-Fi ,NFC, Z WAVE, RFID, and so on. Physical\
    \ object which collects and \nprocesses data that it receives about the enviornment\
    \ [11]. These objects are built with sensors, actuators, \nmicrocontrollers and\
    \ transceivers. The irrigation requirements can easily be automated by the IoT-\
    \ driven decision \nsupport system (DSS). In [22] authors proposed system to transmit\
    \ information through the internet with the help \nof internet of things The IoT\
    \ allows devices to control remotely or sense physical environmental factors using\
    \ \nsensor nodes. The user interface is generated with the help of an Android\
    \ app. The data gathered by the sensor \nnodes propagates following tree topology\
    \ to reach the base station. Arduino UNO and nodeMCU are used for \ntransmission\
    \ and soring the data collected to the cloud. Developed Android app enables the\
    \ access of an \ninformation uploaded to the cloud.  \nVarious technologies are\
    \ growing under internet of things and many methods are proposed and implemented\
    \ \nby various researchers in recent years. \n 2.1.1 Wireless Sensor Network \
    \ \nWireless sensor Networks help in shift from traditional farming to smart farming.\
    \ Research on Precision \nagriculture from basic climate information, soil information\
    \ to decision support system for irrigation are \ndependent on collection of data\
    \ by wireless sensors. The wireless sensor system not only improves crop \nproductivity\
    \ but also helps in saving environment in various forms [12].  A WSN usually consists\
    \ of many multi- \nfunctional sensor nodes that are deployed in a interested field.\
    \ With the recent advancements these nodes are of \nlow cost, less power consumption\
    \ and small in size. In spite of miniature structure these nodes are provisioned\
    \ \nwith sensors, microcontrollers, and radio transceivers. These nodes have capability\
    \ to sense the data, process it \nand capable to communicate it. These nodes are\
    \ capable to communicate over short distance via wireless mode \nTh\ne \nMo\n\

    \ \n133  \nof communication. Wireless communication standards plays an important\
    \ role for normal functioning of wireless \nsensor network. Various techniques\
    \ are designed at physical layer and protocols are followed at higher layers for\
    \ \neffective working of wireless sensor network. Nodes are generally categorises\
    \ as a source node and  a sink or \ngateway node. The collection of data is done\
    \ by source node and receiving of data is by sink or gateway node. In \nterms\
    \ of computational power sink nodes have higher power in comparison to a source\
    \ node. While choosing \nwireless nodes constraints faced are size, data rate,\
    \ memory and power consumption. In [13] comparison of sensor \nnodes used in precision\
    \ agriculture is done with their specification and it is considered that MICA2\
    \ is more \nsuitable due to its capability to connect with many sensors  with\
    \ help of its large expansion connectors. In recent \nmany ways are opted by different\
    \ researchers to apply wireless sensor network to agriculture. In [14] method\
    \ \nproposed to monitor agriculture environment was based on smart wireless sensor\
    \ network. They design an \narchitecture by deploying various nodes in the agriculture\
    \ area. Then collected data was analysed and displaying \nit to end user. Similarly,\
    \ In [15] authors  proposed a technique which applies on top surface of the soil\
    \ in two \ndomains namely time and space to monitor variation in soil moisture\
    \ content. This experiment has conducted by \nconsidering twenty seven different\
    \ locations where wireless sensor nodes have deployed. To collect real-time \n\
    data multi hope configuration has been used. In [16] paper has wireless sensor\
    \ network based smart system used \nin a red bayberry greenhouse. A smart system\
    \ is designed using temperature sensors and soil moisture. This \nsystem monitor\
    \ the humidity ,temperature and illumination in the greenhouse. In [17] authors\
    \ proposed wireless \nsensor networks based system in potato farm which monitors\
    \ individual crop requirements. The farmers can easily \nrecognise the different\
    \ requirements of crop ,fertilizers use and need of irrigation. The article presented\
    \ a model \nfor irrigation management to figure out agricultural parameters using\
    \ intelligent humidity sensors and \nmathematical calculations on the basis of\
    \ received input. In [18] authors  presented smart precision agriculture \nsystem\
    \ using IoT technology and wireless sensor network . This system has designed\
    \ automated irrigation system. \nComparison of scheduled irrigation in which irrigation\
    \ is done at specific times with automatic irrigation system \nbased on  moisture\
    \ sensors, temperature, and humidity. Two irrigation methods are compared and\
    \ it is found that \nautomatic irrigation has better efficiency in terms of water\
    \ consumption. In [19] proposed method is implemented \nby dividing the agricultural\
    \ land in for regions and three different sensors namely temperature, humidity\
    \ and soil \nmoisture sensor. Data collection is done by these sensor nodes and\
    \ transmitted through other nodes and gateways \nto server. Data received at server\
    \ is analysed and displayed in an application in GUI that can be made available\
    \ \nin mobile application and on the related website. In [20] authors developed\
    \ IoT-enabled wireless sensor network \nenvironment to monitor soil and environmental\
    \ parameters which are used to schedule irrigation on the basis of \nwater requirements.\
    \ Developed robust mechanism using interpolation technique for making soil moisture\
    \ content \ndistribution map. Method  made distribution map  by measuring soil\
    \ moisture content at different nine positions \nof the agricultural land. Structural\
    \ similarity index (SSIM) mechanisms was adopted to control irrigation valves\
    \ \ndepending on zone-specific irrigation control commands. In [21] a wireless\
    \ drip irrigation system was presented \nby deploying soil moisture sensors. An\
    \ implementation of a WSN was realized for wireless managed irrigation \nsolution\
    \ and real time monitoring of soil water content. Data collection is done with\
    \ the help of solar powered \nbased wireless acquisition stations to automate\
    \ an irrigation. With this system design monitoring of water content \nwas done.\
    \ It is clear from above reviewed papers that proposed systems use multiple sensors\
    \ nodes to make \nagriculture more precise. The design of the system is selected\
    \ depending on various features that fulfil the \nrequirement for low cost , less\
    \ power consumption, less water consumption, reduced manpower and secure \nwireless\
    \ communication between these nodes [23].  \nIn the agriculture sector wireless\
    \ sensor networks are being used to develop smart irrigation systems, smart \n\
    fertilization systems, crop health monitoring, early crop disease detection and\
    \ smart pest control systems.  \n  2.1.2 IoT Connectivity \nIn IoT objects can\
    \ talk and this is possible only through their connectivity to each other and\
    \ to the outside \nworld. Due to the rapid growth in WSN technologies and IoT\
    \ devices several wireless communication protocols \nare brought in use. These\
    \ protocols have their own specifications depending on various factors like data\
    \ rate, \nbandwidth, free channels, , battery life and cost [24]. Commonly used\
    \ protocol for IoT connectivity in agriculture \nsector are Zigbee, Bluetooth,\
    \ 6LoWPAN, RFID, Wi-Fi and Lora WAN.  ZigBee is a wireless protocol commonly \n\
    used in precision agriculture applications like smart irrigation systems and smart\
    \ greenhouses [25]. In [26], \nauthors presented a smart irrigation system in\
    \ which communication is handled by the ZigBee module. This \nsystem used two\
    \ nodes, i.e., a sensor node and an actuator node where sensor node was comprised\
    \ of soil moisture \nsensors, which were used to monitor the water level in the\
    \ soil and the actuator module used to take required \nactions on basis of the\
    \ water content of the soil. ZigBee protocol handled the whole communication part\
    \ of the \nsystem. In [27] wireless greenhouse sensors based on CC2420 and Zigbee.\
    \ In [28] greenhouse environment \nmonitoring system using three sensors namely\
    \ light intensity sensor, air temperature sensor and humidity sensor \nwas designed.\
    \ The system monitoring is Wi-Fi based which converts TTL signal from the sensor\
    \ to the Wi-Fi \nsignal to be transmitted to the server. In this framework physical\
    \ devices are connected to Wi-Fi network to \nmonitor and control greenhouse environment.\
    \ Similarly, In another smart agriculture system proposed in [29] \nWi-Fi protocols\
    \ were used. In this paper system is designed using Raspberry Pi   and multiple\
    \ sensors used for \ndata collection. The transmission of this data to the cloud\
    \ is done using Wi-Fi protocols.  Indu and S.R.N. [30] \nproposed a GSM(Global\
    \ system for mobile communication) based system to control irrigation. The system\
    \ \ndesigned is used to set the irrigation time depending on the data collected\
    \ by temperature and humidity sensors \nwhich helps to irrigate automatically\
    \ when unattended. Communication between the end user and system is \nRana Gill\
    \  a, and Dr. Paras Chawla b \n \n134  \nestablished via short messaging service\
    \ (SMS) on GSM network. In [31], a proposed system used smart phone \nusing Bluetooth\
    \ to collect the data from sensors deployed in the farm. Sensors used in the system\
    \ are soil \ntemperature sensor and soil moisture sensor. In [32] a smartphone\
    \ App is designed which enables the Wi-Fi \nconnection of the smartphone creating\
    \ an access point to a router node. This node is connected through the Zigbee\
    \ \nprotocol to a gateway that controls the irrigation pump. In [33], authors\
    \ presented wireless sensor network to \nmonitor the soil properties of the farm\
    \ by using a 6LoWPAN. 4G cellular technology is also considered as a good \nchoice\
    \ in underground wireless sensor networks [34]. Common IoT applications which\
    \ use RFID are security, \nmedical, smart shopping and smart agriculture. RFID\
    \ based smart irrigation system was presented in [35] which \nused soil moisture\
    \ and soil temperature sensors for controlling valve of irrigation pump. An information\
    \ collected \nby these sensors is transmitted to the cloud based on RFID wireless\
    \ communication protocols, with the help of \nwhich user can control a water pump.\
    \  \n  3. Precision Agriculture Challenges \nPrecision agriculture is in use from\
    \ last few decades to increase crop productivity by keeping low cost and \nless\
    \ human intervention. But still very limited farmers have adopted these techniques\
    \ due to several challenges. \nAs Precision agriculture relies on different sensors\
    \ which have certain limitations like deployment, development \ncost and maintenance\
    \ cost. So this hardware cost is main challenge in precision agriculture. Atmospheric\
    \ \ndisturbances also cause interference in wireless communication channels which\
    \ can further interrupt \ncommunication between wireless nodes and cloud. In Precision\
    \ agriculture systems large amounts of data get \ngenerated which need storage\
    \ and data analysis. New facilities and software platforms are in demand for \n\
    management of data. Literacy and connectivity are another important factors that\
    \ affects the adoption of smart \nfarming. The main challenge that is acting as\
    \ an obstruction in growth of precision agriculture is interoperability. \n 4.\
    \ Conclusion and Future scope \nPrecision agriculture with involvement of technologies\
    \ like IoT and wireless sensor networks helps to increase \nyield and productivity\
    \ with resource optimization. Most of the research articles in this field indicates\
    \ that precision \nagriculture is about sustainability and decision support systems.\
    \ Precision agriculture includes multiple \nparameters like temperature, soil\
    \ moisture, light intensity, humidity, soil nutrients, etc. Many challenges are\

    Yusoof Ismail1 1 Dhofar University, Oman Abstract Internet of things has acquired
    attention all over the globe. It has transformed the agricultural field and allowed
    farmers to compete with massive issues they face. The aim of this paper is to
    review the various challenges and opportunities associated with the applications
    of internet of things in agricultural sector. This research makes use of secondary
    sources that have been gathered from existing academic literature such as journals,
    books, articles, magazines, internet, newsletter, company publications and whitepapers.
    Applications reviewed in this research are about crop sensing, mapping and monitoring
    the croplands pattern, managing and controlling with the help of radio frequency
    identification and real-time monitoring of environment. Some of the challenges
    that were taken into consideration for reviewing the applications of internet
    of things are software complexity, security, lack of supporting infrastructure
    and technical skill requirement. Complexity in the software has to be rectified
    in order to support the IoT network. Therefore software must be developed as user-friendly
    for improving the farming, production and quality of the crop. Security is the
    major threat in the IoT applications. Security has to be enhanced through proper
    access control, data confidentiality and user authentication. Technical skill
    is required for farming to enhance the organizational abilities and to perform
    the farming functions, solving problems and more. Proper supporting infrastructure
    can be developed with proper internet availability and connectivity. Some of the
    opportunities were taken for reviewing the applications of internet of things
    are low power wireless sensor, better connectivity, operational efficiency and
    remote management. Journal of Computer Science Volume 14 No. 2, 2018, 132-143  DOI:

    Metrics Abstract: Problems regarding agriculture have always been deterring development
    and the introduction of cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) into agricultural
    is considered the next step in the modernization of agriculture. Various solutions
    are available and they offer important features for monitoring agriculture processes
    and facilities, but the accuracy and relevance of the measured values still represent
    a big concern when it comes to making decisions based on the analysis of gathered
    data. In this paper, we make an overview of the problems regarding IoT-based telemetry
    for agriculture and asses two market-ready solutions (Adcon and Libelium) for
    a co-dependent statistic measurement of their accuracy and performance. Using
    relevant statistic indicators on a variate set of measured metrics, we made an
    appreciation of the correlation between the measurements of those two solutions
    and appreciated the relevance of the measured values. Published in: 2018 International

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Bucharest, Romania SECTION I. Introduction
    In recent years, there has been a growing interest of the governments around the
    world in the progressive adoption of smart metering technology at homes, by promoting
    the agreement with the industries and adapting their regulations. A telemetry
    system includes automatic measurement and transmission of data from one location
    to another, mainly due to the inaccessibility of the source to be monitored directly.
    The application domains of these systems extend to health care, vehicle automation,
    energy utilities, aerospace and defense, wildlife, agriculture, and oceanography,
    among others. Smart telemetry, also known as smart metering refers to electronic
    devices that periodically record the consumption of resources (such as electric
    energy, water, or gas), and at least once a day transmit that information to the
    software used for monitoring and billing. One such decision-making platform can
    only be as good as the data you feed it with. In order to properly assess and
    evaluate what to do with this information, one needs relevant data from experiments,
    and not from the nearby city center, where meteorological stations are usually
    located. The continued requirement for cloud-based services, scalability and interoperability
    are believed to be the driving factors for the global telemetry market [1]. Cloud
    computing and IoT are two hot concepts newly emerged from the last few decades.
    They are the hard-core of information technology industry of the new generation.
    Not long after President of the U.S., Barack Obama put forward the concept of
    smart plane in 2009, Chinese Premier Wen raised the development idea of sensing
    Europe, which mainly emphasized the development of IoT and strategic new industries.
    Internet of Things is closely related to cloud computing in the sense that it
    obtains powerful computing tools through cloud computing while cloud computing
    finds the best practicing channel based on IoT. Cloud computing is a method which
    enables shared hardware and software information to be delivered to computers
    and other network equipment on demand [2]. End users do not need to know the basics
    of cloud computing or have any professional knowledge concerning this all they
    need to know is what kind of resource they require and how to receive relevant
    service through the Internet. Cloud computing describes a new way of using, adding
    and exchanging IT service based on the Internet which involves providing dynamic,
    expandable and most of the time virtualized resources over the Internet [3]. The
    following five features of cloud computing are: on-demand service, Internet access,
    resource pooling, rapid elasticity and calculability. Current technological advances
    in low power integrated circuits and wireless communications have made available
    efficient, inexpensive, and low power miniature devices for use in remote sensing
    applications. All these factors combined have improved the viability of using
    a sensor network consisting of many intelligent sensors, making them able to collect,
    process, analyze, and disseminate valuable information, collected in many kinds
    of environments [4]. Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is a network protocol
    that works on top of the TCP/IP protocol. It was designed for connections with
    remote locations where a code is required, or the network bandwidth is limited.
    The protocol uses a publish/subscribe architecture pattern in comparison to HTTP
    with its request/response paradigm. Publish/Subscribe is event-driven and enables
    messages to be delivered to clients. The central communication point is the MQTT
    broker, which is responsible for dispatching all messages between the senders
    and the legit receivers. Every client that declares a message to the broker includes
    a topic into the message. This topic acts as the routing information for the broker.
    Each client who wants to receive messages subscribes to a particular topic, and
    the broker will deliver all messages with the matching topic to that client. Therefore
    the clients don''ts have to know each other, they only communicate over the topic.
    In comparison to MQTT, REST (Representational State Transfer) simply provides
    a client-server application used for requests and replies, useful for systems
    in need to communicate over the Internet, and cannot implement publish-and-subscribe
    message exchanges. The novelty of the work is to analyze and compare existing
    cloud of things environments in order to implement decision making services for
    the agriculture domain. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section
    II presents related work for smart agriculture, Section III discusses technical
    description on ADCON telemetry stations, Libelium stations and problems related
    to agriculture, Section IV presents the experimental data and lastly, Section
    V concludes the paper. SECTION II. Related Work The concept of smart agriculture
    has been around for some time now. The purpose of this paper is making agriculture
    smart using automation and IoT technologies. This paper gives information about
    field activities, irrigation problems, and storage for smart irrigation system
    and smart warehouse management systems respectively [5], monitoring the crop-field
    using soil moisture sensors, temperature and humidity sensors, light sensors and
    automated irrigation systems [6]. MQTT implements a plain and slight device data
    collection solution. Therefore, only limited interoperability between MQTT publishers
    and subscribers can be assured. There can be an exchange of messages between different
    MQTT implementations excepting the format of the message body, which is agreed
    between peers. MQTT is a message-centric wire protocol created for M2M communications
    that allows the transfer of telemetry-style data in the form of messages from
    devices, with high latency or strained networks, to a small message broker [7].
    The MQTT protocol is agile, power efficient and provides different levels of QoS
    (Quality of Service). The protocol rotates around the concept, where clients might
    publish updates or subscribe for receiving the updates from other clients. The
    MQTT community claims that a publisher and subscriber protocol is exactly what
    is required to build an authentic IoT environment [8]. RESTful style architectures
    include clients and servers where clients trigger requests to the servers, servers
    take action on these requests and reply with appropriate responses [9]. RESTful
    architectures might be established on other Application Layer protocols if they
    already implement a rich and orderly vocabulary for functions established on the
    transfer of meaningful representational state [10]. A surplus of IoT middleware
    platforms has lately come across in the marketplace. Examples include UBIDOTS
    [11], Xively [12], Thing Speak [13] Open. Sen. se [14], Sensor Cloud [15] and
    most latest, Amazon IoT [16] and IBM IoT platforms. These IoT middleware platforms
    intend to clear the injection of data from all kinds of sources (physical devices,
    human input, online data, etc.) by using an Application Programming Interface
    (API). All similar platforms consistently provide essential functionalities for
    filtering and assembling the data, as well as specification of events based on
    input data. Although the IoT platforms in this category provide tools for data
    ingestion, storage, and computation, the benefits of such platforms in smart agriculture
    through message passing interfaces applying message queues and publish/subscribe
    mechanisms are yet to be determined [17]. SECTION III. Technical Description Adcon
    and Libelium stations represents the main components of our implementation which
    are responsible to measure the level of the sensors for environmental protection.
    A. Adcon Telemetry Stations. a 753 Gprs Adcon Telemetry equipment is being successfully
    utilized in agriculture, hydrometrics, irrigation control systems, meteorology,
    water and air quality measurements, water management systems, measurement of renewable
    energy potential, plant disease management etc [18]. The sensors that ADCON stations
    support are: temperature relative humidity, solar radiation, wind speed, wind
    direction, barometric pressure, leaf wetness, soil temperature and precipitation.
    The remote telmetry unit (RTU) is thus responsible for transmitting the data through
    radio waves from the site back to the master station at the gateway, as it was
    used in viticulture [19]. B. Libelium Stations. Smart Agriculture Pro 4g Libelium
    stations are utilized for analyzing the level of pollution - air pollution, agricultural,
    noise, water, meteorology, water management systems, measurement of renewable
    energy potential, plant disease management, etc [20]. The sensors that Libelium
    stations support are temperature relative humidity, solar radiation, wind speed,
    wind direction, barometric pressure, leaf wetness, soil temperature, precipitation,
    luminosity, ultraviolet radiation The data from these sensors are stored in the
    Libelium''s gateway, called Meshlium [21]. C. Problems Related to Agriculture
    There are many different issues in this area. Some major problems that investigate
    the use of technology are described below [22]: •: IrrigationIt is significant
    in those areas where rainfalls are not sufficient to fulfill the crop water requirements
    [23]. Water shortage is becoming a global problem and this persuades the need
    for proper use of water which is that it should only be provided to those places
    where it is critically needed and in a required quantity [24]. Besides, that water
    wastage is also desired to be minimized. To cope up with these issues, many different
    mechanisms of irrigation are in use, like drip irrigation, sprinkler irrigation,
    etc [25]. The main purpose of various methods of irrigation is controlled water
    distribution at the required places in case the water could be saved without compromising
    the crop water requirements. To find out the amount of water required at a specific
    location on an instance of time, Information Technology (IT) is playing a vital
    role in providing different solutions [26]. •: Pesticide and Fertilizer ApplicationUse
    of fertilizers and pesticides at an appropriate location and quantity maximizes
    the productivity of the yield. Application of fertilizers could be performed using
    various techniques which includes broadcasting, placement, and foliar application
    [27]. Distribution of required quantity of fertilizer at appropriate place is
    a challenging task. Implementing unnecessary amount of fertilizers may decline
    the quality of water as well as could support the growth of algae. Pesticide application
    is a treatment of organism (e.g., crop) from possible damages by other plants,
    fungus, insects or animals. Timing, quantity, and location of application are
    very cautious in case of pesticides spraying. The use of technologies is becoming
    a great support in dealing with timing, quantity control, and finding proper location
    in demand for pesticides and fertilizers [28]. •: Crop, Soil and Climate MonitoringKnowing
    the condition of the crop, soil, and climate is essential for farmers as their
    decisions to irrigate the crop, spray pesticide, apply fertilizer, etc. are based
    on their current state. Remote sensor networks technology is strongly in use to
    get the local microclimate measurement as well as to measure soil attributes and
    the plant state. The connection of technologies is also providing the gain in
    having a mix of various local and global specialties to take a good decision.
    SECTION IV. Experimental Data In order to have a proper view of the comparative
    measurements of the, ADCON and Libelium telemetry stations, those were installed
    in the same analytical perimeter. The communication protocol and data transmition
    modalities for ADCON and Libelium telemetry station are presented in the table
    I. Table I Data transmision and communication protocol A fixed period for environmental
    analysis has been set. The data acquired from the sensors was centralized into
    a database and was used to highlight the sensor events, based on timestamps and
    sensor types. The variation of the values for the measured parameters (temperature,
    relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, global radiation, wind direction and
    wind speed) are presented in the next figures (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4,

    speed values Show All From the analysis of these figures, it can be concluded
    that the values measured by the two stations, ADCON and Libelium, are comparable,
    which means that both smart agricultural stations are correlated and valid. The
    results of the statistical analysis of the parameters measured with ADCON and
    Libelium are shown in Table II. Table II Statistic values for the selected parameters
    The statistical values (mean, standard deviation and Pearson correlation coefficient)
    indicate a close correlation between the two datasets and show a very good agreement
    of the measured values with the both station (ADCON and Libelium). SECTION V.
    Conclusion In conclusion, the probes from ADCON and Libelium stations have different
    structures, but the values of the parameters monitored are comparable, and there
    is a good correlation between them. These correlations highlight the usefulness
    of ADCON and Libelium deployments in the field of agriculture, thus we can see
    this way the soil water mix, or the meteorological parameters necessary for the
    development in healthy plant conditions. Data are transmitted through different
    gateway A850 for ADCON and from the Meshlium gateway for Libelium, but all the
    measured data are well correlated. These values determined at the two monitoring
    stations of the climatic parameters, highlight the importance of their use in
    the crops life cycle. The existence of these data transmission systems highlights
    the knowledge of the soil-plant-atmosphere interactions needed to optimize agricultural
    production. Parameters such as soil humidity give information if the crop needs
    irrigation and how much water it needs to be administered. As a result of the
    measurements made on: air and soil temperature, rainfall, atmospheric pressure,
    relative air humidity, solar radiation, wind speed and direction, information
    is obtained to optimally manage the development of agricultural crops. The energy
    efficiency of these stations comes from the fact that they are powered by solar
    panels and irrespective of the time you can make continuous measurements. Future
    work will investigate the security of the IoT systems. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work

    \ (A.C.-P.)\nAbstract: Wireless technologies are increasingly relevant in different\
    \ activities and lines of the\neconomy, as well as in the daily life of people\
    \ and companies. The advent of ﬁfth generation\nnetworks (5G) implies a promising\
    \ synergy with the Internet of Things (IoT), allowing for more\nautomations in\
    \ production processes and an increase in the efﬁciency of information transmission,\n\
    managing to improve the efﬁciency in decision-making through tools such as big\
    \ data and artiﬁcial\nintelligence. This article presents a description of the\
    \ 5G implementation process in Colombia, as\nwell as a revision of opportunities\
    \ when combining with IoT in featured sectors of the departmental\ndevelopment\
    \ plans, such as agriculture, tourism, health, the environment, and industry.\
    \ Results\nshows that the startup of 5G in Colombia has been a slow process, but\
    \ there are comparisons with\nsimilar procedures in other developed countries.\
    \ Additionally, we present examples of 5G and IoT\napplications which can be promoted\
    \ in Colombia, aimed at improving the quality of life of their\nhabitants and\
    \ promoting economic development.\nKeywords: 5G; frequency bands; Colombia; IoT;\
    \ radioelectric spectrum\n1. Introduction\nThe demand of mobile data services\
    \ is one of the factors that conditions the develop-\nment of future wireless\
    \ networks. The 2020 report of Ericsson indicates that the mobile\ndata trafﬁc\
    \ in that year was 50 Exabytes (EB)/month, and it is estimated that it could be\n\
    incremented to 150 EB/month in 2024 [1]. This increase is associated with a higher\
    \ need\nof services by users and requirements of technologies such as Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT),\nWireless Sensor Networks (WSN), and Artiﬁcial Intelligence\
    \ (IA). In order to meet demand,\nwork began in 2012 on a Fifth Generation wireless\
    \ technology (5G) [2].\nThe 5G network presents considerable improvements over\
    \ fourth generation networks\n(4G), highlighting the increment of the transmission\
    \ rate, ultra-reliability, less latency, and\nhigher connectivity [3,4]. Some\
    \ countries (Japan, South Korea, China, United States,\nGermany) ﬁnished test\
    \ stages and began technology commercialization. Colombia has not\nbeen oblivious\
    \ to this evolution, currently having 5G networks in pilot test processes before\n\
    launching its service to the public. In 2020, the Ministry of Information and\
    \ Communication\nTechnologies (MinICT) issued a resolution, opening a process\
    \ of granting permissions for\nthe use of the radioelectric spectrum in different\
    \ frequency bands, with the purpose of\nstarting pilot tests which uses 5G mobile\
    \ technologies [5]. Also, the ministry of ICT states\nthat the 5G frequency bands’\
    \ concession stage will start before September 2022 [6].\nSensors 2021, 21, 7167.\

    \ 2021, 21, 7167\n2 of 26\n1.1. IoT and 5G Networks\nIoT is increasingly involved\
    \ in different areas, including home automation, health,\nagriculture, industry,\
    \ and logistic. The 5G networks exceed the limitations of 4G in terms\nof security,\
    \ low latency, higher data transfer speed, and a higher quantity of connected\n\
    devices on their communications, allowing for the possibility of a wide implementation\n\
    of IoT applications [7,8]; many of which have low potency and latency requirements\
    \ [9].\nTherefore, different initiatives worldwide (for example, 4G America, IMT-2020,\
    \ 5G Forum)\nhave worked on the adoption and standardization of IoT enabled for\
    \ 5G [10]. Also, the 3rd\nGeneration Partnership Project (3GPP) has included IoT\
    \ on their standards. For example,\nin June of 2020, an Industrial IoT (IIoT)\
    \ work item was initiated and completed as a central\nelement of Release 16, and\
    \ is oriented to robotic applications and autonomous systems\n(RAS) [11].\nIn\
    \ addition to the industrial ﬁeld, it is possible to integrate IoT, through 5G,\
    \ with\nother sectors, such as home, cities, and farms [9]. In Table 1, a general\
    \ description of the\ntypical requirements of IoT applications that the ﬁfth generation\
    \ networks should satisfy\nis presented.\nTable 1. General description of features/typical\

    \ of 5G IoT, its implementation will bring a series of\nchallenges that need to\
    \ be overcome, including scalability, network management, interop-\nerability,\
    \ and heterogeneity [12].\n1.2. 5G Application Scenarios\nNetworks commercially\
    \ operating with 5G are supported with the technology New\nRadio (NR), speciﬁed\
    \ by the 3GPP in the Release 15, which is largely based on the rec-\nommendations\
    \ given by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) [13]. Some\nof the\
    \ most important technical characteristics are the use of Orthogonal Frequency\
    \ Di-\nvision Multiplexing (OFDM) and the operation up to 52.5 GHz, through time\
    \ division\nduplex (TDD) or frequency division duplex (FDD) [14]. In addition,\
    \ Release 15 added\nnew bands for 5G: 3300 MHz–4200 MHz, 3300 MHz–3800 MHz, 4400\
    \ MHz–5000 MHz,\n24,250 MHz–27,500 MHz, and 37,000 MHz–40,000 MHz [15]. For the\
    \ purpose of satisfying\nthe future requirements of the market and especially\
    \ of the industry, ITU divided 5G into\nthree application scenarios [16]: (a)\
    \ enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), focused on a high\ntransmission rate and targeting\
    \ applications in busy indoor and outdoor environments,\nas well as a possible\
    \ last-mile solution in areas where there is an absence of copper or\nﬁber optic\
    \ wired networks; (b) massive machine-to-machine communications (mMTC),\nspecially\
    \ designed to support a high density of equipment per square kilometer, such as\n\
    IoT applications in smart environments, e.g., smart cities, smart farm, smart\
    \ home, among\nothers; and (c) ultra-reliable low latency communications (uRLLC)\
    \ with lower transmission\nSensors 2021, 21, 7167\n3 of 26\nrates, intended to\
    \ support industrial automation or applications requiring mobility, such\nas autonomous\
    \ vehicles or patient monitoring. Figure 1 presents a summary of the main\ncharacteristics\
    \ of the three categories.\nFigure 1. 5G Application Scenarios. Source: [16,17].\n\
    Part of the 5G development is based on the fact that some applications will work\
    \ in\nfrequencies located in much higher bands than the ones used by the current\
    \ 4G networks, as\nis the case with the so-called “high band” spectrum range between\
    \ 24 GHz and 100 GHz [8].\nTo this end, the use of tools is required to minimize\
    \ the problems associated with loss in\npropagation [18]. For this reason, the\
    \ implementation of technologies of multiple massive\ntransmission and reception\
    \ (mMIMO) antennas that use spatial multiplexing to improve\nthe channel capacity\
    \ is considered, in addition to using large-scale antenna systems, and\nthus serving\
    \ the growing number of users [14].\n1.3. Goals and Motivation\n•\nThe main objective\
    \ of this article is to show the progress for the deployment of\nthe 5G network\
    \ in Colombia, as well as the availability of the spectrum and the\nfuture needs\
    \ of this resource according to the considerations established by regulatory\n\
    agencies. In addition, an analysis of potential IoT applications in different\
    \ sectors of\nthe Colombian economy that could contribute to the development of\
    \ the regions with\nthe implementation of 5G is presented. The speciﬁc objectives\
    \ of this article are:\n•\nAssociate IoT applications with 5G in the future demand\
    \ of the main economic activi-\nties of each department and region in Colombia.\n\
    •\nContextualize the current situation of 5G network deployment in Colombia.\n\
    •\nRelate the 5G frequency bands that will be implemented in Colombia with the\
    \ most\nsuitable IoT applications for the demands of economic activities in each\
    \ department\nand region.\nOur work will be a roadmap for future research in the\
    \ development of IoT applications\nwith 5G, according to the demand of the most\
    \ relevant economic sectors in different parts\nof Colombia.\nIn this research,\
    \ we present the demand for IoT applications that will be enhanced\nwhen working\
    \ in combination with 5G networks in Colombia. For this purpose, a search\nwas\
    \ conducted in the Scopus database, selecting articles published as of 2017. We\
    \ used\nsearch strings where the terms “5G”, “IoT”, “Colombia”, “spectrum”, “frequency\
    \ bands”,\n“trends”, “challenges”, “agriculture”, “livestock”, “e-health”, “tourism”,\
    \ “environment”,\nand “industry” were a part of the titles, abstracts, and keywords.\
    \ Subsequently, we\nreviewed each of the documents, focusing on the issues raised,\
    \ the results, and the conclu-\nsions. Additionally, we analyzed different documents\
    \ from ofﬁcial regulatory organizations,\nSensors 2021, 21, 7167\n4 of 26\nmanufacturers,\
    \ operators, and governmental institutions, obtaining a more commercial\nvision\
    \ of the future of 5G in Colombia.\nThe following criteria were considered in\
    \ the ﬁnal selection of the bibliography: a focus\non IoT, a focus on IoT/5G,\
    \ the relation of the subject matter with the Colombian context,\nthe relevant\
    \ problems of the Colombian economic and social sector, and government\ninformation.\
    \ In total, we selected and used 193 references, of which 69 correspond to\njournal\
    \ articles or conferences, 10 to private companies or organizations, 12 to regulators\
    \ or\nforeign entities (external to Colombia), and 102 to Colombian public sector\
    \ entities.\nThe structure of this article is as follows: Section 2 describes\
    \ an analysis of the results\nand provides examples with the use of IoT and 5G\
    \ in different sectors of Colombia. Finally,\nSection 3 shows the discussion and\
    \ conclusions.\n2. Results and Analysis\n2.1. Projected Use of 5G Frequency Bands\n\
    Current saturation of the radioelectric spectrum has highlighted that, in different\n\
    countries, the new auctions should principally be between 1 and 6 GHz. However,\
    \ the\ngrowing need for a bandwidth that supports 5G services has brought into\
    \ consideration\nportions of the spectrum that were previously not widely accessed;\
    \ for example, the\nsub-GHz and the millimetric (mm-W). In Table 2, we highlight\
    \ some examples of bands\nauctioned in some countries and their expectations about\
    \ the allocation of 5G spectrum in\nthe future.\nTable 2. Examples of auctioned\
    \ bands for 5G service provision. Source: own elaboration.\nCountry\nBands Auctioned\n\

    \ Colombian case, to cover future needs and in harmony with the provisions of\n\
    the 2019 World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-19) [13], there is a need to\
    \ arrange\nthe spectrum in three (03) types of bands of frequency: (a) lower than\
    \ 1GHz, (b) between 1\nand 6 GHz, and (c) higher than 6 GHz. In this sense, the\
    \ 5G plan developed by MinICT\nhas identiﬁed a set of candidate frequencies to\
    \ be used in future networks [26], which are\npresented in Table 3.\nAll of these\
    \ bands have not been attributed to the mobile service provision according\nto\
    \ the presented data on the National Table of Attribution of Frequency Bands [27],\
    \ which\nwill force entities to perform modiﬁcations in the future, or perform\
    \ studies that allow\nfor an evaluation of their compatibility with other already\
    \ attributed services. Actually,\nthere is not a formal deﬁnition of the 5G frequencies\
    \ that will be assigned in Colombia;\nhowever, MinICT advances studies of viability\
    \ about spectrum portions that could serve\nas IMT (International Mobile Telecommunications)\
    \ bands, which should ﬁnalize in the\nfourth trimester of 2021 [28]. Also, in\
    \ June 2020, MinICT invited the operators to manifest\ntheir interest to participate\
    \ in processes of permission, obtaining radioelectric spectrum use\nfor the provision\
    \ of IMT services in the 700 MHZ, 1900 MHZ, 2500 MHz, and 3500 MHz\nbands [29].\n\

    and 81 GHz) were not identiﬁed by the WCR-19 for the provided 5G service. However,\
    \ they\ncould be a part of future spectrum auctions thanks to the developments\
    \ of manufacturers\nand the needs of operators. Between the examples of this situation,\
    \ there is the band of\n28 GHz, not identiﬁed by the WCR-19 inside the set of\
    \ destined frequencies to IMT, in\nwhich the 5G is framed. However, as it can\
    \ be observed in Table 2, some countries have\nalready auctioned in this spectrum\
    \ portion, and others have manifested interest on doing\nso in the future.\n2.2.\
    \ Projected 5G Frequency Bands for Use in Colombia\nIn April 2020, MinICT authorized\
    \ 5G pilot tests in Colombia in ﬁve (05) bands of the\nspectrum: 3.5–3.7 GHz,\
    \ 24.25–27.5 GHz, 37–43.5 GHz, 45.5–47 GHz, and 47.2–48.2 GHz.\nNevertheless,\
    \ in agreement with the inform of assignation of the direction of the industry\
    \ of\nCommunications of MinICT, four of the network providers and telecommunication\
    \ systems\n(NPTS) operating in Colombia submitted applications to perform tests\
    \ in the band of\nSensors 2021, 21, 7167\n6 of 26\n3500 MHz to 3600 MHz, while\
    \ others with an interest submitted their application in bands\nfrom 3300 MHz\
    \ to 3400 MHz and from 587 to 592 MHz [30]. In total, 52 entities (public\nand\
    \ private) and 24 natural persons showed an interest in participating in this\
    \ process\nfor use in eight different types of activities in the next descending\
    \ order of demand [17]:\nThe ﬁrst is the interest in using it in projects related\
    \ to smart cities, followed by its use in\napplications in education, agricultural\
    \ development, the entertainment industry, virtual\nreality, public safety, the\
    \ health sector, and ﬁnally, in transportation.\nOf the operators with participation\
    \ in the mobile services in Colombia, three of them\nsubmitted applications to\
    \ carry out pilot tests: Colombia Telecommunications, COMCEL\nCellular Communication\
    \ (Claro), and the Bogota Telecommunications Company. In those\ntests, the Claro\
    \ company recorded speeds from 864 Mbps in the download link (DL)\nand 103 Mbps\
    \ in the upload link (UL) [31]. The Movistar company, in alliance with\nthe military\
    \ hospital and with the MinICT endorsement, incorporated this technology\nto a\
    \ telemedicine car with the purpose of providing services of interconsultations\
    \ and\nan observation of procedures through video conferences. The results show\
    \ that they\nreached rates of 1.62 Gbps in DL and 176 Mbps in UL [32]. Other values\
    \ obtained by\nmobile telephone providers in Colombia, before the permissions\
    \ granted in 2020 in indoor\nscenarios, reached speeds of 640 Mbps per cell and\
    \ a spectral efﬁciency of 32 Mbps per\nMHz [33]. The Claro company in 2018 had\
    \ speeds of 10 Gbps in the 28 GHz, and a latency\nlower than 1ms [34].\nRegarding\
    \ the auctions of spectrum destined for 5G in Colombia, there is no set date,\n\
    although there are some projections. The ANE has suggested that, with the entry\
    \ of 5G, a\nspectral portion of 400MHz is necessary in the C band (3300–3700 MHz)\
    \ in 2018, and close\nto 1172 MHz in the year 2024 [35]. Figure 2a,b shows a projection\
    \ of ANE for the demand\nfor mobile technology of its bandwidths in MHz until\
    \ the year 2029, and the expectations\nfor future spectrum auctions in the country.\n\
    Figure 2. (a) Prospective spectrum demand for Colombia IMT, and (b) Band auctions\
    \ projections. Source: ANE and [17].\nTwo scenarios have been put forward for\
    \ 5G implementation from 4G-LTE: Stan-\ndAlone (SA) and Non-StandAlone (NSA) [17].\
    \ Regarding SA, these are radio access archi-\ntectures that do not use the existing\
    \ 4G networks core, while in NSA, the 5G architecture is\nbased on a 4G network\
    \ core. In the Colombian case, it is expected that the ﬁrst commercial\nnetworks\
    \ will start in NSA mode, and that is why MinICT has been strengthening the 4G\n\
    expansion process in Colombia, for which spectrum auction processes have already\
    \ been\ncarried out in the 700 MHz and 2500 MHz bands to expand mobile broadband\
    \ coverage to\n3658 locations located in rural areas. In addition, operators Tigo\
    \ and Claro will execute the\nSensors 2021, 21, 7167\n7 of 26\ntransition from\
    \ 2G and 3G to 4G within four years, starting in 2021 [36,37]. Besides, in 2020,\n\
    Colombia opened a consultation for expressions of interest in obtaining radio\
    \ spectrum for\nthe provision of IMT, of which 5G is a part. The bands destined\
    \ for a future granting of\npermits are: 700 MHz, 1900 MHz, 2500 MHz, and 3500\
    \ MHz [29].\nIoT is largely responsible for this increase in spectrum requirements\
    \ in 5G, and this\nis demonstrated by the forecasts of different entities [38–40].\
    \ For example, CISCO, in its\nannual internet report, predicts that in the year\
    \ 2023, the number of M2M (machine-to-\nmachine) connections will be 14.7 billion,\
    \ with an average of 1.8 connections per user\nworldwide [41]. In this report,\
    \ they also present ﬁgures about the IoT applications with the\nhighest number\
    \ of connections, these being those related to the home. In addition, smart\n\
    city and vehicle related applications will be faster growing.\nRegarding IoT in\
    \ Colombia, in accordance with the 5G Plan and in harmony with\nworld trends,\
    \ MinICT proposes possible uses in each of the 5G spectrum portions. Fre-\nquencies\
    \ below 1 GHz will preferably be used for high-speed mobile broadband in urban,\n\
    suburban, and rural areas, in order to serve the deployment of IoT services. Regarding\n\
    the band between 1 and 6 GHz, it is the one with the greatest options to be used\
    \ in the\nﬁrst commercial 5G implementations, and has 3G and 4G service assignments.\
    \ As for the\nfrequency band above 6 GHz (with or without a license), its use\
    \ is proposed for ultra-fast\nspeed connections.\nA study presented by the General\
    \ Directorate of Communications Networks, Contents,\nand Technology (an ofﬁcial\
    \ entity of the European Community) indicated that approxi-\nmately 19 GHz of\
    \ shared spectrum could be required for IoT in the coming years [42]. The\nsame\
    \ report shows that there is not enough spectrum in the lower 1 GHz bands (low\
    \ band)\nand between 1 to 6 GHz (mid-band) if you want to develop monitoring applications\
    \ for\nhighways, power supplies, and healthcare. It is important to highlight\
    \ that they arrived\nat this result from three factors: (a) total number of devices\
    \ per km2, (b) data rate of the\ndevices, and (c) spectral efﬁciency. In terms\
    \ of spectrum usage preferences in IoT, mobile\noperators prefer to implement\
    \ IoT within licensed spectrum, while manufacturers lean\ntowards implementation\
    \ in unlicensed bands to avoid licensing costs [43].\n2.3. Opportunities for Using\
    \ IoT/5G Applications for Projects in Colombia\nThe National Development Plan\
    \ (NDP) is an ofﬁcial document prepared by the\nNational Planning Department of\
    \ Colombia, which contains the strategic guidelines of\neach government policy\
    \ [44]. It is a roadmap that details various aspects for improvement,\nprojected\
    \ for a period of four years. It is issued at the beginning of the mandate of\
    \ each\npresidential government in order to ensure the continuous progress of\
    \ the nation in different\naspects, such as social, economic, environmental, and\
    \ health. In this sense, one of the goals\nin the 2018–2022 four-year period is\
    \ the increase in the number of internet connections and\nthe digital transformation\
    \ of society [45]. Our research is focused on the areas where the\nexplosive growth\
    \ of IoT applications is envisaged to work in conjunction with 5G wireless\nnetworks\
    \ to become ideal solutions in different ﬁelds of national development.\nAdministratively,\
    \ Colombia is made up of departments, districts, and municipalities\nin its political\
    \ division with the largest geographical extension. However, historically\nit\
    \ has also been subdivided into six (06) natural regions: Amazon, Andean, Caribbean,\n\
    Island, Orinoco, and Paciﬁc, which can be seen in Figure 3. Each of them is made\
    \ up of\ndifferent departments with their own geographical, social, and cultural\
    \ characteristics that\ndifferentiate them from each other. Although there is\
    \ an NDP, each department draws up\nits own government policy through a Departmental\
    \ Development Plan (DDP), which is a\nplanning instrument for a four-year period\
    \ that allows governors to set the objectives and\ngoals of their period, starting\
    \ from its potentialities and shortcomings [46]. Through the\nDDPs, the aim is\
    \ to strengthen different economic activities that help improve the quality of\n\
    life of its citizens, and within this framework, IoT and 5G are promising tools\
    \ that could help\ngenerate innovation and solutions to different problems. This\
    \ section presents a summary\nof the economic activities in which each department\
    \ has proposed its development efforts\nSensors 2021, 21, 7167\n8 of 26\nin the\
    \ 2020–2023 period (see Table 4), and subsequently, the potentialities of IoT\

    \ raising is an activity carried out in a large part of the rural territory of\
    \ Colombia,\nand it was one of the few economic sectors that showed growth in\
    \ 2020 [126]. The PND\npromotes sustainable cattle raising and the development\
    \ of agricultural production models\nwith the support of technologies that increase\
    \ their efﬁciency.\nThe proposed application possibilities of IoT focused on precision\
    \ farming are varied.\nFor example, monitoring the heat (when it is ready for\
    \ mating) and the geographic location\nof the animals would allow for an increase\
    \ of their reproductive efﬁciency, and protect\nagainst theft of cattle [127].\
    \ Diseases and health problems suffered by animals on farms\ncause a loss of productivity,\
    \ and are a threat to public health [128]. In this sense, it would be\npossible\
    \ to control animal diseases such as echinococcus [129] or tumors [130] through\
    \ IoT\nmanagement and monitoring systems. It will also be possible to help farmers\
    \ in making\ndecisions regarding livestock, thanks to AI techniques and machine\
    \ learning (ML), among\nothers [131]. Currently, there are no reports of a large\
    \ number of IoT projects oriented\nto cattle farming in Colombia, although work\
    \ has been done on the control of livestock\nmobility [132] or on the detection\
    \ of animals in heat [133]. This utility of IoT will be\nenhanced with the improved\
    \ capacity (bps) of 5G, thanks to increased bandwidth and\nspatial multiplexing,\
    \ reducing network congestion and overload [127]. In addition, the\nreduction\
    \ in energy consumption and the ability to connect a large number of devices\n\
    make it possible for IoT to play an important role in the wide geographical scenarios\
    \ where\nlivestock farming is developed [131].\nIn this sense, 5G will reinforce\
    \ the communication infrastructure of WSN, being the\ntransport method to send\
    \ data to the internet, preferably when using the sub-GHz band\n(700 MHz) in rural\
    \ areas. Furthermore, and taking into account the high demand for\nwireless nodes\
    \ deployed in large geographical areas required for smart farm environments,\n\
    mMTC is the ideal option in a 5G scenario to serve the development purposes of\
    \ this\neconomic sector through ICT.\n2.3.2. Tourism\nBefore the start of the\
    \ pandemic caused by the appearance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus\n(also known as COVID-19),\
    \ tourism had achieved record ﬁgures in Colombia, reaching\n4,515,932 non-resident\
    \ foreign visitors, growing at a rate greater than the rest of the coun-\ntries\
    \ of the region [134]. Most Colombian departments consider tourism a key factor\
    \ in their\ndevelopment, and for that they have a diverse offer. Although there\
    \ are traditional tourist\nproposals for sun and beach (or coastal tourism) mainly\
    \ in Bolívar, Magdalena, Sucre, and\nSan Andrés—or historical tourism such as\
    \ Cartagena and Mompox (in the department\nof Bolívar), Santa Marta (capital of\
    \ Magdalena), or Popayán (capital of Cauca)—there are\nalso many other alternatives\
    \ such as adventure and ecological tourism in Chocó, Caquetá,\nVichada, and Tolima\
    \ with their jungles and natural reserves, while due to their biodiversity,\n\
    the natural parks and the eastern plains are attractive in the departments of\
    \ the Andean\nregion and the Orinoco, respectively. In addition, the festivities\
    \ and events also attract a\nlarge number of tourists each year, as in the case\
    \ of Barranquilla (capital of the department\nof Atlántico) with its carnival,\
    \ Medellín (capital of the department of Antioquia) with\nthe Feria de las Flores,\
    \ Pasto (Capital of the department of Nariño) with the Carnival of\nBlacks and\
    \ Whites, or Cali (capital of the department of Valle del Cauca) with its fair.\
    \ There\nare also health or medical tourism offers in some cities in Colombia,\
    \ such as in the case\nof Barranquilla, Cali, Medellín, or Bucaramanga (capital\
    \ of Santander). Thanks to the\nsigniﬁcant offer and investment in infrastructure\
    \ and human training, these locations have\nbeen consolidated as suggested destinations\
    \ to perform different types of interventions,\nmainly aesthetic and cardiology\
    \ specialties [135–137].\nThe integration of IoT and 5G could provide great beneﬁts\
    \ to the tourism sector in\nthese regions of Colombia, taking into account that\
    \ despite its potential, many of these\ndepartments of tourism still do not represent\
    \ a signiﬁcant percentage of their economy,\nand therefore, there is a great growth\
    \ opportunity. In this regard, and considering that the\nSensors 2021, 21, 7167\n\
    14 of 26\ntourism industry requires a large amount of information and is increasingly\
    \ dependent on\nICT [138], it is necessary to collect information at all stages\
    \ of a tourist trip or event, so that\nappropriate actions can be taken to satisfy\
    \ customers and improve the competitiveness of\nthis sector. The collection of\
    \ information through IoT systems would help develop practical\napplications for\
    \ the beneﬁt of users such as guided tours, smart shopping, or efﬁcient\ntravel\
    \ management [138,139], as well as to the monitoring of architectural works in\
    \ historic\nbuildings with at-risk infrastructure [140]. It would also allow for\
    \ the implementation of\nalgorithms for predicting user behavior as proposed in\
    \ [141], or be complemented with big\ndata tools so that tourists have a personalized\
    \ experience and are able to make decisions\nabout their trips [142,143]. It would\
    \ also help to improve the experience and safety of\ntravelers who make use of\
    \ extended reality technologies through sensors, as in [144], where\nthey used\
    \ ultrasound transducers that perceive the surrounding environment, providing\n\
    complementary information to augmented reality systems. The 5G network plans to\n\
    offer small-cell and mm-Wave connectivity to tourists at any time and location\
    \ [145]. So-\ncalled “green, ethical, and clean” tourism will best integrate IoT\
    \ with 5G, boosting the\nuse of virtual reality, augmented reality, and AI, thanks\
    \ to the expected high speed and\ncoverage [146].\nIn the Colombian context, virtual\
    \ reality and augmented reality are the technologies\nof current interest in the\
    \ development of prototypes. For example, in [147], they were used\nin the promotion\
    \ of historical sites in Cartagena, or to improve the experience of tourists\n\
    visiting tourist sites in Bucaramanga [148].\nConsidering the transmission of\
    \ large amounts of data, as well as the efﬁcient man-\nagement of a high density\
    \ of equipment in small areas due to the high number of tourists\ntraveling for\
    \ entertainment purposes, meeting in open spaces (beaches, festivals, fairs) or\n\
    in enclosed areas (museums, historical buildings), and also for health tourism\
    \ reasons, it is\nnecessary to measure different variables to connect, monitor,\
    \ and diagnose remotely [149].\nHere, the 5G eMBB application scenario is the\
    \ best option to support the communication\nneeds and information volume in IoT\
    \ applications in the tourism sector.\n2.3.3. Agriculture\nAll DDPs present the\
    \ intention of strengthening the agricultural sector in each of\nthe Colombian\
    \ departments. Due to the geographical characteristics of each of them,\ndifferent\
    \ crops predominate that could beneﬁt from the interaction of IoT, such as cassava\n\
    in the Caribbean and Amazon region, coffee in the Andean region, sugarcane in\
    \ the Paciﬁc\nregion, and rice in the Orinoco region. Despite the hydrological\
    \ potential of Colombia\nand the quality of some of its lands for agriculture,\
    \ this country is regularly affected\nby droughts that originate from natural\
    \ phenomena such as the so-called “Niño”. In\naddition, there are many other factors,\
    \ among which are the appearance of pests, bad\npractices in crops, and little\
    \ techniﬁcation. These factors have an impact on productivity\nand inﬂuence the\
    \ cost of food, putting food sustainability at risk. For this reason, the\nMinistry\
    \ of Agriculture has given recommendations to mitigate the effect of these events,\n\
    including the monitoring of information and alerts issued by the Institute of\
    \ Hydrology,\nMeteorology, and Environmental Studies (IDEAM); an alternate means\
    \ of water supply;\ngenerating alternative mechanisms to shade crops and animals;\
    \ planning irrigation shifts\nfor access to water; constructing reservoirs for\
    \ water storage; and generating plans for pest\ncontrol [150].\nIoT offers many\
    \ options that could help farmers in managing their crops. One such\noption is\
    \ the implementation of low-cost automated irrigation systems that use wireless\n\
    technologies for the purpose of monitoring soil moisture and verifying its operation\n\
    through IoT [151,152]. It is also attractive to develop control technologies for\
    \ irrigation or\nfertigation systems, and to plan the administration of crops,\
    \ which allows for an increase\nin the yield of crops and, at the same time, a\
    \ reduction in environmental risks [153–155].\nAnother possibility is the monitoring\
    \ of the crop or of climatological variables to which\nSensors 2021, 21, 7167\n\
    15 of 26\nplantation managers can access remotely and through different platforms,\
    \ allowing for\nefﬁcient management [156,157].\nWith the speed of data transfer\
    \ offered by 5G, agricultural operations have had a\npositive impact since 2017,\
    \ helping to improve crop management through the use of\ndrones and/or robots,\
    \ the real-time monitoring of variables, and data analysis, among\nmany others\
    \ [158]. Another favorable aspect in this economic sector is the improvements\n\
    introduced in 5G, by reducing IoT implementation costs and increasing its use\
    \ to more\nefﬁciently integrate the agricultural cycle, i.e., from the sowing\
    \ stage to the distribution of\nproducts [159].\nRegarding the Colombian scenario,\
    \ agriculture is possibly the economic and social\nsector where most research\
    \ is being done in relation to IoT applications. For example,\nin [160,161], IoT\
    \ was part of the set of tools used in crop irrigation management, while\nin [162]\
    \ it improved production in a tomato ﬁeld. These and other opportunities for\n\
    implementation in agriculture will be possible with 5G, requiring a great effort\
    \ from the\npublic and private sectors to promote the implementation of new IoT\
    \ projects, with the\n5G mMTC scenario being the most appropriate because it supports\
    \ many nodes deployed\nin large areas of crops. Currently, many rural areas in\
    \ Colombia do not have access\nto cell phone networks or to the Internet as a\
    \ complementary tool in their agricultural\nactivities. To overcome this obstacle,\
    \ the Colombian government has reached agreements\nwith the main mobile telephone\
    \ operators of the country, extending the cellular telephone\nnetwork infrastructure\
    \ to 3658 new rural locations before the end of 2024. This new\ntechnological\
    \ panorama is favorable for projecting new applications that optimize the\nprocesses\
    \ of agricultural activities. Otherwise, without this wireless coverage, the high\n\
    costs of implementing IoT projects in agriculture would be low or nonexistent,\
    \ due to the\ninstallation of the infrastructure [163,164].\n2.3.4. Health\nThe\
    \ health problems of the different Colombian departments are diverse. In some\n\
    departments, among which Norte de Santander, Caquetá, San Andrés y Providencia,\n\
    Córdoba, and Chocó stand out, there are deﬁciencies in health services across\
    \ several of\ntheir respective localities that surround them. In addition, due\
    \ to the extension of their\nterritories and the lack of adequate road infrastructure\
    \ or geography, timely access to health\nprofessionals and medical centers is\
    \ difﬁcult. For example, in Chocó, a large part of the\ntowns that make up this\
    \ department are more than 7 h away from the municipal seats or\nthe capital [112],\
    \ while in Nariño, 40% of the total extension of the department does not\ncount\
    \ with road connection [113], which makes access to doctors, laboratories, or\
    \ hospitals\ndifﬁcult. Another common health problem in Colombian departments\
    \ are respiratory,\ncirculatory, and heart diseases, which occur even in more\
    \ developed departments such\nas Valle del Cauca, Antioquia, and Santander. Health\
    \ systems based on IoT and 5G are a\ngreat opportunity to improve the quality\
    \ of services and increase coverage, especially in\nremote areas of these regions\
    \ where access to health services can be expensive and slow\ndue to the great\
    \ distances to travel. For example, the department of Antioquia in its PDD\nconsiders\
    \ that the activities of telemedicine, prehospital telecare, and remote diagnosis,\n\
    among others, can be effective in improving health care in remote locations [76].\n\
    Real-time monitoring applications using body area networks (WBAN) can become\n\
    indispensable tools, monitoring vital signs of patients located in quarantine\
    \ areas, in high-\ndemand hospital centers, or in remote locations. The data can\
    \ then be sent to IoT devices,\nwhich then forward them to the treating physician\
    \ or diagnostic systems using the 5G\nnetwork [165–168]. Through IoT, it would\
    \ also be possible to monitor patients who have\ntravelled hundreds of kilometers\
    \ to hospital centers, allowing health care workers to know\nvital parameters\
    \ such as heartbeat, temperature, or respiratory rate in advance, making\npossible\
    \ the provision of an efﬁcient service with less loss of time. Some resources\
    \ that are\na part of an intelligent hospital infrastructure and that will dominate\
    \ the health scenario in\nSensors 2021, 21, 7167\n16 of 26\nthe future area include\
    \ telecare assets, networked medical devices, networks, and sensors\ndistributed\
    \ in buildings [165].\nIoT/5G deployment is currently contributing to the rise\
    \ of healthcare applications\nbecause they leverage higher availability, high\
    \ scalability, and low network latency [169].\nIn addition, multi-access perimeter\
    \ computing nodes in 5G provide sufﬁcient compute and\nstorage capacities at the\
    \ edge of the network [170].\nSome prototypes of IoT applications in health care\
    \ have already been implemented\nin Colombia for the remote monitoring of patients,\
    \ as in [171], where large data sets were\nobtained through sensors to perform\
    \ predictive analysis among a group of people with\nhypertension problems, and\
    \ thus designing prevention campaigns; or in [172], oriented\nto the surveillance\
    \ of this same disease. Other projects have been oriented to the remote\nmonitoring\
    \ of patients in hospital centers [173], or even to self-monitoring, in an attempt\
    \ to\navoid traveling to hospitals or clinics [174].\nCritical IoT applications\
    \ in the health sector will be potentiated with the advantages\noffered by 5G\
    \ networks because they demand high reliability and low communication\nlatency,\
    \ being the uRLLC scenario appropriate for the sensitive registration of vital\
    \ signs\ninformation collected by devices used for patients [165,175–177].\n2.3.5.\
    \ Industry\nTable 4 shows that manufacturing-type industries predominate in Colombia,\
    \ mainly\nin departments with greater economic development such as Antioquia,\
    \ Atlántico, Cun-\ndinamarca, Santander, and Valle del Cauca. The modern industry\
    \ increasingly requires\nlow latency, high determinism, high bandwidth, and high\
    \ resilience computing and com-\nmunication; characteristics necessary to implement\
    \ fast, intelligent, and autonomous\ndecision-making [178]. In this sense, IoT\
    \ and 5G are considered technological tools of great\npotential, because industry\
    \ 4.0 is increasingly incorporating wireless connections in the\nmanufacturing\
    \ and logistics of its processes [179]. In addition, an increase is expected in\
    \ the\nnumber of industrial wireless sensors that collect information on environmental\
    \ conditions\nand the processes carried out in the plants, allowing for self-diagnosis\
    \ activities to be carried\nout for the maintenance and operation of the equipment\
    \ [180]. There are also opportunities\nwith industrial production robots that\
    \ can be controlled in the cloud [178], for which 5G\nwill be key in the timely\
    \ exchange of information through high-speed connections [180].\nThe positive\
    \ impact of 5G features on industry offers improved real-time production\nmonitoring\
    \ or information about the status of a piece of equipment or its manufacturing\n\
    process [181]. Some projections indicate that the digitalization of the manufacturing\
    \ indus-\ntry enabled by 5G will offer new production opportunities, increasing\
    \ global manufacturing\nrevenues from USD 52 billion in 2022 to USD 233 billion\
    \ in 2026 [182].\nIn Colombia, the Superintendence of Industry and Commerce presented\
    \ the main\naspects to implement IoT in the industrial sector, speciﬁcally in\
    \ logistics, inventory manage-\nment, and smart factories. It also identiﬁed a\
    \ patent application by a Colombian company\non the issue of tracking for the\
    \ control and traceability of the position and ﬁxed or moving\nlocation of tangible\
    \ objects or merchandise by means of radiofrequency and image recogni-\ntion [183].\
    \ Because industrial services are classiﬁed as critical, it is convenient to make\
    \ use\nof the uRLLC scenario, so that the probability of failure at low latency\
    \ is reduced [184,185].\n2.3.6. Environment\nDeforestation is the predominant\
    \ environmental problem in the regions that make\nup the Colombian territory.\
    \ Figures from the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable\nDevelopment (Minambiente)\
    \ indicate that in 2020, 171,685 hectares of forest were lost in\nColombia as\
    \ a result of deforestation [186].\nSome actions have been carried out with the\
    \ purpose of ﬁnding solutions through\nIoT that allow reducing deforestation levels\
    \ with the implementation of technologies that\ndetect illegal logging and the\
    \ commercialization of wood. Amazon Web Services (AWS),\nin collaboration with\
    \ the Jorge Tadeo Lozano University and the United States Embassy,\nSensors 2021,\
    \ 21, 7167\n17 of 26\nsponsored an event in 2019 where they faced challenges to\
    \ control the production chain,\nand combatted illegal logging and deforestation.\
    \ One of the solutions proposed was based\non IoT, and consisted of tracking the\
    \ record from the moment of extraction to the delivery\nto manufacturers through\
    \ devices installed in trucks [187]. Also, in [188], the advantage of\nIoT aimed\
    \ at preventing illegal deforestation is demonstrated, integrating inclination\
    \ and\nsound sensors to detect the poaching of trees. Regarding forest ﬁres, DDPs\
    \ have identiﬁed\nthem as one of the main environmental problems in Colombia,\
    \ causing serious damage\nto the biodiversity of the areas where they occur, as\
    \ well as deterioration in air quality in\ncities [189]. IoT can also be a part\
    \ of the solution to this phenomenon; more speciﬁcally,\nits application in this\
    \ ﬁeld is a topic widely researched and reported in the literature,\nand, therefore,\
    \ it could serve as an example of implementation to present solutions in\nColombia.\
    \ For example, in [190–192], they used IoT devices with meteorological sensors\n\
    (rain, temperature, humidity, wind speed, CO, CO2) for the detection and prediction\
    \ of\nforest ﬁres, respectively, making timely decisions that help to preserve\
    \ forests and jungles.\nThere is also research on air pollution and environmental\
    \ temperature and humid-\nity monitoring that prefers 5G technology to transmit\
    \ data over the cloud rather than\nZigbee, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi, because of its\
    \ high communication range and low power\nconsumption [193].\nRegarding 5G, a\
    \ wide use of this technology is not reported in applications related to\nthe\
    \ topic discussed in this item. However, if these networks are deployed in the\
    \ future, it\nwould be possible to develop similar projects in Colombia, especially\
    \ with the use of bands\nbelow 1 GHz (700 MHz) that have been considered for use\
    \ in rural areas, because they have\nlower attenuation with respect to other higher\
    \ frequency bands due to the characteristic of\nits wavelength. Also, the mMTC\
    \ 5G scenario is the best option for implementation in IoT\napplications that\
    \ monitor environmental variables in the aforementioned areas of study\nand research.\n\
    The application possibilities of IoT based on 5G are wide and generate a high\
    \ expec-\ntation of development in the Colombian economy and society. Moreover,\
    \ sectors such as\neducation, security, sports, and transportation, among others,\
    \ could also beneﬁt from the\njoint implementation of these two technological\
    \ tools. Figure 4 summarizes the comparative\nanalysis of the possibility of applications\
    \ for each natural region of Colombia.\nFigure 4. IoT/5G applications potential\
    \ summary in natural regions of Colombia.\nSensors 2021, 21, 7167\n18 of 26\n\
    3. Discussion\nIt is evident that 5G represents an important evolution in the\
    \ development of wireless\nnetworks passing from focusing on users, to machines,\
    \ to the industry, and through the\ncloud, within the Internet of Things. Moreover,\
    \ changes are observed in the spectrum\nmanagement with respect to what was done\
    \ by most nations until the deployment of fourth\ngeneration networks, currently\
    \ considering the use of bands above 6 GHz, which brings\nmore bandwidth, but\
    \ also creates challenges in relation to the propagation of radio waves.\nHowever,\
    \ we believe that all of the advantages offered by 5G will not be available before\n\
    September 2022. This is due to the fact that, since 4G is the base that initially\
    \ supports it, the\nlatter is still expanding its deployment in most of the rural\
    \ areas of the Colombian territory,\npromoted by bilateral agreements between\
    \ the state and private companies. Therefore,\nit will be necessary to increase\
    \ regulatory policies that allow operators to expand their\ncoverage, as well\
    \ as incentives for users to acquire the necessary services and equipment to\n\
    implement IoT in different areas of the economy; for example, the current tax\
    \ exemption\nfor the purchase of smartphones that are below approximately USD\
    \ 185.\nThis review shows that there is a wide range of tourism in parks and nature\
    \ reserves,\nwhich, together with agricultural activities, deforestation, and\
    \ major health issues, are more\nrelevant in rural scenarios. Consequently, the\
    \ short- and medium-term use of IoT through\n5G as technological tools to help\
    \ solve challenges in health, environment, agribusiness, and\neco-tourism, among\
    \ others, will depend on different projections and agreements between\nthe state\
    \ and private enterprise, highlighting:\n•\nearly execution of spectrum auction\
    \ processes;\n•\nincentives for operators to deploy infrastructure in areas where\
    \ there is no high purchasing\npower by the population, and little opportunity\
    \ for rapid return on investment;\n•\nrapid regulation for spectrum below 1 GHz\
    \ to be auctioned and promptly used in rural\nareas, to overcome propagation problems\
    \ and the number of antennas that would\nhave to be installed compared to higher\
    \ frequency bands; and\n•\nimplementation of applications in 5G mMTC and eMBB\
    \ scenarios to satisfy the high\ndensity of equipment per square kilometer, as\
    \ well as high transmission rate requirements.\nAs for industrial activities,\
    \ the results of health tourism and events such as trade fairs\nand congresses\
    \ are mainly in large cities. As a result, the following should be considered:\n\
    •\nThe spectrum solution to serve IoT applications in these cases should be oriented\
    \ to\nbands above 1 GHz.\n•\nIn cases of applications that demand a high data\
    \ rate, such as virtual reality and big\ndata for tourism in major urban centers,\
    \ and machine learning in the industrial sector,\neMBB is the scenario that best\
    \ meets this demand, increasing its channel capacity in\nthe future with the use\
    \ of millimeter bands.\n•\nuRLLC is the 5G scenario that best meets IoT applications\
    \ in e-health in hospitals, due\nto its low latency and better performance in\
    \ highly mobile equipment.\nIn the Colombian case, it has been ofﬁcially established\
    \ that the ﬁrst commercial 5G\nnetwork will be available before the end of August\
    \ 2022, with progress being made by\nMinICT in pilot tests and technical regulations.\n\
    Finally, the use of IoT applications with 5G described throughout the document\
    \ is\nan opportunity to increase the economic and social wealth in Colombia, making\
    \ viable\nthe execution of future projects associated with the fundamental demands\
    \ in different\ngeographical scenarios throughout the Colombian territory.\nAuthor\

    14 Sept 2022 Accepted 16 Sept 2022 Published 06 Oct 2022 Abstract Agriculture
    has become more industrialized and intensive due to the rising demand for food
    in quality and quantity. Agricultural modernization will be made possible by the
    Internet of Things (IoT), a technology with a great promise for revolutionizing
    the industry. Agricultural products will be in high demand by 2050 due to a 30%
    increase in the global population, so there is a need to devise new mechanisms
    for agriculture, and smart agriculture is one of those mechanisms; however, smart
    agriculture needs to be explored further to realize its potential fully. So, to
    explore the potential of this field, the researchers have used a corpus that is
    extracted from the Scopus database from the year 2008 to the year 2022 and applied
    the LDA technique. A corpus of 4309 articles was selected from the Scopus database
    to apply the latent Dirichlet analysis (LDA) model to predict research areas for
    smart agriculture. Using IoT technology, farmers and producers may better manage
    their resources, such as fertilizer consumption and the number of trips made by
    farm vehicles, while minimizing waste and maximizing productivity, including water,
    electricity, and other inputs. This data-driven experimental study identifies
    smart agriculture research trends by implementing a topic modeling technique previously
    used in smart agriculture. The authors have created seventeen research themes
    in smart agriculture based on the LDA topic modeling. This analysis suggests that
    the indicated areas are in the growth phase and require further research and exploration.
    1. Introduction Digital technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) are reshaping
    agriculture. When it comes to farming, what is IoT? The IoT connects “dumb” devices.
    IoT is all about data [ 1]. Data is becoming a valuable resource for our world.
    Farmers may become more intelligent and safe by using data from gadgets to adapt
    to changing conditions more readily and farm more efficiently [ 2]. To free up
    resources, farmers can use the ability to monitor agricultural conditions and
    infrastructure from afar [ 3]. Many sectors and industries have adopted IoT to
    reduce errors and improve performance in manufacturing, energy, health care, and
    communication [ 1]. Farm devices can collect and deliver data remotely to their
    owners using IoT. Farmers can save time and money using IoT to keep tabs on-farm
    operations and efficiency, make more informed decisions about boosting productivity,
    and respond more quickly to changing conditions. In this case, it is putting data
    ahead of the farmer’s intuition [ 2]. A trough’s water supply, the amount of fertilizer
    to use on a crop, and which ewe to check when lambing are all things a farmer
    could know about. Smart agriculture is necessary since 70% of the farming time
    is spent monitoring and analyzing crop status rather than performing actual field
    labor [ 3]. Given the industry’s size, it needs various technology and precise
    solutions to ensure sustainability while reducing environmental damage. Sensors
    and communication technologies have provided farmers with a remote sight of their
    fields, allowing them to watch what is happening without leaving home. Wireless
    sensors make monitoring crops in real-time with greater precision and, more importantly,
    detecting the early stages of undesirable conditions easier [ 4]. This is why
    “smart agriculture uses innovative equipment and kits from seeding to crop harvesting,
    storage, and transportation. The operation is smart and cost-effective due to
    its accurate monitoring capabilities and prompts reporting using a variety of
    sensors. Various autonomous tractors, harvesters, robotic weeders, drones, and
    satellites supplement agriculture equipment [ 5]. Sensors can be instantly deployed,
    started collecting data, and made available for further online study. By enabling
    precise data collection at each area, sensor technology allows crop and site-specific
    agriculture”. IoT and its apps are only scratching the surface of what they can
    do and have yet to impact people’s lives significantly, and everyone can see this.
    However, given the recent rise in IoT technology in agricultural applications,
    we can expect it to play a significant role. Figure 1 summarizes the key factors
    driving agricultural technology.    Figure 1  Technology’s key drivers in the
    agriculture industry. There are reasonable efforts to emphasize the importance
    of IoT in agriculture; most published work [ 6] focuses solely on applications.
    However, in light of the most recent facts and data, most current publications
    either give little insight or place a limited emphasis on diverse IoT-based designs,
    prototypes, advanced approaches, IoT for food quality, and other future issues.
    The current state of IoT-based agriculture research is examined in this paper.
    Farmers are either delaying or refusing to change their traditional techniques,
    which might further depress India’s GDP. Recently skilled migrants from all across
    India who returned to their homelands during the COVID-19 pandemic selected farming
    as a profession and had no plans to return. These migrants may move closer to
    smart agricultural systems since it takes less time to persuade them to use them
    than traditional farmers. (i) Remote monitoring of agricultural infrastructure
    and conditions can save farmers time and labor by reducing the frequency of on-site
    field inspections (ii) Farmers benefit from data analysis (iii) Gaining insights
    from real-time data throughout a value chain allows farmers to respond faster
    to market requests (iv) The food manufacturing process should improve efficiency
    to lower food waste, speed up the time to market, and improve traceability. This
    will allow us to demonstrate to our consumers that our food is safe and sustainable
    (v) Research, development, and adaptation to new technologies ensure continued
    productivity and innovation The first objective of this study is to do a meta-analysis
    of the collected corpus. The second objective is to forecast the present research
    areas and trends as 2, 5, and 10 topics, as highlighted in Table 1. The third
    objective is to examine in-depth the current research trends to assist future
    researchers in determining the correct research directions in the field of smart
    agriculture. Table 1  Topic labels and high-loading research articles. 2. Review
    of Literature IoT is revolutionizing agriculture by bringing together various
    approaches, such as accuracy and conservative farming, to help farmers overcome
    obstacles in the field. Jayaraman et al. [ 7] discussed using IoT, cloud computing,
    mobile computing, and smart agriculture to develop a “phononet” system, an open
    system of wireless sensors that share information and communicate. For many years,
    devices presently labeled as IoT have been deployed in agriculture. The Bosch
    technology corporation provides IoT-based data management strategies to monitor
    agricultural yield and diseases [ 8]. A platform based on IoT developed by Intel
    helps agricultural solutions operate more efficiently by improving the interoperability
    of services [ 9]. As part of the MIT Media Lab Open Agriculture Initiative, Google
    has shared its vision for a more sustainable food system [ 10]. For efficient
    seed planting, “sensors and vision-based technology” help determine the distance
    and depth. An autonomous robot named Agribot is being developed to sow seeds using
    sensors and a vision-based [ 11]. Technology and economic sustainability go hand
    in hand. A study was conducted in Pakistan to determine the commercial viability
    of a proposed crop insurance plan and assess the demand for crop insurance in
    various flood-prone rural districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province [ 12]. Additional
    research revealed that farm households in the study area faced several barriers
    to adapting to climate variability, including a lack of labor, an insecure land
    tenure system, a lack of market access, poverty, a lack of governmental support,
    a lack of access to assets, a lack of water sources, a lack of credit sources,
    and a lack of knowledge and information [ 13]. One study found a link between
    poverty reduction and natural and social capital for sustainable livelihood. The
    research provides empirical and quantitative evidence on poverty alleviation,
    and the conclusions will improve agricultural households’ sustainability [ 14].
    A study also uses natural and agricultural resources in Northwestern Pakistan
    to create a livelihood vulnerability index (LVI), LVI-IPCC, and livelihood effect
    index [ 15]. Further, several noncontact sensing methods for determining the seed
    flow rate are proposed in [ 16], “where the sensors were equipped with LEDs, infrared,
    visible light, laser-LED, and a radiation reception element”. The output voltage
    fluctuates depending on how the seeds move through the sensor and band of light
    rays and how the shades fall on the reception parts [ 17]. Therefore, the seed
    flow rate is calculated based on the signal information about the passing seeds.
    Researchers offer an expert system for evaluating the viability of agricultural
    land in a 2019 study by combining sensor networks with artificial intelligence
    systems such as neural networks and multilayer perceptron [ 18]. The proposed
    method is intended to assist farmers in categorizing agricultural land for cultivation
    into the most suitable, suitable, somewhat suitable, and unsuitable categories.
    In a recent study, researchers used citrus fruits data labeled by a domain expert
    with four severity levels (high, medium, low, and healthy) to train a deep neural
    network (DNN) model to detect disease by severity [ 19]. The model has a 98% likelihood
    of predicting low severity and a 98% chance of predicting high seriousness. In
    a subsequent study, the author takes advantage of blockchain’s potential benefits,
    combines it with SDN, and provides justification for worries about energy consumption
    and security [ 20]. In the most recent survey, authors applied the same blockchain
    technology integration technology to different platforms. LDA was used to anticipate
    blockchain research trends. The researchers have predicted 17 scientific trends
    that deserve more attention. According to the literature, LDA approaches anticipate
    smart agriculture research trends [ 21]. The researcher created a novel routing
    protocol for IoT networks with a cluster topology using a blockchain-based architecture
    for the SDN controller. The research concepts of the existing state of the art
    and its differentiation from the current state are represented in Table 2. Table
    2  Existing and current research differentiation. 3. Topic Modeling Data mining
    is an emerging field to extract data from unstructured formats. Topic modeling
    is a powerful technique in text mining in natural language processing to explore
    the relationship between the data and collected documents [ 22]. This technique
    is used by various researchers in their native fields, like medical, semantic
    analysis [ 23], and engineering [ 24], to conclude the relationship between the
    documents and topics. Techniques like latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), nonnegative
    matrix factorization (NMF), latent semantic analysis (LSA), parallel latent Dirichlet
    allocation (PLDA), and Pachinko allocation model (PAM) were used in the topic
    modeling; among all, LDA is intensively used by researchers. The topic modeling
    technique is similar to the dimensionality reduction technique used for numerical
    data. A bag of words (BOW) is created from the dictionary of words, and topic
    modeling extracts the required features from this BOW. The words contained in
    the corpus are viewed as a significant feature in NLP. NLP considers each word
    as a feature to train the model. This technique helps us find the right content
    instead of analyzing the accurate data. LDA is used to attain a relationship among
    the documents in the collected dataset, and results are represented statistically
    and graphically. To develop LDA, variational exception maximization (VEM) algorithm
    [ 25] is used to estimate the similarities from the corpus. Usually, the top few
    words are picked up from the BOW as this approach lacks semantics in the sentence.
    LDA follows the concept of probabilistic distribution, so each document in the
    corpus portrays the probabilistic distribution of topics, and each extracted topic
    depicts the probabilistic distribution of words. It led to concluding a clear
    vision of the topic connection. LDA is applied to retrieve critical information
    or analysis from unstructured data. For example, research on social media makes
    users understandable reactions and conversations among the people connected in
    social media to conclude the patterns [ 26]. 4. Methodology The stepwise procedure
    of whatever tasks have been completed is affectingly explained, which picture
    quality defines our research methodology to predict the research trends of IoT
    agriculture. The methods used to conduct this review are depicted in Figure 2,
    in which three phases are involved. The first phase of research is data collection;
    in the second phase, collected data is preprocessed; finally, in the third phase,
    data is analyzed, and results are depicted.    Figure 2  Proposed methodology.
    4.1. Corpus The primary sources of data collection and formation of the research
    corpus were the various online digital libraries, journals, and conference proceedings
    available to users through Google Scholar. The search keywords for digital libraries
    have been selected based on topic selection. The research works of Sehra et al.
    [ 27] have influenced them to experiment. The search phrases identified were “IoT
    agriculture”. Scopus is considered the most extensive database for published articles
    globally. The string is run on the Scopus platform, and 4803 articles were extracted
    from the Scopus database. The specific keywords in the publication’s title, abstract,
    and keywords were collected by searching for them in various databases. Further
    processing required inclusion and exclusion criteria to finalize the corpus, so,
    for inclusion criteria, we considered the research papers published in English
    only. Then, the studies concerning IoT agriculture were only considered. Under
    the exclusion procedure, we excluded and removed those studies published in different
    native languages. In addition, studies having missing information like author,
    abstract, title, and year were excluded from the corpus. After applying the requirements,
    4309 studies were considered for the current research. Figure 3 represents the
    year-wise growth in article publication in IoT agriculture. It is clear from Figure
    3 that after 2015 there has been tremendous growth in publications. The leading
    publication is in 2021, 26.43% of the total corpus; in 2020, 21.95% of an article
    was published. In 2022 as per data, there is 0.07% publication, which can be increased
    by the end of the year.    Figure 3  Year publication analysis. This area of research
    is published in various reputed journals. Some top-rated journals or dominating
    journals in IoT agriculture are shown in Figure 4. Dominating journal analysis
    shows maximum participation from the Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,
    which has 134 articles having 0.031%, and this journal belongs to Springer, having
    H-Index 48 and 0.66 as its impact factor.    Figure 4  Dominating journals analysis.
    4.2. Preprocessing It is a preliminary step that processes the dataset or the
    information collected. The objective of preprocessing is to discard the extraneous
    information inside the information. Preprocessing removes unwanted words and characters
    from the accumulated or collected corpus and improves the dataset’s quality. As
    a result, the profile of further processing becomes more accurate and acceptable.
    In the collected corpus, the author used four types of data for LDA modeling:
    title of the paper, year of publication, journal of published article, abstract,
    and keywords of the documents. Further, abstract and keywords are combined under
    the same column. A sample of the loading corpus is shown in Table 3. Table 3  Sample
    of loading dataset. The first step to performing on the uploaded corpus is to
    token the words so that all the abstracts per title are tokenized into tokens.
    The generated tokens are then transformed into lowercase letters for each document.
    In tokenization, the focus is on removing the punctuation marks, single characters,
    and other special characters like “;”, “,”, “.”, “/”, “\”, “brackets”, “!”. Further,
    any equation or formula used in the abstract was removed. Also, the numerical
    values were eradicated to get a full-fledge textual token [ 28]. Finally, after
    tokenization, the words which have no meaning are removed. The stop words are
    the commonly used words such as “the”, “if”, “but”, “a”, or “an”. These words
    take up space in our corpus and consume valuable processing time. Thus, it becomes
    crucial to remove these stop removals, and here in our experimentation, we have
    used Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). This toolkit has stop words stored in more
    than sixteen languages. Here, the English-language stop words in the NLTK library
    and other phrases used to build the corpus were removed from the corpus [ 29].
    Further, stemming is reducing a word to its word stem. Stemming is essential in
    natural language understanding and natural language processing, endeavoring to
    extract the root or core word that is usually appended with the English suffixes
    and prefixes. It erases all the extraneous parts in the word and sources out the
    accurate, meaningful word. For example, use is the core word that can be extracted
    by stemming the word useless, useful, and uses. To prepare an adequate corpus,
    words stem from their original form using the Snowball stemmer algorithm [ 30],
    and the resulting base keywords are stored in the cleansed corpus. Finally, the
    words which were previously stemmed need to be lemmatized. Lemmatization is when
    the context is considered, and stemmed words are converted into more meaningful
    base words or lemmas. This phase targets removing inflected words and outputs
    the dictionary form of a word [ 31]. 5. Latent Dirichlet Allocation Latent Dirichlet
    allocation (LDA) is the most popular technique in NLP, so data is fed to the LDA
    model after preprocessing. Before sending data, bigrams and trigrams are removed
    from the corpus. Two words that occur together are named bigrams, like human resources,
    and the three words frequently occurring together in the document are termed trigrams,
    like human resource management. The LDA model is implemented in python language,
    where the genism library has been used to remove such phrases. Genism’s phrases
    model can build and identify these bigrams, trigrams, quadgrams, or even -grams
    [ 32]; thus, we can remove and improve the data cleansing process. It is also
    part of preprocessing, so after completing this stage, data is sent to the LDA
    model for further analysis [ 49, 67]. LDA topic modeling is based on three input
    parameters, one of which is a list of topics, and the other is hyperparameters.
    Before the distribution of a document’s topic content is the magnitude of the
    Dirichlet. This parameter is regarded as several “pseudowords” equally distributed
    across the document’s topics, regardless of how the document’s other words are
    assigned to topics. is per-word-weight of Dirichlet prior over topic-word distributions.
    The value for this experiment is taken as , where is the desired number of topics
    [ 33], and the has been fixed as 0.01 for all topic solutions. For identifying
    two, five, and ten topic solutions, as suggested by [ 26], the number of iterations
    considered is 1000. Thus, initializing these parameters becomes a concern as the
    values can define the distribution of high-quality topic results. The bag of words
    (BOW) extracted is initially processed in LDA topic modeling, where the most frequently
    and least frequently occurring are removed so the corpus can become absolute.
    This study removes a word frequency of more than 5000 from BOW. The top 20 frequently
    occurring words from the corpus with their frequency are shown in Figure 5, as
    it is clear from the graph that the most occurring keyword is the system, use,
    sensors, internet, agriculture, and many more.    Figure 5  Top 20 words from
    corpus with frequency. Hyperparameters are optimized using Python’s mallet library,
    a JAVA-based NLP package. Then, the mallet package extracts the desired topics
    by training the model using BOW. Unfortunately, no official or proven measure
    exists to find the optimal number of solutions [ 27]. Still, some observational
    parameters are given by Cao and Arun, which helps the researcher decide the optimal
    number of keys [ 55, 68]. Furthermore, the choice of the topic solution has been
    influenced by the heuristics and findings of the studies [ 55, 61, 68, 69]. Finally,
    -mean clustering algorithms are used to find the optimal number of topics from
    the BOW. 6. Topic Labeling Once the topics have been extracted with the help of
    the LDA model, each topic is labeled manually based on the key terms of each topic.
    As a result, there are 4309 articles in the corpus, and out of all documents,
    the top five high-loading papers and their contribution to the topic are mentioned
    in Table 1. 7. Result Analysis 7.1. Parameters of Topic Solutions The loadings
    for two, five, and ten topic solutions have been acquired by deploying the LDA
    model and are presented in Table 1. The selection of two, five, and ten topic
    solutions is based on a coherence score and is influenced by the previous studies.
    The coherence score plays an essential role in finding the semantic similarity
    between the key terms in the topic, and ideally, a 0.3 to 0.6 coherence value
    is considered a good score [ 81]. In this study, coherence values achieved are
    good; for two topic solutions, 0.62; for five topics, 0.58; and for ten topic
    solutions, 0.52 coherence value is reached. Therefore, five topic solutions are
    considered optimal based on coherence value. The dominance of each topic solution
    is also supported by the corresponding count of articles it covers. Table 4 summarizes
    the count of year-wise publications corresponding to each topic solution. Table
    4  Year-wise publication analysis for 2, 5, and 10 topic solutions. The initial
    choice of two topics will broadly depict the core research areas that have been
    widely covered by the researchers in the compiled research literature. Further,
    in five topic solutions, the researchers have explored the research areas. Therefore,
    we have depicted in detail the research areas studied in five topic solutions.
    Further in the hierarchy, the five topic solutions have widened into ten topic
    solutions, with new areas emerging as the research trends in GHRM. 7.2. Topic
    Labeling The core research zones explored and discovered based on the two topic
    solutions are depicted in topics T-2.1 and T-2.2. Let us discuss how this labeling
    has been performed. While implementing LDA on two topic solutions, the keywords
    and their loading has been extracted. The extraction results of LDA depict the
    high-loading articles per topic and the high-loading terms or keywords per topic.
    The labeling process is based on the high-loading keywords that have been collected.
    Thus, in the table, the labeling per topic solution corresponds to the terms extracted
    under the heads T-2.1, T-2.2, and so on; it goes for five and ten topic solutions.
    7.2.1. Core Research Area The two topic solutions present an abstract view of
    the literature dataset and divides it into “Security and Privacy in Smart Agriculture”
    (T-2.1) and “Monitoring and Control System in Agriculture” (T-2.2). These two
    significant labels depict the research areas the researchers have extensively
    explored. (1) T-2.1: Security and Privacy in Smart Agriculture. Agriculture has
    shaped human civilizations since ancient times. Rapid information and communication
    growth affects agriculture’s structure and operation (ICT) [ 82]. Despite advances,
    hazards may be significant, so smart farming must grasp security and privacy challenges
    before contemplating cyber attacks. Smart farming uses devices, protocols, and
    computer ideas to modernize agriculture. Digital farming changes everything and
    creates effective, efficient, sustainable, and open systems [ 83]. Mobile devices,
    precision agronomy, remote sensing, big data, cloud analytics, cyber security,
    and intelligent systems simplify agricultural technology integration. Incompatibility,
    heterogeneity, equipment constraints, processing, and data security may threaten
    smart farming, but recent years have increased usage of ICTs in agriculture [
    84]. Physical risks and concerns may impede agriculture’s deployment, but agriculture
    4.0 will be the new agriculture standard [ 85]. Simultaneous research is also
    going on in the area to secure smart agriculture. Technology has added to environmental
    problems—list agriculture’s physical threats by category. Population increase,
    urbanization, aging, and technical developments in food production all affect
    agriculture and farmers. Agriculture’s most significant physical hazard is weather
    [ 86]. External factors continually threaten agriculture. In recent decades, technology
    has reduced its influence. Agriculture apps need stable connections, IoT networks,
    and cloud computing [ 87]. External factors continually threaten agriculture.
    In recent decades, technology has reduced its influence. Agriculture apps need
    stable connections, IoT networks, and cloud computing. The sensors can malfunction,
    causing erroneous readings and instructions that could cause a manufacturing failure.
    Temperature, humidity, obstructions, and human presence can impact Lora WAN, Zigbee,
    and other agri-wireless networks, causing data loss. Sensors and networking equipment
    are usually exposed [ 88]. (2) T-2.2 Monitoring and Control System in Agriculture.
    New techniques, technology, and approaches have also helped in agriculture. 35%
    of the world’s workforce works in this profession. Agriculture helps many economies
    to grow [ 89]. It boosts industrialized nations’ economies. India is the second
    largest country that deals in this profession. Every country has practiced agriculture
    since ancient times. Businesses and other areas must support agriculture’s tech
    transformation. The future population rise is frightening. Mid-20th century population
    may have surpassed nine billion counts, so agriculture needs to be strengthened
    to meet the flooding needs. Agricultural engineering challenges include drainage,
    irrigation, crop scheduling, and bio-system optimization. The lack of agricultural
    technology to monitor and manage systems or machinery likely causes these problems.
    The report says control approaches increased seedling growth [ 90]. IoT helps
    in the process of modernizing the agriculture segment by gathering farming data.
    IoT-based agricultural monitoring system wirelessly communicates and disseminates
    the sensor data. Global agriculture uses 70% of available fresh water each year
    to irrigate 17% of the land [ 91]. Growing food requirements and global warming
    reduce irrigated land, a challenge in plague agriculture. FAO predicts global
    food production must rise by 70% to meet population and urbanization needs. Modern
    agriculture uses robotics, automation, and computer systems to replace challenging
    human jobs, so expanding agriculture needs new technologies to be included [ 92].
    Future agricultural technology includes robotics and machine vision. In addition,
    population growth will increase the demand for resources and products. “Sustainability”
    is blended into social, economic, and technological problems to address environmental
    conservation and economic development, and information and control systems will
    be crucial [ 93]. 7.2.2. Five Topic Solutions: Research Areas (1) T-5.1: Intelligent
    Disease Detection Models. India’s economy is mainly based on agriculture. Agriculture
    accounts for 16% of India’s GDP and exports. More than 75% of India’s population
    depends on agriculture. Healthy, high-quality agriculture is essential for economic
    prosperity [ 94]. Detection of plant disease is critical at an early stage. Plants
    can become ill while growing. Early illness diagnosis is a challenge in agriculture.
    Researchers first demonstrated cutting-edge machine learning methods for identifying
    plant illnesses [ 95]. Training parameters are used in modern systems but require
    powerful computers or lengthy training and prediction durations to work. Convolutional
    auto encoder (CAE) network prediction features have been reduced while preserving
    accuracy in this research. Thanks to technological advancements, the world’s population
    of 7 billion people can be fed [ 96]. Changing climates, declining pollinators,
    and plant diseases threaten the ability to produce enough food. Plant diseases
    endanger the livelihoods of smallholder farmers who depend on healthy crops [
    97]. Despite declining yields, smallholder farmers in developing economies provide
    more than 80% agricultural output. Methods for preventing disease already exist
    [ 98]. Pesticides have been replaced with integrated pest management (IPM). Early
    diagnosis is essential for successful therapy. Agricultural extension organizations
    and local plant clinics have long supported disease detection thanks to their
    computer power, high-resolution displays, and broad accessory sets, such as HD
    cameras. Smartphone diagnostics are a first-of-its-kind technology. 5-6 billion
    mobile phones will be in use by 2020. More than two-thirds of the world’s people
    now have access to mobile broadband, a 12-fold increase since 2007 [ 99]. (2)
    T-5.2: Data Security Challenges in Smart Agriculture. Technology, equipment, protocols,
    and computer paradigms are all used to enhance agricultural operations in smart
    agriculture. Big data, artificial intelligence, the cloud, and edge computing
    all store and analyze the data in various forms of storage and archiving. As a
    relatively new field, smart agriculture lacks adequate data security measures
    [ 84]. Farming’s future relies heavily on the availability and quality of data,
    which necessitates the need for security. To maintain security in smart agriculture,
    managing data compatibility, resource constraints, and massive data processing
    [ 100]. Agricultural systems may not be well suited to traditional IoT security
    solutions, resulting in unique demands and possibilities. New agricultural projects
    have been developed to keep up with population increase and food production. The
    success of agriculture depends on productivity, era-specific restrictions, and
    the advancement of science and technology. A lot may go wrong regarding smart
    agriculture, which is still in its infancy. In the future, farmers will rely heavily
    on the availability and quality of data to help them; thus, developing secure
    and stable systems is critical [ 101]. The growth of the agriculture generation
    is depicted in Figure 6, in which agriculture 1.0 started in 1784. In the 20th
    century, agriculture 2.0 came into existence. In 1992 agriculture 3.0 was started,
    and in 2018 agriculture 4.0 if followed.    Figure 6  Agriculture generation.
    Smart agriculture uses IT to increase information perception, quantitative decision-making,
    intelligent control, suitable investment, and personal service [ 102]. In addition,
    current technology boosts agricultural yield and improves security and privacy
    [ 103]. There are both advantages and disadvantages to using automation in smart
    agriculture. Computer-aided farming uses contemporary technology and procedures,
    so in the future, “digital agriculture” will be more productive, efficient, sustainable,
    inclusive, transparent, and resilient agriculture. Many different types of agricultural
    technology may be used in conjunction with one another to increase efficiency
    and productivity [ 104]. (3) T-5.3: Smart Monitoring System in Agriculture. Rainfall
    and temperature fluctuations are very unpredictable. Climate-smart farming is
    becoming increasingly popular among Indian farmers. IoT enables smart agriculture.
    It saves water, fertilizer, and agricultural yields. IoT-enabled automated systems
    and wireless networks are expanding industries. Thus, research into integrated
    sensor technology and the usage of IoT networks in agriculture is reaching the
    level [ 105]. (4) T-5.4: Production and Supply Chain Management in Agriculture.
    The growth of the supply chain and the movement of information are driven by the
    gathering of materials, the transformation of products, and the delivery to end-users.
    Information-driven, “connected supply chains” enable organizations to reduce inventory
    and expenditures; increase product value; extend resources; expedite time to market;
    and retain consumers, among other benefits [ 106]. Supply chain performance determines
    how healthy activities are linked to maximizing customer value and profitability
    at each process stage—the end-user benefits from an efficient supply chain. Several
    agricultural supply chains in India are problematic owing to issues in the agriculture
    industry [ 107]. Many factors affect the agri-food supply chain, including small
    and marginal farmers, disjointed supply chains, a lack of economies of scale,
    subpar processing, value addition, and fewer marketing options. Supply chain management
    is expanding into logistics by creating new divisions integrating manufacturing,
    procurement, transportation, and distribution [ 108]. Information flow visibility
    has increased because of advancements in telecommunications, electronic data interfaces,
    and other technologies. Animals and plants are used in agriculture to produce
    products that benefit human health. For example, agribusiness produces textiles
    and paper. Throughout the supply chain, the needs of customers are met. Organizations
    in the agricultural supply chain, such as cooperatives, distribute produce, fruits,
    grains, pulses, and products derived from animals [ 109]—a network of businesses
    that make goods and services for the end-user. There are several benefits to establishing
    a supply chain network, such as shifting risk and profit from one company to another.
    Quality is ensured by openness and accountability in the process. Quality is dependent
    on transparent processes and responsibilities at each stage of the process. The
    price and performance of transfer payments are crucial to the success of process
    chains. (5) T-5.5: Cost-Effective Communication System in Smart Agriculture. Low-cost
    solutions like crop rotation, green manuring, and mulching have cut cultivation
    expenses while saving soil and water. Legumes, weed control, and increased agricultural
    diversity are nonmonetary inputs [ 101]. Climate change, global warming, saltwater
    intrusion, desertification, and a lack of arable land have increased worldwide
    worries about food safety and security. Connectivity-of-Things applications require
    steady internet [ 110]. In the Mekong Delta and HCMC, climate change threatens
    food security. Drought and saltwater intrusion in the South and Central Highlands
    in early 2016 demonstrate the vulnerability and susceptibility of unsustainable
    agriculture. Agriculture may be more efficient and safer thanks to a new Farming
    system. Vietnam may become a smart and sustainable farm by modernizing, boosting
    productivity, and ensuring quality. Businesses in Vietnam have shared their know-how
    with companies in other countries. Another important factor to consider is the
    safety of the food being prepared. When deciding which meals are good for you
    and the environment, most people have no idea where to begin. Concerns about food
    safety have given rise to new ideas like “city farms” and “growing your veggies
    at home” [ 111]. However, the economic sustainability of these models must be
    thoroughly explored. Researchers are currently focusing on developing an IoT-enabled
    agriculture system. Increased productivity, quality, and safety may be achieved
    via this method [ 82]. 7.2.3. Ten Topic Solutions: Research Trends (1) T-10.1:
    Greenhouse Monitoring System. Most Indians work in agriculture, contributing to
    the country’s economy—agriculture benefits from technological advancements. However,
    pesticides are used to grow most fruits and vegetables since contemporary farming
    methods cannot keep up with demand. As a result, conventional farming practices
    contend with weather and disease. Although crop yields may be increased by altering
    agricultural practices [ 112] because of urbanization and land scarcity, farming
    must be done in greenhouses. Temperature, humidity, light, water content, pH,
    and wetness are all shown via LEDs in the greenhouse. The goal is to create an
    intelligent greenhouse. Greenhouse temperature and humidity may be adjusted automatically
    using programmable modules and low-cost and high-efficiency options [ 113]. Soil
    water content, light intensity, temperature, and humidity may be adjusted. In
    greenhouse crop production, the appropriate growth conditions must be changed
    to achieve high yields, low costs, improved quality, and the lowest environmental
    impact. To attain these goals, proper heating and ventilation must be maintained.
    Using a greenhouse is more dependable, but it is also more difficult [ 114]. Temperature
    and timing controls had previously improved crop quality. Many control devices
    and systems lack automation and efficiency in today’s dynamic and competitive
    environment. A variety of complicated models depict the greenhouse effect. Costs
    increased, plans became more complex, and more control was required. The usage
    of computers in greenhouses has increased during the last decade. These components
    are necessary for a control system. Sophisticated microelectronic hybrid circuits
    boost sensor manufacturing. Advances in product quality and dependability enable
    commercial competitiveness. Each sensor’s performance is determined by its calibration
    and sensing processes. It will be impossible to automate some jobs even in the
    far future. Several American businesses have yet to automate fully, maybe due
    to cost concerns [ 115]. (2) T-10.2: Service-Based Industry for Smart Agriculture.
    Technical advancement has been driven by the widespread use of IT and its adaptability
    in satisfying various requirements. Service-based agriculture (SBA) is widely
    utilized in multiple industries. Farming systems that make it easier for farmers
    to do their work. A large-scale service smart agriculture systems link buses to
    a hotel, hospital, logistics center, restaurant, grocery store, or traditional
    market. With SBA, material sales partners may easily share information about their
    products with one other fast. As a result of SBA, Indonesia will see an increase
    in its economy, as quoted in one study. Over time, the importance of information
    technology has grown. The production of farms has increased thanks to the adoption
    of contemporary technology [ 116]. Many people are familiar with the predicament
    of Indonesian farmers. The significance of variables cannot be overstated. Farmers
    have a fear of technology. Farmers in Indonesia may be able to increase their
    abilities and produce food for the country’s population by utilizing new technologies.
    Brokers are often used to resell the produce of Indonesian farmers. Small-scale
    farmers in Indonesia were hurt by brokers who gambled on the price of agricultural
    goods [ 117]. Prices for components are rising. Broker fraud inflated market values.
    Brokers save agricultural products, giving the impression that the market is oversupplied
    and driving up the price of food. When chili prices climb and there is a shortage,
    many brokers refuse to buy from growers. The growing cost of food in Indonesia
    might harm the country’s economy. Farmers must be able to sell their products
    directly to consumers. The direct distribution offers farmers an easy way to market
    their products. Wholesalers buy agricultural goods from farmers at inexpensive
    rates [ 118]. To get their goods to market, farmers must rent a vehicle. Commodities
    no longer impact farmers’ earnings with a long processing time. Indonesians rely
    heavily on their smartphones to get information. Technology can help farmers become
    food wholesalers. Local markets and restaurants might be fed using this method
    by farmers. The Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing support agriculture’s
    food supply and distribution systems [ 119]. Nowadays, nanotechnology is also
    used in agriculture to improve yields and reduce waste. (3) T-10.3: Cloud-Based
    Smart Applications in Agriculture. Smart farming uses technology to increase production
    and improve product quality. For example, the Internet of Things-based smart agriculture
    automates crop inspections and watering. Database traffic and data cannot be handled
    by a cloud-based IoT-based system. As a result, there is less lag, the battery
    lasts longer, and the money and information are better managed [ 120]. In many
    cases, the edge for IoT may provide significant advantages, such as removing the
    need for interval and geometric communications efficiency. High interface automation
    in IoT activities may achieve reduced latency and faster processing. This simulator
    replicates the sting, edge, and fog of IoT. IoT-based edge computing is more immediate,
    cost-effective, and efficient than traditional computer systems [ 121]. In cities,
    these strategies are ineffective. Rural locations are where they are most commonly
    used. Robots should be used in agriculture. The field is navigated using the GPS
    on the tractor. Agribusiness in the 21st century is anything but digital or computerized.
    Monitoring crops and animals with sensors, GPS-enabled tractors, image processing,
    and machine learning is possible. Edge computing reduces the amount of noise in
    the raw data it analyses which can be cleaned using data mining techniques [ 122].
    On the other hand, Broadband networks are more cumbersome and difficult to standardize.
    After sensors are installed, data is automatically collected. We can identify
    if animals or birds are active, inactive, unwell, healthy, submissive, or dominant.
    We may alter their treatment, living circumstances, medicine, and food to suit
    their needs [ 123]. (4) T-10.4: Energy-Efficient Smart Transmission System. An
    intelligent electrical infrastructure that satisfies society’s sustainability
    and energy efficiency demands is called “smart infrastructure” Customers and utility
    providers will benefit from the smart grid’s ability to monitor their energy use
    better and link the power grid with micro-networks. As a result, there is a danger
    to data security and privacy. Economic growth depends on the availability of electricity,
    which boosts productivity and sustains quality of life. Global economic development
    and electricity usage are depleting the world’s energy resources [ 124]. The smart
    grid’s core assumption is to minimize resource depletion and promote economic
    growth through energy efficiency and management technologies. Demand management
    lowers transmission and distribution system stress and high-demand overhead lines.
    Several countries have used industrial and commercial demand response strategies
    to boost their economies. Direct load limiting often reduces peak demand [ 125].
    Direct load management may result in a decrease in customer satisfaction—direct
    load management. Consumers and utility companies benefit from reduced peak demand
    when loads are shifted. However, the electrical system’s stability and dependability
    are compromised during periods of high energy demand. The smart grid and load
    modeling need to limit peak energy use. Trouble ensues when demand exceeds supply.
    From 2019 to 2030, India’s population and development demands are expected to
    grow by 50 percent [ 126]. A transmission system that can endure interruptions
    and blackouts must meet these criteria. Grid operators must regularly monitor
    supply and demand to avoid power outages. To fix this problem, load shedding disconnects
    specific customers’ electricity. Generators must be turned down to prevent blackouts
    if supply and demand are out of sync. Smart grids can identify problems early
    on and immediately resolve them. Sensors monitor the grid and manage the flow
    of current. These are computerized to increase productivity [ 127]. (5) T-10.5:
    Smart Solutions for Modern Farming. Sustainable food production is in high demand
    as the world’s population expands and weather patterns shift. Agriculture and
    development go forward as time goes by. Agricultural technology is advancing rapidly.
    These new technologies are pretty effective, but they must be constantly improved.
    Using information and communications technology, planting, watering, and harvesting
    are all enhanced. Many fields, including agriculture, benefit from technological
    advancements. The Internet of Things (IoT) in agriculture is referred to as “smart
    farming” [ 128]. Produce and livestock will be healthier thanks to IoT-enabled
    smart farming. Real-time information is provided through wearables and sensors
    in the field. Shelter, clothing, and food have been top priorities for humanity
    since the dawn of civilization. There is a lot of modernity in the house and clothing.
    According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), humanity’s food requirements
    will rise by 70% by 2050, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization
    (FAO) [ 129]. IoT can be used to solve problems in business and technology. Tractors
    are used to plant seeds and gather crops. You can use it for business or yourself.
    Farming is done with the help of tractors. Farmers can do other things when they
    use tractors that drive themselves. A Polish company called Agribot makes tractors
    that can work independently. When they pull weeds, their tractors have sensors
    that reduce the number of chemicals and pesticides exposed. Agro-IoT devices can
    meet the needs of farming in the future. Traditional agriculture must become more
    productive and less risky for the global economy to grow. IoT helps growth. Farmers
    can keep an eye on their land with the help of the Internet of Things. IoT applications
    include keeping an eye on climate change, managing water, keeping an eye on land,
    improving productivity, keeping an eye on farming, and keeping track of pesticides
    and herbicides [ 130]. (6) T-10.6: Smart Irrigation System for Agriculture. The
    most difficult chore in agriculture is watering fields. Water systems consist
    of drips, nozzles, tubes, and sprinklers, among other things. As a whole, agriculture
    has a positive impact on economic activity. Watering by hand is required. Gardening
    and soil deterioration are both covered in rainfall. Agriculture’s key objectives
    are the production of food and livestock. IoT is a network of interconnected devices
    that can exchange data [ 131]. When water supplies are limited, automatic irrigation
    may be necessary. According on the weather, irrigation might be done continuously
    or intermittently. As a result, there is less spillage. Almost all of the water
    comes from drip irrigation or sprinklers. With a wireless gadget, soil moisture
    and humidity may be monitored. In agriculture, controllers manage everything from
    power to intruder detection to pump switching [ 69]. A pump is used to deliver
    water to the ground. Water is conserved when drippers are used. Drip irrigation
    and flood irrigation are both standard irrigation methods. Both all of the sensors,
    pumps, and controls work as expected. Manual watering may hurt or deplete crops
    and the environment. Automated irrigation systems can be used to address the difficulties.
    Farming may benefit from drip irrigation, which saves on water. Automatic irrigation
    systems for crop management have become widespread during rainstorms, landscaping,
    and soil erosion. Wi-fi sensors are used to gauge the humidity and moisture content
    of the soil. In agriculture, controllers keep an eye on the electricity, keep
    an eye out for intruders, and manage the pumps. Saturating the soil is accomplished
    with the use of pumps. Using drippers saves water, therefore reducing the amount
    of water used. Floatation irrigation commonly utilizes electricity, sensors, pumps,
    and controls [ 132]. (7) T-10.7: Blockchain-Based Security System for Agriculture.
    There are nodes in a blockchain, and each node has its own distributed ledger,
    allowing several nodes to read and amend a single ledger while preserving shared
    control. Each blockchain node contains a distributed ledger that is safe and accessible
    to all participants. There are no middlemen to authenticate, track, store or synchronize
    transactions using blockchain technology. According to several research studies,
    blockchain has altered technology from centralized to decentralized and distributed
    networks, a shift that has been well documented. The blockchain helps business
    networks [ 133]. Business networks are composed of companies or individuals that
    trade assets. Products, materials, and equipment are examples of physical assets.
    A distributed ledger may be used to move assets across the network by anybody
    who is a member. The most recent ledger is available to all members. Consensus-based
    distributed ledgers and smart contracts foster network confidence. Assets and
    transactions are recorded in the distributed ledger. Transactions are possible
    with a distributed ledger. You cannot remove a transaction after it has been added.
    An encrypted ledger prevents tampering with transactions. With blockchain, the
    distributed ledger is transformed into a reliable data source for the network
    [ 134]. A distributed ledger of digital commerce is known as a blockchain. Each
    node of the network modifies distributed ledgers through cryptography. Components
    of a blockchain include its block header, timestamp, nonce, and Merkle root hash.
    Smart apps are being developed for rural agriculture. Agricultural modernization
    relies on ICT to automate processes and protect personal data. Data from many
    IoT devices may be sent to a central hub to analyze and manage autonomous farm
    activities. However, centralized intermediates are inherent in a single point
    of failure, data loss risk, and man-in-the-middle attacks. Thanks to smart contracts
    on the blockchain, decentralized and safe agricultural automations are now possible
    [ 135]. (8) T-10.8: Production-Based Smart System for Agriculture. It is possible
    to increase productivity and quality by using IoT-based agricultural convergence
    technologies. Predicting demand, managing supply, and ensuring quality are benefits
    of precision agriculture. The expansion of the economy is mainly fueled by agriculture.
    The government is responsible for protecting the land [ 136]. Nothing has changed
    despite advances in science and technology. There is no shortage of green technologies.
    Farmers need to reduce the time they spend working and increase the precision
    they use their resources. Complex statistical methodologies are used by agriculturalists
    when analyzing historical data and making economic predictions. Farm yields are
    improved via GPS, sensors, and big data. Real-time data from ICT-based decision
    support systems can take the role of farmers’ knowledge and intuition [ 137].
    Improved decision-making reduces the amount of waste and increases efficiency.
    Images, GPS, science-based solutions, climate forecasts, technology, and environmental
    controls play a role in agriculture. As with the terms “smart meters” and “smart
    cities,” “smart farming” refers to any M2M application. Technology advances to
    aid in harvest forecasting. However, predictions based on statistics are not always
    accurate. Harvest data and the agricultural environment should be correlated.
    IoT will provide agricultural data. Complex statistical methodologies are used
    by agriculturalists when analyzing historical data and making economic predictions.
    Predicting crop yields is aided by the use of smart systems. In the end, statistical
    forecasts are not perfect; they are only a starting point. Make a connection between
    the agricultural environment and harvest data. Crop pattern data will be provided
    through IoT-based decision support. On IoT, agribusiness utilizes data mining,
    statistical forecasting, and IoT services [ 138]. (9) T-10.9: Industry 4.0 in
    Agriculture. Global agriculture must undergo a paradigm shift in light of evolving
    environmental conditions, dietary preferences, and a scarcity of critical inputs.
    It is all about the latest advancements in agriculture. As a result of the adoption
    of Industry 4.0, businesses may expect to see advances in output, efficiency,
    and creativity. First, agriculture provides food for the world’s population. Second,
    agriculture 4.0 decreases labor and environmental effects to increase agricultural
    profitability by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and water use. Third, agriculture
    is the primary source of income for half of India’s population, India’s veins
    and arteries [ 139]. The fourth stage of industrial development is large-scale
    agriculture. Among the essential ICTs is the IoT. Flexibility is improved in “smart
    factories.” People, equipment, and software work together to satisfy production
    demands, which are met through cutting-edge technology such as CPS/IoT/iOS and
    real-time interaction. The industry benefits from consolidation. However, future
    manufacturing and commerce will be harmed. This shift is made possible due to
    the Internet and information technology [ 140]. Quality control encompasses all
    aspects of engineering, management, manufacturing, operations, and logistics.
    Costs, availability, use of resources, and market demand may all be automated.
    ‘The implementation of Industry 4.0 will profoundly impact the agriculture and
    industrial sectors. All technologies like Big Data, AI, and IoT are part of Industry
    4.0. IoT allows agricultural systems and equipment to connect with one another,
    making Industry 4.0 a game changer in agriculture [ 141]. The fourth industrial
    revolution created networked tractors, farms, and manufacturing equipment [ 142].
    “Industry Revolutions 4.0” refers to three factors: (1) Digitalization and its
    integration into simple economical and technical networks (2) Digitalization of
    services and products (3) Market models that have been updated As economic, economic
    and business models develop, humans become more distant from the center of production
    and surveillance of crops. Industry 4.0 is being used by both developed and developing
    countries. India has a lot of untapped potential for agricultural growth. Robotics,
    IoT, and e-business are the three pillars of this revolution, aiming to deliver
    technology to every corner of the globe. (10) T-10.10: Image-Based Classification
    Techniques in Intelligent Agriculture. Agriculture originated thirteen thousand
    years ago between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers north of Iraq. Gathered vegetation
    included wild wheat and others. Few people needed food. UN estimates that the
    world’s population will reach 10 billion by 2050, impacting farmers. Desertification
    and urbanization wreak havoc on farmland. COVID-19 is a threat to food security
    and the nation’s economy. To solve this problem, we need to use fewer people to
    generate more food [ 143]. In certain parts of India, rainfall is the only irrigation
    water supply. However, crop destruction can occur in some places due to unpredictability
    in rainfall, which is a problem. Management of watersheds is critical. Many-variable
    hydrological modeling is required to predict rainfall and runoff in different
    basins accurately. Estimates of imperviousness necessitate a terrain categorization,
    which ultimately categorizes land use and cover [ 144]. The image classification
    curve number is used in modeling. Satellite pictures are difficult to classify
    because of their high resolution and wide range of applications. Nevertheless,
    images are a common practice in agriculture and water management. There are a
    plethora of tools and methods for classifying images. ANN and SVM are used for
    image classification [ 145]. Techniques used to organize pictures traditionally
    are time-consuming and prone to human error. With pattern recognition, alternate
    ways can reduce time and enhance accuracy. Unlike Bayes’ discriminant criteria,
    SVM multiclassification outperforms. 8. Threats to Validity This analysis is based
    on LDA topic modeling and has bounded to the limitations of this topic modeling
    technique. A sufficient article count has been achieved, yet the risk of missing
    out is a concern. The bibliographic material has also been inferred. The search
    string insufficiency has been eradicated appropriately due to the limitations
    of selected search terms, synonyms, string formulation, and search engines’ variedness
    resulting in imperfect retrieval of literature corpus. Labeling topics is a significant
    concern due to subjectivity and bias. According to the author, a deep discussion
    has been conducted to determine the label best to overcome this limitation. Then,
    based on critical terms, labels have been formulated to draw the best topic labels
    for researchers and practitioners. 9. Conclusion Using IoT technology, farmers
    and producers may better manage their resources, such as fertilizer consumption
    and the number of trips made by farm vehicles, while minimizing waste and maximizing
    productivity, including water, electricity, and other inputs. In IoT smart farming
    systems, sensors monitor the agricultural field and automate the irrigation system.
    Farmers can monitor their fields from anywhere. This paper concluded the research
    direction in smart agriculture and farming. Technology has shaped agriculture’s
    history. Historians have identified several agricultural revolutions that changed
    practice and output. Technological advances have fueled these revolutions. The
    Industrial Revolution mechanized agriculture, improving farm labor productivity.
    Modern mechanized agriculture has replaced numerous farm activities by hand or
    by oxen, horses, and mules. Weather forecasting and barbed wire were 19thcentury
    advances. Portable engines and threshing machines became popular after improvements.
    In the 20thcentury, synthetic fertilizers and insecticides, mass-produced tractors,
    and agricultural aircraft for aerial pesticide application were developed. Precision
    farming, disease monitoring, agricultural drones, satellite imagery, and sensors
    are just ways technology makes farming easier for farmers. Intelligent software
    analysis for pest and disease prediction and soil management are only a few of
    the many analytical activities that IoT-based sensor networks may do. New issues
    in smart farming include the security of the farming data, technical failures,
    and technical incompetence. 10. Future Work The LDA model works like a recommender
    system. The current research is based on extracting keywords from the documents
    and recommends current and trending research areas based on the correlation of
    the keywords in the specified field. So, in the real-time scenario, any corpus
    of any size can be passed to the model to get the relevant keywords, and based
    on these keywords, suggestions for topics can be depicted. The authors have used
    this model on smart agriculture in the current research. In contrast, this model
    can also be implemented in other research fields like smart cities, blockchain,
    and Wireless Sensor Networks. In this study, the authors analyzed data retrieved
    from the Scopus database instead of Web of Science, Education Resources Information
    Center, ScienceDirect, or the Directory of Open Access Journals. However, the
    authors chose the Scopus database over these other databases because Scopus has
    more excellent coverage of publications, demonstrating that it is a comprehensive
    and dependable data source and so justifying its eligibility for this review.

    LAN Interfaces is essential for every manufacturer developing devices and sensors
    for the Internet of Things. (PRE-SALE OFFER available. Please contact IEEE for
    a custom quote at onlinesupport@ieee.org). Scope: The Internet of Things is predicted
    to consist of billions of devices by 2020. Many of these devices will run on batteries.
    To prolong the useful life of these batteries, while making sure devices don’t
    stay in a sleep state too long and run slowly, devices must be able to run in
    a low-power, low-latency state. Wake-Up Radio, which is being developed by the
    IEEE 802.11ba working group, offers a solution to this challenge. Purpose: Wake-Up
    Radio is part of IEEE s standard: IEEE Std 802.11 (i.e., Wi-Fi(R)) and is being
    developed by the IEEE 802.11ba standards task group. Devices (like sensors) periodically
    wake up from sleep to receive information to maximize battery life. The longer
    the device stays asleep the less power it consumes, but the less information it
    can exchange (so it takes longer to exchange information latency.) In today''s
    devices, low power consumption and low latency are conflicting goals. To increase
    battery life, a device needs to sleep more = increased latency.To exchange data
    with low latency, a device needs to sleep less = shorter battery life. IEEE Technology

    Metrics Abstract: Problems regarding agriculture have always been deterring development
    and the introduction of cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) into agricultural
    is considered the next step in the modernization of agriculture. Various solutions
    are available and they offer important features for monitoring agriculture processes
    and facilities, but the accuracy and relevance of the measured values still represent
    a big concern when it comes to making decisions based on the analysis of gathered
    data. In this paper, we make an overview of the problems regarding IoT-based telemetry
    for agriculture and asses two market-ready solutions (Adcon and Libelium) for
    a co-dependent statistic measurement of their accuracy and performance. Using
    relevant statistic indicators on a variate set of measured metrics, we made an
    appreciation of the correlation between the measurements of those two solutions
    and appreciated the relevance of the measured values. Published in: 2018 International

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Bucharest, Romania SECTION I. Introduction
    In recent years, there has been a growing interest of the governments around the
    world in the progressive adoption of smart metering technology at homes, by promoting
    the agreement with the industries and adapting their regulations. A telemetry
    system includes automatic measurement and transmission of data from one location
    to another, mainly due to the inaccessibility of the source to be monitored directly.
    The application domains of these systems extend to health care, vehicle automation,
    energy utilities, aerospace and defense, wildlife, agriculture, and oceanography,
    among others. Smart telemetry, also known as smart metering refers to electronic
    devices that periodically record the consumption of resources (such as electric
    energy, water, or gas), and at least once a day transmit that information to the
    software used for monitoring and billing. One such decision-making platform can
    only be as good as the data you feed it with. In order to properly assess and
    evaluate what to do with this information, one needs relevant data from experiments,
    and not from the nearby city center, where meteorological stations are usually
    located. The continued requirement for cloud-based services, scalability and interoperability
    are believed to be the driving factors for the global telemetry market [1]. Cloud
    computing and IoT are two hot concepts newly emerged from the last few decades.
    They are the hard-core of information technology industry of the new generation.
    Not long after President of the U.S., Barack Obama put forward the concept of
    smart plane in 2009, Chinese Premier Wen raised the development idea of sensing
    Europe, which mainly emphasized the development of IoT and strategic new industries.
    Internet of Things is closely related to cloud computing in the sense that it
    obtains powerful computing tools through cloud computing while cloud computing
    finds the best practicing channel based on IoT. Cloud computing is a method which
    enables shared hardware and software information to be delivered to computers
    and other network equipment on demand [2]. End users do not need to know the basics
    of cloud computing or have any professional knowledge concerning this all they
    need to know is what kind of resource they require and how to receive relevant
    service through the Internet. Cloud computing describes a new way of using, adding
    and exchanging IT service based on the Internet which involves providing dynamic,
    expandable and most of the time virtualized resources over the Internet [3]. The
    following five features of cloud computing are: on-demand service, Internet access,
    resource pooling, rapid elasticity and calculability. Current technological advances
    in low power integrated circuits and wireless communications have made available
    efficient, inexpensive, and low power miniature devices for use in remote sensing
    applications. All these factors combined have improved the viability of using
    a sensor network consisting of many intelligent sensors, making them able to collect,
    process, analyze, and disseminate valuable information, collected in many kinds
    of environments [4]. Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is a network protocol
    that works on top of the TCP/IP protocol. It was designed for connections with
    remote locations where a code is required, or the network bandwidth is limited.
    The protocol uses a publish/subscribe architecture pattern in comparison to HTTP
    with its request/response paradigm. Publish/Subscribe is event-driven and enables
    messages to be delivered to clients. The central communication point is the MQTT
    broker, which is responsible for dispatching all messages between the senders
    and the legit receivers. Every client that declares a message to the broker includes
    a topic into the message. This topic acts as the routing information for the broker.
    Each client who wants to receive messages subscribes to a particular topic, and
    the broker will deliver all messages with the matching topic to that client. Therefore
    the clients don''ts have to know each other, they only communicate over the topic.
    In comparison to MQTT, REST (Representational State Transfer) simply provides
    a client-server application used for requests and replies, useful for systems
    in need to communicate over the Internet, and cannot implement publish-and-subscribe
    message exchanges. The novelty of the work is to analyze and compare existing
    cloud of things environments in order to implement decision making services for
    the agriculture domain. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section
    II presents related work for smart agriculture, Section III discusses technical
    description on ADCON telemetry stations, Libelium stations and problems related
    to agriculture, Section IV presents the experimental data and lastly, Section
    V concludes the paper. SECTION II. Related Work The concept of smart agriculture
    has been around for some time now. The purpose of this paper is making agriculture
    smart using automation and IoT technologies. This paper gives information about
    field activities, irrigation problems, and storage for smart irrigation system
    and smart warehouse management systems respectively [5], monitoring the crop-field
    using soil moisture sensors, temperature and humidity sensors, light sensors and
    automated irrigation systems [6]. MQTT implements a plain and slight device data
    collection solution. Therefore, only limited interoperability between MQTT publishers
    and subscribers can be assured. There can be an exchange of messages between different
    MQTT implementations excepting the format of the message body, which is agreed
    between peers. MQTT is a message-centric wire protocol created for M2M communications
    that allows the transfer of telemetry-style data in the form of messages from
    devices, with high latency or strained networks, to a small message broker [7].
    The MQTT protocol is agile, power efficient and provides different levels of QoS
    (Quality of Service). The protocol rotates around the concept, where clients might
    publish updates or subscribe for receiving the updates from other clients. The
    MQTT community claims that a publisher and subscriber protocol is exactly what
    is required to build an authentic IoT environment [8]. RESTful style architectures
    include clients and servers where clients trigger requests to the servers, servers
    take action on these requests and reply with appropriate responses [9]. RESTful
    architectures might be established on other Application Layer protocols if they
    already implement a rich and orderly vocabulary for functions established on the
    transfer of meaningful representational state [10]. A surplus of IoT middleware
    platforms has lately come across in the marketplace. Examples include UBIDOTS
    [11], Xively [12], Thing Speak [13] Open. Sen. se [14], Sensor Cloud [15] and
    most latest, Amazon IoT [16] and IBM IoT platforms. These IoT middleware platforms
    intend to clear the injection of data from all kinds of sources (physical devices,
    human input, online data, etc.) by using an Application Programming Interface
    (API). All similar platforms consistently provide essential functionalities for
    filtering and assembling the data, as well as specification of events based on
    input data. Although the IoT platforms in this category provide tools for data
    ingestion, storage, and computation, the benefits of such platforms in smart agriculture
    through message passing interfaces applying message queues and publish/subscribe
    mechanisms are yet to be determined [17]. SECTION III. Technical Description Adcon
    and Libelium stations represents the main components of our implementation which
    are responsible to measure the level of the sensors for environmental protection.
    A. Adcon Telemetry Stations. a 753 Gprs Adcon Telemetry equipment is being successfully
    utilized in agriculture, hydrometrics, irrigation control systems, meteorology,
    water and air quality measurements, water management systems, measurement of renewable
    energy potential, plant disease management etc [18]. The sensors that ADCON stations
    support are: temperature relative humidity, solar radiation, wind speed, wind
    direction, barometric pressure, leaf wetness, soil temperature and precipitation.
    The remote telmetry unit (RTU) is thus responsible for transmitting the data through
    radio waves from the site back to the master station at the gateway, as it was
    used in viticulture [19]. B. Libelium Stations. Smart Agriculture Pro 4g Libelium
    stations are utilized for analyzing the level of pollution - air pollution, agricultural,
    noise, water, meteorology, water management systems, measurement of renewable
    energy potential, plant disease management, etc [20]. The sensors that Libelium
    stations support are temperature relative humidity, solar radiation, wind speed,
    wind direction, barometric pressure, leaf wetness, soil temperature, precipitation,
    luminosity, ultraviolet radiation The data from these sensors are stored in the
    Libelium''s gateway, called Meshlium [21]. C. Problems Related to Agriculture
    There are many different issues in this area. Some major problems that investigate
    the use of technology are described below [22]: •: IrrigationIt is significant
    in those areas where rainfalls are not sufficient to fulfill the crop water requirements
    [23]. Water shortage is becoming a global problem and this persuades the need
    for proper use of water which is that it should only be provided to those places
    where it is critically needed and in a required quantity [24]. Besides, that water
    wastage is also desired to be minimized. To cope up with these issues, many different
    mechanisms of irrigation are in use, like drip irrigation, sprinkler irrigation,
    etc [25]. The main purpose of various methods of irrigation is controlled water
    distribution at the required places in case the water could be saved without compromising
    the crop water requirements. To find out the amount of water required at a specific
    location on an instance of time, Information Technology (IT) is playing a vital
    role in providing different solutions [26]. •: Pesticide and Fertilizer ApplicationUse
    of fertilizers and pesticides at an appropriate location and quantity maximizes
    the productivity of the yield. Application of fertilizers could be performed using
    various techniques which includes broadcasting, placement, and foliar application
    [27]. Distribution of required quantity of fertilizer at appropriate place is
    a challenging task. Implementing unnecessary amount of fertilizers may decline
    the quality of water as well as could support the growth of algae. Pesticide application
    is a treatment of organism (e.g., crop) from possible damages by other plants,
    fungus, insects or animals. Timing, quantity, and location of application are
    very cautious in case of pesticides spraying. The use of technologies is becoming
    a great support in dealing with timing, quantity control, and finding proper location
    in demand for pesticides and fertilizers [28]. •: Crop, Soil and Climate MonitoringKnowing
    the condition of the crop, soil, and climate is essential for farmers as their
    decisions to irrigate the crop, spray pesticide, apply fertilizer, etc. are based
    on their current state. Remote sensor networks technology is strongly in use to
    get the local microclimate measurement as well as to measure soil attributes and
    the plant state. The connection of technologies is also providing the gain in
    having a mix of various local and global specialties to take a good decision.
    SECTION IV. Experimental Data In order to have a proper view of the comparative
    measurements of the, ADCON and Libelium telemetry stations, those were installed
    in the same analytical perimeter. The communication protocol and data transmition
    modalities for ADCON and Libelium telemetry station are presented in the table
    I. Table I Data transmision and communication protocol A fixed period for environmental
    analysis has been set. The data acquired from the sensors was centralized into
    a database and was used to highlight the sensor events, based on timestamps and
    sensor types. The variation of the values for the measured parameters (temperature,
    relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, global radiation, wind direction and
    wind speed) are presented in the next figures (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4,
    Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8). Fig. 1 Variation of atmospheric pressure Show
    All Fig. 2 Variation of solar radiation Show All Fig. 3 Variation of precipitation
    quantities Show All Fig. 4 Variation of relative humidity values Show All Fig.
    5 Variation of soil moisture values Show All Fig. 6 Variation of temperature values
    Show All Fig. 7 Variation of wind direction Show All Fig. 8 Variation of wind
    speed values Show All From the analysis of these figures, it can be concluded
    that the values measured by the two stations, ADCON and Libelium, are comparable,
    which means that both smart agricultural stations are correlated and valid. The
    results of the statistical analysis of the parameters measured with ADCON and
    Libelium are shown in Table II. Table II Statistic values for the selected parameters
    The statistical values (mean, standard deviation and Pearson correlation coefficient)
    indicate a close correlation between the two datasets and show a very good agreement
    of the measured values with the both station (ADCON and Libelium). SECTION V.
    Conclusion In conclusion, the probes from ADCON and Libelium stations have different
    structures, but the values of the parameters monitored are comparable, and there
    is a good correlation between them. These correlations highlight the usefulness
    of ADCON and Libelium deployments in the field of agriculture, thus we can see
    this way the soil water mix, or the meteorological parameters necessary for the
    development in healthy plant conditions. Data are transmitted through different
    gateway A850 for ADCON and from the Meshlium gateway for Libelium, but all the
    measured data are well correlated. These values determined at the two monitoring
    stations of the climatic parameters, highlight the importance of their use in
    the crops life cycle. The existence of these data transmission systems highlights
    the knowledge of the soil-plant-atmosphere interactions needed to optimize agricultural
    production. Parameters such as soil humidity give information if the crop needs
    irrigation and how much water it needs to be administered. As a result of the
    measurements made on: air and soil temperature, rainfall, atmospheric pressure,
    relative air humidity, solar radiation, wind speed and direction, information
    is obtained to optimally manage the development of agricultural crops. The energy
    efficiency of these stations comes from the fact that they are powered by solar
    panels and irrespective of the time you can make continuous measurements. Future
    work will investigate the security of the IoT systems. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work

    \ \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \n            It is important for farmers to explore multiple\
    \ sources of information to gain a  \ncomprehensive understanding of the role\
    \ of technology in small agricultural projects. By \nstaying informed, farmers\
    \ can make informed decisions and leverage technology \neffectively to improve\
    \ their agricultural practices. \nThe role of technology in precision farming\
    \ projects: \n         Technology plays a pivotal role in precision farming projects,\
    \ which aim to optimize \nagricultural practices by precisely managing resources\
    \ and reducing waste. Here are some \nkey roles of technology in precision farming:\
    \ Global Positioning System (GPS): GPS \ntechnology is integral to precision farming.\
    \ GPS allows farmers to accurately determine \nthe geographic location of their\
    \ fields and equipment. By using GPS receivers, farmers \ncan precisely navigate\
    \ their machinery, create digital maps of their fields, and track the \nlocation\
    \ of specific crop areas. This information forms the foundation for various precision\
    \ \nfarming practices. Remote Sensing and Imaging: Remote sensing technologies,\
    \ such as \nsatellite imagery, aerial drones, and sensors, provide valuable data\
    \ for precision farming. \nThese technologies can capture high-resolution images\
    \ and collect data on crop health, \nvegetation indices, soil moisture, and temperature.\
    \ By analyzing this data, farmers can \nidentify variations within their fields\
    \ and make informed decisions regarding irrigation, \nfertilization, and pest\
    \ management. \n            Variable Rate Technology (VRT): VRT enables farmers\
    \ to apply inputs, such as \nfertilizers and pesticides, at variable rates based\
    \ on the specific needs of different areas \nwithin a field. This technology uses\
    \ data from soil sensors, GPS, and remote sensing to \ncreate prescription maps\
    \ that guide machinery to apply the right amount of inputs in each \nlocation.\
    \ VRT minimizes over-application, reduces input costs, and ensures optimal \n\
    resource utilization. Automated Machinery and Equipment: Precision farming relies\
    \ on \nadvanced machinery and equipment that are equipped with sensors, actuators,\
    \ and GPS \ncapabilities. These machines can perform tasks with high accuracy\
    \ and consistency. For \nexample, automated seeders can precisely place seeds\
    \ at the desired depth and spacing, \nwhile sprayers can apply pesticides only\
    \ to the targeted areas, minimizing drift and \nwastage. Internet of Things (IoT):\
    \ IoT technology enables the collection of real-time data \nfrom various devices\
    \ and sensors on the farm. IoT devices, such as soil moisture sensors, \nweather\
    \ stations, and crop health monitors, provide continuous data streams that help\
    \ \nfarmers monitor and manage their crops more effectively. Farmers can access\
    \ this data \nremotely through mobile apps or web-based platforms, allowing for\
    \ timely decision-\nmaking. \nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN AGRICULTURE AND\

    \ Management Systems: Precision farming generates \nvast amounts of data, and\
    \ technology facilitates the analysis and interpretation of this data. \nAdvanced\
    \ data analytics techniques, such as machine learning and predictive modeling,\
    \ \ncan uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within the data. Farm management\
    \ systems \nintegrate data from multiple sources, such as yield monitors, weather\
    \ data, and input \napplication rates, to provide farmers with comprehensive insights\
    \ for decision-making. \nUnmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs): Drones equipped with\
    \ specialized sensors and \ncameras are used in precision farming for crop monitoring,\
    \ mapping, and scouting. UAVs \ncan quickly collect high-resolution imagery of\
    \ crops, detect stress factors, and identify \nareas of concern, such as pest\
    \ infestations or nutrient deficiencies. This information helps \nfarmers take\
    \ targeted actions and optimize their crop management practices. By \nleveraging\
    \ these technologies, precision farming projects can improve resource \nmanagement,\
    \ optimize inputs, reduce environmental impact, and increase overall farm \nefficiency.\
    \ The integration of data, analytics, and automation empowers farmers to make\
    \ \ndata-driven decisions, maximize yields, and ensure sustainable agricultural\
    \ practices. \nUse of technology in farm management systems: \n            Technology\
    \ plays a crucial role in farm management systems by providing farmers \nwith\
    \ tools and platforms to streamline and optimize various aspects of their agricultural\
    \ \noperations: Data Collection and Monitoring: Technology enables farmers to\
    \ collect and \nmonitor a wide range of data related to their farming operations.\
    \ This includes data on \nweather conditions, soil moisture levels, crop growth,\
    \ pest infestations, and equipment \nperformance. Sensors, IoT devices, and automated\
    \ data collection systems facilitate the \nreal-time collection and transmission\
    \ of data from the field to a centralized system.  Data \nIntegration and Analysis:\
    \ Farm management systems integrate data from multiple sources, \nallowing farmers\
    \ to gain a holistic view of their farm. This integration includes data from \n\
    sensors, machinery, weather stations, and other relevant sources. Advanced data\
    \ analytics \ntechniques are employed to analyze the collected data, identify\
    \ trends, correlations, and \nanomalies, and generate actionable insights for\
    \ decision-making. \n                  Task and Resource Management: Farm management\
    \ systems help farmers \norganize and schedule tasks efficiently. These systems\
    \ can create digital task lists, assign \nresponsibilities to farm workers, and\
    \ track the progress of various activities. By optimizing \ntask management, farmers\
    \ can ensure that operations are carried out in a timely manner, \nreducing delays\
    \ and improving overall productivity. Inventory and Input Management: \nTechnology\
    \ facilitates the management of farm inventory, including seeds, fertilizers,\

    \ \n \n6 \n \npesticides, and other inputs. Farm management systems can track\
    \ inventory levels, \ngenerate purchase orders, and provide alerts when stock\
    \ levels are low. This helps farmers \nmaintain adequate supplies, avoid stockouts,\
    \ and minimize waste or overuse of inputs. \n          Financial Management: Technology\
    \ plays a crucial role in farm financial \nmanagement. Farm management systems\
    \ can track income and expenses, generate \nfinancial reports, and help farmers\
    \ analyze profitability and make informed financial \ndecisions. Integration with\
    \ accounting software and online banking platforms allows for \nseamless financial\
    \ management, budgeting, and cash flow tracking. Equipment \nMonitoring and Maintenance:\
    \ Farm management systems can monitor the performance \nand health of farm machinery\
    \ and equipment. By integrating with sensors and equipment \nmonitoring systems,\
    \ farmers can receive alerts and notifications about maintenance needs, \nmalfunctions,\
    \ or potential breakdowns. This proactive approach helps prevent equipment \n\
    downtime and reduces repair costs. \n           Record Keeping and Compliance:\
    \ Farm management systems enable farmers to \nmaintain detailed records and documentation\
    \ required for regulatory compliance and \ncertification standards. This includes\
    \ records of pesticide applications, irrigation \nschedules, crop rotations, and\
    \ other farming practices. By automating record keeping, \nfarmers can easily\
    \ access and retrieve information when needed, ensuring compliance and \nfacilitating\
    \ audits. Decision Support and Planning: Farm management systems provide \nfarmers\
    \ with decision support tools and planning capabilities. By analyzing data, these\
    \ \nsystems can offer recommendations on optimal planting times, crop rotation\
    \ strategies, \ninput application rates, and other farming practices. This helps\
    \ farmers make data-driven \ndecisions, improve efficiency, and optimize resource\
    \ allocation. The use of technology in \nfarm management systems enhances productivity,\
    \ efficiency, and sustainability by \nenabling farmers to make informed decisions,\
    \ optimize resources, automate tasks, and \nstreamline operations. These systems\

    \ \nAbstract \nIn recent times, there has been an increasing imperative to embrace\
    \ Circular Business Models (CBM) as an indispensable \nmeans for enhancing businesses.\
    \ Nevertheless, existing academic discourse rarely investigates the complex relationship\
    \ \nbetween the Internet of Things (IoT) and CBM. This research paper initiates\
    \ its investigation by identifying four pivotal \nIoT capabilities, namely monitoring,\
    \ tracking, optimisation, and design evolution, all of which are instrumental\
    \ in \nenhancing the performance of CBM, as grounded in the ReSOLVE framework.\
    \ Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic \nReview and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)\
    \ guidelines were employed for systematic literature review in order to scrutinise\
    \ \nhow these identified IoT capabilities contribute to the core concepts of the\
    \ 6R-CBM and CBM-IoT cross-section \nheatmaps and relationship frameworks. Finally,\
    \ a comprehensive examination of the challenges impeding the \nrealisation of\
    \ IoT-enabled CBM is presented. The findings of this study reveal that Loop and\
    \ Optimise business models \nare the predominant subjects of current research\
    \ endeavours. IoT emerges as a pivotal player in these business models, \nprimarily\
    \ through its tracking, monitoring, and optimisation capabilities. In contrast,\
    \ there is a noticeable absence of \n(quantitative) case studies pertaining to\
    \ Virtualize, Exchange, and Regenerate CBM. Notably, IoT exhibits the potential\
    \ \nto limit energy consumption significantly. However, it is essential to acknowledge\
    \ that impediments associated with IoT \nhardware, software, protocol energy consumption,\
    \ interoperability, security, and financial investments may pose \nsubstantial\
    \ challenges to the broader adoption of IoT within the CBM. \nKeywords: Circular\
    \ business model; PRISMA; Internet of Things; ReSOLVE framework \n1. Introduction\n\
    1.1. Brief Historical Background of IoT \nThe term \"Internet of Things\" (IoT)\
    \ originated from one of the executive directors associated with the Auto-ID Center\
    \ \n[1]. The concept of networking devices has fostered the idea that machines\
    \ can function seamlessly as an integrated \nsystem, minimising potential disruptions\
    \ caused by human interfaces, which may lead to errors or time inefficiencies.\
    \ \nIt facilitates robust communication between the physical and digital realms\
    \ across diverse domains, augmenting the \nsophistication of products, operations,\
    \ and services within the value chain by offering innovative solutions to enhance\
    \ \ntheir performance. IoT harnesses internet-based wireless technology to connect\
    \ all devices, enabling interactions that \nenhance functionality. Furthermore,\
    \ through the deployment of sensors, devices can acquire an awareness of their\
    \ \nsurroundings, transmitting substantial volumes of real-time data. IoT has\
    \ the potential to exert a considerable influence \non the supply chain by optimising\
    \ resource utilisation, improving transparency and visibility throughout the entirety\
    \ of \nthe supply chain, enabling real-time supply chain management, streamlining\
    \ supply chain operations, and bolstering \nthe adaptability of the supply chain\
    \ [2]. \nWorld Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, 2023, 20(01), 808–824\
    \ \n809 \nIn 2005, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) characterised\
    \ the IoT as the third phase in the \ntransformation of the global information\
    \ industry. Subsequently, in 2008, the Federal Communications Commission \napproved\
    \ the utilisation of the \"white space spectrum,\" as documented by Suresh et\
    \ al. in [3]. Following this, prominent \ntechnology leaders such as Cisco, IBM,\
    \ and Ericsson embarked on numerous educational and commercial ventures \ninvolving\
    \ the IoT. Furthermore, certain nations, including China, incorporated the IoT\
    \ into their long-term strategic \nplans as a pivotal emerging technology, as\
    \ indicated by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) in \n\
    2012 [4]. \nThe Internet of Things (IoT) technology can be briefly described as\
    \ establishing connections among humans, computers, \nand objects. It relies on\
    \ an array of information-sensing equipment, including RFID, infrared sensors,\
    \ global positioning \nsystems, and laser scanners, among others, to link any\
    \ object within an Internet Protocol (IP) framework, assigning each \na unique\
    \ IP address for information exchange and communication. This framework enables\
    \ the realisation of intelligent \nfunctionalities such as positioning, tracking,\
    \ monitoring, and management of objects. The system architecture can be \ntailored\
    \ to real-time operational contexts and processes. For instance, within a smart\
    \ home environment, every \nelectrical switch box may be linked to a smartphone,\
    \ allowing for remote operation. \nAn example of such technological advancement\
    \ is evident in Huawei's recent development, the HarmonyOS system, \nwhich employs\
    \ a full-stack decoupling architecture. This innovation addresses constraints\
    \ at the interface of software \nand hardware, facilitating the integration of\
    \ additional collaborators into the system [5]. Consequently, the scope of IoT\
    \ \napplications has significantly expanded. In such scenarios, there is no need\
    \ for a processor and storage device in each \nswitch box; a sensor is sufficient\
    \ to capture signals and process them, primarily for tasks like switching ON/OFF\
    \ of a \nmachine. \n1.2. Prospects of IoT technologies in CE \nThe Circular Economy\
    \ stands to gain advantages from the integration of IoT technologies, enhancing\
    \ process innovation, \nminimising material consumption, and facilitating the\
    \ execution of CE strategies. For example, a study in [6] contends \nthat blockchain\
    \ and IoT technologies foster sustainability and CE by encouraging eco-friendly\
    \ practices, enhancing \nproduct life cycle transparency, boosting system efficiency,\
    \ trimming development and operational expenses, and aiding \nin corporate performance\
    \ reporting as well as sustainability monitoring capabilities. \nThe 4th industrial\
    \ revolution, also known as the Industry 4.0 era, IoT presents prospects for advancing\
    \ the principles of \nCE within value chains by enabling real-time monitoring\
    \ of resource inventories, as articulated in [7]. IoT also has the \npotential\
    \ to facilitate the reduction of waste through the detection of product lifecycles,\
    \ thereby enhancing the \noptimisation of material reuse and recycling processes.\
    \ To summarise, IoT promotes an exact, efficient, and sustainable \nresource utilisation\
    \ approach, aligning with the transition from a disposable resource paradigm to\
    \ a renewable one. \nFurthermore, it plays a pivotal role in the inception and\
    \ progression of CBM, as elucidated in [8] study. \nHence, the advancement of\
    \ IoT-enabled Circular Business Models has garnered significant attention in academic\
    \ \nresearch circles. Recent studies have evaluated the influence of Industry\
    \ 4.0 technologies, such as IoT, on CBM, yielding \nvarying conclusions [9,10].\
    \ These studies have investigated the economic, social, and environmental facets\
    \ of CBM and \nIoT, offering comprehensive insights [11,12] and, in a separate\
    \ survey conducted by Rejeb et al. [13], assessed the \ncontributions and challenges\
    \ posed by IoT in the CBM purview. They identified key driving factors and presented\
    \ a \nstructured framework that explored CE strategies with a focus on business\
    \ and management, leveraging IoT \ntechnologies. \nNonetheless, a substantial\
    \ disparity persists between theoretical concepts and practical implementation\
    \ [14]. Notably, \na significant proportion of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises\
    \ (SMEs) find themselves under considerable pressure to \nenhance their environmental\
    \ performance. The potentially substantial cost associated with adopting IoT technologies\
    \ \nmay deter them from embracing opportunities for emissions reduction that IoT\
    \ offers, especially considering their \nunique circumstances, as observed in\
    \ [12] study. Addressing this challenge necessitates a thorough comprehension\
    \ of \nthe capabilities of IoT and the distinguishing features of various CBMs\
    \ to identify the most advantageous convergence \npoint. Given the existence of\
    \ these gaps in the existing research, this paper seeks to address the following\
    \ research \nquestions: \n \nWhat are the collaborative benefits of IoT capabilities\
    \ within various CBMs? \n \nWhat is the potential for reducing carbon emissions\
    \ through IoT within various CBMs? \n \nWhat are the barriers that impede SMEs\
    \ from embracing IoT for advancing circular strategies? \nWorld Journal of Advanced\
    \ Research and Reviews, 2023, 20(01), 808–824 \n810 \n1.2.1. Contributions \n\
    This paper's contributions can be outlined as follows: We employed a predefined\
    \ circular business framework, \nReSOLVE, established by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation,\
    \ to analyse the CBM-IoT context. We then connected this \nframework with the\
    \ principles of the 6Rs to precisely map IoT capabilities within each business\
    \ practice. This visual \nrepresentation elucidates the varying contributions\
    \ of IoT within different business models and facilitates our \nexploration of\
    \ the relationship between IoT capabilities, the 6Rs, and CBM. Furthermore, we\
    \ conducted a quantitative \nreview of existing literature to assess how IoT can\
    \ play a role in reducing environmental impacts within CBM and to \nidentify the\
    \ obstacles associated with its implementation. \n2. PRISMA Review System and\
    \ Applications \nWe conducted a literature search following the checklist framework\
    \ outlined in the PRISMA-P guidelines, initially \ndeveloped for use in the medical\
    \ field [15]. While there are a number of alternative approaches available for\
    \ conducting \nliterature reviews and meta-analyses [16], PRISMA guidelines have\
    \ gained widespread acceptance as a transparent \napproach for conducting literature\
    \ reviews. Notably, these guidelines have been increasingly applied in the field\
    \ of \nsustainability and CE research [17-20]. The most recent PRISMA Abstract\
    \ 2020 guidelines [21] recommend addressing \nfive main items in conjunction with\
    \ ten subcategories within a review. In this study, we refer to the checklist\
    \ items \npresented in Table 1 below. \nTable 1 Key stages in PRISMA Abstract\

    \ the keywords searched for but do \ncontain keywords with similar meanings, while\
    \ other reports do contain the keywords but do not explain them in \ndetail).\
    \ Second, it outlines the quantitative analysis's stages, which involve gathering\
    \ information from particular \npublications and balancing their values. This\
    \ review of the literature was done using this framework. \n \nWorld Journal of\
    \ Advanced Research and Reviews, 2023, 20(01), 808–824 \n811 \n2.1. Categorisation\
    \ of papers included \nWe have utilised the 6R concept, initially introduced by\
    \ Joshi et al. in [22], as the foundational framework to categorise \ncircularity\
    \ strategies and their associated business models, as illustrated in Figure 1.\
    \ The 6 R concept delineates the \nfollowing principles: Reuse, Recycle, Reduce,\
    \ Repair, Remanufacture, and Redesign. In [23], the framework has been \nrecognised\
    \ for encompassing the operational approaches and fundamental tenets of CE. Furthermore,\
    \ the Ellen \nMacArthur Foundation (EMF), in their 2013 report [24], emphasised\
    \ the increasing importance of exploring new \navenues to advance CE within the\
    \ guiding principles of the 6Rs. This \"industrial system is restorative or regenerative\
    \ \nby intention and design.\" This is particularly significant in the context\
    \ of the Industry 4.0 era. From a systemic \nperspective, the amalgamation of\
    \ these six operational approaches gives rise to novel macro-level business models\
    \ \nwithin the realm of CE, as expounded [25]. \nDrawing upon these characteristics,\
    \ the ReSOLVE framework further elaborates on the concept of CE, emphasising the\
    \ \npreservation and augmentation of natural capital, the optimisation of resource\
    \ yields, and the enhancement of system \nefficiency. This framework categorises\
    \ circular models based on the economic and resource implications across major\
    \ \nsectors, as outlined by the EMF [26]. It serves as a valuable tool for formulating\
    \ circular strategies and promoting growth \ninitiatives. Subsequently, Jabbour\
    \ et al. [27] established a connection between Industry 4.0 technologies and the\
    \ six \nCBM proposed by the ReSOLVE framework, which include Regenerating, Share,\
    \ Optimize, Loop, Virtualize, and Exchange. \nThis connection was designed to\
    \ guide organisations in the implementation of CE principles, as initially expressed\
    \ in \n[26] as presented in Table 2 below.  \nTable 2 Description of 6 BM in the\
    \ ReSOLVE framework \nBusiness \nModel \nDescription of Model \nRegenerate  \n\
    The use of renewable resources and energy is the foundation of this business strategy.\
    \ Organic \nwaste is transformed into sources of energy and raw materials for\
    \ other chains through the \nutilisation of biological cycles, which also allow\
    \ the transit of materials and energy. \nShare \nIn this model, Individuals exchange\
    \ assets with one another (either privately held product sharing \namongst peers\
    \ or publicly owned product sharing). As a result, manufacturers should build\
    \ their \nproducts to survive longer and provide maintenance to enable product\
    \ reuse and life extension. \nOptimise \nIn order to eliminate waste in production\
    \ systems throughout supply chains, this model \nnecessitates that firms embrace\
    \ digital manufacturing technologies, such as IoT, automation, and \nbig data.\
    \ Organisations will gain from improved performance as a result. \nLoop \nThe\
    \ model strives to advance the circularity of energy and raw resources. Therefore,\
    \ the design, \nmanufacture, and supply chain must be modified in light of the\
    \ complete life cycle. \nVirtualize \nThis service-oriented business model substitutes\
    \ virtual and dematerialised goods for tangible \nones. \nExchange \nThis model\
    \ entails switching out outdated, non-renewable items for modern, renewable ones.\
    \ \nIt is noteworthy that while most technologies present opportunities in specific\
    \ domains, the IoT emerges as a significant \nenabler capable of rendering such\
    \ business models feasible [27]. \nThe vocabulary used to describe IoT-related\
    \ capabilities differs depending on the situation, so we compiled the \ntechnology's\
    \ fundamental capabilities from published research. Using features like tracking,\
    \ monitoring, control, \noptimisation, and design evolution, a study in [28] contends\
    \ that IoTs can aid in the development of circular business \nmodels. They also\
    \ note that optimisation frequently requires the usage of control capability.\
    \ In order to limit the number \nof pertinent IoT capabilities to four, as indicated\
    \ in Table 3, we added the control capability into optimisation. \nWorld Journal\
    \ of Advanced Research and Reviews, 2023, 20(01), 808–824 \n812 \n \nFigure 1\

    \ or routing are included. \n2.2. Selection and deselection of Articles \nWe used\
    \ the following terms as a basis for the literature search in a Boolean operation:\
    \ Title→Abstract→Keyword = \n[\"internet of things\" AND (\"circular economy\"\
    \ OR \"circular business model\" OR \"sustainable supply chain\")]. This was \n\
    done in order to systematically review the contribution of the IoT to circular\
    \ economy business models. There were a \ntotal of 182 papers available on Web\
    \ of Science (WoS) and 492 papers available on Scopus. Through perusing abstracts,\
    \ \nwe eliminated duplicate entries and studies that had no connection to any\
    \ of the 6Rs. After browsing the entire text, we \nfurther destroyed papers that\
    \ contained non-CBM descriptions that were found in the ReSOLVE framework. \n\
    In this manner, 59 publications were kept in order to research how the IoT contributes\
    \ to CBM; for example, see Fig. 2. \nThen, a quantitative investigation of the\
    \ IoT's impact on CBM's environmental implications was carried out. For this,\
    \ we \nobtained 23 findings from the included publications that a) assessed effects\
    \ on energy-related indicators in the circular \neconomy (such as energy use or\
    \ CO2 emissions) and b) compared these impacts before and after utilising IoT\
    \ \ntechnology.  \nWorld Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, 2023, 20(01),\
    \ 808–824 \n813 \n \nFigure 2 A flowchart illustrating the review's chosen studies\
    \ \n3. Descriptive finding of IoTs Effects on CBM \nThe 59 publications that were\
    \ collected were used to clarify how IoT affects CBM. The annual number of articles\
    \ \npublished is seen in Fig. 4. These publications mainly cover the fields of\
    \ engineering, environmental science, and \ncomputer science. Notably, as shown\
    \ in Figure 4, there was a significant increase in the number of papers published\
    \ \nfrom 2019 to 2021, followed by a decrease afterwards. \n \nFigure 3 Categorisation\
    \ of publications in the 6 R CE business model sets \nWorld Journal of Advanced\
    \ Research and Reviews, 2023, 20(01), 808–824 \n814 \nThe 59 papers are divided\
    \ into four main categories using the model developed by Maroli et al. in [30]:\
    \ literature \nreviews, theoretical analyses, new designs, and case studies. Reviews\
    \ of the literature include papers that list and \ncategorise earlier studies.\
    \ A freshly proposed framework for a particular topic is often examined and discussed\
    \ in \ntheoretical analyses, which are typically based on expert surveys (Delphi)\
    \ or questionnaires. With no empirical \nvalidation through real-world situations,\
    \ novel designs refer to the creation of new mathematical models or protocol \n\
    designs for IoT solutions. When compared to innovative designs, case studies produce\
    \ reference results based on either \nreal-world examples or established situations\
    \ through the following calculation or simulation of a specific case. \nTo provide\
    \ a synopsis of each study category, a brief additional summary of each paper\
    \ is also provided in the table. As \nshown in Figure 3, these publications are\
    \ further divided into six business models suggested by the ReSOLVE framework\
    \ \n[31]. It's important to note that more than 60% of the publications explain\
    \ how the Internet of Things fits into the Loop \nand Optimise frameworks. These\
    \ two models have the potential to have a significant impact on the industrial,\
    \ \ntransportation, and storage sectors. IoT, therefore, holds the potential to\
    \ enable substantial revolutionary changes \nwithin these sectors [31]. \n \n\
    Figure 4 Numbers of IoT publications by year  \nIn terms of the Optimize model,\
    \ the IoT enhances decision-making procedures targeted at lowering energy and\
    \ resource \nconsumption, which is a crucial component of intelligent manufacturing\
    \ and Sustainable Supply Chain Management \n(SSCM). Most theoretical research\
    \ in this area focuses on investigating and developing frameworks for reducing\
    \ carbon \nfootprints across various industries. These frameworks [32-35] take\
    \ advantage of IoT capabilities to gather and process \ninformation more effectively.\
    \ The few case studies and unique designs, on the other hand, frequently concentrate\
    \ on \nprocess optimisation within businesses. In these situations, IoT is used\
    \ to create intelligent logistics delivery and \nproduction scheduling models\
    \ that support sustainable and environmentally friendly growth in the field of\
    \ smart \nmanufacturing [36]. \nThe majority of studies have focused on waste\
    \ management in the context of the Loop business model. IoT is primarily \nused\
    \ in this field to improve waste collection and decision support systems for recycling\
    \ end-of-life products [37-39]. \nBy creating CE-IoT-enabled ecosystems that make\
    \ use of essential IoT technologies, several theoretical studies have \ntaken\
    \ things a step further [40]. Others have combined IoT and Life Cycle Assessment\
    \ (LCA) models to help with the \nprocess of creating new products with minimal\
    \ adverse effects on the environment [41,42]. IoT-enabled solutions that \nare\
    \ based on items with varied technical characteristics, including instances like\
    \ plastic garbage and abandoned cars, \namong others, have been validated by new\
    \ design projects and case studies [43,44].  \nThe articles only cover a small\
    \ percentage of the four remaining business models. The sharing model is one of\
    \ them that \nmainly relies on IoT-enabled online platforms or applications to\
    \ support the exchange of goods or information among \nvarious stakeholders [45].\
    \ In contrast, the implementation of the Virtualize and Exchange models frequently\
    \ \nnecessitates the use of additional technologies, such as 3D printers, Digital\
    \ Twin (DT) systems, and virtual world tools \n[46,47]. \n4. ReSOLVE framework\
    \ integration with 6R and IoTs technologies \nIn this part, we divided the articles\
    \ into groups using different matrices, taking into account section 2's discussion\
    \ of the \n6 R principles, IoT capabilities, and CBM categories. This produced\
    \ a graphic showing the occurrences of cross-sections \nWorld Journal of Advanced\
    \ Research and Reviews, 2023, 20(01), 808–824 \n815 \nbetween CBM and IoT as well\
    \ as CBM and 6R within the sample of 59 publications, which is referred to as\
    \ a \"heat map\" \n(see Figure 5). It's important to note that numerous articles\
    \ discuss cross-sections between CBM and 6R as well as IoT \non multiple occasions.\
    \ Notably, while having different meanings, these groups do not overlap. We examine\
    \ the trends \nfound for each of the CBM categories in the sections that follow.\
    \ \n \nFigure 5 Heat MAP cross-sectionexistence of the CBM-6R and CBM- IoT \n\
    4.1. Optimise Business Model  \nThe majority of studies that explore the Optimize\
    \ model are strongly related to \"Reduce,\" which is supported by IoT. As \nshown\
    \ in Fig 5, monitoring and optimisation skills are generally used to achieve this\
    \ alignment. By continuously \nmonitoring processes and agents like machines,\
    \ IoT technology increases the possibility of seeing possible faults and \nenables\
    \ predictive maintenance to reduce the loss of underperforming items [48]. Additionally,\
    \ managers can monitor \nand optimise production rates by utilising IoT data in\
    \ conjunction with resource production and consumption demands. \nThey are able\
    \ to automatically intervene in processes thanks to the use of sensors and algorithms\
    \ [34,49]. It is possible \nto develop sophisticated and integrated data-driven\
    \ process manufacturing models with improved resilience and \naccuracy by combining\
    \ IoT, cloud computing, and machine learning [50]. \n4.1.1. Applicability of IoT\
    \ Capabilities in the optimise model \n \nMonitoring: If the state of the ideal\
    \ ball mill is carefully examined and applied to the other ball mills, IoT sensors\
    \ \nwill enable energy and cost savings [51]. \n \nTracking: Utilising RFID technology\
    \ for the tagging and monitoring of fresh milk has  the potential to diminish\
    \ \nproduct loss or shrinkage [52] \n \nOptimisation: \nUsing RFID tags and wireless\
    \ sensor networks, each node (including suppliers, wholesalers, \nand retailers)\
    \ might manage and optimise its performance in terms of production, deliveries,\
    \ and \nenvironmental compliance [53]. \n4.2. Optimise Business Model  \nAccording\
    \ to the study's findings, \"Recycle\"-related IoT-enabled solutions are the most\
    \ common, followed by \n\"Remanufacture\" and \"Repair.\" 'Loop' concept papers\
    \ frequently rely on tracking and monitoring tools, with no \nattention paid to\
    \ optimisation and design evolution. The adoption of creative internet-based transactions\
    \ has the \npotential to make use of information for more effective and sustainable\
    \ post-consumer product collection in the context \nof recycling, remanufacturing,\
    \ and mending. As mentioned in [39], these products can be tracked utilising a\
    \ variety of \ntechnologies such as sensors, RFID tags, and barcodes. As a result,\
    \ businesses are able to remanufacture or recycle \nproduct and packaging components\
    \ [54,55]. However, according to the 'Redesign' perspective, product designers\
    \ need \nto take the surroundings into account when making design choices. They\
    \ can use data from an IoT-based product life \nWorld Journal of Advanced Research\
    \ and Reviews, 2023, 20(01), 808–824 \n816 \ncycle management system to help them\
    \ in their efforts to develop and build more sustainable products. The research\
    \ in \n[33,42,56] serves as an example of this strategy. \n4.2.1. Applicability\
    \ of IoT Capabilities in the Loop Model \n \nMonitoring: The uncertainty of a\
    \ product's residual value based on the life cycle tracked by IoT sensors is \n\
    addressed by an IoT-enabled decision support system for a CE model [57]. \n \n\
    Tracking: According to De Fazio et al. in [58], the POIROT research project uses\
    \ IoT technologies to create a \nplatform for the traceability of organic waste\
    \ and convert it into inert, odourless, and sterilised material. \n \nOptimisation:\
    \ A system that integrates intelligent transportation systems comprising RFIDs,\
    \  sensors, \ncameras, actuators, and surveillance systems. This system is complemented\
    \ by an advanced decision-making \nsystem that facilitates real-time data sharing\
    \ among truck drivers, enabling dynamic route optimisation to \nenhance the efficiency\
    \ of waste collection  [38].  \n4.3. Virtualise Business Model  \nVirtualize places\
    \ a high priority on customer service; therefore, using real-time data to track\
    \ supply activities is crucial \nto improving the client experience. Through the\
    \ power of design evolution, this strategy also opens up the possibility of \n\
    IoT-enabled \"Redesign\" of both products and services. It is possible to accomplish\
    \ system reconfigurability by virtually \ndeveloping, simulating, and optimising\
    \ systems and then putting these modifications into practice in the real world.\
    \ As \ndemonstrated by Sassanelli et al. research [59], this entails adjustments\
    \ to specific hardware components (such as \nchanging robot tools for disassembly\
    \ tasks) as well as alterations to software resources (such as coding for robot\
    \ \nprograms). A study in [60] emphasised the idea that IoT technology allows\
    \ the formation of links between businesses, \nsuppliers, and customers, with\
    \ a trend towards selling services rather than tangible things. The IoT can also\
    \ collect \nessential data on consumer behaviour and historical design traits,\
    \ which designers may use to improve service quality. \n4.3.1. Applicability of\
    \ IoT Capabilities in the virtualise model \n \nMonitoring: In order to determine\
    \ whether knowledge sharing and learning across a horizontal supply chain \nwas\
    \ efficient and decreased greenhouse gas emissions associated with business travel,\
    \ a study in [46] examined \n3D Virtual World tools with multiple sources of 'streamed'\
    \ data supplied by IoT. \n \nDesign evolution: A Study in [61] unveiled a platform\
    \ that combines hybrid IoT and blockchain technologies to \nencourage stakeholder\
    \ innovation in prefabricated housing buildings. Through online platforms like\
    \ mobile \napps, these stakeholders actively contribute to the co-design of the\
    \ project's lifespan value. Likewise, a study in \n[62] created a platform that\
    \ allows IoT devices to be installed in smart buildings to track energy usage.\
    \ \nAdditionally, it provides building managers and end users with consulting\
    \ services for energy optimisation. By \nallowing customers to virtually try out\
    \ things through a mirror image, a study in [63] investigated how IoT may \nalter\
    \ the shopping experience. This strategy tries to alleviate the drawbacks of conventional\
    \ Internet shopping \nmethods. Through a connection protocol, research in [47]\
    \ connected the IoT to the Manufacturing Execution \nSystem (MES). Through this\
    \ connectivity, CE procedures can be digitalised within the system, and orders\
    \ from \noutside sources can be sent to the MES. \n4.4. Share Business Model \
    \ \nKey IoT features that are essential to the sharing business model include\
    \ monitoring and tracking. These capabilities \nalso aid in product \"Redesign\"\
    \ and \"Recycle,\" which aim to increase product lifespan. Websites and mobile\
    \ applications \nare used to gather data on consumer behaviour, enabling businesses\
    \ to concurrently improve product design and \nprovide digital services to increase\
    \ equipment use or ease replacements. As seen in Rymaszewska et al. and \nIngemarsdotter\
    \ et al.’s tests [64,28], this method increases customer satisfaction. Additionally,\
    \ adding sensors to \nproducts makes it easier to track maintenance needs and\
    \ monitor performance. Organisations may provide clients with \nhigh-quality services\
    \ thanks to this proactive strategy. Organisations can invest in initiatives that\
    \ follow the 3Rs' (repair, \nreuse, and recycle) tenets by constantly reviewing\
    \ the items they utilise. As a result, this helps to increase the longevity \n\
    of things. \n4.4.1. Applicability of IoT Capabilities in the Share Model \n \n\
    Monitoring:According to cost, demand, and other factors, an automated negotiation\
    \ ecosystem between scrap \nmetal producers and garbage collection businesses\
    \ might be provided via an inter-company IoT \ncommunication protocol [45]. \n\
    World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, 2023, 20(01), 808–824 \n817 \n\
     \nTracking: An intelligent component was designed for Cranfield University's\
    \ shoe recycling project, which tracks \nthe state of the shoes and determines\
    \ when they need to be upgraded or replaced. The shoes' modular \nconstruction\
    \ makes it simple to deconstruct them for recycling or refurbishing [65]. \n\
    \ \nOptimisation: IoT enables business-to-business e-commerce systems to achieve\
    \ a mutually visible inventory in \nreal-time where average food inventory, amount\
    \ of food waste, frequency of lateral inventory share, and \nordering from the\
    \ main depot are optimised along with customer service level in the network [66].\
    \ \n4.5. Exchange Business Model  \nAccording to the suggestion in the study [67],\
    \ this model could be improved by including additive manufacturing and \nIoT devices\
    \ with monitoring capabilities. The use of 3D printers could help with the development\
    \ of sustainable and \nrenewable production methods. Some businesses can create\
    \ customised items by utilising databases that include 3D \nprinters and fostering\
    \ relationships between companies and customers. IoT technology is essential in\
    \ this situation for \nsaving both time and resources during additive manufacturing.\
    \ These features increase the viability of adopting IoT to \nadhere to circular\
    \ economy concepts. \n4.5.1. Applicability of IoT Capabilities in the Exchange\
    \ Model \n \nMonitoring: IoT-enabled 3D printers allow for the recycling of small\
    \ amounts of trash, and additive \nmanufacturing results in a decreased consumption\
    \ of materials [67]. \n \nOptimisation: The seed swarm optimisation technique\
    \ builds effective multi-target production planning in real-\ntime using IoTs\
    \ for the detection of engineered disassemblers and the real-time status of replicable\
    \ resources \n[29]. \n4.6. Regenerate Business Model \nThe model might profit\
    \ from the IoT in the form of sensors and networks, and the design, production,\
    \ and supply \ndecisions of CE could be adjusted based on the data provided by\
    \ IoT [68]. This would make it possible to reduce \nunnecessary resource consumption,\
    \ improve harvest productivity, and lengthen the life cycle of land use. \nIoT\
    \ technology as a whole is gradually supporting the 6R concept. It encourages\
    \ the integration of the six Rs into various \ncircular business models, which\
    \ differ significantly from growth in the linear economy and are made possible\
    \ by the IoT \ntechnology [69]. So, using the 'heat map' data to identify the\
    \ primary contributors of 6R and CBM, we built a relationship \nstructure that\
    \ included the conceptualisation of 4 IoT capabilities, 6R, and the ReSOLVE framework,\
    \ as illustrated in Fig. \n6 below. \n4.6.1. Applicability of IoT Capabilities\
    \ in the Regenerate Model \n \nMonitoring: monitoring and managing aspects of\
    \ land management, such as crop rotation, automating \nirrigation systems depending\
    \ on current weather conditions, and controlling the application of pesticides\
    \ in \naccordance with the well-being of plantings [68]. \n \nBy enabling the\
    \ capacity to change the composition of the ceramic bodies and the transport mix\
    \ to maximise \nthe use of local raw materials, IoT allows real-time measurement\
    \ of the manufacture of ceramic tiles. This \nreduces the distances between mines\
    \ and factories and favours rail transport. [70]. \n5. Challenges associated with\
    \ the adoption of IoT in CBM \nAs mentioned above, we found various ways that\
    \ IoT could support the deployment of circular CBMs while reading the \nliterature.\
    \ However, some of these sources also emphasised IoT's potential environmental\
    \ dangers or other barriers to \nits adoption and use. \n5.1. Negative effects\
    \ of using IoTs \n \nAccording to research in [71], one of the drawbacks of IoT-driven\
    \ business models is the energy consumption and \nsubsequent carbon emissions\
    \ linked to IoT components, including IoT hardware, node software, and protocol\
    \ energy \nutilisation. IoT networks are built on hardware, so it's critical to\
    \ optimise hardware and software components to \nminimise environmental effects\
    \ jointly. For specialised digital signal processing tasks like compression, feature\
    \ \nextraction, or machine learning training, this improvement becomes more critical.\
    \ Additionally, the effectiveness of IoT \nrelies on protocols that facilitate\
    \ communication among various nodes and routing devices within an IoT network.\
    \ \nWorld Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, 2023, 20(01), 808–824 \n818\
    \ \nRegarding software implementation, these protocols must prioritise energy\
    \ efficiency and minimise the utilisation of \ncommunication interfaces. \nThe\
    \ IoT devices may also add to the production of electronic garbage, which presents\
    \ problems for recycling and \ndisposal. As noted in [72], RFID tags are a prime\
    \ example because they not only provide environmental risks but also \npresent\
    \ difficulties in recycling. According to a study in [73], another critical issue\
    \ is that IoT promotes bulk \ncustomisation, making it harder for subsequent users\
    \ to reuse or recycle products. \nThe current body of literature is notable for\
    \ the scant attention paid to the adverse environmental effects of IoT \nadoption,\
    \ including issues like the ecological cost of developing and deploying IoT devices.\
    \ The results of several \npreliminary analyses addressing this issue have been\
    \ published. For instance, a study in [74] revealed the annual energy \nusage\
    \ of IoT devices (particularly LoRa) in the context of energy management systems,\
    \ suggesting a usage rate of 5.20 \nkWh when installed in small buildings with\
    \ an area of 16–40 m2. A study [52] evaluated the environmental performance \n\
    and burdens related to the usage of RFID tags in a fresh milk supply chain in\
    \ a different research. According to their \nanalysis, which was based on Life\
    \ Cycle Assessment (LCA), the environmental costs associated with the use of 1\
    \ million \nRFID tags included 32,900 kg CO2-eq in terms of the potential for\
    \ climate change, 23.9 kg P-eq in terms of the potential \nfor freshwater eutrophication,\
    \ and 156 molc H+-eq in terms of the potential for acidification. There are surprisingly\
    \ few \nacademic works that explore the effects of IoT on CBM through empirical\
    \ case studies or simulations compared to the \namount of existing research. \
    \ \nAdditionally, the security and confidentiality of data may also be challenging\
    \ to maintain [75] because Botnets can target \nend users as weak firewall nodes\
    \ and intermediary nodes in the manufacturing and remanufacturing cycle [76].\
    \ The IoT \nbotnet Mirai serves as a typical illustration. It may target consumer\
    \ electronics and home routers and transform them \ninto zombie remote-control\
    \ bots that can be used in large-scale network attacks [77]. \nHowever, concerns\
    \ should be raised about the need for standardised processes and explicit guidelines\
    \ for the \ndeployment of IoT across various businesses. It is significant that,\
    \ as observed by Astill et al. study in [78], there needs \nto be more existing\
    \ policies that adequately address the issue of data ownership among various parties.\
    \ The resolution \nof these issues relating to data ownership is essential for\
    \ the effective and broad adoption of CE policies. \nSimilarly, a study in [79]\
    \ noted that there is frequently a need for more clearly defined data management\
    \ methods \nintended to ensure the acquisition of high-quality data for industrial\
    \ analysis. It can be challenging to evaluate and \nconfirm the quality of models\
    \ representing real-world systems because of the limited accessibility and diversity\
    \ of \nindustrial data. This includes figuring out when enough data has been gathered\
    \ to guarantee the accuracy of a simulation \nframework, as stated in [50]. \n\
    IoT activities supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research program\
    \ may address these issues. According \nto Calisti’s study in [80], these programs\
    \ include the European Cloud Initiative, the GAIA-X initiative, and public-private\
    \ \npartnerships like the Smart Networks and Services JU and the AI, Big Data,\
    \ and Robotics projects [81]. These initiatives \nwill likely make use of distributed\
    \ artificial intelligence, proactively address security, privacy, and trust requirements,\
    \ \nand support the creation of novel decentralised structures and governance\
    \ models. \n6. Conclusion \nThe state-of-the-art relationship between IoT and\
    \ CBM has been evaluated in this review from a number of angles. This \npaper\
    \ evaluates the literature on the IoT and CBMs, which has been considerably growing\
    \ in recent years, based on the \nPRISMA approach. It presents the current research\
    \ status of IoT-assisted CBMs. It discusses their value for businesses \nfrom\
    \ the standpoint of 6R with illustrative cases through the classification of their\
    \ techniques and contents. The IoT has \nsignificantly improved industrial efficiency,\
    \ promoted recycling, and reduced wasteful material and energy \nconsumption by\
    \ supporting seamless interoperability to optimise systems and real-time monitoring\
    \ and tracking. These \nIoT capabilities are essential for helping CBMs, particularly\
    \ when Loop and Optimise CBMs are involved. \nIn addition, the IoT's capacity\
    \ for dynamic feedback makes it an excellent tool for reevaluating and reworking\
    \ product \nor service concepts, particularly in the context of virtualise, share,\
    \ and exchange models. We have suggested potential \ndirections for these topics\
    \ based on our preliminary study. In the Share model, for instance, IoT can build\
    \ platforms that \nlet users share things, enabling consumers to receive the same\
    \ level of service from a smaller selection of physical goods. \nAdditionally,\
    \ the IoT can complement the Redesign Circular Economy concept through the integration\
    \ of diverse \ntechnologies by providing virtual and dematerialised service alternatives\
    \ instead of physical products with comparable \nfunctionality. \nWorld Journal\
    \ of Advanced Research and Reviews, 2023, 20(01), 808–824 \n819 \nHowever, IoT\
    \ can improve resource use efficiency and lower waste generation. However, widespread\
    \ IoT adoption and \nthe associated data processing activities may unintentionally\
    \ increase energy use and lead to the production of \nelectronic garbage (e-waste),\
    \ which is frequently difficult to recycle. IoT also poses a number of challenges\
    \ for its \nwidespread adoption across various industries, such as difficulties\
    \ in creating global standards for data processing, \nworries about cybersecurity\
    \ risk, and relatively expensive initial investment costs. Small and medium-sized\
    \ firm \ninvestors who are interested in cutting-edge technology and sustainable\
    \ development can learn a lot from these \nassessments of the benefits and challenges\
    \ associated with IoT. \nLimitations and future research direction \nJust like\
    \ other studies, this one has limitations as well. This work has a number of rules,\
    \ most of which result from the \nfact that research into the interplay between\
    \ the IoT and CE is still in its infancy. Only a few case examples are accessible,\
    \ \nand the vast bulk of references are focused on conceptual frameworks, theoretical\
    \ models, and theoretical evaluations. \nThe efficacy of meta-analyses, as tried\
    \ in this work, is constrained by the absence of case studies. Few case studies\
    \ \nspecifically address the Circular Economy methods of Virtualize, Exchange,\
    \ and Regenerate. \nDetermining how IoT might contribute to CBM and environmental\
    \ improvements calls for a more systematic and \nquantitative review of case studies.\
    \ Additionally, the body of extant studies provides scant information about IoT's\
    \ \nadverse ecological effects. While some research suggests that its manufacture\
    \ and use have only a minor environmental \nimpact, a thorough analysis of the\
    \ ecological advantages and disadvantages of IoT calls for more study. Specific\
    \ IoT \napplication scenarios, material selections, and the possibility for upcoming\
    \ advancements that may result from \nscalability and learning effects should\
    \ all be considered in this research. In the forthcoming stages of IoT research,\
    \ these \nfactors become the primary topics of concentration. \nCompliance with\

    \ \nAbstract—The present state of agriculture and its demand is \nvery much different\
    \ than what it used to be two decades back. \nHence, Precision Agriculture (PA)\
    \ is more in demand to address \nthis challenging demand. With consistent pressure\
    \ to develop \nmultiple products over the same agricultural land, farmers find\
    \ \nPA’s adoption the best rescue-based solution with restricted \nresources.\
    \ PA accelerates the yield and potentially assists in \ncatering up the demand\
    \ of scarcity of demands of food. With the \nincreasing adoption of PA-based technologies\
    \ over farming, there \nare best possibilities to explore efficient farming practices\
    \ and \nbetter decision-making facilitated by real-time data availability. \n\
    There isan evolution of various novel technologies to boost \nagricultural \n\
    performance, \ni.e. \nvariable \nrate \ntechnology, \nGeomapping, remote sensing,\
    \ automated steering system, and \nsatellite positioning system. Apart from this,\
    \ it is also observed \nthat Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor Network\
    \ \n(WSN) have been slowly penetrating this area to acceleratePA's \ntechnological\
    \ advancement. It is noticed that the adoption of \nsensing technology is a common\
    \ factor in almost all the \ntechniques used in PA. However, there is no clear\
    \ idea about the \nmost dominant approach in this regard. Therefore, this paper\
    \ \ndiscusses existing approaches concerning standard conventional \nPA and sensing-based\
    \ PA using WSN. The study contributes \ntowards some impressive learning outcomes\
    \ to state that WSN \nand IoT are extensive to boost PA. \nKeywords—Precision\

    \ has penetrated agriculture in \nthe present time, right from small to large\
    \ scale farming [1]. \nTwo decades back, the Global Positioning System (GPS) usage\
    \ \npermits the farmers to collect necessary farming data, which \nfacilitates\
    \ autonomous steering control system development \n[2]. However, the present times\
    \ make use of more advanced \ntechnologies, e.g., fixed solutions for Internet-of-Things\
    \ (IoT), \naerial devices, sensors, etc., to carve the progressive path of \n\
    Precision Agriculture (PA). The prime goal of PA is to \nachieve, i) opt for the\
    \ appropriate crop to ensure increased \nquality yield and make more revenue in\
    \ the commercial \nmarket, ii) using the proper data to assess the performance\
    \ of \nthe farming land, iii) improve the economics of farming and \nanother offer\
    \ better sustainability towards the environment, and \niv) making a prediction\
    \ of climatic fluctuations and taking \nnecessary countermeasures to protect from\
    \ upcoming threat \ntowards agriculture [3]-[5]. The significant beneficial aspectof\
    \ \nPA is minimizing and controlling crop waste and adverse \ninfluence over the\
    \ environment.Farmers are facilitated with the \nappropriate \nanticipated \n\
    yield \nfor \ntheir \nfarming \nland. \nInvestigation towards PA could offer potential\
    \ insight towards \nsolving the crisis of food demand globally [6]. Farmers are\
    \ \nnow able to identify the beneficial aspects of PA introduced by \nIoT. The\
    \ return of investment and quality of decision-making \ncan be ensured by adoption\
    \ PA by business owners.There is the \ninclusion of various metrics to carry out\
    \ PA, e.g., fertilizer \ninput, a sample of soil, nutrient availability of soil,\
    \ rainfall \nlevel, temperature, etc. [7]. \nAcquisition of this information via\
    \ sensors can lead to \nprecision decision-making by the farmers. It can also\
    \ furnish \nvarious real-time data of their farming land, identifying \nspecific\
    \ production patterns or identifying any associated risk \nfactors during cultivation\
    \ and harvesting season. Adopting PA \nalso facilitates exclusive access to the\
    \ agricultural records via \ncloud-based resources where the data can be accessed\
    \ anytime \nand anywhere [8]. It also leads to an adequate formulation of \nmeasures\
    \ towards crop protection. Usage of sensors can \nquickly identify the health\
    \ statistics of a plant concerning soil \npressure, presence of chemicals, environmental\
    \ impact, pest, \netc. [9]. This information leads to a better decision in planning\
    \ \nfor fertilizer input by the farmer. The most potential benefit of \nPA is\
    \ associated with irrigation management. Any form of the \ncrop demands an adequate\
    \ water supply in appropriate \nquantities and channel them throughout the farming\
    \ land. \nUsage of various controllers, actuators, and sensors further \noffers\
    \ relevantwater supply statistics for better irrigation \nmanagement. To effectively\
    \ operational, PA demands the use \nof progressive technologies, i.e., usage of\
    \ sensors [10], \nprecision farming software [11], connectivity protocols [12],\
    \ \nand location monitoring tools [13]. Irrespective of PA’s known \nbenefits,\
    \ it is still yet to get a discloser about the research \nprogress regarding more\
    \ insights over challenging state of \nfarming, minimal resource waste, identifying\
    \ the unique \npattern of production or risk. Therefore, this manuscript offers\
    \ \nan exhaustive review of standard and upcoming potential PA \napproaches to\
    \ providea more precise research state. The \nsignificant contributionsin the\
    \ proposed paper aredescribed as \nfollows: \n The present state of conventional\
    \ approaches in PA is \nhighly scattered. So this paper contributes towards \n\
    offering a compact discussion of conventional standard \napproaches concerning\
    \ its taxonomies. \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science\

    \ proposed manuscript \nareorganized as follows: Section II discussesthe essentials\
    \ of \nprecision agricultureconcerning all standard taxonomies and \nconventional\
    \ research-based approaches. Since WSN is \nidentified as upcoming technology\
    \ and IoT in precision \nagriculture, Section III discusses various techniques\
    \ used in \nWSN in precision agriculture; Section IV discusses the \nresearch\
    \ trend. In contrast, Section V highlights about learning \noutcome of this manuscript.\
    \ Finally, Section VI summarizes \nthe overall contribution of the proposed review\
    \ study and briefs \nabout future work direction in precision agriculturebased\
    \ on \nstudy findings. \nII. PRECISION AGRICULTURE \nPrecision Agriculture (PA)\
    \ targets improving crop \nproduction with the adoption of advanced technologies.\
    \ This \nconcept deals with improving agricultural management based \non various\
    \ scientific observations [14]. The primary aim of \nprecision agriculture is\
    \ to construct an appropriate decision-\nmaking system capable of optimizing productivity\
    \ without \nconsuming expensive resources [15]. It is believed that crop \nproduction\
    \ is significantly affected by the terrain features \nstudied in the phytogeomorphological\
    \ mechanism [16]. The \nevolution of the phytogeomorphological mechanism is due\
    \ to \nthe realizationthat the hydrological factors of farmland are \ncontrolled\
    \ by geomorphic components [17].The proliferation of \nvarious satellite navigation\
    \ systems has further boosted the \nadoption of precision agriculture [18]. Adopting\
    \ such a \nnavigation system helps localize an appropriate location of the \n\
    agricultural land suitable for production. Such geographic \ninformation obtained\
    \ from satellite navigational system also \nfurnishes spatial information of land\
    \ concerningactual contents \nrequired for cultivation viz. potassium, manganese,\
    \ pH level, \nnitrogen level, moisture level, crop yield, etc. [19].  A sensory-\n\
    based satellite navigation system helps further more data \ncollection, right\
    \ from a degree of water in the soil to the level \nof chlorophyll. More granularity\
    \ can be obtained from \nhyperspectral imaging in this regard. At present, there\
    \ are \ndifferent forms of variable rate technology (e.g., sprayers, \nseeders)\
    \ that are used along with satellite images for \noptimizing the resources [20].\
    \ However, the current advances \nin technologies are more inclined to use sensors\
    \ planted within \nthe soil. This sensor can directly forward the aggregated data\
    \ to \nthe user autonomously without any dependency on human \ninteractivity.\
    \ \nThe adoption of airborne vehicles is also used in precision \nagriculture\
    \ due to their cost-effective nature and does not \nrequire specialized skills\
    \ to make them airborne. Such \napproaches make use of photogrammetric techniques\
    \ by using \ndifferent forms of the camera (for both color and hyperspectral \n\
    images) are used over airborne vehicles to extract information \nassociated with\
    \ the field images [21]. The images obtained by \nthis technique can be used for\
    \ evaluating the different forms of \nvegetative index [22]. Apart from this,\
    \ a different form of other \ninformation, e.g.,the elevation of land, can also\
    \ be captured by \nairborne \nvehicles \nsubjected \nto \nvariousconditions \n\
    of \nsophisticated software models for constructing topography \n[23]. Therefore,\
    \ a better probability of enhancing crop \ncultivation can be achieved by studying\
    \ such a topography \nmap. This information can be used for improving the inputs\
    \ \ntowards healthy cultivation, e.g., growth regulators, different \ntypes of\
    \ chemicals, fertilizers, water, etc. Therefore, using \ndifferent forms of technologies\
    \ in precision agriculture is used \nto study crop science, accelerate the economics\
    \ associated with \nthe production, and protect the environment by controlling\
    \ \ndifferent possibilities of risk and agricultural footprints. \nA. Standard\
    \ Taxonomies of Technologies in PA \nThe novel approaches of agricultural practices\
    \ are now \nfacilitated by the advent of different technologies in PA. The \n\
    optimization is now possible for PA for both profitability and \nproductivity\
    \ \nbased \non \ndecision-making \nand \nreal-time \ninformation over the field.\
    \ The prime targets of the \ntechnologies used in PA are mainly to control the\
    \ agricultural \ninput along with environmental protection. On this basis, it\
    \ is \nseen that there are five standard taxonomies of precision \nfarming,including\
    \ 1) Satellite Positioning System, 2) Variable \nRate Technology, 3) Geomapping,\
    \ 4) Automated Steering \nSystem, and 5) Remote Sensing as in (Fig. 1). \nIn Satellite\
    \ Positioning System, the prime technological \ncontributor is the Global Positioning\
    \ System (GPS), mainly \nusing data associated with geo-references of production\
    \ and \nauto-steer system. The agricultural machines (e.g., tractors) are \nbetter\
    \ controlled with accuracy using GPS inbuilt within the \nmachine. The farming\
    \ operation is improved when the driver is \nprovided with error-free information\
    \ with machine movement \npatterns (Fig. 2). \nTechnologies \nin PA\nAutomated\

    \ agricultural inputs are \ncontrolled by farmers. Adopting this standard technology\
    \ \noffers planting density to be optimized while increasing the \napplicate rate's\
    \ efficiency towards nutrients and pest protection. \nThis significantly minimizes\
    \ the farming cost as well as \neffectively control the adverse impact onthe environment.\
    \ \nWhen variable rate technology is integrated with application \nequipment,\
    \ the system offers precise information about the \nfield’s location and appropriate\
    \ time for obtaining input for \nrates corresponding to the region-specific application.\
    \ Fig. 3 \nhighlights the soil map used for variable-rate technology to \nfind\
    \ the different nutrients needed in the soil. \nIn Geomapping and Remote Sensing,\
    \ sensors are usually \nused to construct a map with the different crop and soil\
    \ \nconditions, e.g., pest, soil pH, type of soil, nutrient level of the \nsoil.\
    \ Sensors are attached to different machines and vehicles to \nbe dominantly used\
    \ for creating soil maps. Sensors collect the \ninformation from the field and\
    \ GPS to assess the health \nstatistics of crops and soil. This information is\
    \ then passed on \nto a specific location in an area. Farmers can carry out \n\
    identification of specific events or any significant alteration in \nthe properties\
    \ of soil. Fig. 4 highlights the mapped field which \nis used by the sensors built\
    \ over the agriculture machine. \nIn the Automated Steering System, the vehicles\
    \ used in \nagriculture are involuntarily steered by the navigation system. \n\
    This \ntechnology \nreduces \nhuman-related \nerrors \nwhile \ncontrolling the\
    \ movement of the vehicle. It also permits \neffective management of the field\
    \ by providing overhead \ntuning andcontrolling the machinerybased on edge information.\
    \ \nThe existing system uses differential correction for real-time \nkinematics\
    \ to offer accuracy in the form of centimeters. Fig. 5 \nhighlights overlapping\
    \ factors of auto-steering system and \nmanual machine. \nHowever, to offer higher\
    \ accuracy for the machinery over \nthe deployed path, installing a specific communication\
    \ system \nwith a base station is required. A precise point positioning \nsystem\
    \ does not require any form of data communication in the \nauto-steering system\
    \ [24]. On the other hand, machinery can \nalso be allowed to be moved using GPS\
    \ based navigation \nsystem. \nFiled Name:\nFiled 1\nArea: 23.47 Ha\nPotassium\n\

    \ \nB. Review of Studies on Conventional PA Technologies \nThis section discusses\
    \ the various research work being \ncarried out towards different standard technologies\
    \ in PA \nbriefed in the prior section. \n Satellite Positioning System:  This\
    \ approach uses two \nprominent techniques, i.e., GPS (Global Positioning \nSystem)\
    \ and GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite \nSystem). It is found that GPS, when\
    \ integrated with the \nrobotic application, could significantly contribute \n\
    towards PA. However, the GPS signal’s availability \ncould be impacted due to\
    \ occlusion towards GPS-\nenabled Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) in farming. This \n\
    problem is addressed in Levoir et al. [25] by evolving \nout with a smart rover\
    \ that uses sophisticated image \nprocessing \nand \nstatistical \nanalysis \n\
    to \nperform \nlocalization tasks by the rover. Further studies show \nthat integrating\
    \ GPS with the sensory application could \nimprove the data acquisition with more\
    \ accuracy \n(Rodriguez et al. [26]). A prototype was developed for \nherbicide\
    \ ballistic technology integrated with sensors \nand GPS to automate data acquisition.\
    \ Prototyping-\nbased modeling is evolving in an existing system \nwhere \nGPS\
    \ \nis \nintegrated \nwith \na \nmicro-\nelectromechanical system.The idea was\
    \ to offer a \nprecise steering angle of the agriculture vehicle (Si et \nal.\
    \ [27]). An unscented Kalman filter did the \ncomputation of the steering angle.\
    \ Existing study \ntowards the adoption of GPS has mainly emphasized \nachieving\
    \ better accuracy for the receivers (Dabove et \nal. [28]).It should be noted\
    \ that GPS is an integral \nsection of GNSS with variable ranges of transmission\
    \ \nfrequency. Literature has also studied the adoption of \nGNSS towards precision\
    \ farming (Marucci et al. [29]); \nhowever, it does not work effectively in hilly\
    \ regions. \nThere is still a better possibility of improvement when \nthe GNSS\
    \ system is combined with different \ntechnologies to overcome this issue. GNSS\
    \ is also \nfound with various artifacts, e.g., multipath error, \natmospheric\
    \ \ninterference, \nsatellite \nconfiguration \n(Stombaugh et al. [30]). \n Variable\
    \ Rate Technology: This kind of technology is \nused for managing crop production\
    \ specific to the \nfarming region (Rubio and Mas [31], Ayaz et al. [32]). \n\
    The recent work carried out by Nordblom et al. [33] \nhave used variable rate\
    \ technology in PA focusing on \nnitrogen fertilizer input. The study integrates\
    \ such \napplication with Geographic Information System (GIS) \nand rainfall data\
    \ to determine the reason for \nwaterlogging in a specific geographic area. The\
    \ study \nhas also simulated data distribution of financial risk in \npredictive\
    \ mode to signify variable rate technology. A \nsimilar direction of work is also\
    \ carried out by Steffani \n[34], where a statistical model is used for analyzing\
    \ \nlint. The idea is to emphasize adequate control over the \nenvironment and\
    \ maximization of profit, as discussed \nin the study of Kweon et al. [35]. A\
    \ study carried out \nby Colaco [36] has analyzed the impact of this \ntechnology\
    \ on yield, the fertility of the soil, and \nfertilizer consumption. The study\
    \ outcome shows that \nthe variability factor can successfully achieve increased\
    \ \nproduction without much dependency on excessive \nfertilizers. A study carried\
    \ out by Nawar et al. [37] \nhighlights that this technology, when integrated\
    \ with \nregion delineation management approach then it could \nlead to better\
    \ efficiency in farming in contrast to \napplication with uniform rate. At present,\
    \ the \nimplementation of variable rate technology is further \nboosted by the\
    \ proliferation of novel solutions by \nmanufacturers of farming equipment. The\
    \ work carried \nout by Thomasson et al. [38] has discussed the \nfrequently adopted\
    \ manufacturers using crop sensors \nassociated with this technology of nitrogen\
    \ fertilizers. \nThe study also suggestsusing automatic differential \nharvesting\
    \ as another promising actuation process for \npromoting the harvesting process\
    \ over the field. \nAdoption of differential harvesting process is reported \n\
    in Sethuramasamyraja [39], where infrared sensors \nwere used over vineyards to\
    \ analyze the quality of \ngraph based on anthocyanin present in berries. The\
    \ \nimplementation is carried out as follows viz. \ni) anthocyanin contents of\
    \ the grapes are sensed, ii) a \ncertain level of the threshold for this content\
    \ is \nconsidered to generate a quality map for this data, and \niii) forwarding\
    \ the generated map to the user \n(harvester). \n Geomapping and Remote Sensing:\
    \ There are various \nforms of Geomapping and remote sensing approaches \nused\
    \ towards PA (Kim et al.[40]). This approach leads \nto the generation of agroecological\
    \ zones where \ndifferent attributes are subjected to analysis (Muthoni \net al.\
    \ [41]). The imageries obtained from satellite \nimages are studied for boundary\
    \ delineation using \nfeature extraction and image segmentation method \n(North\
    \ et al. [42]). The existing study has also \nwitnessed increased adoption of\
    \ Sentinel-2 data in PA \n(Sharifi [43]) for analyzing nitrogen usage. Nitrogen\
    \ is \nthe essential input for PA has also been studied by Yao \net al. [44] using\
    \ an active crop sensor.  Apart from \nthese conventional approaches, the advanced\
    \ integrated \napproach of drone technology and Internet-of-Things \nare also\
    \ deployed in precision farming (Uddin et al. \n[45]). Another interesting study\
    \ carried out by Xu et al. \n[46] has used data from cameras and terrestrial laser\
    \ \nscanning to monitor crop health in PA. The majority of \nthe approaches associated\
    \ with Geomapping and \nremote sensing are associated with capturing the field\
    \ \nimage followed by performing analysis. Proximal \nsensing is most recently\
    \ integrated with remote sensing \nfrom multiple sources to study the leaf area\
    \ index \n(Asad et al. [47]). This work connects the health \nstatistics of the\
    \ leaf with the topographical map of the \nearth. This model has three distinct\
    \ modules viz. i) data \nprocessing with semantic segmentation of ground \nimages,\
    \ ii) training using deep learning model, and iii) \nperforming prediction. The\
    \ study outcome suggests \nthat it is capable of performing better prediction\
    \ even \nwith images with low resolution. \n(IJACSA) International Journal of\
    \ Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 2, 2021 \n308 | P\
    \ a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \nThe current study has also discussed spectral\
    \ feature usage, \nwhere the prime challenge is to address the issues associated\
    \ \nwith data collection and training. This issue is addressed in \nAshourloo\
    \ et al. [48], which carried out a comparative study of \ndifferent variants of\
    \ spectral bands. The outcome shows \nsupport vector machine to be useful for\
    \ large scale of data \nusing time-series approach.  However, such an approach\
    \ is less \nutilized for computing as well as predicting yield. This \nproblem\
    \ is addressed in the work of Fieuzal et al. [49] \nconsidering leaf area index.\
    \ The data considered for this \nanalysis is from synthetic aperture radar, where\
    \ multiple \nsources are considered for analysis for evaluating a crop’s dry \n\
    mass. A similar study is also carried out by Zalite et al. [50], \nwhere time\
    \ series is considered. The study limits its evaluation \nfrom the wetlands, which\
    \ is another research challenge found \nin current times. The prime cause of this\
    \ challenge is spectral \nsimilarity and the degree of heterogeneity involved\
    \ in \nlandmasses. A study to address this challenge is seen in \nHempattarasuwan\
    \ et al. [51], where quantitative analysis is \ncarried out over historical data.\
    \ The study implements a \nclassification \napproach \nby \ncombining \nthree\
    \ \nstandard \napproaches, i.e., Mahalanobis distance, maximum likelihood, \n\
    and decision tree. The outcome shows a decision tree to offer \nbetter classification\
    \ performance. A study concerning leaf area \nindex is also carried out by Pan\
    \ et al. [52], where water content \ninformation is also used for modeling. The\
    \ emphasis on water \nattributes was also seen in the study of Patil et al. [53].\
    \ The \ncurrent study also claims that useful classification can be \ncarried\
    \ out using a PA's deep learning approach (Sun et al. \n[54]). From an approach\
    \ perspective, the random forest has \nalso registered itself to be assisting\
    \ in the classification of \nsatellite images of land (Zafari et al. [55]). In\
    \ such an approach, \na unique classifier is designed for constructing a similarity\
    \ \nkernel. There are also studies where correlated factors, e.g., \ndevelopment\
    \ stage and fractal dimension,are studied (Shen et \nal. [56]). Such study mainly\
    \ explores different factors that \naffect production, i.e., soil background and\
    \ different farming \npractices. A unique study carried out by Dong et al. [57]\
    \ has \nused chlorophyll index for assessing the internal processing of \ncrops\
    \ in PA.  The study carried out over simulated environment \nshows the potential\
    \ linear correlation among different variants \nof vegetation index. The study\
    \ contributes towards the impact \nof red edge reflectance associated with chlorophyll\
    \ during \nphotosynthesis. Such models emphasize the internal processing \nof\
    \ plant nutrients but do not focus on balancing them. \nBalancing the nutrient\
    \ demand is essential when it comes tothe \nmanagement of agricultural land in\
    \ PA. Such an approach was \ndiscussed by Gimenez et al. [58],where remotely sensed\
    \ data is \nintegrated with the model for land management. The study \ncontributes\
    \ towards yielding useful information associated with \nfarm practices and balancing\
    \ the nutrients demands on it.  \nExisting studies have also evolved with a unique\
    \ clustering \napproach on its features over the standard scale to assess the\
    \ \nmonitoring of crops in PA (Yuzugullu et al. [59]). The work \ncarried out\
    \ by Ali et al. [60] has developed a model for remote \nsensing where multitemporal\
    \ attributes have been used for \nevaluating biomass. The study has used an integrated\
    \ machine \nlearning approach where neuro-fuzzy logic, neural network, \nand linear\
    \ regression have been used over remotely sensed data \nto extract biomass estimates.\
    \ \n Automated Steering System: The research work \ntowards this approach is\
    \ mainly associated with \ndeveloping agricultural machinery to give them a \n\

    \ robots (Gonzalez-de-\nSantos et al. [67]), and automatic pilot system (Wang\

    \ of the dominant adoption of sensors, \ncurrent research work towards PA has\
    \ been revolutionized \nmore toward incorporating smart sensing. One of the prime\
    \ \nmotivations towards this research trend is the increasing \nawareness of Internet-of-Things\
    \ (IoT), where sensors are \nintegral. IoT is one dominant research topic for\
    \ improving \nagricultural yields (Kour and Arora [69]). It has contributed \n\
    towards opening avenues for smart farming and PA, although \nthere is some dominant\
    \ research gap (Kour and Arora [69]). In \nthis aspect, various forms of sensors\
    \ have also been \ninvestigated towards PA, where it is found that support vector\
    \ \nmachine and random forest are dominant classification \napproaches (Kamath\
    \ et al. [70]). Apart from this, there is also \ndedicated research work being\
    \ carried out where machine \nlearning approaches are claimed to optimize IoT\
    \ performance \nin PA to facilitate predictive operation for farming. \nWith the\
    \ adoption of various sensors for capturing field \ninformation, the data are\
    \ forwarded using various IEEE \nstandards of the family (e.g., 802.15.4/11 as\
    \ seen in the work of \nKone et al. [71]), which further forwards it to the gateway\
    \ node \nand then to cloud where the application of analytics resides \n(Ahmed\
    \ et al. [72]). The study offers some specific information \nthat was not found\
    \ in conventional PA-based approaches, e.g., \ni) energy being one of the practical\
    \ constraintsof using sensors \nin PA, and ii) routing and topology is another\
    \ essential \noperation, which is also challenged in adverse environmental \n\
    condition. There are various MAC protocols in wireless sensor \nnetworks [72],\
    \ but they do not combine to ensure downlink \nscheduling, multi-hop decisions,\
    \ heterogeneous duty cycles, \nand traffic adaptive. To perform a full scenario\
    \ to capture \nenvironment information of farming process, all this \ncharacteristic\
    \ is demanded in IoT. The adoption of IoT \ntechnology in PA is depicted in Fig.\
    \ 6. The figure shows how \nsensor devices, gateways, and WiFi technology integrated\
    \ with \ncloud infrastructure enableIoT-PA ecosystems. There are \nbasically severalwireless\
    \ sensor nodes deployed in the farm \nand agriculture fields in rural regions.\
    \ The sensor nodes capture \nsignificant events related to agriculture and send\
    \ them to the \ncloud computing system via WiFi and gateway-based \nnetworking\
    \ systems. The sensed data collected to the cloud is \nfurther stored and processed\
    \ by an analytics engine and fog \nnetworking to enable framers managing farms\
    \ to boost the \nquality and quantity of products and optimizes the cost \nassociated\
    \ with human labor required. However, in this \nscenario, the biggest impediment\
    \ is a trade-off concerning \nsupportability and efficiency between the protocols\
    \ in IoT and \nWireless Sensor Network (WSN). \nCloud \nWiFi Node\n10 KM Link\n\

    \ PA. \nThe most recent study carried out by Gulec et al. [73] has \ndiscussed\
    \ improving the lifetime of WSN focusing on PA in a \ndistributed environment.\
    \ The study uses connected dominating \nsets as a backbone of communication in\
    \ WSN considering \nharvester and regular sensors in farming. The study outcome\
    \ is \nobtained from both experimental and simulated versions stating \nthat the\
    \ proposed system is energy efficient. Existing research \n(IJACSA) International\
    \ Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 2, 2021\
    \ \n311 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \nshows certain dedicated attempts\
    \ to model WSN in PA with \nuniform sensory node distribution over the farming\
    \ area. The \nwork carried out by Bacco et al. [74] has developed a channel \n\
    model that is used by the ground sensors to perform data \ntransfer. However,\
    \ the emphasis was more on the usage of \nIEEE standards and less on WSN. Adopting\
    \ the heterogeneous \nsensor network is witnessed in Sylvian et al. [75] and \n\
    Kaiwartya et al. [76]. In this work, prototyping is carried out \nusing different\
    \ sensors to capture different information \nassociated with farm fields and crops.\
    \ \nFurther, WSN also claims to offer a decision support \nsystem for facilitating\
    \ water usage (Khan et al. [77]). A \nprototype is designed where the temperature\
    \ is used for \nenvironmental monitoring in PA. The study analyzes the \nconsumption\
    \ of current while functioning over different \ndegrees of temperatures. Importance\
    \ over plant water is \nanother investigation in the existing system, an essential\
    \ part of \nthe leaf sensing system in WSN with PA. The current study \nclaims\
    \ that the adoption of backscatter-based sensor nodes \ncould enhance the PA performance\
    \ from the perspective of \npower-saving (Daskalakis et al. [78]). The study has\
    \ also used \nMorse code, which is computationally cost-effective for carrier\
    \ \nsignal modulation. Focus on power saving can also be \nimplemented using non-orthonormal\
    \ multiple access in WSN \n(Hu et al. [79]). The study outcome shows that this\
    \ mechanism \nsignificantly controls outage probability and the rate of \nsummed\
    \ data. \nThe majority of the existing studies emphasize estimating \nsoil parameters\
    \ in PA; however, the modeling attributes are \nless emphasized towards power.\
    \ A study on such issues is \ncarried out by Estrada-Lopez et al. [80], where\
    \ a WSN \ntopology is constructed using both cloud and IoT considering \nsoil\
    \ parameters. The data analysis is carried out by an artificial \nneural network\
    \ followed by using a unique power management \nscheme. Apart from the terrestrial\
    \ application, the adoption of \nWSN is also carried out over the underground\
    \ ecosystem. \nSalam et al. [81] have developed such a system to model \nchannel\
    \ impulse. The study has also analyzed various time-\ndomain attributes, e.g.,\
    \ gain in multipath power, channel \ncapacity, delay, etc. A study on a similar\
    \ direction towards the \nunderground ecosystem is also investigated by Castellanos\
    \ et \nal. [82], where soil parameters are collected using a narrow-\nband communication\
    \ scheme of Long Term Evolution (LTE). \nThe study uses unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ to collect data from \nunderground sensors over the potato crop field. Another\
    \ study \nof the underground ecosystem is carried out by Sambo et al. \n[83],\
    \ where a path loss model is presented along with \npredictive framework development\
    \ using a complex dielectric \nconstant. \nDeployment of WSN in PA was also claimed\
    \ to enhance \nproductivity by using dataloggers and actuators (Lozoya et al.\
    \ \n[84]). The current study of WSN is also focused on \nincorporating intelligence\
    \ in the process of irrigation in PA. \nThe work carried out by Jamroen et al.\
    \ [85] has developed an \nirrigation scheduling mechanism using fuzzy logic in\
    \ WSN. \nThe outcome witnessed an increase in crop yield. The current \nstudy\
    \ also discusses the usage of WSN for assisting in \nlocalizing in PA. Sahota\
    \ and Kumar [86] have implemented a \nmodel where the received signal strength\
    \ has been used for \ndistribution over WSN. The study develops a node localization\
    \ \nmodel considering distance propagation invarious degrading \neffective over\
    \ the signal considering fading and path loss \nmodel. The study contributes to\
    \ predicting loss in nitrogen. A \nsimilar received signal strength-based approach\
    \ for assisting in \nlocalization has also been carried out by Abouzar et al.\
    \ [87]. \nThis study has used a spanning tree for developing belief \npropagation.\
    \ \nA unique concept towards promoting energy harvesting in \nPA is discussed\
    \ by Konstantopoulos et al. [88]. According to \nthis study, the electric potential\
    \ produced within a plant is used \nas a power source for WSN. The study uses\
    \ nonnegative matrix \nfactorization to process this electric potential signal.\
    \ From the \nviewpoint of power saving, it is also found that data registers'\
    \ \nfrequency plays a crucial role. The energy-saving in WSN can \nbe facilitated\
    \ using this data register frequency variation to \nimpact PA (Santos and Cugnasca\
    \ [89]). Another essential \nfactor to be considered is the presence of partitioned\
    \ sensors in \nPA, which leads to disruption in the network. The work carried\
    \ \nout by Maheswararajah et al. [90] hypothesizes that the \npresence of such\
    \ nodes leads to noise in the measurement. A \nKalman-filter-based optimization\
    \ strategy is developed to \nrestore such nodes. Existing literature further hypothesizes\
    \ that \nmonitoring environmental values is essential when deploying \nWSN in\
    \ PA. The work of Kampianakis et al. [91] has \npresented a prototype that employs\
    \ the networking principle of \nsensor nodes (especially modulation of analog\
    \ frequency) \nalong with software-defined radio. \nThe summary of the practical\
    \ approaches in WSN in PA is \ntabulated in Table II. \n \n \n(IJACSA) International\

    \ trend, it is seen that IoT, \nalong with the inclusion of software and different\
    \ variants of \nsensing technology, is going to minimize the skilled labors in\
    \ \nagriculture in the coming days. The global market is not \nconsistently evolving\
    \ with the rise of real-time kinetic \ntechnology, remote sensing technology,\
    \ networking, variable \nrate technology, robotics, and fertilizers and sprayer\
    \ \ncontrollers. \nA. Trend in PA Research \nThe last decade has witnessed approximately\
    \ 1710 research \npapers in PA approaches while only 230 are found to be \njournals\
    \ in IEEE Xplore digital library. A nearly similar trend \nis found in other reputed\
    \ publishers like ACM digital library, \nSpringer, ScienceDirect, and Elsevier.\
    \ There are very few \nstudies towards automated steering systems, while more\
    \ \nstudies are populated in the adoption of satellite positioning \nsystems (GPS,\
    \ GNSS). Not much work is carried out towards \nvariable rate technology. However,\
    \ some potential work in a \nlarge number has been carried out towards remote\
    \ sensing and \nsoil mapping. More inclination is seen towards remote sensing\
    \ \napproaches using hyperspectral images or other equivalent \nforms of images\
    \ from an unmanned flying object (drones).  \nHowever, the trend is more on adopting\
    \ a single crop field is \nextensively more investigated, and multi-crop land\
    \ is less \nfound in consideration, which could impedeupcoming research \nwork.\
    \ Agriculture 4.0 is an upcoming standard for automating \nPA; however, studies\
    \ show few implementations associated \nwith such upcoming standard formulation.\
    \ Image processing \nremains the dominant approach, and its adoption is consistently\
    \ \nincreasing; however, there is a shift of this approach with data-\ncentric\
    \ technologies in IoT. \nB. Trend in Technological Adoption \nThe present scenario\
    \ of implementation in PA is highly \nscattered. More work is carried out using\
    \ prototyping, and less \nmathematical or computational modeling is noticed. Adoption\
    \ \nof machine learning or artificial intelligence is also found to be \nless\
    \ prominent in this aspect. Although machine learning has \nbeen used in existing\
    \ studies, it is not evaluated fromits \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced\
    \ Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 2, 2021 \n313 | P a g e  \n\
    www.ijacsa.thesai.org \ncomputational complexity. The engineering area, e.g.,\
    \ robotics, \nembedded system, machinery compilation, etc. is more \nfocused,\
    \ limiting investigation strength and giving less \nexposure to unknown challenges\
    \ in PA. Adopting IoT and \nWSN has just started its research work, and it has\
    \ more way to \ngo to achieve its state of maturity as a research standard model.\
    \ \nThe development of a test-bed for analyzing farming data is \nanother inclusive\
    \ research trend in PA. \nC. Trend in Target Issues \nThe issues mainly considered\
    \ in the existing system in PA \nare mainly associated with environmental monitoring.\
    \ The \nexisting research trend is also to consider a specific issue \nconnected\
    \ with a specific crop, making the model heavily case-\nspecific and less applicable\
    \ to different environments. Data \nacquisition is another target issue considered\
    \ in the existing \nresearch trend in PA. Different techniques have been carried\
    \ \nout towards acquiring data. However, less emphasis is offered \nto analyze\
    \ this collected data. The trend towards analytics over \nmulti-crop land is less\
    \ found. Adopting sensors integrated with \ndifferent networking principles also\
    \ assists in data acquisition; \nhowever, there are various open-end challenges\
    \ associated, \ne.g., non-inclusion of the energy model makes such a solution\
    \ \nlimited to theoretical concepts. \nV. DISCUSSION AND PERSPECTIVE \nBased on\
    \ the observation being carried out towards \nconventional approaches used in\
    \ PA and the upcoming \nadoption of WSN in PA, it is noticed that there are various\
    \ \nconcluding remarks associated with the overall techniques used \nin PA. This\
    \ section briefs about the learning outcomes of the \nproposed review work as\
    \ follows: \n A \ntradeoff \nbetween \nDemands \nand \nAvailable \nTechnology:\
    \ A closer look into the available \napproaches shows that PA needs to consider\
    \ multiple \nattributes simultaneously, e.g., soil health, plant-related \nfeatures,\
    \ surrounding environment, and weather. There \nare many more sub-attributes for\
    \ this core attribute, \nwhich require equal attention for improved crop \ncultivation\
    \ and environmental risk reduction. All the \nexisting approaches using a conventional\
    \ approach or \nWSN based approaches use only a limited number of \nsuch attributes\
    \ in modeling its PA. On the other side, \nthere has been an immense advancement\
    \ in prototyping \nas \nwell as computational \nmodeling. However, \nprototyping\
    \ is the most dominant approach in PA in \nexisting studies. Hence, the demand\
    \ to offer productive \nPA performance is immensely more which are not \nfound\
    \ to be considered while modeling with existing \ntechnological advancement. \n\
     Lack of Uncertainty-based Modelling: There are \nvarious \nattributes \nlike\
    \ \ncrop \nhealth, \nrainfall, \ntemperature, soil health, etc. they are stochastic.\
    \ \nExisting approaches focus on modeling predefined \necosystems, which is more\
    \ or less impractical than \nreal-world scenarios. There isa various uncertain\
    \ \nscenario that could develop either using conventional \nor WSN based approaches,\
    \ e.g. rate of energy \ndepletion,incoming \nstreamed \ndata, \nmobile \nof \n\
    machinery, occlusion in GPS-based data, etc. Until and \nunless such uncertainty\
    \ conditions are not included in \nthe modeling, the outcome may eventually result\
    \ in \noutliers.  Apart from this, various studies where \nmachine learning has\
    \ been used do not consider this, \nleading to its solution inapplicable to real-time\
    \ \napplication. \n Use Case Specific Study: Almost all the existing PA \napproaches\
    \ have considered a specific use case of crop \nor study environment (e.g., soil\
    \ health, water, \ntemperature, etc.). On the other side, the conventional \n\
    study approach has focused on the adoption of specific \nmachinery. The modeling\
    \ is carried out considering a \nspecific form of crops using any of the approaches\
    \ in \nPA. This means that there is no generalized algorithm \nto solve a similar\
    \ problem when environmental \nvariables change. It also incurs more cost when\
    \ it \ncomes to deploying commercial products and their \nadoption. It is only\
    \ cost-effective of a simplified model \n(or product) that can address multiple\
    \ PA problems \naltogether. \n Less Emphasis over Routing: Routing or deploying\
    \ a \ncommunication protocol is significant usingthe larger \nfarming \narea \n\
    with \nchallenging \ncommunication \nscenarios (e.g., forest, terrain, etc.).\
    \ It is already \nobserved that the adoption of the hybrid approach is \nthe most\
    \ effective one to mitigate the limitation of \nsingle-approach. For example,\
    \ GPS integrated with \nsensor nodes or drones could offer more effective data\
    \ \ncapture than considering any of them. This also means \nthat there isa good\
    \ possibility of hybridizing different \ntypes of machinery and different nodes\
    \ to facilitate an \neffective data transmission in PA. However, this \nchallenge\
    \ can be addressed if a unique routing protocol \nis designed and developed for\
    \ such a scenario. No \nstudies are being carried out in evolving a novel \nrouting\
    \ scheme in PA;instead, it reuses the adopted \ntechniques' routing scheme. This\
    \ also offers more \nimpediments towards data transmission when the farm \nenvironment\
    \ is subjected to priority-based data \ntransmission \nor \nexercising \nspecific\
    \ \ntime-critical \napplications. \n IoT and WSN still in the Nascent Stage:\
    \ IoT is slowly \nmaking its entry from the roof of research and \ndevelopment\
    \ to the commercial world. Apart from this, \nthe study shows that most PA approaches\
    \ have a \ndeployment of sensor nodes for soil mapping, remote \nsensing, etc.\
    \ (conventional approach in PA), but they \ndo not have a deployment of WSN, which\
    \ makes a \nnetwork of sensors. With the inclusion of automation \nstandard 4.0,\
    \ there is a need for smart farming using \nIoT, which is still under development.\
    \ Apart from this, \nWSN is an integral part of IoT. However, there has \nbeen\
    \ immense work towards addressing multiple \nproblems in WSN in past decades,\
    \ and their solutions \nare not directly applicable in IoT. There is always a\
    \ \ntradeoff between IoT and WSN with the inclusion of \nIoT based routing scheme\
    \ and WSN based routing \nscheme that requires smooth integration. Hence, \n(IJACSA)\
    \ International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol.\
    \ 12, No. 2, 2021 \n314 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \ncurrent approaches\
    \ in WSN on PA aresignificantly less \nand insignificant in contrast to conventional\
    \ PA \napproaches. \n Lack of inclusion of Resource: Sensor nodes of any \nform\
    \ are characterized by the limited capability of \nprocessing as well as they\
    \ have limited availability of \nresources too (e.g., memory, channel capacity,\
    \ energy, \netc.). None of the existing studies where WSN is \nconsidered in PA\
    \ has any inclusion of novel resource \nmanagement model exclusively focusing\
    \ on constraints \nassociated with PA's farming environment. Without the \ninclusion\
    \ of the resource factor, modeling any solution \nwill be more impractical. \n\
     Few Studies towards Optimization: By optimization, it \ncan represent a technique\
    \ that offers increased \nperformance yield with low inclusion/dependencies of\
    \ \nresources. Machine learning has been used for this \npurpose to some extent.\
    \ At present, many optimization-\nbased approaches fit on solving various problems\
    \ \nassociated with PA. A closer look into the existing \nsystem \nalso \nshows\
    \ \nthat \nit \ndoes \nnot \nensure \ncomputational cost-effectiveness in its\
    \ algorithm. \nHence, the adoption of appropriate optimization \ntechniques is\
    \ highly demanded. \nVI. CONCLUSION \nThe manuscript discusses the PA approaches\
    \ and \ntechniques that are mainly associated with implementing a \nmanagement\
    \ scheme towards facilitating effective responses \ntoward crops, measurement,\
    \ and observation towards animals \nand fields. Adoption of PA leads to enhanced\
    \ yields in the \ncrop, cost reduction, and process input optimization. However,\
    \ \nthere are various challenges associated with it. There is an \ninclusion of\
    \ higher initial capital to implement PA in real-time, \nand such investment is\
    \ carried out for long-term plans. In order \nto reach the PA implementation maturity\
    \ stage, several years \nmay be consumed prior to even possessing adequate data\
    \ to \nimplement even the conventional approaches completely. The \nfinal challenge\
    \ in PA implementation is its data aggregation \nfollowed by an analysis, which\
    \ could be an extensively \ndemanding task. Based on the presented findings of\
    \ existing \nresearch work, it could be just said that effective \nimplementation\
    \ of PA demands i) precise management, \nii) identification and adoption of appropriate\
    \ technology, and \niii) data. \n1) Overall summary: The essential findings of\
    \ the proposed \nstudy are summarized as follows: i) existing approaches of PA\
    \ \nhas an increasing concern over interoperability of different \ninnovative\
    \ systems and tools, ii) adoption of PA by ordinary \nfarmers will be a big task\
    \ as the technologies involved in it are \nhighly advanced and require a thorough\
    \ knowledge of it, \niii) despite various studies using IoT, narrowband, GPS,\
    \ WSN, \netc., coverage and connectivity in rural areas will be a \npotentiallytricky\
    \ task, iv) An appropriate PA implementation \nleads to generate a massive score\
    \ of big farming data which is \nimpossible to analyze from a single data point\
    \ in the crop field.  \nWith the increasing adoption of multi-crop land, there\
    \ will be \nmassive growth of data and understanding the significance and \npriority\
    \ of such data will be near to impossible for average \nfarmers in existing times,\
    \ v) IoT and WSN is the most \npromising technology in PA, but adoption of current\
    \ schemes \nonly induces scalability problems along with troublesome \nconfiguration\
    \ issues, vi) there is a lack of mathematical \nmodelling seen in the existing\
    \ system using WSN, which has \nbetter future scope. \n2) Future work: The future\
    \ direction of work will consider \nadopting IoT and WSN, which is the most demanding\
    \ \nupcoming technology for reshaping the existing system to \nFarming 4.0. In\
    \ this context, the next work is to design and \ndevelop an IoT scenario with\
    \ multi-crop land powered by \nheterogeneous WSN. The focus will be first to include\
    \ all real-\ntime constraints, e.g., energy, coverage and connectivity, \nresource\
    \ management of the sensors. The secondary focus is to \nformulate a novel routing\
    \ scheme thatoffers flexibility, \nscalability, and resource efficiency. It is\
    \ also necessary to \nperform the complete modeling using the computational model,\
    \ \nconsidering its applicability to practical world scenarios. The \ninclusion\
    \ of multiple challenging test-bed and an effective \nvalidation technique could\
    \ further offer more reliability to PA's \nupcoming solution. \nREFERENCES \n\

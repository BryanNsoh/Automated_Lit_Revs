    Get rights and content Abstract The development of industrialization and information
    communication technology (ICT) has deeply changed our way of life. In particular,
    with the emerging theory of “Industry 4.0”, the integration of cloud technologies
    and industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPS) becomes increasingly important, as
    this will greatly improve the manufacturing chain and business services. In this
    paper, we first describe the development and character of ICPS. ICPS will inevitably
    play an important role in manufacturing, sales, and logistics. With the support
    of the cloud, ICPS development will impact value creation, business models, downstream
    services, and work organization. Then, we present a service-oriented ICPS model.
    With the support of the cloud, infrastructure platform and service application,
    ICPS will promote the manufacturing efficiency, increase quality of production,
    enable a sustainable industrial system and more environmentally friendly businesses.
    Thirdly, we focus on some key enabling technologies, which are critical in supporting
    smart factories. These key enabling technologies will also help companies to realize
    high quality, high output, and low cost. Finally, we talk about some challenges
    of ICPS implementation and the future work. Previous article in issue Next article

    wireless networks 1. Introduction The rapid development of information communication
    technologies (ICTs) has significantly changed design, manufacturing, logistics,
    and service. Especially in the process of Industry 4.0, due to the deep integration
    of micro controller and physical devices, our machines and tools are becoming
    more automated and self-sufficient, increasingly replacing manual labor. The integration
    of computing, communication, and control technologies has led to developments
    in real-time sensing, the dynamic control of large-scale engineering systems,
    information services, and production life cycle management (PLCM). Yet these technologies
    still do not fulfill our needs. The final aims of cyber physical systems (CPS)
    [1], [2], [3] are to realize “intelligent monitoring” and “intelligent control”.
    These are the processes which need to realize real-time information extraction,
    data analysis, decision making and data transmission. On the other hand, the human
    race is meeting two tremendous challenges: global climate change and the energy
    crisis. The demands of sustainable development and green business have become
    more prominent in our daily life, and ICT as a key support to optimize manufacturing
    chain will play an important role in it. So, the work of integration of physical
    world and cyber world is inevitable [4], [5], [6]. And many countries has made
    CPS as a national development strategy and put it on the top of the priority list.
    Germany’s implementation of Industry 4.0 has received great attention in the business
    world, resulting in more companies wanting to improve their manufacturing chains
    to realize it. CPS is effective in combining computation with a physical process,
    thus achieving the goal of integration of industrialization and ICT [7]. Furthermore,
    CPS combines embedded computers, networks, sensors, and actuators [8], [9], which
    are important for smart manufacturing. Such as in the process of PLCM, ICPS will
    help meet customer demand by monitoring every part of production, realizing real-time
    logistics, and providing comprehensive customer services. Additionally, applications
    of CPS will have the giant potential to change the world in many fields [10].
    These include population crisis, environment protection, health care, easing transportation
    pressure, the control of smart grids, saving energy, etc. It is also easy to envision
    new capabilities, such as supply to manufacturing chains, to realize smart production,
    smart logistics, smart grids and real-time services. Currently, due to the increased
    popularity of smart manufacturing and smart factories, ICPS cannot fulfill our
    demand. In the process of Industry 4.0, traditional industries are hard to integrate
    industrial sources, social sources and share them [11]. What is more, companies
    need more hardware and software platforms to optimize their industry chains. Moreover,
    the fast growing data volume is hard to process. But now, the ICPS technologies
    cannot support ultra-fast computing and high throughout reliable networks, which
    are essential for businesses. Without enough resources, it cannot provide real-time
    and reliable services to corporations. Thus, an industrial cloud to support to
    ICPS will be highly beneficial. Industrial clouds will supply all kinds of manufacturing
    services and realize the open collaboration between manufacturing resources and
    services, as well as to enable a high degree of social resource sharing. Moreover,
    this will supply a big platform to generate a series of new service models for
    PLCM, including supply standards, specifications, and sharing resources. Meanwhile,
    industrial cloud will take more optimization to ICPS that now discussed. 1.1.
    Provide distributed fast computing With the development of big data and cloud
    computing, the multi-channel distributed computing method achieves fast computational
    speed. What is more, the cloud can supply a big source pool to store, process,
    and analyze these data, which will generate accurate data information and reduce
    costs. 1.2. Provide flexibility and scalability services Everyday, there are numerous
    data and application uploads on the cloud. These sources can be easily searched
    by enterprises to help them ascertain customers’ demand, design products and manage
    products life cycle. Meanwhile, the cloud can be as a big platform for every company
    to storage their data, analysis their information and utilize these upload application
    to optimize their manufacturing chain, increase their production efficiency and
    reduce cost. 1.3. Provide security Private, public, and hybrid clouds all contain
    many high-reliability security mechanisms to provide safe service. This is similar
    to the scheme of “end-to-end security”, which is used to ensure information security
    in the process of sending and receiving e-mails. Moreover, with the support of
    clouds [12], [13], data storage and exchange become faster and faster, which enables
    the construction of intelligent factories. In the industrial environment, with
    the support of the cloud, the CPS system will promote the objects of production
    directly or via the Internet to achieve independent information exchange, operation
    and mutual manipulation through machine to machine (M2M) communication [14]. This
    model will make great progress in the industrial processes of manufacturing, industrial
    engineering, material utilization, supply chain management and PLCM. Just like
    the expression in the Fig. 1, ICPS will focus on the building of smart factories
    and through cloud to combine them with smart mobility, smart grids, smart buildings,
    smart production and smart logistics. Furthermore, the cloud will augment optimize
    industry chain, increase production efficiency, data exchanges and applications
    [15], [16]. The cloud is like a huge resource pool. In any process of the ICPS,
    we can deploy services via the cloud to acquire our required information and help
    us improve our service chain. Furthermore, the cloud can be used as a storage
    server and information exchange tool, making the manufacturing chain more flexible
    and usable to provide customers with goods of higher quality and personalization

    image Fig. 1. The structure of cloud-assisted ICPS. However, in the implementation
    of ICPS, we can find obvious gaps between the ideal situation and reality. Cloud-assisted
    ICPS needs high integration of the cyber world (which includes communication technologies,
    computing technologies, big data, etc.) and the physical world (which includes
    industrial manufacturing chains, sensors, actuators, etc.) [18]. The development
    of these enabling technologies will determine the realization of ICPS. In this
    paper, we explore the novel service-oriented cloud-assisted ICPS model. We express
    the views that against the backdrop of Industry 4.0, this model will substantially
    improve production chains and can realize smart manufacturing and smart factories.
    Next, according to the demand of ICPS, we depict some key enabling technologies
    and show their larger applications in industry. We also discuss challenges that
    will be met in this process and propose solutions. With the support of the cloud
    and integration of the cyber and physical worlds, our approach can actualize smart
    mobility, smart grids, smart logistics and smart products. The rest of the paper
    is organized as follows. Section 2 addresses the architecture of service-oriented
    ICPS. Section 3 talks about some key enabling technologies that are used in ICPS.
    Section 4 depicts the challenges that are needed to solve existing challenges.
    In Section 5, we express our predictions and discuss future work. 2. Architecture
    of service-oriented cloud-assisted ICPS Due to the fast development of our society
    and fast consumption of resources, sustainability becomes an important issue and
    garners attention. Two key ICT technologies provide an important role in the sustainability
    of industrial systems: service-oriented architectures (SOA) and CPS [19], [20].
    SOA’s advantages make it suitable for a growing number of industrial systems,
    including integration flexibility and the ability for processes to be composed.
    CPS involves the integration of the computational and physical worlds. In factories,
    the same principles apply as in the personal sector [21], [22]. With the perfection
    of infrastructure service platform, it will make automation more easily. All kinds
    of sensors perceive the physical information around them, and transform these
    data to control centers. Then, the control centers will give the order to actuators
    to change a station. It uses the method of embedded systems to integrate computation,
    sensors and actuators in devices [23]. Then, industrial networks supply the support
    of M2M communication, break the limitation of source constraints, and achieve
    resource sharing and distributed computing. Among network layers, numerous devices
    link the Internet. These computers, storage devices and control devices can be
    integrated as services and provide support to accomplish specific tasks, and provide
    virtual computing for terminals [24]. These may also create many applications
    for industries. These software component technologies, including object-oriented
    design and service-oriented architectures, are built on abstractions that match
    software better than physical systems [25], [26]. These features will improve
    convenience in the personal and industrial sectors. In the near future, information
    will be the core resource of every enterprise. Every company will endeavor to
    provide the best services to their customers. By searching customers’ demand,
    data on the manufacture of products, customer service, and PLCM will be available
    to industries, which is just the core of quality of service (QoS). Thus, big data
    and cloud services will inevitably play an important role in our daily manufacturing
    [27], [28]. With these cloud service platform, we can easily storage and analyze
    our data, exchange information among companies, integrate production chain between
    enterprises and transform our production mode. But we must think about several
    questions, such as how to find the demands of customers, what machines should
    cooperate with others, where is the best place for selling, and what is the problem
    with our product. The answers will easily find through cloud and obviously provide
    significant improvement to companies. As we show in the Fig. 2, in the process
    of implement of service-oriented cloud-assisted ICPS, we can divide it as three
    steps. The first is to deploy infrastructure to make equipments become smart and
    can communication with others. The second step is to supply them platform for
    processing their data and information. The last is to provide various applications
    to promote their production efficiency and industrial chain. What’s more, cloud
    multimedia services can provide an efficient, flexible, and scalable data processing
    method and offer a solution for the user demands of high quality and diversified
    file formats. We can easily obtain every device’s real-time station and every
    user’s demand, so we can provide high quality, high speed, humanization, individualization
    and real-time service [29]. Download : Download high-res image (582KB) Download

    will focus on the SOA’s following advantages that are essential for industrial
    system. 2.1. Comprehensive and distributed services For every company, these comprehensive
    and distributed services provide support to manage their workflows, optimize their
    manufacturing chains, provide high quality and low price product to their customers,
    etc. With the various kinds and different levels of services to choose from, our
    enterprises can select the most fitting server depending on the timeliness, reliability
    and energy efficiency desired. For instance, a company can accurately find the
    customers’ demand and give them real-time help, which is based on the data that
    was composed from customers’ location, hobby, context-aware searching [30], [31]
    and some others. 2.2. Transparency services In industrial systems, we may often
    encounter equipment that can’t be extended to more applications due to the core
    layer limits. Because, every enterprise prefer selling their products to selling
    their technologies because these data and technologies is their lifeline and they
    do not want to share with others. This is just a problem of protecting private
    information. However, for service-oriented architectures, the services will be
    transparent for all the industries and they can easily monitor the performance
    of all the devices and find problems in a timely fashion. 2.3. Service security
    An increasing number of data attacks and information leakage has influenced the
    core interests of enterprises. It may even destroy the industrial chain just like
    the Iran petroleum system accident. For another part, many companies may spend
    much more money to buy some well-known security mechanisms to protect their workflow.
    However, these mechanisms are not suitable for ICPS networks and systems because
    they can’t provide any fine-grain access control. Service-oriented architecture,
    on the other hand, allows fine grain access control on every service and method
    on a case-by-case basis. This is similar to the end-to-end plugins that are made
    by Google, which provides terminal-to-terminal email encryption. User data will
    be encrypted when it leaves the browsers, and will be decrypted when the message
    is received by the recipient. Comparing the ICPS and traditional manufacturing
    systems, we can find that, with the support of cloud and some other technologies,
    the industrial manufacturing will become more efficient, flexible, fast and humanized.
    Just as show in Table 1, the ICPS will help us to realize sustainable manufacturing
    and green business. Table 1. The compare with traditional manufacturing system
    and ICPS. Type Traditional manufacturing system ICPS Production mode Manual control,
    assembly line operation Remote control, automatic production Single production
    process and production line Flexible production line Semi-mechanical assembly-line

    finish different task Manual maintenance Self-detection, early warning, self-adjustment

    individual cost and material is the same Flexibility All the designs are determined
    by designers Customer can change their design at any time Real-time Customer cannot
    get their ideal product until the enterprise has designed and produced it Smart
    production and smart logistics provide real-time products Personal-oriented service
    The transaction is terminal after the sale The company monitors the product’s
    life cycle and provides customer service 3. Key enabling technologies During the
    process of ICPS, WSN, internet of things, industrial cloud technologies and some
    other enabling technologies will take so much promotion to it. We can divide ICPS
    into three levels, the first is infrastructure that is aim to connect every device
    and realize smart interoperability. This process can be represented as M2M communication
    that is committed to make all of machines connective. The second level is network
    level, which is to achieve intelligent communication. In which, industrial wireless
    network plays an important role. The top level is cloud, which is a big service
    platform to storage information, analysis data, supply applications, etc. 3.1.
    Industrial cloud technologies ICPS is the process of integrating computation into
    manufacturing chains and other areas of LCM. It is necessary to process the data
    that come from different companies, different devices and various communication
    networks. Then, we need to analyze it and acquire the key information for our
    daily production, which is the format of smart manufacturing. Furthermore, with
    the support of cloud technologies, it will generate an increasing number of applications
    to improve the manufacturing chain. 3.1.1. Industrial cloud computing Due to the
    explosive growth of data volume and real-time service concept, we need more rapid
    methods to deal with these data. Cloud computing will change the traditional way
    of passive market research model and use the active perception, discovery to realize
    accurate insight into market information. In addition, cloud computing is to use
    public servers and network device [32]. It will reduce most cost on equipment
    and allows companies to focus on increasing their core value services. What’s
    more, due to the advantages of cloud platform, most service system is scalability
    and flexibility. It can easy to transplant to another platform. In industrial
    manufacturing chains, due to the demand of manufacturing and PLCM, cloud computing
    is different from traditional cloud technologies and has its own characteristics.
    In the information age, the core competitiveness of a company is fast information
    and real-time responses, which require the cloud technologies to provide fast,
    accurate and uninterrupted computing from social resources and manufacturing resources.
    In another part, Industry 4.0 will generate countless data from various domains
    like sensors, machines, social networks and LCM. This means the cloud computing
    must integrate these data and find the useful information. The growing popularity
    of social computing, which is used to help people understand and study the various
    problems in the social sciences, and promote benefits and an enhanced level of
    human social activities through ICT. In industries, this technology will help
    business to analyze the social behavior and computational system to find social
    demand, and optimize life cycle management. Now, with the increase of social computing
    platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Skype and YouTube, it will speed the development
    of intelligent manufacturing and provide personalized and real-time service to
    customers. 3.1.2. Industrial big data Big data and cloud computing are highly
    interdependent. Without cloud computing, big data is useless and vice versa. Now,
    with the development of industrialization, the quantity of machines have several
    times as many as human beings, and the amount of data generated from manufacturing
    chains continually increases. Industrial sensors, radio frequency identification
    systems, bar codes, industrial automation control systems, enterprise resource
    planning, computer aided design and other technologies are increasingly rich in
    industrial data volume. These data are huge and unstructured, which is difficult
    to process, so we must use some professional tools to solve it. Recently, however,
    applications can process these big data within a “tolerable elapsed time” [33].
    The goal of industrial CPS is to find the customers’ demand and provide personalized
    product and real-time PLCM, so it is necessary to collect and analyze these data
    [34]. The most challenging aspect is to explore the large volumes of data and
    extract useful information or knowledge for future actions [35]. In our survey,
    there are 48 h of video uploaded to YouTube, 100 thousand statuses in twitter,
    and billions of other messages every minute. What’s more, these data have high
    volume, variety data types and formats, so we must use some special database and
    hardware environments to collect and process them. The volume of data is very
    large (as large as exa-bytes), and arises from various domains, including public
    information, sensors, climate and other channels [36], [37], [38]. Several new
    types of “octopus” data collection platforms now exist, the most common tools
    including the following. (1) ScraperWiki [39], a web-based platform for collaboratively
    building programs to extract and analyze public (online) data. (2) Needlebase
    [40], which can schedule a scraper to run at regular intervals, while re-formatting
    data to clarify it, filter it, or make it compatible with other sets of data.
    Then, it visualizes and combines data from more than one source. (3) Hadoop [41]
    contains a distributed file system (HDFS), and supports high error tolerance.
    It can be deployed in low-cost hardware to increase throughput. (4) Thingspeak
    [42] is a free web service hosted by an I/O bridge that lets you collect and store
    sensor data and develop IoT applications. The data from multiple sensors can be
    sent to ThingSpeak from Arduino, Raspberry Pi and some others. Then, ThingSpeak
    can integrate with matlab to analyze and visualize these data, etc. As shown in
    Fig. 3, all kinds of applications collect these initial data and store them in
    different ways. Due to the different structure of data, we need to extract and
    integrate them. Then, we use some professional algorithm to analyze it and find
    the useful information like customers’ demand, transport conditions, weather changes
    and medical status. We can image a scene that when we share our new ideas of some
    products with friends through social networking, we may never wish to realize
    these functions right now. However, with the support of cloud technologies, enterprises
    can use data mining to search your demands, then use 3D printing to produce personalized
    product and deliver the goods to you through smart logistics. Download : Download

    of data processing. 3.2. Industrial wireless networks In the form of modern intelligent
    manufacturing, the maximum demand is to realize collaboration among companies,
    devices and terminals. This corporate synergy takes the form of horizontal integration,
    which is to gather the advantages of various companies to provide better services.
    However, in an enterprise, the demand is to coordinate each device to work together
    and produce better goods. The end-to-end integration aims to use sensors, controllers
    and actuators to realize intelligent monitoring [43], [44], intelligent manufacturing,
    intelligent logistics, and real-time communication. In this process, the most
    important thing is information exchange, which includes information interactions
    between devices, companies, and clouds [45]. Especially in our manufacturing chain,
    where all kinds of machines, sensors, and equipment must work at the same time,
    we don’t have enough workers to perform these tasks. Instead, we transmit some
    program to these machines to make them work by themselves and even some places
    where people can’t reach, which is needed for remote operation. In this scenario,
    wireless networking as a substitute for traditional Ethernet has a big advantage.
    In the ICPS, Industrial wireless networking is an important link and safeguard
    technology between machines, terminals and cloud [46], [47]. It will allow us
    to flexibly communicate with any piece of equipment without any restrictions of
    time and place [48], [49], [50]. Moreover, it will provide support when we want
    to ascertain the demand. A wireless network will also mean much in the PLCM. There
    are many kinds of wireless access point (AP) that suitable for industrial environment.
    Just as shown in Table 2, different AP has his own advantages and characteristic,
    but all of them will supply big promotion to manufacturing chain. In this paper,
    we depict some obvious advantages in industrial systems compared to traditional
    communication technologies. Table 2. The characteristics of some mainstream wireless
    AP. Manufacturers Characteristic Siemens [51] Supply multi band protocol Logic

    Korenix Jetwave [53] Network self-healing 5.8 GHz communication band High throughput,
    long distance communication Advantech [54] Multiple jump technology Fast roaming
    handover Multiple security mechanisms 3.2.1. Reliability In traditional communication
    links, with line constraints and aging, there are always much problems such as
    communication with terminals and areas where lines cannot reach. However, industrial
    wireless networks (IWN) [55], [56] can fulfill our demand of real-time communication
    while maintaining a robust environment. Furthermore, in some special companies,
    the environment is corrosive and IWN is the only substitute to communicate. 3.2.2.
    Flexibility The IWN requires no cable ties, and the worker can easily configure
    the placement of sensors and meet different demands of smart monitors [57]. Furthermore,
    it also requires a large amount of support to control the machines (especially
    the mobile AGV). 3.2.3. Usability Compared to traditional Ethernet, distributed
    intelligent wireless sensor systems can realize the control of the industrial
    processes independently [58]. The AP can dynamically change depending on the environment
    and machines, and monitor every part of the manufacturing chain. It can help to
    improve the manufacturing chain to realize QoS and low cost. 3.2.4. Security Data
    attacks and information loss are an ever-increasing problem. Security has become
    a big issue and interest is growing everywhere. New forms of encryption will require
    companies to provide more support during the transmission of information and business
    dealings. 3.3. M2M communications In the traditional manufacturing chain, every
    machine was isolated and worked independently. In the time of intelligent manufacturing,
    M2M technologies will integrate these devices and realize cooperative work [59],
    [60]. It can also include limited human intervention. All of the equipment is
    connected to the Internet and is more valuable when it works interdependently
    than individually. Additionally, more and more autonomous and smart services can
    be generated based on the interconnected devices. WSNs are the basic supplements
    of M2M [61], and M2M is the foundation of CPS. With all machines connected to
    the Internet through ICT and WSN, the physical world has been connected to the
    cyber world. However, CPS needs the cyber world and physical world to interact
    with each other, which is an evolution of M2M in intelligent information processing
    [62]. In the development of ICPS, M2M will play a significant role. The development
    of communications will include human-2-human, human-2-machine, and machine-2-machine.
    This is points to the development of a number of application cases that are service-oriented
    and exposed from physical devices, such as sensors, RFIDs, actuators, and machines.
    With the integration of these equipment and terminals, the cyber world and physical
    world can be linked together and generate many kinds of service-oriented applications
    to industries. 3.3.1. M2M area networks M2M area networks aim to furnish connection
    and communication between all kinds of smart machines and sensors and some other
    smart terminals. They can be divided into personal area networks, which include
    IEEE 802.15, Zigbee, Bluetooth, and local networks, which include WIFI, wireless
    M-Bus, and power line communication. According to the range of radiation, transmission
    speed and energy constraints, the area network can supply different services like
    file sharing, video, smart grids, and RFID. 3.3.2. M2M application With the development
    of economy and the improvement of social information level, how to build a ubiquitous
    network society has become a great concern of the government, academia and enterprises
    in many countries. In addition, the increasing number of devices and productions
    including the fast development of social network need rapidly deploy solutions
    that can optimize your business processes and help deliver better and faster services.
    The M2M application is delivered as a cloud-based service to reduce complexity
    and maintenance concerns [63]. It will also take companies robust, proven technology
    based on the highly secure, industry-leading network infrastructure. What’s more,
    the M2M application has built to handle large-scale deployments, high transaction
    rates, and support a large number of concurrent users and reporting assets. In
    industry, the key architecture of smart factories is to realize horizontal integration,
    vertical integration and terminal-to-terminal integration. Industries realize
    the interaction of devices and terminals will improve the efficiency of manufacturing
    chains and monitor and maintain every part of it. In another way, smart enterprises
    need to realize the complete product life cycle management. All parts must coordinate
    and connect with each other to realize flexible and sustainable development, from
    design, materials and processes to logistics, employment and customer service.
    What’s more, every product is a smart terminal. It will know where the user came
    from, and predict where the user will go and what can the user can do. M2M communication
    can supply this to us. ICPS is just the evolution of M2M and achieves the goal
    of sustainable development, green businesses and smart manufacturing. 4. Key challenges
    As a whole, researchers have made some progress in the construction of industrial
    CPS, and the development of cloud technologies has played an important role in
    this system. However, CPS remains in the embryonic stage. A variety of issues
    and challenges need to be further solved at different layers of the architecture
    and from different aspects of system design to ease the integration of the physical
    and cyber worlds. In this chapter, we outline some challenges as follows. 4.1.
    Industrial cloud In industrial environments, information islands are an important
    reason to reduce production efficiency. Mutual equipment cooperation is not smooth,
    information cannot interact, the state cannot be notified in a timely manner,
    and these aspects will restrict the development of enterprises. Industrial clouds
    refer to cloud-computing modes that provide software services to industrial enterprises,
    and social resources can share cloud service platforms which can be easily searched
    by companies. Industrial clouds will greatly reduce the threshold of manufacturing
    information construction. In the process of building smart factories and Industry
    4.0, it will be as the pivotal player to help to realize horizontal integration
    between factories and vertical integration in a manufacturing chain. However,
    the data from different factories and different machines have their own characteristics
    and formats. Developing methods to integrate these data and realize sharing among
    factories is therefore very important. Industrial clouds can extract and integrate
    these data to help industrial organizations to overcome the information gap in
    industrial domains by providing information exchange systems. In this way, it
    will reduce conversion and downtime of equipment and increase the production efficiency.
    In another way, it will also provide an efficient solution to search for business
    partners, industrial processes, components, and technologies, as well as to respond
    to industrial issues to strengthen cooperation between plants, and improve the
    interaction and cooperation between the equipment. For example, in the manufacturing
    chain, we can integrate different pieces of information from different enterprises
    and cooperate with each to finish a product. Moreover, we can monitor the product’s
    entire life cycle and collect the information to supply to customer service. What’s
    more, the industrial cloud will also help to monitor the condition of machines
    all the time and report the information to the maintenance department. It will
    find the problems with equipment in advance, reduce equipment downtime, and improve
    production efficiency. In another way, industrial clouds will provide a big cloud
    platform and generate various services to companies to optimize their office business.
    In this cloud platform, they can achieve internal and external collaborative work,
    message synchronization anytime and anywhere, and realize unlimited imagination
    in the office system. Furthermore, in this platform, these services are free and
    are updated frequently, which will save costs and increase their production efficiency.
    4.2. Data mining Due to the popularity of big data, data mining has developed
    much interest in many domains, such as business intelligence, web searching and
    digital libraries. Data mining involves discovering novel, interesting, and potentially
    useful patterns from large data sets and applying algorithms to the extraction
    of hidden information [64]. It can form many usage applications including risk
    analysis, targeted marketing, customer retention, and portfolio management. The
    objective of any data mining process is to build an efficient predictive or descriptive
    model of a large amount of data that not only best fits or explains it, but is
    also able to generalize to new data [65]. Based on a broad view of data mining
    functionality, data mining is the process of discovering interesting knowledge
    from large amounts of data stored in either databases [66], data warehouses, or
    other information repositories. Based on the definition of data mining and the
    definition of data mining functions, a typical data mining process includes data
    preparation, data mining and data presentation [67]. In factories, everywhere
    and every time has data generation, the main data resources come from designing,
    manufacturing chains, logistics information, equipment condition monitoring, and
    social network information. Different kinds of data present big challenges to
    process, store, transform and analyze to represent the desired result, which is
    very essential to industries. Moreover, much of these data are semi-structured
    or unstructured, which is different from traditional structured data. All of these
    characteristics determine that we must use different algorithm to analyze them.
    For instance, we must use classification modeling to analyze discrete data while
    we use regression modeling to process continuous data. For another part, with
    numerous data arising from different data sources and in different formats, big
    challenges may arise that will vitally affect our analysis result. In this paper,
    we will focus on the following aspect of data sources, and talk about some of
    their key problems for data mining [68]. Just as we show in Table 3, all of these
    problems will cause distortion of data, which will reduce the value of its analysis.
    Furthermore, data security and privacy have become an essential task for every
    corporation to solve. Data assault and leakage have deeply affected the interests
    of many enterprises. So, data mining will also a big problem in the industry.
    Table 3. The challenges in data mining. Data source Challenges Sensors (e.g. equipment
    condition) Low accuracy, various error Noise affecting the test result Machines
    (e.g. manufacturing chain) Much variable, too much adjust data Unstructured data
    Office system (e.g. logistics transportation) Data record is not accurate Important
    data missing or ignored Cloud service (e.g. social network information) Data security,
    privacy, authority and accuracy 4.3. Real-time processing and reliability Industrial
    wireless networks are essential for industrial systems to realize smart monitoring
    and timely control. In different industrial systems, due to different requirements,
    companies need various qualities of service, which are reliability, energy efficiency,
    low latency and high throughput [69], [70], [71]. These are especially important
    in real-time control systems, which need the data to be transmitted in a timely
    manner. This is similar to mobile automated guided vehicles, which are used to
    transport and load commodities in the manufacturing chain. Sometimes, IWNs must
    cooperate with the machines and production transfer belts to realize seamless
    connection. Thus, the control signal must be transmitted to the components timely
    and accurately. The real-time processing and reliability will also be exhibited
    by remote maintenance capability. In the new process of ICPS, all of machines
    are automated and unmanned. They need to equip self-detection equipment to monitor
    its condition. While some indicators of the machine over the warning line, we
    must adjust it as soon as possible to avoid downtime and mechanical damage. Due
    to less people participate in the manufacturing chain, so all of these sensor,
    actuator and network infrastructure must keep reliability for a long time. Although,
    every AP supplier has its own distinctive advantage, in our survey, we can find
    that all of these advantages are insufficient to realize reliability and real-time
    communication. The most important requirements for reliability and real-time processing
    are latency and packet loss rate, but none of the current systems can achieve
    low delay and loss-free packet transmission. In fact, according to our experience,
    we use some APs to realize wireless roaming to reduce latency to acceptable levels,
    but when we use a computer to connect the AP and communicate with it, the latency
    and packet loss rates increase significantly. However, in manufacturing chains,
    some work steps are needed to achieve perfect synchronization, and this latency
    and data loss can destroy the entire production chain. 4.4. Information security
    and privacy Currently, information security and privacy has grown popular and
    caused more and more interest [72], [73]. Now, we can use cloud tools and other
    resources to search and analyze multimedia files. The final goal of big data is
    to share information for all systems and people. However, increased information
    disclosure and privacy violations have generated concerns [74]. In the time of
    fast development of information, ICT and ICPS aim to integrate everything in the
    big Internet of things system and make them interact with each other. This is
    a big chance to make systems more intelligent and automated, but it is imperative
    for humans to maintain security. 4.4.1. Retention of network security Ethernet
    and wireless networks are the most important information transfer channels in
    the world. In the time of Industry 4.0, it is the foundation technology of ICPS.
    With more and more devices connected to networks, it will cause network congestion
    and the increase of network latency. For another part, if the network is assaulted,
    all of the machines will experience downtime. 4.4.2. Maintaining industrial information
    security In intelligent manufacturing chains, all of the machines are embedded
    into microcomputers and work by themselves through some programs. This will save
    manual work but acquires a threat of information security. If someone invades
    the industrial system and modifies programs to control these machines, it could
    give the factory a devastating blow, similar to the case of the intrusion incident
    of government office systems, which has caused a breach the government can’t handle.
    4.4.3. Maintain data security Recently, most companies have connected to a cloud
    server and deployed its applications. The cloud is a source pool so big that no
    company can control it. Data explosions and attacks have become a big threat to
    many domains. With limited storage space, we can’t store and analyze all of the
    data. Furthermore, most of the rubbish information will cause high latency or
    even destroy our system. Thus, it is inevitable to maintain data security. 5.
    Conclusions In this paper, we addressed the architecture of cloud-assisted industrial
    CPS, and highlighted some key enabling technologies in this process. Then, we
    reviewed some challenges that need to be solved in the future. Cloud-assisted
    CPS is a service-oriented technology. CPS aims to link anything to the Internet,
    but the cloud will provide work after this is achieved. It will be based on cloud
    services and big datasets to realize the integration of devices with devices,
    devices with products, and the cyber world with the physical world. Then, it will
    supply real-time services and PLCM to customers and products. It is an important
    part of smart manufacturing and smart factories. In this process, enabling technologies
    will play an important role in data mining, data analysis and data transformation.
    It will provide support for information and communication to achieve the integration
    of the industrialization and serialization of data. It will always provide support
    for optimizing production efficiency, optimizing production and optimizing service
    quality. However, some challenges will affect the efficiency and quality of services.
    The solution of these problems will play an important role in the future. Then,
    these factories can be directly linked with users to fulfill their real-time demand.
    In the era of Industry 4.0, the use of some enabling technologies to link the
    cyber world and physical world is essential and these key enabling technologies
    supply a big support to the system of ICPS. However, in the future, we also have
    many problems to solve, such as the challenges of security and privacy. Cloud
    computing and big data require many more applications and data sources, but they
    will also encumber us with much rubbish data and data violation. In another way,
    the building of Industry 4.0 is a long way off, some years or even some decades.
    We should follow the direction of the road and develop more technologies to achieve
    it. Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank the National Natural Science

    impulse towards a larger introduction of Information and Communication Technology
    (ICT) in the agricultural field is currently experiencing its momentum, as digitisation
    has large potentialities to provide benefits for both producers and consumers;
    on the other hand, pushing technological solutions into a rural context encounters
    several challenges. In this work, we provide a survey of the most recent research
    activities, in the form of both research projects and scientific literature, with
    the objective of showing the already achieved results, the current investigations,
    and the still open challenges, both technical and non technical. We mainly focus
    on the EU territory, identifying threats and concerns, and then looking at existing
    and upcoming solutions to overcome those barriers. Previous article in issue Next

    computing5GSatelliteUAV 1. Introduction Smart Farming (SF) refers to the application
    of ICT to agriculture. Data collected and analysed through ICT techniques support
    efficient production processes [1], thus motivating scientists, practitioners,
    private and public companies to work towards the goal of developing and encouraging
    the use of innovative technologies to support farmers on the ground. According
    to the European Union (EU), the most relevant technologies and techniques to be
    fully exploited are the satellite imagery, the use of agricultural robots, a larger
    use of sensor nodes to collect data, and the potentialities of Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicles (UAVs) for aerial imagery and actuation. Those indications are contained
    into the declaration of cooperation on A smart and sustainable digital future
    for European agriculture and rural areas1 signed on April 2019 by 24 EU countries.
    According to the aforementioned declaration, the first obstacle towards a full
    implementation of SF in rural areas is the lack of connectivity, i.e., digital
    divide. The advent of 5G is promising to improve such a situation in rural and
    low-income areas [2], but scattered coverage must be still taken into account,
    as highlighted in recent surveys in the EU territory [3]. Rural areas remain challenging,
    not being covered by any Next Generation Access network: up to 53% at the end
    of 2017 in EU [3]. Putting this issue aside, a plethora of initiatives can be
    identified towards the objective of the digitisation of agriculture. As an exemplary
    case, Smart AKIS, an EU-funded thematic network promoted by the Agricultural European
    Innovation Partnership (EIP-AGRI) established in 2016, aims to close the gap between
    scientific knowledge and practitioners, in order to promote concrete solutions
    to be implemented. A solution can be defined as anything that makes the farming
    practice more controlled and accurate through ICT, reducing both the costs and
    the environmental impact, while also increasing the production. SF has the potential
    to also improve work safety, contributing to the sustainability of agriculture
    [1], but its socio-economic implications are debated [4]. In this innovative approach
    of farm management, a key component is the use of hardware and software technologies,
    like the deploying of sensor nodes, control systems, robotics, satellites for
    imagery and positioning, data storage and analysis, advisory systems, and terrestrial
    and aerial drones. However, the aim of SF should not be just in industrializing
    agriculture, but in making the whole process more efficient, sustainable, and
    of high quality, while respecting farmers’ needs. SF dates back to the middle
    of the 80’s, but it has been practiced commercially only since the 90’s [5]. However,
    many farmers are still skeptical about the actual advantages it can offer. This
    can be explained by considering the profit and the direct benefits for the farm.
    In fact, it is not straightforward to identify those [6], for instance when considering
    Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) and Operating Expenditures (OPEX) for software, machinery,
    and data. Farmers generally tend to identify SF as a set of tools that benefits
    only large holdings, both in crop and livestock production. This is linked to
    the perception of high costs and complexity of the involved technologies. What
    is lacking from this image is the possibility that innovative technologies might
    not be only large-scale and thus costly, but rather also slow and precise, plus
    small and cheap [7]. Nowadays, SF is rapidly taking advantage of recent technological
    advancements for improving agricultural practices [8], further than business models
    for lowering adoption costs. For instance, rental programs for farming equipment,
    like Trringo in India, make possible farm mechanization processes with affordable
    costs for farmers, also providing support services. Such an initiative can be
    categorised as cooperative farming, potentially increasing the penetration of
    SF in low-income areas. Karnott, a French company, is pushing both web services
    and hardware solutions to transform legacy equipment into SF-ready one. Karnott
    sells a control unit to be installed on agricultural machines, offering several
    services through a battery-powered device, collecting and exchanging real-time
    data, as well as geolocation. Then, collected data can be exploited through on-line
    services, like those provided by api-agro, a secure platform to share data. Available
    data can be accessed and fed to different management systems, thus offering a
    valuable repository for farms. Taranis offers a platform using aerial and satellite
    imagery joint with Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to provide a Decision
    Support System (DSS) for Precision Farming (PF) applications. AgriOpenData provides
    a DSS as well, exploiting blockchain, UAVs, and adding support services on top
    of it. When considering fully autonomous solutions, Iron Ox offers a complete
    robotic solution to grow plants, from seeds to harvest, with a hydroponic system
    able to strongly reduce the water consumption. At last, traceability is experiencing
    a revolution thanks to digital ledgers. Even if it cannot be considered immediately
    within the umbrella of SF, still the origin and the quality of agricultural products
    remains a central issue. Carrefour, a French multinational retailer, is betting
    on blockchain as a solution to provide trustable data to consumers and intermediate
    actors. Blockchain is used by Hectare Agritech in a farm trading platform as well,
    highlighting how innovative paradigms can be adapted to different use cases in
    the agricultural field. The aim of this work is to survey both research initiatives
    and scientific literature on the topic of SF, looking at recent technologies and
    techniques being used or being actively pushed for adoption. In addition, we discuss
    still open challenges hampering such an objective. The rest of this work is structured
    as follows: Section 2 surveys research and innovation projects covering SF activities
    in the EU territory, then the scope of the survey is enlarged by taking into account
    the state of the art in the scientific literature. Section 3 discusses the open
    challenges at today, considering both technical and non-technical factors. Finally,
    Section 4 draws the conclusions and opens to future directions. 2. State of the
    art This section provides two main contributions. The first one is in Section
    2.1, surveying relevant research projects recently funded by the EU in the field
    of SF; the aim is to highlight the increasing attention towards those activities,
    and then to identify the involved technologies. Table 1 provides an overview of
    surveyed R&I projects. Furthermore, Fig. 1 depicts relevant agricultural operations
    as faced by the described research projects, and the technological solutions exploited
    in the latter ones. The second contribution is in Section 2.2, surveying the scientific
    works that propose solutions for the implementation of SF. Table 2 provides an
    overview of surveyed literature, then a keyword analysis is proposed in Fig. 2.

    the surveyed literature: the 4 categories, as proposed in Table 2, can be read
    internally, and each keyword is weighted (circle radius) in the cluster it belongs
    to. 2.1. EU research projects In last years, the EU has been actively undertaking
    R&I activities laying the ground for the digitisation of agriculture by exploiting
    data-empowered strategies; strategic interventions have been funded to support
    the uptake of digital technologies, to develop new digital solutions and to sustain
    the crucial assessment of the socio-economic impacts of digitisation. In Table
    1, 30 recent EU projects closely related to SF are presented: the first 21 projects,
    spanning from 2015 to 2019, propose, develop, and test the use of digital technologies
    in this field; the 9 projects in the last rows, spanning from 2012 to 2019, have
    the complementary objective of strengthen or evaluate the use of ICT in agriculture,
    for instance through challenge-based strategies, or by setting up marketplaces
    to browse existing solutions ready for use. Most projects jointly exploit multiple
    techniques and technologies; here, we highlight only the most prominent ones.
    2.1.1. Cloud/edge-based systems Cloud platforms are mainly exploited in projects
    that are related to monitoring activities, like growth of plants, water availability,
    soil moisture maps, and so on. There is a clear dominance of cloud solutions with
    respect to those based on edge solutions, because the former is a more established
    option than the latter. The AgriCloud P2 project proposed a cloud-based PF management
    system for a sustainable and intensive agriculture to secure long-term food supply
    in Europe. The APMAV project consists of an intuitive solution for agricultural
    management based on UAV technology and an intelligent cloud-based platform that
    provides farmers valuable, actionable and real-time recommendations for driving
    down costs and improving crop performance. The Flourish project leverages UAVs
    as well, aiming at surveying a field from the air, then at performing a targeted
    intervention on the ground with an Unmanned Terrestrial Vehicle (UTV). The idea
    is to provide a DSS requiring minimal user intervention to target PF applications.
    The SWAMP project develops Internet of Things (IoT)-based methods and approaches
    for smart water management in the precision irrigation domain, in order to utilize
    water more efficiently and effectively, avoiding both under- and over-irrigation.
    The AfriCultuReS project, beyond the use of cloud-based technology, also exploits
    the data collected from different sources (e.g. service providers, weather services)
    to develop an integrated agricultural monitoring and early warning system, based
    on remote sensing, to support decision making. The DataBio project makes intensive
    use of big data techniques related to the raw material production from agriculture,
    forestry, fishery and aquaculture for the production of food, energy, and biomaterials
    in a sustainable way, by means of a software platform integrating big data and
    Earth Observation (EO) methods. Data-driven activities are also proposed in the
    just started Dragon project, whose main efforts are directed towards skill transfers
    to ease PF adoption. Large heterogeneous data sources are considered and analysed
    to offer agricultural knowledge and information systems by ambitiously leveraging
    several techniques. The BigDataGrapes project makes use of big data techniques
    in the context of viticulture, supporting decisions by exploiting real-time analysis
    of large, diverse and multimodal data sources. It has been exploiting the use
    of UAVs as well in vineyards. Last but not least, the IoF2020 project is one of
    the most comprehensive projects from the point of view of SF digital technologies:
    in particular, this project accelerates the adoption of IoT, in order to secure
    sufficient, safe and healthy food and at strengthening competitiveness of farming
    and food chains in Europe. A large scale pilot programme has been started in IoF2020
    to develop and test specific technological solutions in the following sectors:
    arable, dairy, fruits, vegetables, and meat. 2.1.2. Unmanned vehicles The use
    of unmanned vehicles is another trend of great interest. Beyond the aforementioned
    Flourish, APMAV, BigDataGrapes, and Dragon projects, the PANTHEON project, by
    taking advantage of the technological advancements in the fields of robotics,
    remote sensing and big data management, aims at designing an integrated system
    where heterogeneous unmanned robotic components (terrestrial and aerial robots)
    move within the orchards to collect data and perform common farming operations.
    The SWEEPER project has proposed a robotic system to harvest sweet peppers in
    greenhouses, leveraging on machine vision techniques to acquire both colour and
    distance information, and then storing collected peppers in an on-board container.
    Another robotic platform has been developed in the ROMI project to assist in weed
    reduction and crop monitoring, reducing manual labour. Land robots also acquire
    detailed information on sample plants, and an UAV assists by providing information
    at crop level. The GreenPatrol-Robot project designed and built a satellite-guided
    autonomous robot for pest control in greenhouses. It exploits Galileo satellite
    services to navigate, achieving good positioning accuracy inside greenhouses.
    The AFarCloud project aims at the agricultural productivity increase via PF techniques.
    The proposed solution is a distributed platform for autonomous farming robots
    that allows the integration and real-time cooperation of agricultural systems
    to increase efficiency, productivity, and food quality. This platform is integrated
    with a Farm Management System (FMS) to support monitoring and decision-making
    solutions based on real-time data mining techniques. The RUC-APS project is centered
    on management approaches aiming at enhancing SF solutions in agriculture systems,
    applying operational research to optimise farm production. 2.1.3. Satellite-based
    activities Several projects are mainly based on improving the information derived
    from satellite optical data. The AGRORADAR project aims at delivering innovative
    algorithms and data models that can process Copernicus EO Syntethic Aperture Radar
    (SAR) data to achieve precise and detailed information. The AUDITOR project develops
    an improved Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) augmentation system for
    services in PF applications. The project enables cost-effective PF services to
    farmers, like recommendations regarding site-specific application of water, fertilizer
    and pesticides. The WATER4AGRI project combines microwave data obtained from different
    satellites to provide datasets for retrieving key information about water availability
    for crops at field level. The SENSAGRI project combines optical and radar measurements
    to develop three prototype services for near real-time operations: surface soil
    moisture, green and brown Leaf Area Index (LAI), and crop type mapping. The MISTRALE
    project provides soil moisture maps to decision makers in water management using
    GNSS reflectometry (GNSS-R) via satellites and UAVs. The project has developed
    a prototype sensor embedded on a dedicated software platform. The APOLLO project
    brings PF closer to farmers through affordable information services, making extensive
    use of free and open EO data. The proposed services help farmers to make better
    decisions by monitoring the growth and health of crops, providing advice on when
    to irrigate and till their fields, and estimating the size of their harvest. The
    services are designed to be always available thanks to a web platform and a mobile
    application. 2.1.4. Mitigating digital divide Other research projects are mainly
    focused on bringing the advantages of SF to farmers in a way compatible with their
    needs and digital skills, thus reducing digital divide. The SMART-AKIS initiative
    sets up a self-sustainable thematic network on SF technologies designed for the
    effective exchange of knowledge among research, industry, and the farming community,
    disseminating direct applicable research and commercial solutions, and capturing
    grassroots level needs and innovative ideas. The 4D4F project (Data Driven Dairy
    Decision For Farmers) focuses on the benefits provided by sensors in monitoring
    animals and environment, supporting informed decisions. The project hosts a large
    repository of ICT solutions freely browseable by farmers. The SmartAgriHubs project
    brings together 164 partners in the European agri-food sector, carrying out 28
    flagship innovation experiments for digitisation in five agri-food sectors: arable
    farming, livestock, vegetable, fruits, and aquaculture. The overall goal of ICT-AGRI-2
    is to strengthen the research within the area of PF and to develop a common research
    agenda concerning ICT and robotics in agriculture in Europe. Its main objectives
    are: mapping and analysis of existing research and future needs; development of
    instruments and procedures for transnational funding activities; development of
    strategic research agenda and programmes; and establishment of international collaborations
    and networks. Other projects, like Nefertiti, Euraknos, and Desira are setting
    up thematic networks with the objective of promote networking activities, data
    sharing and knowledge exchange. They leverage the vast set of already available
    ICT tools to promote their use in SF contexts and to foster their adaption to
    practitioners’ needs. The DESIRA project, started at June 2019, intends to collect
    practitioners’ needs through 20 national living labs in EU and then to design
    ICT use cases to meet those demands in a Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI)
    fashion. The Fairshare project has data collecting and sharing as foremost objectives,
    in order to build a network able to reduce the agricultural digital divide. Finally,
    FarmingBySatellite is an initiative to promote the use of Galileo as GNSS and
    EO services. It launches a biyearly challenge to identify promising ideas using
    satellite technologies for SF purposes. 2.1.5. Considerations Summing up, some
    considerations can be made: monitoring fields and crops is quite diffused at today,
    leveraging local and remote sensing solutions, i.e., in-field sensors, UAVs, up
    to satellites. Another major challenge is the optimisation of water use. Unmanned
    vehicles enable semi- and full-autonomous scenarios, currently representing a
    major objective for both research institutes and private companies. Anyway, almost
    all surveyed projects aim at providing DSSs instead of autonomous solutions; in
    fact, there is still wide scepticism on them by practitioners as viable alternatives
    to human decisions. To feed DSSs, data analysis techniques are used, also supporting
    automatic actions based on feedback, and farmers’ decisions. Machine learning
    techniques are typically exploited for dedicated applications in the projects
    we considered, such as prediction and estimation of farming parameters to optimise
    livestock production or crop monitoring. 2.2. Scientific literature SF represents
    the evolution of agriculture driven by ICT technologies. ICT provides tools, methods,
    and techniques with the potential to improve both the modeling and the practice
    in this sector. SF is intrinsically tied to large-scale heterogeneous sensing
    [9], involving different hardware, algorithms, and protocols, thus too focused
    approaches have gained little traction at now. In what follows, we survey a very
    recent and exemplary subset of the scientific literature on such a topic, then
    schematised in Table 2. To further highlight what is currently trending in recent
    scientific literature, we show the most used keywords in Fig. 2, according to
    the four thematic clusters we define in Table 2. Each keyword is presented weighted
    in its cluster according to the number of occurrences. Finally, Table 3 maps typical
    application scenarios and data types to commonly used sensing solutions [10,11].

    techniques and management systems SF makes large use of sensor nodes to collect
    data on the environment and the phenomenon under observation. For instance, in
    the case of agriculture, soil sensors, placed at different depths, complement
    data collected from EO satellites, providing enriched information. More generally,
    indoor and outdoor Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), both mobile and fixed, are
    used to collect heterogeneous data [14] for evaluating different indexes, such
    as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the excess green index,
    the LAI, and so on. Given the fundamental role played by data and data sources
    in this context [12], the historical evolution of sensing for PF in Ref. [5] offers
    a valuable perspective. At the beginning, three methodological approaches were
    considered: the first two ones, namely farming by soil and site-specific crop
    management, were contrasting because the former promoted soil mapping, while the
    latter promoted homogeneous actions in sub-units of farm fields, i.e., a punctual
    approach versus a clustered one. The third approach, namely proximal soil sensing,
    came later, consisting in continuous real-time sensing by sensors mounted on tractors.
    It can be considered the father of the PF approaches in use nowadays. Thanks to
    satellites, proximal soil sensing evolved into remote soil sensing, introducing
    spectral analyses. To allow farm managers to exploit all those heterogeneous data
    sources, increasing complex software platforms were introduced to take advantage
    of raw data and of subsequent elaboration: they are referred to as FMIS [13].
    2.2.2. Unmanned vehicles Real-time stream processing, analysis, and reasoning
    are key concepts towards automation in the agricultural field [22], i.e., towards
    a larger use of robots that can adapt to space- and time-varying conditions with
    minimal delay. Robots can perform very precise operations, and can operate in
    fleets, as proposed in Ref. [23], which considers both UTVs and UAVs. Moving systems
    rely on GNSS techniques for precise positioning, and PF applications need large
    accuracy. Several commercial systems integrate a GNSS receiver and use one or
    more fixed Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) reference base stations [26] for providing
    accuracy up to centimeters. Further than precise positioning, robots depend on
    machine-vision systems to navigate the environment [25]; according to the technology
    and the scenario under consideration, specific spectral signatures are of interest,
    as for instance hyperspectral imagery in both local and remote sensing. Commercial
    devices, to be used on board, already capture both RGB and Near Infrared Imagery
    (NIR) bands, and stereovision systems are used for 3D maps [25]. Further than
    terrestrial vehicles, aerial ones have been revolutionising the practices in this
    sector. PF is taking large advantage of UAVs, with several commercial systems
    able to fly at different speeds and altitudes [24], ranging from fixed to rotary
    wing machines. UAVs are used for monitoring scenarios, further than pesticide
    spraying, which is a key application for PF [18]. Heavy and large UAVs can be
    used for such a purpose in the case of large fields, jointly with multispectral
    techniques to generate NDVI maps to be used for spraying pesticides and fertilizers
    where needed. Such a potential has been subject to increasing attention in the
    last years. For instance, UAVs can be used to assess if an area has been subject
    to plowing, and the plowing depths. The authors in Ref. [15] consider the use
    of UAVs for such a purpose as an alternative to the use of satellites. In fact,
    according to the authors, even high-resolution satellites cannot classify the
    roughness of the terrain, thus motivating the use of UAVs. A RGB camera has been
    used for data collection and a visual assessment, and collected georeferenced
    data are analysed to assess the plowing depths. RGB and NIR are collected by means
    of an UAV also in Ref. [16], with the aim of classifying plants and weeds. The
    proposed system makes use of the Excess Green Index (ExG) [16] in the case of
    RGB-only; if NIR is exploited as well, NDVI can be estimated and used because
    of the richer information it provides. By combining these results with geometric
    features, sugar beets can be recognised even in the case of overlapping plants.
    NDVI has been used in viticulture for precision applications [21] as well: in
    fact, using an UAV to collect detailed images in a vineyard, plant rows can be
    discriminated from inter-rows, identifying missing plants with good precision.
    UAVs can be seen as part of a WSN, acting as mobile nodes [17], thus the analytical
    characterisation of the channel model between a moving UAV and fixed terrestrial
    nodes becomes of interest [20]. Low-power 802.15.4-based solutions have been investigated
    in rural contexts, using UAVs as data mules [19]. 2.2.3. IoT platforms As aforementioned
    in Section 1, Internet connectivity is a key requirement for SF. In fact, its
    availability allows IoT-based scenarios to emerge [33], increasing the degree
    of remote control and automation. This is well supported by IoT features, such
    as interoperability and easiness of integration [36]. Anyway, in rural contexts,
    terrestrial connectivity may be lacking. Because of this, aerospace solutions
    for connectivity are a viable option [8]. Looking at the literature, reference
    [30] proposes an IoT platform for PF based on FIWARE.2 It considers the case of
    a greenhouse, where Internet connectivity is likely available, thus opening to
    data exchanges via protocol stacks relying on common IoT protocols, like CoAP
    and MQTT. In greenhouses, the main objectives are typically climate control and
    soil monitoring. The Agricolus software platform, which is a FIWARE-based DSS
    for tobacco crops, is described in Ref. [29], designed to collect soil data via
    802.15.4-based WSNs. The FIWARE middleware is a software enabler in very different
    scenarios [13,29]. Along to climate control systems, irrigation systems have been
    proposed to optimise water use. In Ref. [28], FIWARE cloud components are integrated
    in a PF application to reduce water use. In Ref. [31], tomatoes in a greenhouse
    are monitored, and the authors propose an analytical framework to assess the performance
    of different tested configurations by relying on plant transpiration. The works
    in Refs. [27,32] consider the use of low-cost and general purpose sensor nodes,
    built upon the Arduino platform and upon MICAz Motes, respectively, as information
    sources in greenhouses. Being able to deploy low-cost and easily replaceable sensor
    nodes is a priority for a larger adoption of SF techniques. A core demand is related
    to power consumption: battery-powered devices lasting several years, as for instance
    ZigBee ones in Ref. [27], are fundamental in farm deployments. Apart from FIWARE,
    a plethora of different platforms can be identified as enablers for SF [34]. Those
    platforms aggregate heterogeneous data, then analysed and interpreted in order
    to provide additional value. Here, semantic analyses have been proposed as well,
    like for instance the valuable work in Ref. [35]. The Agri-IoT architecture, a
    layered and complex framework, provides additional value to DSSs because it further
    facilitates informed and accurate decisions thanks to semantic web and real-time
    reasoning. 2.2.4. Decision Support Systems DSSs are one of the most used solutions
    for SF because they provide support to farmers, offering a point of access to
    useful information, according to the aim of the system, and suggesting a plausible
    course of action in a given context. Aims can be very different: minimising the
    impact of diseases in tomatoes by applying automatic climate control [37]; ‘time-to-sow’
    alerts, and cattle monitoring [38]; anticipating potential crop dysfunctions in
    a proactive way [39]; pest control [40]; selecting appropriate alternative crops
    in a given area [41]. Those are just few examples of what can be offered by recent
    developments of DSSs in the agricultural sector. 2.2.5. Considerations Some considerations
    can be made also here: for instance, looking at Fig. 2, it is visible how data
    is a relevant keyword for all clusters. This is a key topic in the context of
    SF, thus deepened in Section 3. A notable exception is visible in the cluster
    Unmanned Vehicles, in which system outnumbers data: this can be explained by taking
    into account that unmanned vehicles are typically considered in an autonomous
    scenario, i.e., within a system composed of several interacting parts. The keywords
    pertaining to the cluster Unmanned Vehicles take the most part of Fig. 2, graphically
    highlighting the technological complexity of designed systems, and the very large
    number of operations that can be performed by those. Finally, what in Fig. 1 can
    be put in relation with what presented in Fig. 2: as an example, in the former
    monitoring operations are practically ubiquitous, and this is confirmed by the
    large number of occurrences of keywords like thing (as in smart thing or IoT)
    and sensor in the latter. 3. Open challenges This section briefly discusses the
    open challenges hampering a larger adoption of SF, summarised in Fig. 3 as well.
    Several technologies pushing for a larger adoption of SF practices have already
    been cited within this work, such as fully autonomous flight control, early identification
    of plant diseases, and reliable virtual fences [1], as well as more general ones,
    as AI, robotics, high performance computing, IoT, and 5G, which are reported within
    the EU declaration cited in Section 1. AI probably represents the largest challenge
    at now and, at the same time, opportunity in several sectors, including the agricultural
    one. The EU is largely investing on it because convinced it will be the upcoming
    disruptive game changer. In fact, the AI4EU initiative, started at the beginning
    of 2019, aims at the transformation of AI into a compelling solution in several
    application scenarios. Download : Download full-size image Figure 3. Overview
    of open challenges in the SF field: technical challenges (on the right) are discussed
    in Section 3.1, non-technical challenges (on the left) are discussed in Section
    3.2. 3.1. Technical challenges Looking at sensor nodes and sensor networks, we
    refer to the valuable works in Refs. [14,42], which survey the use of fixed and
    mobile solutions. According to the authors, advances are needed to further lower
    costs and to design specific solutions for the agricultural context, which requires
    solutions able to resist to difficult conditions (e.g., specific soil properties,
    exposition to high/low temperature, water resistance, fine dusts, and so on).
    Further than costs, solutions are needed toward larger energy efficiency, including
    energy harvesting techniques, and reliability in data collection and transmission,
    in order to minimize the need of maintenance for the deployed solutions. Specific
    issues of the agricultural domain need targeted answers, in particular the deployment
    strategies, to be designed according to fields segmentation and to farmers’ requirements.
    One of the main drivers of the diffusion of WSN in agriculture has been IoT: it
    has marked the transition from closed-source systems and disconnected software
    solutions towards connected systems built upon interoperable solutions. Those
    characteristics are favorable to cost reduction and to easiness of integration.
    Challenges here are overall related to network capabilities, data security, and
    data privacy [33]. Data is one of the most critical topic in the agricultural
    sector. Data ownership, protection, and security are perceived as not sufficiently
    close to farmers’ needs, thus becoming threats to be mitigated, if not completely
    avoided. In more words, nowadays, digital solutions for SF are under-utilised
    because practitioners fear data misuse and the loss of control over their business.
    Data protection must be enhanced to transform into a transparent operation, keeping
    in mind that agriculture is typically a private business activity (i.e., a not
    transparent activity), and data transfers to external systems (e.g. cloud) must
    be controllable and well described to increase acceptance. An option towards larger
    acceptance comes from the possibility for farmers to benefit from business with
    their data, and to benefit from public and official data released in an open fashion.
    On this, the valuable work of the EU with the Galileo services is a notable example
    of good practice, collecting and releasing data through application programming
    interfaces [43]. Further from data, open and used standards for data handling
    is compelling to move towards horizontal solutions instead of vertical ones [44].
    Large IoT platforms generate huge amounts of data to be analysed, thus calling
    for data analytic techniques able to extract meaningful information. Nowadays,
    big data immediately come to mind [45] as a set of strategies towards this objective,
    but it must be noted that its application to agriculture is recent. Generally
    speaking, the big data paradigm goes in an opposite direction with respect to
    acquiring more control over own data by farmers. To counteract that, the possibility
    for farmers to economically gain from sharing and accessing large volumes of data
    works as an incentive [46]. In Ref. [47], the authors underline the difficulties
    in discovering and combining large heterogeneous datasets in the agro-environmental
    field, often complicated by lacking of metadata. Furthermore, the need for semantic
    analyses and interoperability is highlighted in Ref. [47]. Natural language processing
    and machine learning techniques play a role here, facilitated by existing initiatives
    for building and maintaining open large repositories for training purposes, like
    CINERGI by Earthcube. Once meaningful information is available thanks to raw data
    sources and to analytics techniques, decision making is performed. This is where
    machine learning techniques and, more generally, AI can be fully exploited toward
    autonomous systems. To this aim, a fundamental challenge is moving intelligence
    from cloud platforms to closer computation platforms, such as edge solutions,
    handling and processing data close to the source, thus reducing delays. Multi-Access
    Edge Computing (MEC), jointly with 5G, is expected to play a role here. In the
    case of agricultural autonomous systems, real-time constraints are more easily
    satisfied by edge solutions than remote centralised systems. According to Ref.
    [48], in order to build sustainable infrastructure, the several emerging architecture
    paradigms (with different degrees of centralised and distributed entities) must
    comply to open standards for both easiness of implementation and cost reduction.
    Environmental monitoring and real-time agricultural data analytics and control
    can benefit from those paradigms, for instance by providing localized information
    about pollution and pests in the vicinity of edge servers [49]. 3.2. Socio-economic
    and other non-technical challenges This section discusses non-technical issues
    still holding back a larger diffusion of SF, at least in the EU. In fact, uptake
    in EU is rather low if compared to what expected [50]. Incentives and policies
    play a large role, considering national and EU rules, economical and skills perspectives.
    In Ref. [50], the authors show how financial and government incentives are the
    most influential solution, followed by training and other non-financial support.
    Farmers’ concerns are related to the time to recover the investment, and to the
    difficulties in evaluating the advantages; small farms have almost no adoption
    at all, also because the machinery has no support for more advanced technology.
    Sole farmers show a large interest in SF tools, which may come as unexpected,
    because it reduces exposure to occupational accidents and injuries; anyway, those
    barriers still hold back its use [51]. Because of those reasons, initiatives like
    those presented in Section 1 have a significant socio-economic value: cooperative
    farming with support services for a better handling of costs and needed investments;
    hardware solutions to transform legacy equipment into SF-ready machinery to avoid
    too high initial costs and to have time to familiarise with new technology; secure
    and open platforms for sharing data and getting back useful information, helping
    in assessing potential advantages. Research activities aiming at reducing the
    agricultural digital divide have an impact as well, helping farmers with new ICT-based
    tools in their daily work; on the other hand, different strategies in designing
    innovative ICT tools must be considered, like using natural language [52] to explicitly
    take into account potentially low-literate speakers. Nowadays, the right to access
    and use the collected data is at the center of the discussion: COPA-COGECA, an
    European farming representative organisation, in cooperation with CEMA, the European
    agricultural machinery association, has recently released a code of conduct to
    grant the data originator (i.e., the farmer) a leading role in controlling the
    access to and the use of data.3 The concerns on data use and access have been
    explored also in Ref. [4], highlighting existing scepticism by Australian farmers
    and divergence of expectations between involved actors. On the one hand, marketers
    and traders expect that big data techniques increase the reliability of predictions
    in the market dynamics; on the other hand, farmers are convinced that power asymmetries
    will increase, thus acting as a brake. Similar considerations are in Ref. [53],
    when looking to Ireland: whilst recognizing that SF is a real opportunity for
    the farming context, potential challenges and risks should be carefully considered
    to anticipate and reduce the gap among winners and losers. 4. Conclusions and
    future directions In this work, we surveyed the most relevant research activities
    aiming at improving and encouraging the adoption of SF techniques in agricultural
    contexts. Large efforts are currently poured to boost ICT use, at least in the
    EU, where this analysis is focused. On the one hand, the already established use
    of sensor nodes and heterogeneous data sources, as well as simple analytic techniques,
    is pushing DSSs in the farms; on the other hand, a growing need is there for ever
    advancing technology and open standards to consolidate existing scenarios in an
    interoperable and low-cost manner, as well as programmes to help ICT diffusion
    in areas suffering from digital divide. In the future, technology will have a
    growing role in agriculture [6]. Several operations will be automatised, from
    planting to harvesting, thanks to increased robotisation, both terrestrial and
    aerial one. Soil information will be readily available, thus allowing for e.g.
    a finer control of pests and pesticides, combining local information with other
    data sources, like weather and pollution data. In the end, an increase in production
    is expected, joint with a reduction in chemicals today in use, thus reducing pressure
    on soil. SF has the potential for a rapid and efficient growth in coming years,
    supported by policies that can fuel both R&D efforts and farmers’ adoption through
    investments. Anyway, the main barriers at today, i.e., vertical solutions, reduced
    digital skills and high costs for farmers, poor telecommunication infrastructures,
    and concerns on data ownership and use must be carefully addressed by technical
    and non-technical actors to facilitate SF adoption. Declaration of Competing Interest
    The authors declare no conflict of interest. Acknowledgment This work has received

    \ sector is one of the backbones of many countries’ economies. Its processes\n\
    have been changing to enable technology adoption to increase productivity, quality,\
    \ and sustainable\ndevelopment. In this research, we present a scientiﬁc mapping\
    \ of the adoption of precision techniques\nand breakthrough technologies in agriculture,\
    \ so-called Digital Agriculture. To do this, we used\n4694 documents from the\
    \ Web of Science database to perform a Bibliometric Performance and\nNetwork Analysis\
    \ of the literature using SciMAT software with the support of the PICOC protocol.\n\
    Our ﬁndings presented 22 strategic themes related to Digital Agriculture, such\
    \ as Internet of Things\n(IoT), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and Climate-smart\
    \ Agriculture (CSA), among others. The\nthematic network structure of the nine\
    \ most important clusters (motor themes) was presented and\nan in-depth discussion\
    \ was performed. The thematic evolution map provides a broad perspective\nof how\
    \ the ﬁeld has evolved over time from 1994 to 2020. In addition, our results discuss\
    \ the main\nchallenges and opportunities for research and practice in the ﬁeld\
    \ of study. Our ﬁndings provide a\ncomprehensive overview of the main themes related\
    \ to Digital Agriculture. These results show the\nmain subjects analyzed on this\
    \ topic and provide a basis for insights for future research.\nKeywords: precision\
    \ agriculture; agriculture 4.0; digital agriculture; smart farming; industry 4.0;\n\
    sustainability; innovation; bibliometrics; science mapping\n1. Introduction\n\
    The ﬁeld and the concept itself of agriculture have dramatically changed and have\n\
    been profoundly revolutionized over time, with the introduction of new approaches\
    \ and\nconcepts, such as those of Precision Agriculture (PA) and Agriculture 4.0\
    \ (A4.0). These have\ngiven rise to so-called Digital Agriculture (DA). Around\
    \ 10,000 years ago, humans began to\ndedicate efforts to domesticating plants\
    \ and animals, spreading seeds, planting seedlings,\nand using animal force to\
    \ plow the land [1]. This revolution that changed human life and\ntransformed\
    \ hunter-gatherers into farmers is called the Neolithic Revolution or the First\n\
    Agricultural Revolution [2]. Although this revolution was a great leap for humankind—as\n\
    it allowed the cultivation of plants and guaranteed food for the population—the\
    \ new\nactivities demanded more hours of work [2]. This dedication to agriculture\
    \ generated\na surplus of food that multiplied the number of people and created\
    \ elites who owned\nSensors 2021, 21, 7889. https://doi.org/10.3390/s21237889\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2021, 21, 7889\n2 of 28\nand controlled\
    \ land and food [2]. Between the First Agricultural Revolution and the\nprosperous\
    \ and abundant society that we have today, thousands of years have passed, and\n\
    several transformations have occurred in the ways of production, and several difﬁculties\n\
    related to economic niches, malnutrition and wars over ﬁelds and cultures have\
    \ arisen [2].\nThese signiﬁcant disadvantages and shortcomings have led to new\
    \ transformations and\nrevolutions in the ﬁeld of agriculture [3].\nIn the 19th\
    \ century, Agriculture 2.0, also known as the Second Agricultural Revolution,\n\
    changed farming by introducing ad hoc machinery, selective breeding, animal fertilizer,\n\
    crop rotation, reapers and tractors that contributed to shaping the ﬁrst steps\
    \ of modern\nagriculture [1]. Food started to be produced faster in this frame,\
    \ but farmers were hindered\nby rust, pests, and soil depletion. New techniques\
    \ and technologies have increased food\nsurplus and reduced the need for labor\
    \ in agriculture, forcing the migration of workers\nand the urbanization and the\
    \ growth of cities [4,5]. This workforce allocation in towns was\nan integral\
    \ part of the industrial revolution, which stimulated the rise of manufacturing\n\
    industries [4].\nTo deal with the challenges of the Second Agricultural Revolution,\
    \ Agriculture 3.0 or\nthe Third Agricultural Revolution emerged in the 20th and\
    \ early 21st centuries. Between\n1966 and 1985, the concept of the Green Revolution\
    \ was introduced, especially in terms\nof the use of advanced, cutting-edge technologies,\
    \ such as biotechnology and genetic\nengineering to generate genetically varieties,\
    \ hybrid plants and animals [6,7], and this\nprovided a real breakthrough in agriculture.\
    \ The third revolution was characterized by\nthe further introduction of new technologies,\
    \ such as GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite\nSystem) to monitor animals and crops,\
    \ computers and devices for data management and\nanalysis of agricultural production-related\
    \ information, robots, chemicals, fertilizers, and\nirrigation systems to increase\
    \ productivity and production quality [1]. These transforma-\ntions greatly impacted\
    \ the quality of agricultural production and the societal, economic,\nand environmental\
    \ pillars of sustainability [8].\nThe concept of PA emerged in 1980 and represented\
    \ the adoption of precision tech-\nniques and technologies used singly or in combination\
    \ [9] to control ﬁeld variability [10,11].\nDespite the concept of PA appearing\
    \ during the Third Agricultural Revolution, its tech-\nniques and technologies\
    \ were mainly exploited in the context of the Fourth Industrial\nRevolution, driven\
    \ by the Industry 4.0 concept [11]. A4.0 represents the use of technologies\n\
    such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Artiﬁcial Intelligence, big data, cloud\
    \ computing,\nand other smart systems and devices for managing crops and farms\
    \ [11,12]. In this sense,\nboth terms are related to DA, which can be perceived\
    \ as a major driver for changes and\nevolution in sustainability, food security,\
    \ efﬁciency, and productivity.\nDespite the fact that these revolutions have,\
    \ at least partially, solved food production\nand security problems, the increase\
    \ in population and the scarcity of resources are worri-\nsome challenges for\
    \ modern agriculture. Nowadays, almost one billion people go to sleep\nhungry\
    \ every day [13]. The human population is expected to reach 9 billion by 2050\
    \ [11],\nincreasing food demand by up to 50% [14]. Most of these people are expected\
    \ to live in\nSouth Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where more than 20% of the current\
    \ population is\nfood insecure [15]. In addition, agriculture is responsible for\
    \ consuming 70% of the world’s\ndrinking water [11]. Human consumption of resources\
    \ has tripled in the last 50 years, and\nthe exploitation of resources is 30%\
    \ greater than nature’s ability to regenerate [16]. From\nthis perspective, the\
    \ challenges involved in producing more food with less environmental\nimpact are\
    \ evident [17]. Given this backdrop, emerging technologies can enable sustainable\n\
    agricultural production, and the main challenges, in terms of either structural\
    \ or perceived\nobstacles and barriers, as well as the major opportunities of\
    \ their technological adoption,\nneed to be explored.\nSeveral studies have revised\
    \ the changes and revolutions that have occurred in the\nﬁeld of agriculture to\
    \ understand the effects of technology adoption and its potential to deal\nwith\
    \ challenges related to food production for the current and future generations.\
    \ Kim et al.\n(2019) and Raparelli and Bajocco (2019) [18,19] performed bibliometric\
    \ analyses on the\nSensors 2021, 21, 7889\n3 of 28\nuse of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles\
    \ (UAV) in agriculture, and Terence and Purushothaman\n(2020) and Navarro et al.\
    \ (2020) [20,21] systematically reviewed the use of IoT in smart\nfarms. In addition,\
    \ previously published studies explored the use of Machine Learning\n(ML) techniques\
    \ [22–24], geospatial technology [25], and big data for smart farming [26,27].\n\
    Extensive reviews show PA technologies’ state of the art [28] and the main factors\
    \ that\ninﬂuence technological adoption [29]. Although some reviews and overviews\
    \ have already\nbeen carried out, to the best of our knowledge, no study has investigated\
    \ the complete\nevolution of the ﬁeld of study over time or discussed the digitalization\
    \ process of agricul-\nture. The present paper addresses precisely this literature\
    \ gap by highlighting the main\nchallenges and opportunities related to Digital\
    \ Agriculture.\nDue to the transformational potential of emerging technologies\
    \ for agriculture overviewed\nin the above-mentioned reviews, the present paper\
    \ is devoted to offering a scientiﬁc map-\nping approach to identify strategic\
    \ themes, the thematic evolution structure and the main\nchallenges and opportunities\
    \ of Digital Agriculture. For this, the PICOC protocol (Popula-\ntion, Intervention,\
    \ Comparison, Outcome, and Context) was used to guide and ensure the\nquality\
    \ of this study. The SciMAT (Science Mapping Analysis Software Tool), developed\
    \ by\nCobo et al. (2012) [30], was used for data treatment and generation of the\
    \ strategic diagram\nand the evolutionary map of the ﬁeld of study.\nThe paper\
    \ is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the research background.\nSection\
    \ 3 contains materials and methods.\nResults and discussions are presented in\n\
    Section 4. The main challenges and opportunities are presented in Section 5, and\
    \ Section 6\npresents the conclusions, limitations, and suggestions for further\
    \ research.\n2. Research Background\nDifferent terms can be used (and have been\
    \ used) to refer to the ﬁelds of PA and\nA4.0 [31]. Some authors closely associate\
    \ them, whereas, in the current work, we operate\na distinction between PA and\
    \ A4.0. While PA is often related to issues of ﬁeld variability\nand speciﬁc analyses\
    \ and technologies, such as application of agricultural inputs in areas\nwith\
    \ the most signiﬁcant productive potential (e.g., the use of georeferenced data\
    \ for\nthe application of chemicals according to the needs of each area), A4.0\
    \ goes beyond the\nanalysis of ﬁeld variability and aims to manage farms based\
    \ on detailed knowledge of the\nspeciﬁc context and situation, to create a value\
    \ chain that fully integrates, incorporates\nand involves stakeholders, technologies\
    \ and agricultural processes [11,31,32]. Due to the\nvariety of concepts, theoretical\
    \ frameworks/approaches and interpretations related to the\ntechnological adoption\
    \ in agriculture, in this research, the term Digital Agriculture is used\nto describe\
    \ both concepts associated with digital transformation in agriculture without\n\
    considering the technological level.\n2.1. Precision Agriculture\nThe PA concept\
    \ represents the use of techniques and emerging technologies for crop\nmanagement,\
    \ pest control and ﬁeld improvement [11,33]. With PA, it is possible to increase\n\
    crop quality and crop productivity. Since 1980, with the introduction of sophisticated,\n\
    cutting-edge analyses, there has been a considerable increase in the use of technology\
    \ in\nagriculture. For instance, the global soybean production could be 32 million\
    \ tons higher\nif the PA were massively adopted [34]. Progressively, new techniques\
    \ and technologies\nwere developed, with researchers and practitioners gradually\
    \ exploring how to provide an\nenhanced range of advantages for the primary sector\
    \ [11].\nTherefore, several studies have shown the importance of the adoption\
    \ of PA for\nreducing/minimizing environmental impacts while preserving food production\
    \ [35–37].\nFor instance, the efﬁcient analysis of phosphorus and potassium through\
    \ PA technologies\ncontributes to agriculture being more sustainable [34]. PA\
    \ research is also related to\nthe identiﬁcation of management zones [38,39],\
    \ analysis and management of soil and\nplant nutrients [40–42], UAV applications\
    \ for a proper capture and analysis of plantation\ndata [43,44], farmers’ perception\
    \ [45] and others.\nSensors 2021, 21, 7889\n4 of 28\nRelated to PA, there are\
    \ several terms and concepts, ranging from Precision/Open\nField/Farming (PF)\
    \ to Precision Horticulture (PH) (or controlled-environmental agriculture\n(CEA)\
    \ and Vertical Farming (VF)), Precision Animal Farming (PAF), including Precision\n\
    Aquaculture (Fisheries). These sectors are also very important in food production,\
    \ being\n“concentrated capital” and “economically and technologically manageable”.\
    \ This reﬂects\nthe non-uniform, but multi-faceted and complex nature of the ﬁeld\
    \ of PA.\n2.2. Agriculture 4.0\nThe concept of A4.0 emerged after the introduction\
    \ and development of the concept of\nIndustry 4.0 in 2011 and seeks to use the\
    \ same technologies used by factories of the future\nto create a new level of\
    \ agricultural production for ensuring food safety and protection\nof the environment\
    \ [11]. A4.0 represents the use of emerging technologies to develop a\nvalue chain\
    \ that successfully integrates organizations, farmers, customers, and all relevant\n\
    stakeholders in favor of economic, social, and environmental sustainability. Therefore,\
    \ A4.0\nis important for mitigating several global concerns related to productivity,\
    \ proﬁtability,\ncost reduction and efﬁciency [11], including mitigating against\
    \ climate change effects and\nallocating agricultural resources in a reasonable\
    \ and ethical way [35]. Given this, there\nis an evident growing interest from\
    \ the scholarly community towards the topic of digital\nagriculture [46].\nA4.0\
    \ seems to be a more comprehensive and broader concept than PA, as it seeks\n\
    to integrate all actors in agri-food production through a technological value\
    \ chain. In\nthis perspective, A4.0 goes beyond local and speciﬁc analyses to\
    \ include all agricultural\nprocesses. Studies related to A4.0 address the development\
    \ of decision support systems to\nintegrate all members of the production chain\
    \ [1], responsible innovation [47], real-time\nintegration of IoT for agriculture\
    \ [48], and the potential of A4.0 to address major societal\nissues associated\
    \ with environmental sustainability (e.g., carbon emissions and exploitation\n\
    of natural resources), social (e.g., impact on labor and food security) and economic\
    \ sustain-\nability (e.g., productivity, costs and agriculture as a subsistence\
    \ economy) [11,32,49–52],\namong others.\n3. Materials and Methods\nWe use the\
    \ PICOC protocol and SciMAT software to perform a Bibliometric Perfor-\nmance\
    \ and Network Analysis (BPNA) to achieve our goal. PICOC ensured the robustness\n\
    and deﬁnition of the research criteria. At the same time, SciMAT helped identify\
    \ the strate-\ngic themes, the thematic evolution structure and the main challenges\
    \ and opportunities in\nthe ﬁeld of study.\n3.1. PICOC Protocol\nThe PICOC protocol\
    \ was used to deﬁne the research questions [53], the key terms\nand variants [54],\
    \ and the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the selection of papers\nrelated\
    \ to the ﬁeld of study [55]. This method ensures the quality and reproducibility\
    \ of\nthe research with the lowest bias from the researchers. In this study, the\
    \ process of the\nPICOC protocol was adapted, slightly modifying the search and\
    \ analysis steps presented\nby Bruzza et al. (2017) and Silva et al. (2020) [55,56].\
    \ Table 1 shows the attributes according\nto the PICOC protocol.\nWith the support\
    \ of the PICOC protocol, we deﬁned three major research questions\n(RQ1–3):\n\
    RQ1: What are the strategic themes related to Digital Agriculture?\nRQ2: How has\
    \ the thematic evolution of Digital Agriculture occurred over time?\nRQ3: What\
    \ are the main challenges and opportunities of Digital Agriculture?\nSensors 2021,\

    Bibliometric software\nScience Mapping Analysis Software Tool (SciMAT)\nFor bibliometric\
    \ analysis and identiﬁcation of strategic themes and the evolutionary\nmap of\
    \ the ﬁeld, we used the SciMAT software developed by Cobo et al. (2012) [30].\
    \ We\nchose the SciMAT because it assists all stages of scientiﬁc mapping, from\
    \ data preprocessing\nto the generation of maps of the ﬁeld of study [30,52,59,60].\
    \ In addition, the SciMAT\npresents a robust preprocessing module, which ensures\
    \ data quality [30]. With the support\nof the SciMAT, we plotted a strategic diagram\
    \ and the intellectual network structure of the\nmost important themes [61–63].\
    \ In addition, it was possible to generate an evolutionary\ndiagram that presented\
    \ the most important themes of the ﬁeld of study distributed over\ntime. Figure\
    \ 1 illustrates an example of the strategic diagram (a), thematic network structure\n\
    (b), and thematic evolution structure (c), where the size of the clusters represents\
    \ the\nnumber of associated documents and the importance of the theme for the\
    \ research ﬁeld,\nand the thickness of the lines represents the strength of the\
    \ relationship between the\nclusters [30,59,60]. The evolutionary map was created\
    \ based on the equivalence index,\nwhere the solid lines (Figure 1c) indicate\
    \ that the clusters share the main theme (main\ntheme ∈ {thematic nexuses}). In\
    \ contrast, dashed lines represent a connection between the\nnon-main elements\
    \ (main theme /∈ {thematic nexuses}), and the absence of lines means that\nthe\
    \ theme was discontinued from one period to the following period(s) [64].\nSensors\

    \ of 28\nAfter deﬁning the subperiods, we generated the diagrams based on the\
    \ keyword\nco-occurrence matrix with the SciMAT to identify the most important\
    \ themes and their\nnodes with other clusters [66–68]. To determine the similarity\
    \ between themes, data were\nthen normalized using the Equivalence Index [69]\
    \ and clustered based on the Simple\nCenters Algorithm (SCA) to create a network\
    \ of relationships [70]. To make the diagrams,\nwe reduced the data on a frequency\
    \ reduction of eight times. We deﬁned a maximum and\nminimum network of 12 and\
    \ 3, respectively, to plot only the most important clusters of\nthe ﬁeld of study\
    \ (for more information, see Cobo et al. (2012) [30]). The clusters were\nplotted\
    \ on a two-dimensional diagram with four quadrants (Q1–4) (e.g., Figure 1a) whose\n\
    horizontal axis represents the centrality of the themes and their number of connections\n\
    with other themes, and the vertical axis represents the density of the connections\
    \ between\nclusters [11,13,59,60]. In other words, clusters with high centrality\
    \ tend to co-occur with\nmany other themes, while clusters with high density have\
    \ very dense co-occurrence links\nwith speciﬁc themes. This analysis highlights\
    \ the correlational breadth between two or\nmore themes over time. The four quadrants\
    \ are deﬁned as follows:\n•\nMotor themes (Q1): the upper right clusters are highly\
    \ developed themes. The strong\ncentrality and density represent the high number\
    \ of associated documents and the\nmany links between these themes and others.\
    \ In this sense, motor clusters are the\nmost developed and important themes in\
    \ the ﬁeld of study and are related to many\nother subjects/topics.\n•\nBasic\
    \ and transversal themes (Q2): clusters in the lower right quadrant are themes\n\
    that have many relationships with other themes but whose relationships are weak.\n\
    Despite these clusters’ great development and links with different themes, the\
    \ low\ndensity indicates little capacity to sustain over time.\n•\nEmerging or\
    \ declining themes (Q3): they represent clusters with few and weak links\nwith\
    \ other themes, which may appear or disappear in the ﬁeld of study. These\nthemes\
    \ need in-depth qualitative analysis by researchers to identify whether they are\n\
    emerging or declining. Over time, these clusters may cease to be discussed or\
    \ move to\nother quadrants.\n•\nHighly developed and isolated themes (Q4): the\
    \ upper left quadrant comprises of low\ncentrality and high-density clusters.\
    \ These clusters have few but strong links with\nother themes. The strong centrality\
    \ of these themes shows their ability to prevail over\ntime, to develop links\
    \ with other clusters and, perhaps, to become motor themes.\nThe motor themes\
    \ of the strategic diagram were explored to identify the relationships\nwith other\
    \ themes. In this way, it was possible to identify technologies, techniques and\n\
    other widely discussed subjects/topics and the main challenges and opportunities\
    \ of\nDigital Agriculture.\nAs a last remark to the methodology adopted in the\
    \ present study, we would like\nto stress two major points. First, as also previously\
    \ mentioned, to the best of our knowl-\nedge, the present investigation is the\
    \ ﬁrst to perform a bibliometric analysis related to\nthe ﬁeld of Digital Agriculture.\
    \ As such, this study should be intended as being of an\nexploratory nature, providing\
    \ readers with a preliminary, though broad, comprehensive,\nand detailed overview\
    \ of the existing scholarly literature covering the research area of\nDigital\
    \ Agriculture. Therefore, we decided to focus on PA, not including other PA-related\n\
    terms as keywords, and we did not attempt to explore its multi-faceted, complex\
    \ nature\nand its sub-sectors (namely, PH, CEA, VF, PAF or Precision Aquaculture/Fisheries).\
    \ These\naspects warrant further ad hoc reviews (either in the form of systematic\
    \ overviews or\nmapping/scoping reviews), based also on the ﬁndings of the present\
    \ investigation.\n4. Results\nTo explore in-depth the DA ﬁeld, we conducted a\

    In 1994, the term Precision Agriculture started to be widely discussed in studies\n\
    that evaluated the rate of application of inputs in crops [71], the spatial and\
    \ temporal\nvariability of yields [72–74] and the potential of precision techniques\
    \ for conserving natural\nresources [75]. After the initial introduction and its\

    \ and maturity the ﬁeld is reaching and achieving and by the number of researchers\n\
    who have made efforts to understand the impact of technology adoption in agriculture.\n\
    Different aspects of a ﬁeld of study can be understood and quantiﬁed through bibliometric\n\

    \ the following subsection.\nIn addition, ‘NDVI’ (Normalized Difference Vegetation\
    \ Index) and ‘SUSTAINABILITY’\nappear to be basic and transversal themes (Figure\
    \ 3) and represent the concern for the sus-\ntainable development of agriculture.\
    \ Other techniques appear related to crop management,\nsuch as ‘WEED-CONTROL’,\
    \ ‘CROP-MODEL’, ‘SOIL-TEXTURE’, ‘PHENOTYPING’, ‘SOIL-\nCOMPACTION’ and ‘WATER-PRODUCTIVITY’,\
    \ and others are related to technologies,\nsuch as ‘HYPERSPECTRAL-IMAGERY’, ‘SUPPORT-VECTOR-MACHINES’,\
    \ ‘EM38′, and\n‘AGRICULTURAL-ROBOTICS’. Although some clusters represent speciﬁc\
    \ analyses and\ntechniques related to productivity and quality of agricultural\
    \ production, the motor themes\nhighlight the transformation expected for food\
    \ production in the coming years.\n4.3. Motor Themes Related to Digital Agriculture\n\
    We explored the thematic network structure (Figure 4) of the motor themes presented\n\
    in the strategic diagram (Figure 3). This analysis highlights the relationships\
    \ of a cluster\nwith others and provides an in-depth view of the ﬁeld of research.\
    \ The size of each cluster is\nproportional to the number of associated documents,\
    \ and the thickness of the lines denotes\nthe binding force between clusters.\n\
    4.3.1. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)\nThe cluster ‘UAV’ presents signiﬁcant importance\
    \ in the strategic diagram (Figure 3)\ndue to its high degree of interactions\
    \ with the other motor themes. The UAV corresponds\nto a pilotless aircraft, i.e.,\
    \ a ﬂying machine operated with no humans (passenger/pilot)\nonboard [78]. Some\
    \ previous literature reviews and meta-analysis explored the use of\nUAVs in agriculture,\
    \ as in research by Lelong et al. (2012) [79], Singh and Frazier (2018) [80],\n\
    Shahbazi et al. (2014) [81] and Eskandari et al. (2020) [82]. UAVs are low-cost\
    \ and easy-\nto-operate technologies in agriculture [83] that can be adopted for\
    \ spraying in ﬁelds [84],\nsuch as water precision irrigation. Given the technological\
    \ advancement emerging in\ndifferent countries, UAVs have gained more and more\
    \ space and importance for smart\nfarming [83,85]. Various sensors can be coupled\
    \ to UAVs [85] associated with techniques,\nsuch as photogrammetry, Structure\
    \ from Motion (SfM), multi-spectral and hyper-spectral\nimages, and technologies,\
    \ such as Machine Learning, LiDAR, and sensors, cameras and\nother hardware and\
    \ software that contribute to monitoring the crop. This seems to justify\nthe\
    \ strong relationship between UAV and the subtheme ‘REMOTE-SENSING’, followed\n\
    by the subthemes ‘MACHINE-LEARNING’ and ‘VEGETATION-INDICES’ among others\n(Figure\
    \ 4a).\nSensors 2021, 21, 7889\n12 of 28\nFigure 4a shows the relationship between\
    \ UAV and Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS),\nwhile UAV focuses on the development\
    \ and use of robots; UAS includes ground-based\ncontrollers, communication systems,\
    \ payloads, electro-optical systems, radar, and software\nfor aircraft vehicles.\
    \ The sensors in the drones can generate vegetation indices, helping\nto monitor\
    \ crop growth diagnosis and grain yield prediction [86]; disaster detection in\n\
    environmental areas [87]; the existence of pests and pathogens in the crop; the\
    \ analysis\nof the health and stress status of the vegetation; and the assessment\
    \ of soil fertility for\nappropriate remote management and precise and reduced\
    \ application of agrochemicals,\ndriving sustainable agriculture [85] and increased\
    \ productivity. New, sophisticated, cutting-\nedge techniques and approaches,\
    \ such as machine learning, improve decision-making in the\nﬁeld of precision\
    \ and digital agriculture, assisting and facilitating tasks like the prediction\n\
    of nitrogen index of the crop through remote sensing from UAV [83,88]. Thus, farm-related\n\
    data and information can be easily collected through drones, such as images [89],\
    \ and can\ngenerate knowledge that machine learning techniques can process to\
    \ make agriculture\nmore precise and digital. For instance, Zhang and Zhao (2019)\
    \ [90] used images of coastal\nsoils captured through UAV to identify salinization\
    \ levels and then proposed a method\nto improve the monitoring and management\
    \ of the soil for avoiding the negative impacts\nof salinization on crop growth\
    \ and production. Hence, this cluster highlights the central\nrole of UAV, which,\
    \ together with other emerging technologies, generates precision in\nagriculture\
    \ and enables the interconnection among technologies for better decision-making,\n\
    allowing farms to be smart.\n4.3.2. Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA)\nCSA (Figure\
    \ 4b) is a concept related to the adoption of best agricultural production\npractices\
    \ and methods for reorienting agriculture for environmental protection, food secu-\n\
    rity and climate change issues [15,91]. The population increase, land and environmental\n\
    degradation, and the negative impacts of the food system on the climate require\
    \ new\nagricultural practices. Within this framework, CSA is an extremely necessary\
    \ approach to\nﬁnd win-win solutions for the sustainable development of agriculture\
    \ [92]. Climate change\nand the degradation of the planet’s biodiversity cause\
    \ risks to the food supply, and the\nvulnerability of people who have agriculture\
    \ as their primary source of subsistence [15].\nTo deal with this, the resilient\
    \ agriculture model proposed by CSA seeks to create adaptive\ncoherence between\
    \ climate and agricultural practices [92]. To assist in the development\nof CSA,\
    \ farmers embrace technological innovations that could make agriculture more\n\
    sustainable. However, great governmental and academic incentives need to be dedicated\n\
    to assisting the agricultural sector in sustainable development [91,92].\nThis\
    \ high-density motor theme is related to sustainable agriculture, which shows\
    \ its\nstrong relationship with climate-related themes (e.g., ‘CLIMATE-CHANGE-ADAPTATION’\n\
    ‘CLIMATE-CHANGE’), environmental preservation (e.g., ‘CONSERVATION-AGRICULTURE’\n\
    ‘AGROFORESTRY’), organizations (e.g., ‘SMALLHOLDER FARMERS’) and discussions\n\
    related to agricultural resilience, food security and the main challenges for\
    \ organizations, es-\npecially for smallholders. Previous systematic reviews explored\
    \ the role of CSA [91,93–95].\nRelated research discusses technological adoption\
    \ [96], farmers’ adaptation to resilient\nagriculture [97], innovative economic\
    \ models [98], emerging ways to increase the resilience\nof smallholder farmers\
    \ [99], and the impact of CSA on food security [100], among other\nissues associated\
    \ with resilient agriculture.\n4.3.3. Internet of Things (IoT)\nThe cluster ‘IoT’\
    \ (Figure 4c) has a high degree of interactions with the subtheme\n‘WIRELESS-SENSOR-NETWORKS’,\
    \ followed by ‘BIG-DATA’, ‘ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE’,\n‘CLOUD-COMPUTING’ and others.\
    \ Internet of Things can be deﬁned as a grouping of\ntechnologies and infrastructures\
    \ that, wirelessly connected, enable data mining from inter-\nconnected objects,\
    \ as well as the monitoring and correct management of data [11,101]. It\nallows\
    \ remote access and control of objects [102]. Thus, IoT has been achieving a promi-\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 7889\n13 of 28\nnent role in agriculture. Both the quality and\
    \ quantity of production in the agricultural\nindustry have been maximized through\
    \ IoT [103], such as crop yield and efﬁciency [104].\nIoT technologies, such as\
    \ smart sensor networks, cameras, weather stations and smart-\nphone applications,\
    \ can improve crop data collection and decision-making for smart farm\nmanagement\
    \ [105].\nThere are many ways of adopting IoT in agriculture. Some authors have\
    \ explored\nprevious literature to understand IoT’s role, opportunities and challenges\
    \ in agricul-\nture [106–108]. Jin et al. (2020) [109] proposed a predictor based\
    \ on IoT to accurately\npredict/forecast temperature and humidity in ﬁelds, allowing\
    \ anticipated planning and\ncontrol for sustainable precision agriculture. Jayaraman\
    \ et al. (2016) [105] proposed an IoT\nplatform capable of expanding data collection\
    \ on soil, irrigation, fertilization and environ-\nmental conditions, generating\
    \ relationships among data for forecasting crop performance\nand boosting smart\
    \ farming. Relating IoT to blockchain, Hussain (2019) [110] developed a\nmodel\
    \ capable of helping in the migration from traditional to smart agriculture. Tekiner-\n\
    dogan (2018) [3] used IoT to create a portable agricultural sensor network system,\
    \ which\ncollects data (temperature, light intensity, and soil moisture content)\
    \ utilizing sensors and\na microcontroller to generate databases that can be used\
    \ through Big Data based analytics\nfor better crop management. These IoT actions\
    \ can be further enhanced and maximized\nwhen combined with artiﬁcial intelligence-based\
    \ technologies, which facilitate the man-\nagement of data collected from different\
    \ objects and sources in the ﬁeld [102]. In addition,\nconnectivity on Digital\
    \ Agriculture through IoT becomes efﬁcient and effective when based\non cloud\
    \ computing [111]. Thus, regardless of the applications, IoT actions in agriculture\n\
    require investments in cloud computing to facilitate the collection, storage,\
    \ access, and\nmanagement of integrated data. Therefore, this cluster emphasizes\
    \ the importance of IoT\nas a link among different technologies, tools, equipment,\
    \ and machines that jointly improve\nprecision agriculture and, consequently,\
    \ lead to digital agriculture.\n4.3.4. Spatial Variability\nThe cluster ‘SPATIAL\
    \ VARIABILITY’ (Figure 4d) is a motor theme that presents strong\ninteractions\
    \ with geostatistics and management zones and contributes to monitoring soil\n\
    properties at agricultural sites. The analysis of the spatial variability of soil\
    \ attributes was\none of the ﬁrst precision techniques associated with crop management\
    \ and helps farmers\nto know chemical and physical characteristics of the soil\
    \ through sampling and analysis\nthat identify soil variations such as nutrients,\
    \ fertility, salinity, electrical conductivity, pH,\norganic matter, phosphorus,\
    \ and other important variables/parameters. Geostatistics\ntechniques such as\
    \ kriging, variogram analysis and interpolation reveal the heterogeneity\nof the\
    \ soil. These analyses allow us to understand intrinsic factors, such as soil\
    \ formation\nand relief, substances, organisms and climate, and extrinsic factors,\
    \ such as management\npractices, and fertilization rate, among others.\nTherefore,\
    \ this cluster is linked with increasing efﬁciency and crop productivity. The\n\
    analysis of spatial variability is, indeed, a key factor for increasing food production\
    \ [112]\nand farmers’ economic revenues [113]. The mapping of soil heterogeneity\
    \ has contributed\nto enhance soil data and to make geostatistics become a fundamental\
    \ tool in agricultural\nmanagement [114]. Some studies show that farmers visualize\
    \ the information of DA made\nby georeferenced analysis [115]. Despite its advantages,\
    \ spatial variability analyses often\nhave high costs that make it difﬁcult for\
    \ small farmers to use them. Future research needs\nto explore the improvement\
    \ of these techniques to increase the expansion of its use.\n4.3.5. Global Positioning\
    \ System (GPS)\nThrough georeferencing, GPS was one of the ﬁrst big steps towards\
    \ Digital Agri-\nculture. The cluster ‘GPS’ (Figure 4e) is a motor theme that\
    \ presents strong interactions\nwith the subtheme Geographic Information Systems\
    \ (GIS). Other subthemes, such as\n‘YIELD-MONITOR’, ‘YIELD-MAPPING’ and ‘VARIABLE-RATE\
    \ TECHNOLOGY’, also\nhave prominent links with this cluster. Thus, the integration\
    \ of GPS with other smart\nSensors 2021, 21, 7889\n14 of 28\ntechnologies, such\
    \ as GIS and remote sensing, can boost farming productivity and cost\nefﬁciency\
    \ [116]. GPS corresponds to a navigation system that, using satellites, identiﬁes\n\
    an object’s exact position and velocity around the world and can guide directions\
    \ [117].\nAgricultural activities, such as seeding and plowing, can only be precisely\
    \ conducted using\nvehicle navigation accuracy [118].\nIn previous research, Si\
    \ et al. [118] proposed a method to enhance the accuracy of\nthe steering angle\
    \ of agricultural vehicles by combining GPS with the low-cost Micro-\nelectromechanical\
    \ System (MEMS), which improves DA. Palaniswami et al. [119] argue\nthat the joint\
    \ adoption of GPS and GIS technologies can improve sugarcane cultivation\nin coastal\
    \ lowland ecosystems, making production more precise and sustainable. Khosro\n\
    (2018) [120] developed a strawberry yield-monitoring picking cart, equipped with\
    \ a real-\ntime kinematic global positioning system (RTK GPS), different types\
    \ of sensors, a micro-\ncontroller, and an inertial measurement unit to improve\
    \ the synchronization of the carts\nwith robots in harvesting and creating yield\
    \ mapping of strawberry productivity. Com-\nmonly, yield mapping on farms is performed\
    \ using GPS and variable-rate technology for\nboosting planters’ performance [121].\
    \ In addition, Thrikawakaa et al. [122] demonstrate\nthat applying variable-rate\
    \ technology through GPS in agricultural vehicles improves the\nwater content\
    \ in ﬁelds and reduces the application of fertilizers. In addition, previous\n\
    literature reviews introduce the conceptualization and potential of GPS (for more\
    \ informa-\ntion see, Rivero et al., 2021 [123]; Peng et al. (2017) [124]). Thus,\
    \ this cluster highlights the\nrole of GPS as a leading technology capable of\
    \ improving DA’s effectiveness through its\ninterconnecting capacity with other\
    \ smart technologies. Emerging technologies combined\nwith scientiﬁc knowledge\
    \ make it possible to use the strategic geographical location of\nagricultural\
    \ production, helping to make precise and targeted decisions.\n4.3.6. Image Processing\n\
    The cluster ‘IMAGE PROCESSING’ (Figure 4f) presents strong linkages with agricul-\n\
    tural management tools (e.g., ‘MACHINE VISION’ and ‘COMPUTER VISION’) that provide\n\
    data for the farmer’s decision-making. Previous literature reviews explored advanced\
    \ con-\ntrol strategies and image processing techniques in Digital Agriculture\
    \ (see Ngugi et al.\n(2021) [125], Syeda et al. (2021) [126], and Sohail et al.\
    \ (2020) [127]). Zhao et al. [128] used\nmachine vision to exploit color images\
    \ to detect immature green citrus. The use of video pro-\ncessing (i.e., machine\
    \ vision) also was analyzed by Sabzi et al. [129] to classify potato plants\n\
    and three types of weed. In this regard, machine vision was also revised by Wang\
    \ et al. [130],\ncombined with image processing as relevant tools for ‘WEED DETECTION’.\n\
    Machine learning algorithms also are linked with image processing and can assist\n\
    ‘DEEP LEARNING’ in agriculture [131]. ‘ARTIFICIAL-NEURAL-NETWORKS’ is an ex-\n\
    ample of the Artiﬁcial Intelligence method [132] to create new forms to solve\
    \ complex\nagricultural problems based on big data. Through image processing,\
    \ several outputs\ncan be processed by machine learning and can be shown in apps\
    \ for smartphones and\ncomputers [133].\n4.3.7. Nitrogen\nThe cluster ‘NITROGEN’\
    \ (Figure 4g), like the ‘HYPERSPECTRAL’ and ‘YIELD PRE-\nDICTION’ clusters, has\
    \ no stronger relations with some themes than the other clusters. As\nan important\
    \ nutrient for agricultural production, this cluster is related to crop management\n\
    (e.g., ‘MAIZE’ and ‘POTATO’), and fertilizers (e.g., ‘PHOSPHORUS’ and ‘POTASSIUM’).\n\
    The link between ‘NITROGEN’ and these themes comprises several ﬁelds of studies,\
    \ such\nas nitrogen deﬁciency [134], nutrient management [135,136], nutrient loss\
    \ [137], nutrient\nefﬁciency [138], and nutrient monitoring [139]. Therefore,\
    \ the technical agronomic back-\ndrop is preeminent in this cluster. In addition,\
    \ this theme is strongly linked to efﬁciency in\napplying nitrogen and other applications\
    \ of variable-rate technology [135,136,140].\nSensors 2021, 21, 7889\n15 of 28\n\
    4.3.8. Hyperspectral\nSeveral technologies are being developed and tested to analyze\
    \ plants, soil and crop\nvariables, such as optical sensors, three-dimensional\
    \ (3D) imaging, ﬂuorescence imaging,\nthermography, multispectral and hyperspectral\
    \ imaging [141]. The ‘HYPERSPECTRAL’\ncluster (Figure 4h) shows that these analyses\
    \ are standing out in agriculture, mainly because\nhyperspectral imaging is a\
    \ more advanced technique than traditional multispectral imaging\nand allows the\
    \ identiﬁcation of more details of the target features [142]. Hyperspectral\n\
    images are used as an efﬁcient alternative for collecting and processing data\
    \ and creating\nan electromagnetic spectrum of agricultural ﬁelds, being a valuable\
    \ tool for monitoring,\nanalyzing, and providing more accurate detection of spatio-temporal\
    \ variations in crop\nphysiological and morphological characteristics [142,143],\
    \ such as soil attributes and soil\ndegradation. Some previous research explored\
    \ the use of multispectral and hyperspectral\ntechniques in the ﬁeld of Digital\
    \ Agriculture, focusing on high-resolution applications, and\nplant disease detection,\
    \ among others [142,144,145].\nDespite their great potential, hyperspectral images\
    \ are still little used outside the\nacademic context, but this is changing through\
    \ low-cost and mini-sized airborne hyper-\nspectral technologies that are being\
    \ used by farmers [142]. This difﬁculty occurs due to\nthe complexity of technologies\
    \ and algorithms, and the need to store and transfer data\ncollected by hyperspectral\
    \ analysis devices [146]. The signiﬁcance of the ‘HYPERSPEC-\nTRAL’ cluster shows\
    \ the volume of analyzes performed using maps and images of crops.\nThe clusters\
    \ associated with this theme demonstrate analyses related to vegetation in-\n\
    dexes and characteristics (e.g., ‘VEGETATION-INDEX’, ‘CHLOROPHYLL-CONTEXT’,\n\
    ‘CHLOROPHYLL-FLUORESCENCE’ and ‘LEAF-AREA-INDEX’). Previous research used\nhyperspectral\
    \ remote sensing to enable measurement of grapevine drought stress [147],\nidentiﬁcation\
    \ of pests and diseases [148], and assessment of seed germination [149].\n4.3.9.\
    \ Yield Prediction\nYield prediction is historically used in agriculture for farmers\
    \ to plan inputs, labor,\nproﬁtability and other issues related to agricultural\
    \ productivity. The cluster ‘YIELD-\nPREDICTION’ (Figure 4i) in Digital Agriculture\
    \ represents the evolution of predictive\nanalysis on crop yields, which in the\
    \ past was carried out by the knowledge of farmers,\nand is now carried out with\
    \ emerging technologies [98]. In this way, preharvest crop yield\nprediction helps\
    \ farmers to make better and faster decisions related to planting, fertilization,\n\
    irrigation, pruning and the harvesting of plantations [150]. It also contributes\
    \ to the entire\nsupply and consumption chain, and allows the projection of future\
    \ scenarios for food\nproduction [151].\nThis cluster appears related to be related\
    \ to few themes, but we can highlight ‘MOD-\nELING’, ‘IMAGE-ANALYSIS’ and ‘NEURAL-NETWORKS’\
    \ that are used to map and\nmodel crop data and information for future predictions.\
    \ Previous research related to crop\nyield prediction used different techniques\
    \ and technologies to collect and analyze data,\nsuch as Neural Network Techniques\
    \ [100], Unmanned Aerial System Imagery [152], Air-\nborne Optical Sensors [153],\
    \ Artiﬁcial Neural Networks [154], Machine Learning [155–157],\nHyperspectral\
    \ Imagery and Ensemble Learning [158], among others.\n4.4. Thematic Evolution\
    \ Structure\nThe evolutionary map presents the themes that have stood out over\
    \ time. The map\nwas divided into three subperiods to show the most important\
    \ themes according to the\nevolution of the ﬁeld of study. The ﬁrst subperiod\
    \ presents the main themes studied since\nthe ﬁrst mention of the term PA in 1994\
    \ in the ISI/Web of Science until the emergence\nof the Agriculture 4.0 concept\
    \ in 2011. The second subperiod covers the years 2012 to\n2017 and highlights\
    \ the terms widely discussed since the appearance of A4.0. The last\nsubperiod\
    \ (2018–2020) highlights the most current and relevant themes in the literature\
    \ in\nthe previous years. Figure 5 shows the evolutionary map of the ﬁeld of study,\
    \ the size of\nthe clusters is proportional to the number of associated documents,\
    \ while the thickness\nSensors 2021, 21, 7889\n16 of 28\nof the lines represents\
    \ the relationship between the themes. Continuous lines represent\nconceptual\
    \ nexus and dashed lines have non-conceptual nexus.\n4.4.1. First Subperiod (1994–2011)\n\
    In this subperiod (1994–2011) (Figure 5), we identiﬁed the ﬁrst studies that mentioned\n\
    Digital Agriculture through discussions about the use of technologies to increase\
    \ produc-\ntivity, deal with environmental variability and environmental conservation\
    \ of agribusi-\nness [71–75]. This subperiod contains studies that used hyperspectral\
    \ maps to analyze veg-\netation indices [159,160], imaging techniques [161] and\
    \ geostatistical analysis [162]. Besides,\nFigure 5 shows that technologies started\
    \ to be explored at this time, such as ‘GPS’, ‘HYPER-\nSPECTRAL’ images, and speciﬁc\
    \ analyses of soil and plants, such as ‘SOIL-FERTILITY’,\n‘NITROGEN’, ‘ELECTROMAGNETIC-INDUCTION’,\
    \ ‘PH’, ‘SOIL-COMPACTION’ and\n‘SOIL-TEXTURE’. These themes show that few technologies\
    \ were discussed and most of the\nthemes were associated with crop variability.\
    \ These themes prove that the discussions re-\nlated to Digital Agriculture mainly\
    \ represent the use of technologies such as georeferencing\nto analyze variability\
    \ associated with soil and plants.\nIn this subperiod, the ﬁrst discussions on\
    \ agroecosystems were developed [163] to\ncreate strategies to mitigate against\
    \ environmental damage. It is important to note that\nthis subperiod was one of\
    \ the most important for discussions related to sustainability, as\nresearch was\
    \ paving the way for other in-depth studies aimed at exploring the development\n\
    of resilient agriculture and the sustainable development of agribusiness. In addition,\n\
    many studies in this subperiod predicted that Digital Agriculture would be the\
    \ future of\nagribusiness [164–169].\n4.4.2. Second Subperiod (2012–2017)\nThe\
    \ second subperiod (2012–2017) (Figure 5) was characterized by a greater number\n\
    of documents associated with the consolidated PA motor themes and with emerging\
    \ A4.0\nones, as new technologies started to be discussed as the application of\
    \ UAV [170], wireless\nsensor networks and NDVI. The presence of clusters still\
    \ related to the ﬁrst subperiod, such\nas ‘NITROGEN’, ‘HYPERSPECTRAL’ and ‘GPS’,\
    \ demonstrates that some themes have\nremained strong over time. In addition,\
    \ new themes emerged, such as ‘GEOSTATISTICS’\nwith a signiﬁcant number of documents,\
    \ and ‘SUSTAINABLE-INTENSIFICATION’ and\n‘CSA’ associated with the development\
    \ of resilient and sustainable agriculture, demonstrat-\ning the further expansion\
    \ and growth of the ﬁeld of study [171–173].\nBetween 2012 and 2017, the term\
    \ A4.0 gained space and came to be widely discussed\nin the literature to portray\
    \ the creation of a digital value chain in agriculture. Although\nmany terms are\
    \ discussed in this subperiod, few of them stand out in the volume of\nassociated\
    \ documents and interrelationships with themes from other subperiods. Only\nthe\
    \ ‘GEOSTATISTICS’ cluster has a strong relationship with the ‘SPATIAL-VARIABILITY’\n\
    clusters of the ﬁrst and third subperiods, highlighting the high potential of\
    \ geostatistics\nfor analyzing crop variability. In addition, ‘CSA’ has evolved\
    \ to become one of the main\nthemes of the third subperiod. It is important to\
    \ note that some themes have evolved over\ntime; however, the small size of most\
    \ clusters shows that the ﬁeld of study was still under\ndevelopment.\n4.4.3.\
    \ Third Subperiod (2018–2020)\nThe third subperiod (2018–2020) (Figure 5) presents\
    \ the most recent themes related to\nDigital Agriculture. Three clusters stand\
    \ out with a large volume of associated documents.\nThey are ‘IoT’, ‘UAV’ and\
    \ ‘CSA’, which indicates that the use of emerging technologies and\nsustainable\
    \ development are currently the most important concerns of researchers in the\n\
    primary sector. The ‘IoT’ and ‘UAV’ clusters show the potential and adaptability\
    \ of small\nsensors for any agricultural scenario, whether in large crops or in\
    \ mountainous areas that\nare difﬁcult to cultivate [11], while the ‘CSA’ cluster\
    \ shows that concern for the sustainable\ndevelopment of agriculture continues\
    \ to grow and is characterized as one of the most\nSensors 2021, 21, 7889\n17\
    \ of 28\nimportant discussions in the arena of smart agriculture [97,100]. In\
    \ addition, discussions\nrelated to deep learning and machine vision represent\
    \ major technological adoptions in the\nﬁeld of agriculture, and themes like ‘APPARENT-ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY’\
    \ [174],\n‘WATER-BALANCE’ [175] and ‘PROXIMAL-SOIL-SENSING’ [176] show that the\
    \ concern\nwith analyses of plants and soil remains extremely important for the\
    \ digital transformation\nof agriculture.\nA broad look allows us to see the evolution\
    \ of the ﬁeld of study and the main themes\ndiscussed over time. The third subperiod\
    \ also produces insights on future trends, because\nsome themes stand out from\
    \ the others and are anticipated to remain of paramount impor-\ntance. Besides,\
    \ other themes have emerged only in the last subperiod and may represent\nemerging\
    \ themes that can be further explored in depth in the coming years. The growth\n\
    in the number of documents in the ﬁeld of study (Figure 2) and discussions associated\n\
    with technological adoption in agriculture (Figure 4) demonstrate the commitment\
    \ of\nresearchers to the development of the primary sector and its importance\
    \ for the sustainable\ndevelopment of society and organizations.\n5. Challenges\
    \ and Opportunities\n5.1. Main Challenges\nDiscussions related to UAV, spatial\
    \ variability, yield prediction and crop model\n(Figure 3) show that there are\
    \ many challenges associated with the adoption of emerging\ntechnologies in agriculture,\
    \ such as variations in soil, climate, sustainability, cultivated\nspecies and\
    \ producer size. Government investments, export volume, agricultural and\nconsumer\
    \ culture are also factors that directly impact the way food is grown and pro-\n\
    duced, and the innovative efforts and investments dedicated to production. Developed\n\
    and emerging economies have different types of governmental investment for agricultural\n\
    production, and some are developing projects aimed at the digital transformation\
    \ of agri-\nculture in countries, like China [177], Brazil [178], Mexico [179],\
    \ Thailand [180,181] and\nothers. Despite the investment of many countries in\
    \ digital agriculture, the transforma-\ntion is still in its infancy compared\
    \ to the technological adoption in the manufacturing\nand service sectors. Technologies\
    \ widely used in other sectors such as big data, Machine\nLearning, blockchain,\
    \ simulation/mathematical modeling and augmented reality are still\nlittle explored\
    \ in agriculture. Figure 3 shows that only Internet of Things and UAV are\nprominent\
    \ technologies in the arena of agriculture.\nAmong the main challenges of digital\
    \ technology, technological adoption is among the\ncharacteristics and peculiarities\
    \ of emerging technologies, which are often complex for the\nlow level of technical\
    \ knowledge of smallholder farmers [45]. The most signiﬁcant volume\nof agricultural\
    \ production is from developing countries, and most of these farmers are\nsmall\
    \ producers with low levels of education. Under these circumstances, even language\n\
    can become a barrier to technological innovation, since most technologies are\
    \ developed\nin English, a language not spoken by small producers in developing\
    \ countries [31]. This\nbarrier for small producers favors large agribusiness\
    \ companies that have workers trained\nto use technologies and apply them to increase\
    \ large-scale production quality. In addition,\nthere is a major digital infrastructure\
    \ problem in many developing countries, which are\ngradually developing ways to\
    \ bring digital devices and applications at low cost to small\nproducers to increase\
    \ proﬁtability and production quality. This concern is evident in the\nrelationship\
    \ between smallholder farmers and CSA (Figure 4b), which also appears to be\n\
    related to discussions of gender and female management in agriculture.\nThe motor\
    \ theme of the ﬁeld of study, the Internet of Things, appears related to\nsecurity\
    \ and blockchain (Figure 4c), highlighting that technological advances bring also\n\
    complex data security and privacy issues. Concerns about information, conﬁdentiality\n\
    and data integrity are major challenges that concern farmers [182]. In highly\
    \ technological\nscenarios, these concerns increase the efforts of researchers\
    \ and practitioners in the search\nfor better encryption and security techniques\
    \ to reduce the risks of cyber-attacks and ensure\ndata security and privacy [183].\
    \ According to Zhang et al. (2020) [184], farmers are highly\nSensors 2021, 21,\
    \ 7889\n18 of 28\nconcerned about data security and the physical requirements\
    \ for equipment and practical\ntools for data protection and distributed systems\
    \ for agricultural management. Hussein\n(2019) [183] reviews the requirement of\
    \ the computational infrastructure necessary for\ncloud storage to be effective\
    \ and secure. This and other studies highlight the concern\nwith agile software\
    \ development, data security, conﬁdentiality, and reliability to guarantee\nfair\
    \ competition, differential privacy, economic development, sustainable innovation,\
    \ and\nsocial entrepreneurship in agriculture.\nIn this sense, two major strands\
    \ of challenges can be considered: the ﬁrst strand is\nabout technical challenges,\
    \ such as the mastery and the adaptation of technological tools\nto direct them\
    \ in the best possible way for optimal gains. These challenges are evident\nthrough\
    \ technologies that are subthemes of thematic network structures, such as Machine\n\
    Learning and Deep Learning, drones, cloud computing, big data, blockchain, Artiﬁcial\n\
    Intelligence, artiﬁcial neural networks, computer vision, and others (Figure 4).\
    \ The second\nstrand is related to sustainability issues, such as the continuous\
    \ world population growth\nand global warming (mainly due to the greenhouse effect,\
    \ or gas emissions) and their\nharmful effects on agriculture [185]. Discussions\
    \ related to these challenges are represented\nby subthemes, such as food security,\
    \ conservation agriculture, climate change adaptation,\nagroforestry, vegetation\
    \ indices, resilience, and mitigation.\nMoreover, it is crucial to keep in mind\
    \ that, although many authors discuss the\ntechnological potential for promoting\
    \ sustainable development, other authors discuss\nthe paradox of sustainability\
    \ [186] by raising questions about the contradictions between\neconomic growth\
    \ and sustainable development that mainly negatively affect the low-\nincome populations\
    \ [187]. In the same perspective, the technological paradox regards the\nlack\
    \ of evidence about technological beneﬁts in terms of productivity and sustainability\
    \ of\norganizations and society [188]. These controversies between authors show\
    \ that discussions\nabout these paradoxes in agriculture are not yet sufﬁciently\
    \ developed and addressed, and\nthat future research should explore this topic\
    \ in-depth [52].\n5.2. Opportunities for Research and Practice\nThe primary sector\
    \ is crucial for human survival and is full of challenges. In this\nscenario,\
    \ the technological potential can be exploited to meet the food needs of the human\n\
    population without damaging the environment [52]. The number of studies associated\
    \ with\nsustainable agriculture shows that technological adoption can develop\
    \ resilient agriculture\nthat integrates the various (economic, environmental,\
    \ and societal) pillars. Previous re-\nsearch related to the motor theme of CSA\
    \ explored the adaptation of agricultural methods\nto develop adaptive agriculture\
    \ for plantations, landscapes and forests while addressing\nclimate issues and\
    \ food security [91,92]. Regenerative and circular agriculture explores\nways\
    \ to avoid using chemicals and to rather utilize methods to develop natural pro-\n\
    cesses to protect the soil, the environment, and people through the production\
    \ of healthier\nfoods [189]. Figure 4 highlights this through subthemes, such\
    \ as food security, soil fertility\nand related properties/topics. These subthemes\
    \ also help us identify the main crops where\nthe technology is being implemented\
    \ and discussed in the literature, such as sugarcane,\ncotton, potatoes, maize,\
    \ and grape (viticulture). Thus, the formulation and adoption of\nnew technologies\
    \ based on the circular economy principles (reduce, reuse, recycle) can\nboost\
    \ the sustainability, digitalization, and integration of agriculture with other\
    \ links of the\nagribusiness value chains, a promising opportunity for further\
    \ advancement of the ﬁeld.\nAdvances in agricultural production are crucial for\
    \ increasing production and im-\nproving logistics performance and traceability\
    \ of agricultural data in the coming years [52].\nAlthough big machines favor\
    \ agricultural monopolies, small technologies, such as sensors,\nactuators, and\
    \ drones can be developed at a lower cost and with features to assist small\n\
    farmers in collecting and analyzing crop variability data [11]. Other technologies,\
    \ such\nas smart grids can assist in the development of integrated energy networks\
    \ that facilitate\nthe management of crops at lower costs [190]. Digital Agriculture\
    \ depends on techno-\nlogical progress, and a viable path for future research\
    \ concerns strategic foresight [191]\nSensors 2021, 21, 7889\n19 of 28\nand analysis\
    \ of innovation capabilities [192,193] to assist in the development of techno-\n\
    logical innovations in smart agriculture. Our results are presented in the evolutionary\n\
    map (Figure 5) with the emergence of themes such as thermal imaging, red edge,\
    \ spraying\nequipment, NDVI, and technology adoption.\nDigital Agriculture can\
    \ promote and foster changes, revolutions, transformations, and\ngains, both for\
    \ society and sustainability, as well as for economic agents through the im-\n\
    provements in scale and efﬁciency of the digitization of agriculture. Within this\
    \ framework,\nif drones and IoT are more connected to companies and businesses,\
    \ CSA has an important\nimpact on inclusive and sustainable agriculture. The existing\
    \ scholarly literature presents\nseveral techniques and technological solutions\
    \ aimed at ensuring environmental protection\nand economic and social sustainability\
    \ (see Figure 5, e.g., hyperspectral, thermal imaging,\nspatial variability, proximal\
    \ soil sensing, and CSA, among others), which represent both\ntechnological and\
    \ sustainable revolutions in the primary sector. This may motivate a cycle\nof\
    \ sustainable production and consumption to transform the planet and society.\
    \ According\nto Ofori and El-Gayar (2020) [31], the main drivers for technological\
    \ adoption in agribusi-\nness are related to governance, policies, trade opportunities,\
    \ effects on human capital,\nemployment opportunities and environmental protection.\
    \ In this perspective, traditional\nagriculture is no longer sufﬁcient to meet\
    \ the demand for food, quality, sustainability\nand safety of the environment,\
    \ and a new paradigm is needed, namely the technological\nparadigm [194].\nTo\
    \ create a technological and sustainable culture, agriculture depends on the en-\n\
    gagement of various members of society, such as universities, farmers, companies,\
    \ the\ncommunity and the government. In this sense, the topic of creation of an\
    \ innovation\necosystem has been little explored in the literature and presents\
    \ an opportunity for future\nresearch. The participation of universities is crucial\
    \ for developing technologies and re-\nsearch aimed at modeling and developing\
    \ methods and techniques that assist farmers in\nmanaging agricultural processes.\
    \ Governmental programs and ﬁnancing can help in the\ndigital transformation of\
    \ agriculture in developing countries, promoting the production\nand consumption\
    \ of sustainable products, less waste and awareness of recycling. In this\nperspective,\
    \ innovation ecosystems can be explored in-depth for the digital and sustainable\n\
    transformation of the primary sector. The adoption of new technologies enables\
    \ the trans-\nformation of value chains into digital ecosystems, potentially integrating\
    \ organizations and\nstakeholders, beneﬁting each participant in the ecosystem\
    \ [195]. As in industries, in agri-\nculture, value ecosystems can directly impact\
    \ economic performance and business agility.\nTo do this, national innovation\
    \ systems can assist in transferring knowledge between\nindustries and universities\
    \ [196,197], facilitating the development of digital innovation.\nIn addition,\
    \ the number of startups focused on agribusiness is growing, and they are\ndeveloping\
    \ technologies at a lower cost that meet the needs of small and medium farmers.\n\
    All of this can help, in particular, small producers, who are responsible for\
    \ a large portion of\nthe world’s population’s food production, and who are affected\
    \ the most by the challenges\nof agricultural revolutions. Technologies, such\
    \ as big data, facilitate the collection and\nanalysis of large volumes of data,\
    \ and IoT, through its small sensors and actuators, can\nbe used in any type of\
    \ setting/environment. In addition, cybersecurity can be exploited\nto address\
    \ farmers’ fear of data protection and security. Altogether these approaches can\n\
    facilitate the digital transformation of agriculture in different scenarios and\
    \ for different\nsizes of agricultural producers.\n6. Conclusions\nIn this research,\
    \ we presented the strategic themes and the scientiﬁc evolution struc-\nture of\
    \ Digital Agriculture. With the PICOC protocol and the SciMAT software it was\n\
    possible to map and identify the strategic themes of the ﬁeld of study, which\
    \ are mainly\nassociated with technologies and sustainable development, such as\
    \ IoT, UAV, GPS, spatial\nvariability, and CSA. In addition, the evolution map\
    \ divides the literature into three subpe-\nriods of time, listing the most important\
    \ themes at each stage of development of digital\nSensors 2021, 21, 7889\n20 of\
    \ 28\ntransformation in agriculture. The main challenges associated with digital\
    \ technological\nadoption were identiﬁed, mainly related to the complexity of\
    \ technologies, agricultural\nculture and adaptation, data security/safety/integrity\
    \ and environmental issues [198,199].\nIn addition, we identiﬁed the main opportunities\
    \ of technological adoption and research\nin agribusiness that are strongly related\
    \ to creating a technological and smart value chain\nto increase the productivity,\
    \ quality, and proﬁtability of agricultural production, while\npromoting and ensuring\
    \ economic, societal, and environmental sustainability. Thus, we be-\nlieve to\
    \ have covered a major gap in the existing scholarly literature related to the\
    \ evolution\nof the digitalization of agriculture and its strategic themes over\
    \ time.\nLimitations and Further Research\nDespite its contribution, methodological\
    \ rigor and high-quality, as well as trans-\nparency, and reproducibility, this\
    \ research has limitations that should be properly acknowl-\nedged. This study\
    \ explored only documents from the Web of Science database, and we\nanalyzed only\
    \ the thematic structures of the motor themes, and as such other themes\nshould\
    \ be addressed in future works. It is important to keep in mind that agriculture\n\
    directly impacts socioeconomic conditions and environmental sustainability. Thus,\
    \ a more\ncomprehensive qualitative analysis could be realized in terms of the\
    \ implications of Digital\nAgriculture for sustainability and societal development.\
    \ The role of emerging technologies\nto promote food security and the impact of\
    \ food production on society and organizations\nneed to be explored. Future research\
    \ can explore in-depth agricultural management prac-\ntices focused on CSA, sustainable\
    \ and lean agriculture to identify and analyze sustainable\nproduction paths.\
    \ In addition, scenarios and frameworks for smart agriculture imple-\nmentation\
    \ should be explored. Future research could map the ﬁeld of study, focusing\n\
    on speciﬁc techniques, applications, and technologies such as Big Data, Artiﬁcial\
    \ Intelli-\ngence, blockchain, Internet of Things, autonomous robots, NDVI, yield\
    \ prediction, image\nprocessing, etc. Future studies could explore each theme\
    \ and subtheme not covered in\nthis research to discover hidden and emerging themes\
    \ in the ﬁeld of study, such as those\nrelated to subsectors of PA, like PH, CEA,\
    \ VF, PAF and Precision Aquaculture/Fisheries.\nMoreover, further additional analyses\
    \ could be performed, stratifying ﬁndings based on\nthe speciﬁc study design of\
    \ the investigation (original research, overview/review, etc.)\nand gradating/assessing\
    \ its strength of evidence. Innovation ecosystems need also to be\nexamined by\
    \ involving organizations, government, and universities to integrate and digi-\n\
    tize processes. Future works can also explore technological and sustainability\
    \ paradoxes\nto identify the real potential of technologies in agriculture and\
    \ the challenges related to\ntheir contradictions to better understand whether\
    \ human decisions about food production\nare moving in the right direction or\
    \ are causing an ecological collapse unrecoverable on\nthe planet.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    \ been proposed over the last years as they\nfacilitate understanding the roles\
    \ of diﬀerent networking, hardware, and software components of\nsmart applications.\
    \ These are inherently distributed, spanning from devices installed in the ﬁeld\
    \ up\nto a cloud datacenter and further to a user smartphone, passing by intermediary\
    \ stages at diﬀerent\nlevels of fog computing infrastructure. However, IoT architectures\
    \ provide almost no hints on where\ncomponents should be deployed. IoT Software\
    \ Platforms derived from the layered architectures\nare expected to adapt to scenarios\
    \ with diﬀerent characteristics, requirements, and constraints from\nstakeholders\
    \ and applications. In such a complex environment, a one-size-ﬁts-all approach\
    \ does\nnot adapt well to varying demands and may hinder the adoption of IoT Smart\
    \ Applications. In this\npaper, we propose a 5-layer IoT Architecture and a 5-stage\
    \ IoT Computing Continuum, as well as\nprovide insights on the mapping of software\
    \ components of the former into physical locations of the\nlatter. Also, we conduct\
    \ a performance analysis study with six conﬁgurations where components are\ndeployed\
    \ into diﬀerent stages. Our results show that diﬀerent deployment conﬁgurations\
    \ of layered\ncomponents into staged locations generate bottlenecks that aﬀect\
    \ system performance and scalability.\nBased on that, policies for static deployment\
    \ and dynamic migration of layered components into\nstaged locations can be identiﬁed.\n\

    \ new demand for system architectures,\ninfrastructure and platform deployment\
    \ approaches, in order to fulﬁll the requirements of a new breed\nof highly distributed\
    \ smart applications. The number of devices connected to the Internet has been\n\
    increasing steadily [1,2], so smart applications will typically have to deal with\
    \ thousands or even\nmillions of devices. Customized conﬁgurations, automated\
    \ reconﬁgurability, and scalability are critical\nchallenges in any successful\
    \ deployment of IoT smart applications [3], in areas such as agriculture [4,5],\n\
    cities [6,7], healthcare [8] and industry [9].\nLayered architectures are critical\
    \ structures in computer networks and distributed systems as\nthey facilitate\
    \ the understanding of roles, locations, and levels of abstraction of diﬀerent\
    \ networking,\nhardware, and software components. Diﬀerent IoT architectures have\
    \ been proposed for facilitating\nSensors 2020, 20, 84; doi:10.3390/s20010084\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2020, 20, 84\n2 of 24\nthe understanding\
    \ and design of smart applications, with three [10], four [11,12], or ﬁve layers\
    \ [12–14].\nThe 3-layer architecture—application, network, and perception layers—was\
    \ soon replaced by a 5-layer\narchitecture by adding two new layers—middleware\
    \ and business—considered thus more adequate\nfor the rapid evolution of IoT systems.\
    \ Also, intermediate 4-layer architectures have been proposed,\nadding, for example,\
    \ a security and management layer. The reason behind the growing interest in IoT\n\
    architecture is that a complete solution for IoT smart applications requires diﬀerent\
    \ software, hardware,\nand communication technologies working together and integrating\
    \ a variety of platforms, components,\nservices, and applications. IoT smart applications\
    \ require careful consideration and new concepts to be\ndeveloped as they are\
    \ inherently distributed, spanning from sensors and actuators in the ﬁeld up to\
    \ a\ncloud datacenter and further to a user smartphone, passing by intermediary\
    \ stages at diﬀerent levels\nof fog computing infrastructure.\nIoT architectures\
    \ provide a functional view of software, hardware, and communication components\n\
    placed into layers for facilitating system design and development. However, they\
    \ do not provide\nindications on where these components should be deployed. As\
    \ the end-to-end data ﬂow occurring in\na smart application includes sensors deployed\
    \ in the ﬁeld whose data usually are processed in the\ncloud, the deployment of\
    \ architectural components is a complex task that may vary according to the\n\
    characteristics, requirements, and constraints of applications and stakeholders.\
    \ In such a complex\nenvironment, a one-size-ﬁts-all approach does not adapt well\
    \ to varying demands and may hinder the\nadoption of IoT smart applications. On\
    \ the other hand, a clean and layered architecture deﬁnition\nmight open the way\
    \ towards engineering processes that enable ﬂexible reallocation of data and services\n\
    to the diﬀerent deployment stages, for increased performance and scalability [15].\n\
    In this paper, we introduce a new IoT architecture for smart applications called\
    \ IoTecture,\ncomprising ﬁve layers, namely L1-Device, L2-Transport, L3-Data,\
    \ L4-Model, and L5-Service.\nOur experience with deploying an IoT platform derived\
    \ from the implementation of this architecture in\nfour pilots with diﬀerent characteristics\
    \ in three countries [4] taught us that there is no one-size-ﬁts-all\napproach\
    \ for this process. The need for our IoTecture is due to the acknowledgment that\
    \ the traditional\n5-layer architecture is not prone to having an active role\
    \ in the deployment of new applications since\nthe business, application, and\
    \ middleware layers are too generic with broader scopes.\nTherefore, together\
    \ with IoTecture, we developed the concept of an IoT computing continuum,\ncalled\
    \ IoTinuum, to provide a clear view of the diﬀerent deployment locations for architectural\n\
    components, divided up into ﬁve stages, namely S1-Thing, S2-Mist, S3-Fog, S4-Cloud,\
    \ and S5-Terminal.\nBy representing architecture layers and deployment stages\
    \ separately and mapping one into the other,\nwe obtain a ﬂexible mechanism for\
    \ reasoning on functionality and placement, thus allowing the\ndeployment of IoT\
    \ smart applications on diﬀerent scenarios. We advocate that IoTecture is not\
    \ just yet\nanother passive IoT architecture since it is actively used for the\
    \ deployment of software components\ninto distributed locations of IoTinuum.\n\
    Diﬀerent deployment conﬁgurations of layered IoTecture components mapped into\
    \ staged\nIoTinuum places generate diﬀerent hardware and software bottlenecks\
    \ represented by the use of\nsystem resources. In order to facilitate the understanding\
    \ of the tradeoﬀs involved in this mapping,\nwe conducted a performance analysis\
    \ study with six conﬁgurations of a FIWARE-based IoT platform,\nvarying the smart\
    \ application (agriculture and city), the low power wide area network (LPWAN)\n\
    technology [16] such as LoRaWAN [17], the workload and the use of fog computing\
    \ infrastructure\n(no fog, lightweight fog or heavyweight fog). Our results show\
    \ that diﬀerent deployment conﬁgurations\nof layered components into staged locations\
    \ generate diﬀerent hardware and software bottlenecks\nrepresented by the use\
    \ of system resources. The physical location where a software component is\nexecuted\
    \ has a signiﬁcant impact on the performance and scalability and brings diﬀerent\
    \ tradeoﬀs,\nas revealed by our performance analysis results. The concepts and\
    \ processes involved in architecting\nand deploying smart applications, together\
    \ with the practical performance analysis results, increase\nthe understanding\
    \ and awareness involved in the development and operation of a new breed of\n\
    IoT-enabled systems.\nSensors 2020, 20, 84\n3 of 24\nThe contributions of this\
    \ paper are threefold. Firstly, the proposal of IoTecture and IoT continuum\n\
    and the mapping of one into the other for facilitating the deployment of IoT smart\
    \ applications.\nSecondly, the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of diﬀerent\
    \ technologies according to the\nIoTinuum approach, analyzing tradeoﬀs, and highlighting\
    \ the suitability of each scenario. Thirdly, we\nincreased the understanding of\
    \ how diﬀerent components of FIWARE and LoRaWAN behave under\nheavy workload,\
    \ as our experiments indicate that some FIWARE components deal poorly with high\n\
    throughput applications. This problem has not been identiﬁed before in the literature\
    \ because most\nstudies with available results do not stress the system enough\
    \ to detect system bottlenecks.\nIn the remainder of this paper, Section 2 introduces\
    \ the background and related work, and\nSection 3 presents IoTecture and IoTinuum.\
    \ Section 4 details the research design and methods of our\nperformance analysis\
    \ study, whose results are presented in Section 5 and discussed in Section 6.\
    \ Finally,\nSection 7 draws some conclusions and presents future work.\n2. Background\
    \ and Related Work\n2.1. IoT Architectures and Platforms\nLayered architectures\
    \ are critical structures in computer networks and distributed systems as\nthey\
    \ facilitate the understanding of roles, locations, and levels of abstraction\
    \ of diﬀerent networking,\nhardware, and software components. In order to separate\
    \ concerns, it is pertinent to emphasize that\nfrom an IoT architecture, diﬀerent\
    \ application software architectures can be derived as they deﬁne the\nhigh-level\
    \ structure of a system comprising software components and relations [18]. However,\
    \ here\nwe do not elaborate on application software architectures.\nThe initial\
    \ proposal of a generic IoT architecture had three layers, namely application,\
    \ network,\nand perception [10]. The application layer processes large amounts\
    \ of data using computational\nintelligence techniques and interfaces with users.\
    \ The network (also called transport) layer deals with\ncommunication and networking\
    \ technologies to transfer data from sensors to the place of processing\nand send\
    \ commands back to actuators. The perception (also called sensing) layer collects\
    \ the data from\nsensors. However, soon, a 5-layer architecture was proposed to\
    \ deal with the rapid development of\nIoT solutions at the time, adding two more\
    \ layers: middleware and business [12–14]. The middleware\n(also called processing\
    \ or service) layer deals with data and databases, as well as service functions,\
    \ such\nas discovery, composition, and management. The business layer is a loosely\
    \ deﬁned one that aggregates\ngeneral functions to deal with an entire IoT system,\
    \ including business models and security/privacy.\nDiﬀerent extensions of the\
    \ 3-layer IoT architecture added only one new layer, a middleware/service\nlayer\
    \ [6,19], and a security and management layer [20]. As for the latter, here we\
    \ consider that\northogonal layers more adequately address these non-functional\
    \ requirements.\nNowadays, most eﬀort in developing and deploying new IoT smart\
    \ applications is aimed at\nimproving distributed data management in order to\
    \ make data promptly available for the processing\nof application-speciﬁc models,\
    \ both physical and data-driven ones. Also, these proposals follow a\ncommon approach\
    \ in the past where layered IoT architectures provided an initial functional view\
    \ of\nthe entire solution, and after some iterations in the development process,\
    \ they gave way to software\narchitectures and artifacts.\nIt is imperative the\
    \ need to implement and deploy highly distributed IoT applications that span\n\
    from the things, going through diﬀerent processing/storage/transmission stages,\
    \ up to the cloud, and\nfurther to the user terminal. In other words, we advocate\
    \ that IoT architectures must have an active\nrole in the deployment of new applications.\
    \ An option is to embed deployment locations within\nthe architecture, explicitly\
    \ recognizing the existence of edge processing [21]. However, we consider\nthat\
    \ a new concept is needed to separate the concerns of layered software components\
    \ from staged\ndeployment locations. In the 5-layer IoT architecture, the business,\
    \ application, and middleware layers\nare too generic with broader scopes, which\
    \ do not facilitate the activity of system deployment.\nSensors 2020, 20, 84\n\
    4 of 24\nAn IoT platform—also known as IoT software platform [22] or IoT middleware\
    \ [19,23]—\nimplements an IoT architecture providing a variety of building blocks\
    \ to facilitate the development of\nan IoT smart application, such as device connectivity,\
    \ device management, data management, data\nanalytics, security, and visualization.\
    \ An IoT platform gathers data from IoT devices and enables\nthe development and\
    \ of smart applications that control, monitor, and manage these devices. It is\n\
    often composed of several middleware components, each of then focusing on a speciﬁc\
    \ feature in a\nparticular layer to provide an end-to-end platform involving data\
    \ generation, transmission, storage,\nand processing.\nPractitioners can rely\
    \ on diﬀerent IoT platforms available, both open-source and commercial\nsolutions\
    \ [11,19,24]. These platforms may use multiple protocols and standards or even\
    \ proprietary\nsolutions.\nThis plethora of platforms leads to interoperability\
    \ problems since developers must\nadapt their applications to each platform, using\
    \ speciﬁc API, information models, and protocols [25].\nThus, standard interfaces\
    \ are needed to fulﬁll this interoperability issue among IoT applications and\n\
    heterogeneous IoT platforms. Also, security requirements must be addressed, such\
    \ as authentication,\nauthorization and access control, and secure communication\
    \ [26,27].\nFIWARE [28] is an open-source IoT platform that has been attracting\
    \ widespread attention in the\nlast years, comprised of a series of generic enablers\
    \ (GEs) that provide diﬀerent services. A combination\nof GEs builds diﬀerent\
    \ applications that exchange data through a REST API based on OMA NGSI [29].\n\
    Entities and their attributes represent the key aspect of the FIWARE NGSI context\
    \ management\ninformation model.\nOrion is the main FIWARE GE, a publish/subscribe\
    \ context broker and an eﬃcient data distributor,\nproviding an interface where\
    \ producers publish entities that are further notiﬁed to consumers. Orion\nonly\
    \ stores the last entity version published so that it must work together with\
    \ other GEs to keep\nhistorical data. The IoT Agent GE translates sensor data\
    \ in diﬀerent formats to NGSI and publishes\nit in Orion. There are diﬀerent implementations\
    \ of the IoT Agent, where each one maps diﬀerent\nIoT communication protocols\
    \ and data models to NGSI. The standard FIWARE IoT Agent receives\nMQTT data from\
    \ the sensors formatted in the Ultralight 2.0 protocol [30]—a lightweight text-based\n\
    protocol aimed to constrained devices and communications where the bandwidth and\
    \ device memory\nmay be limited resources. Currently, the oﬃcial FIWARE IoT Agent\
    \ implementation that supports\nLoRaWAN communication is unstable. Therefore,\
    \ we developed our own version of IoT Agent capable\nof mapping LoRaWAN messages\
    \ in the NGSI format.\n2.2. LPWAN Technologies for IoT\nIn recent years, LPWAN\
    \ technologies have been developed to meet the needs of IoT. LPWAN\nprovides long\
    \ transmission ranges, low energy consumption and low bandwidth [16], which make\
    \ it\nan attractive technology for IoT applications that send a few dozens of\
    \ bytes every couple of minutes\nor hours, such as street lighting, pollution\
    \ monitoring and irrigation for agriculture–i.e., smart cities\nand smart agriculture\
    \ scenarios. LPWANs follow a star topology, where sensors send data directly\n\
    to a data hub called gateway, which has a stable energy source and Internet connection.\
    \ Three\nLPWAN technologies are leading the forefront of this ﬁeld: Narrowband\
    \ IoT (NB-IoT) [31], Sigfox [32]\nand LoRaWAN [33]. NB-IoT, developed by 3GPP,\
    \ uses a subset of the LTE standard that limits the\nbandwidth to 200kH, thus\
    \ using cellular base stations for communication with devices. Sigfox uses\nunlicensed\
    \ ISM bands to connect end-devices to base stations based on patented technologies.\n\
    LoRa operates in the sub-GHz ranges, such as 433 MHz and 868 MHz (Europe) and\
    \ 915 MHz\n(USA and Brazil) [17]. The physical layer is called Long Range (LoRa),\
    \ and the upper layers are\ncalled LoRaWAN. The latter is standardized by the\
    \ LoRa Alliance [33] and can reach distances of\nsome kilometers with a bandwidth\
    \ up to 50 Kbps and a typical payload of fewer than 100 bytes. The\nLoRaWAN architecture\
    \ comprises LoRa end-nodes (i.e., sensors and actuators) and LoRa gateways that\n\
    have an active IP connection and forwards LoRa packets to a centralized server.\
    \ The server is further\ndivided into network server (deals with network issues)\
    \ and application (App) server, dealing with\nSensors 2020, 20, 84\n5 of 24\n\
    diﬀerent applications. LoRaWAN deﬁnes an ALOHA-based media access control protocol\
    \ on top of\nLoRa communication, as well as providing security features such as\
    \ authentication and cryptography.\nThere are diﬀerent ways of implementing the\
    \ LoRaWAN architecture: (a) Open source software\nthat can be installed in a cloud\
    \ datacenter or fog according to the scenario, such as ChirpStack [34],\npreviously\
    \ called LoRa Server; (b) The Things Network (TTN), a crowdfunded online community\n\
    that implements a LoRaWAN server and makes them available as a service (some services\
    \ are not\nfree, though) [35]; (c) Proprietary solutions, such as Loriot [36];\
    \ (d) The development of a new\nimplementation that means in practice reinventing\
    \ the wheel.\n2.3. Fog and Mist Computing for IoT\nFog computing is a new approach\
    \ for dealing with the enormous amount of data generated by\nIoT smart applications\
    \ [37]. It addresses three key challenges: (a) decreasing latency for real-time\n\
    application; (b) reducing data traﬃc between devices and cloud, and; (c) providing\
    \ a load balancing\nalternative to soften the processing burden of the cloud.\
    \ The fog metaphor is similar to the cloud\none, but the former is closer to the\
    \ ground and the people than the latter [38]. The underlying fog\ninfrastructure\
    \ is a virtualized platform that provides computing, storage, and communication\
    \ services\nbetween the users and the cloud datacenter [39]. In other words, fog\
    \ is the distributed computing\ninfrastructure for IoT. Here we consider fog computing\
    \ and edge computing as interchangeable terms,\neven though minor diﬀerences might\
    \ exist [40].\nWhile the fog aims at reducing bandwidth usage, latency, and data\
    \ communication with the\ndatacenter, mist computing extends this concept further\
    \ in IoT-based systems, closer to the sensors\nand actuators [12]. Although there\
    \ is no consensus about the deﬁnition of mist, some common\nunderstanding can\
    \ be found, such as being located closer to the devices [21,41]. Mist can be considered\n\
    the lowest level of a hierarchical fog computing system.\nUsually, mist nodes\
    \ host communication facilities, such as a LoRaWAN gateway or a Wi-Fi\naccess\
    \ point. Additionally, they can also host light processing and temporary storage,\
    \ typically using\nARM processors, such as Raspberry Pi and similar. According\
    \ to the Internet Engineering Task Force\n(IETF), these devices belong to a category\
    \ of general-purpose constrained nodes, making the diﬀerence\nbetween sensing\
    \ devices based on microcontrollers [42]. The mist infrastructure may be composed\
    \ of\ndiﬀerent nodes working together to provide services to devices within the\
    \ same geographical area,\nwhich not necessarily are packed into the same box.\n\
    2.4. IoT Smart Applications\nThe IoT allows people and objects to be connected\
    \ at any time, from anywhere, using standard\nnetworks and protocols to access\
    \ innovative smart services. Sensors of diﬀerent natures in diﬀerent\nspaces coupled\
    \ with ubiquitous GPS-equipped smartphones, in addition to the resources available\
    \ in\ncore or edge datacenters, allow seamless automation of typical manual activities.\
    \ The use of a variety\nof combined technologies—such as IoT, cloud computing,\
    \ big data analytics (e.g., machine learning\ntechniques) and network softwarization-make\
    \ it possible to build a myriad of new smart applications\nto the beneﬁt of our\
    \ society.\nHere we use four IoT verticals as examples of smart applications,\
    \ namely smart cities, smart\nagriculture, smart healthcare, and smart industry.\
    \ Although other smart applications exist, these four\nones represent the majority\
    \ of currents eﬀorts where IoT has been applied in real cases [3]. Cities\nare\
    \ becoming smarter for citizens and municipal governments, as new and existing\
    \ technologies\nare increasingly used to the development of a substantial variety\
    \ of services and applications [6,7].\nIn farms, the use of technology to add\
    \ intelligence to agriculture still has a vast potential to generate\nsigniﬁcant\
    \ advances. Smart agriculture (or more broadly smart farming), depends on innovative\n\
    technologies to increase the productivity of crops and animal products, to make\
    \ eﬃcient use of precious\nresources like water, and to decrease the amount of\
    \ chemical substances used (e.g., medicines and\npesticides) [5]. Notably, we\
    \ have been involved in using IoT and machine learning solutions within the\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 84\n6 of 24\nSWAMP project, which develops IoT-based approaches\
    \ for smart water management for a precision\nirrigation application, and pilots\
    \ them in Italy, Spain, and Brazil [4]. Healthcare is an essential area for\n\
    introducing IoT, given its enormous potential to provide quality of life to the\
    \ society in applications\nsuch as elderly monitoring, chronic diseases, ﬁtness\
    \ programs, and remote treatment [8]. Finally,\nindustrial automation has been\
    \ experiencing a signiﬁcant change in the last years, which is due to the\nrecent\
    \ technological advances that allow more profound interconnection and improved\
    \ integration\nand production control [9].\nA critical concern in the development\
    \ of IoT smart applications is security [26,27,43].\nThe applications must deal\
    \ with data privacy, conﬁdentiality, integrity, authentication, and availability\n\
    of services. The four IoT verticals have similar security requirements to protect\
    \ the data. In healthcare,\nprivacy means the health records of the patients must\
    \ be appropriately secured, using adequate\nauthentication methods to avoid access\
    \ by non-authorized users, and secure communication for\nexchanged data [27].\
    \ The data integrity is also important since incorrect sensor measurements or\n\
    prescriptions can cause serious health problems to the patient. Most embedded\
    \ sensors and wearables\nused in healthcare have resource limitations, which makes\
    \ it challenging to use traditional security\nmechanisms, usually computationally\
    \ expensive. Since many IoT devices are limited in power,\nprocessing, and memory,\
    \ this is a challenge also for applications in smart cities, smart agriculture,\
    \ and\nsmart industry.\n2.5. Performance and Scalability of IoT Systems\nDiﬀerent\
    \ forecasts have been reporting the availability of billions of connected devices\
    \ in the\nnext years [1,2]. Since smart applications will typically have to deal\
    \ with thousands of devices-or\nconsiderably more-performance and scalability\
    \ concerns are key to any successful IoT deployment. Yet,\nmost current reported\
    \ experiences show: (a) small-scale pilots [7,44]; (b) simulation-based or analytical\n\
    results [21,45]; (c) measurement-based results with limited scope [19,46]; (d)\
    \ no quantitative results at\nall [2,3,5,8,9,11,12,16,24,37,47]. Also, diﬀerent\
    \ architectural and deployment choices for IoT systems\naﬀect scalability, and\
    \ real-time decision-making is possible in an environment composed of thousands\n\
    of sensors [4,48]. Therefore, understanding the tradeoﬀs involved in planning\
    \ and deploying diﬀerent\nsoftware components of a speciﬁc scenario on diﬀerent\
    \ location infrastructures-such as cloud, fog,\nor mist—requires careful consideration\
    \ of the performance and scalability of the solution.\nCruz et al. [19] proposed\
    \ qualitative and quantitative metrics and evaluated the performance\nof various\
    \ IoT platforms. Out of 11 platforms initially analyzed by the qualitative approach,\
    \ ﬁve\nwere selected for the performance analysis. However, since they adopted\
    \ a generic approach, the\nauthors did not go into the speciﬁcs of individual\
    \ platforms, and they did not evaluate diﬀerent\ndeployment infrastructures.\n\
    Martínez et al. [46] gave a detailed description of a FIWARE testbed architecture\
    \ conﬁgured for\nprecision agriculture, which diﬀers from our approach, mainly\
    \ because our focus is to test diﬀerent\nconﬁgurations considering our IoTecture\
    \ and IoTinuum. Besides, their test application connects directly\nto Orion with\
    \ NGSI JSON, while we used an IoT Agent with an IoT sensor simulator that generates\n\
    synthetic data.\nThis paper diﬀers from previous work showing a performance analysis\
    \ study of six deployment\nconﬁgurations of FIWARE and LoRaWAN/LPWAN for smart\
    \ agriculture and smart city, involving\ndiﬀerent placement strategies of components\
    \ over fog and cloud infrastructures. It extends previous\npreliminary performance\
    \ results presented in [4] and [48], which focused on more speciﬁc scenarios of\n\
    smart irrigation.\n3. Architecting and Deploying IoT Smart Applications\nA complete\
    \ solution for IoT smart applications requires diﬀerent software, hardware, and\n\
    communication technologies working together and integrating a variety of platforms,\
    \ components,\nservices, and applications. These technologies play diﬀerent roles\
    \ and provide functions that operate in\nSensors 2020, 20, 84\n7 of 24\ndiﬀerent\
    \ perspectives of the scenarios addressed by smart applications. Figure 1 depicts\
    \ our proposed\nIoTecture, a generic 5-layer architecture based on our previous\
    \ experience with the development of\nIoT smart applications [4,49]. We recognize\
    \ that a myriad of diﬀerent layered architectures may be\nconceived having in\
    \ mind diﬀerent target applications.\nNevertheless, IoTecture is the outcome of\
    \ both an analysis of the literature (Section 2) and an\niterative reﬁnement process,\
    \ and as such, it is eﬀectively used in the speciﬁcation of pilot deployment\n\
    scenarios, as well as performance analysis studies. Compared to the 5-layer IoT\
    \ architecture [12–14],\nour 5-layer one explicitly adds support for highly distributed\
    \ data management functions and separates\nphysical and data-driven models from\
    \ application services. Also, by clearly identifying and separating\ncomponents\
    \ that are logically bound to the data, model, and service layers, IoTecture actively\
    \ helps\nthe deployment of IoT smart applications over diﬀerent distributed locations\
    \ in the mist, fog, and\ncloud. From a software architecture point of view, components\
    \ of diﬀerent layers are implemented by\nservices—actually encapsulated into Docker\
    \ containers with an exposed API, therefore microservices.\nComponents inside\
    \ each layer serve as representative examples of diﬀerent alternatives that may\
    \ vary\naccording to characteristics, requirements, and constraints of applications\
    \ and users.\n•\nLayer 1 (L1-Device): Sensors, actuators, and communication technologies—both\
    \ wired and\nwireless—make up the lowest layer of the IoT architecture. Devices\
    \ are sensors and actuators that\nrepresent IoT things. Figure 1 depicts some\
    \ examples of Layer 1 components, such as industrial\nrobots, that have many sensors\
    \ to track their actions, and actuators to control engines that make\nthem move\
    \ according to diﬀerent degrees of freedom, both exchanging messages with a smart\n\
    industry application via wired and wireless communication technologies.\n•\nLayer\
    \ 2 (L2-Transport): Collecting data from sensors, making it available to data\
    \ management\nfunctions, receiving commands from application models, and sending\
    \ them to actuators require a\ngood deal of intermediate components to make it\
    \ happen. Figure 1 depicts some examples of\ngeneric data transport functions\
    \ for sensing and actuation purposes, such as: (a) IoT protocol\n(e.g., MQTT [50])\
    \ that sends data from IP speaking devices to place where they are transformed\n\
    or ﬁltered either by other components of this layer or by data management components;\n\
    (b) IoT protocol translator (e.g., FIWARE IoT Agent) converts data from IoT protocol\
    \ format\n(e.g., byte stream for MQTT) into its internal format within data management\
    \ components\n(e.g., NGSI/JSON [29] for FIWARE) and vice-versa; (c) Sensor data\
    \ endpoint (e.g., ChirpStack [34])\ntransports, unpacks and decodes data for speciﬁc\
    \ IoT wireless communication technologies such as\nLPWAN [16]; (d) Device register\
    \ deals with the myriad of connected devices; (e) Data encryption\nand Authentication,\
    \ Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) is pervasively necessary for IoT\ncommunications\
    \ and included in Layer 2. A general function of data security and network/service\n\
    management are transversal functions, as all layers pervasively needed them (not\
    \ represented in\nFigure 1, though).\n•\nLayer 3 (L3-Data): Every stage of any\
    \ end-to-end IoT data ﬂow needs to deal with data in diﬀerent\nways, such as storing,\
    \ retrieving, distributing, transforming, and ﬁltering. Figure 1 depicts some\n\
    examples of generic data management functions, such as: (a) Context broker (e.g.,\
    \ FIWARE\nOrion [51]) for context data distribution and related storage system;\
    \ (b) Big data pipeline (e.g.,\nApache Kafka [52]) for raw data distribution and\
    \ replication; (c) Big data processing (e.g., Apache\nSpark [53]) for processing\
    \ large amounts of data; (d) Time series storage (e.g., CrateDB [54]) for\nhistorical\
    \ data, and; (e) Interfacing with external systems, such as weather forecast services,\
    \ online\ncity traﬃc management services and databases.\n•\nLayer 4 (L4-Model):\
    \ Represent application-speciﬁc models for any type of processing over data\n\
    collected from sensors and external systems, encompassing an assortment of algorithms,\
    \ equations,\nmethods and techniques that change the data into knowledge that\
    \ is used by end-users to change\nthe environment in a way that ﬁts their best\
    \ interests. For example, a smart irrigation application\nmay use soil and weather\
    \ data, as well as weather forecast information (external system), to feed\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 84\n8 of 24\nphysical and machine learning models to precisely compute\
    \ when and how much crops should\nbe irrigated [4].\n•\nLayer 5 (L5-Service):\
    \ Contains services that support the interfaces and the interaction with\nend-users\
    \ of smart applications. This layer encompasses all services, applications, and\
    \ graphical\ninterfaces that provide visualization of sensor data, sensing and\
    \ actuation infrastructures, analyses,\nchoices, and decisions, as well as commands\
    \ to change the state of the system. Figure 1 depicts\nfour IoT verticals as examples\
    \ of smart applications, namely smart agriculture, smart city, smart\nhealthcare,\
    \ and smart industry.\nSensors 2020, 20, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n8 of 24 \ninterfaces\

    \ should be deployed–i.e., mist, \nfog, or cloud-in a naturally distributed IoT\
    \ smart application. As the end-to-end data flow occurring \nin a smart application\
    \ includes sensors deployed in the field whose data usually are processed in the\
    \ \ncloud, the deployment of architectural components is a complex task that may\

    \ characteristics of the existing infrastructure, and extends the concept of IoT-fog-cloud\

    \ \nAs shown in Section 3, the mapping between components of the layered IoTecture\
    \ into stages of \nthe IoTinuum may result in different deployment configurations,\
    \ depending on the characteristics, \nrequirements, and constraints of applications\
    \ and users. The performance of smart applications is \ninfluenced by different\

    \ through which the data flow has to pass in its way from sensors (S1-Thing) up\
    \ to the \ncloud (S4-Cloud)–and user (S5-Terminal)-and back to actuators (S1-Thing).\
    \ Depending on where \ncomponents are deployed and how they are connected, the\
    \ bottlenecks may move from one place to \nthe other, as well as the amount of\
    \ data to be processed, stored, and transmitted may increase or \ndecrease, thus\
    \ impacting performance metrics, such as response time. In this section, we conduct\
    \ a \nperformance analysis study with six configurations to help us understand\
    \ the performance tradeoffs \nof different architectural and deployment choices,\
    \ based on our IoTecture and IoTinuum presented \nin Section 3. \n4.1. Design\
    \ Decisions and Deployment Configurations \nThe scope of this performance analysis\
    \ study follows design choices focused on typical IoT \nplatform components, independent\
    \ of application and communication technologies. Figure 5 depicts \nsix deployment\
    \ configurations of layered IoTecture components into staged IoTinuum places \n\
    devised following four key design choices: \n• \nApplication independence: Layers\
    \ L4-Model and L5-Application of IoTecture represent specific \napplications.\
    \ This study addresses architectural components that comprise a common IoT \n\
    platform, oblivious of smart application particularities. Thus, application-specific\
    \ components \nare not included in our experiments. As applications must consume\
    \ data managed by L3-Data, \na simple Consumer component was added to represent\
    \ L4-Model as a generic data sink. As a \ndirect consequence of this choice, data\
    \ flows only in one way, from sensors to the consumer \nlocated at the cloud.\
    \ In other words, users are not involved, and therefore, L5-Service and \nT5-Terminal\
    \ are outside of the scope of this work. \n• \nCommunication independence: in\

    \ wherein we can increase the workload by abstracting a large \nnumber of sensors\
    \ using the SenSE sensor simulator [56] that generates data at different rates.\

    analysis study with six conﬁgurations to help us understand the performance tradeoﬀs\
    \ of diﬀerent\narchitectural and deployment choices, based on our IoTecture and\

    12 of 24\n•\nCommunication independence: in order to understand scalability limits,\
    \ our study was performed\nin a lab testbed, wherein we can increase the workload\
    \ by abstracting a large number of sensors\nusing the SenSE sensor simulator [56]\
    \ that generates data at diﬀerent rates. Therefore, real IoT\ncommunication technologies-e.g.,\
    \ LPWAN-were not included in our experiments. Nevertheless,\nsince LoRaWAN is\
    \ currently a key LPWAN technology that needs a middleware component to\nwork\
    \ properly, a LoRaWAN server was included, as it belongs to L2-Transport playing\
    \ the role of\na sensor data endpoint. SenSE generates data emulating a LoRaWAN\
    \ device, in a way that the\nserver is unaware of not receiving data from real\
    \ sensors. The conﬁgurations with ChirpStack\nare compared to conﬁgurations with\
    \ a generic LPWAN technology where the sensor simulator\ngenerates data in a simple\
    \ string-based protocol–e.g., Ultralight 2.0-and does not need to go\nthrough\
    \ to the particularities of a speciﬁc LPWAN technology.\n•\nScenario simplicity:\
    \ to clearly understand the eﬀect of diﬀerent deployment conﬁgurations-i.e., the\n\
    mapping of IoTecture components into IoTinuum stages-a minimum set of components\
    \ was used\nto guarantee a data ﬂow that starts at sensors-actually, at SenSE-and\
    \ ends at the consumer. The set\nof software components included in the evaluated\
    \ IoT platform is composed of (Table 2): SenSE\nsensor simulator, ChirpStack,\
    \ FIWARE IoT Agent, FIWARE Orion, and consumer. They include\nother auxiliary\
    \ components as MQTT broker and databases (MongoDB, Redis), represented in\nFigure\
    \ 6.\n•\nFog Dilemma: S3-Fog may frequently leave behind in speciﬁc conﬁgurations\
    \ for diﬀerent reasons,\nsuch as the choice of the farmer in not hosting IoT infrastructure\

    4.2. Experimental Design\nFigure 6 extends Figure 5, providing additional technical\
    \ information for the six deployment\nconﬁgurations introduced in, needed for\
    \ the clear understanding of both experiments and results.\n•\nSmart applications:\
    \ two scenarios of smart agriculture and smart city are considered in our\nexperiments.\
    \ The critical diﬀerence between them is the approach for sensor data generation.\n\
    In the smart agriculture scenario, we consider many soil moisture sensor probes,\
    \ continually\ngenerating and transmitting one data packet every 10 min. In the\
    \ smart city scenario, we consider\nvehicles playing the role of sensors that\
    \ communicate with a traﬃc light according to a Poisson\narrival rate. In both\
    \ scenarios, the SenSE sensor simulator synthetically generates sensor data.\n\
    •\nLPWAN Technology: data is generated by SenSE using the Ultralight 2.0 protocol\
    \ format in\nboth scenarios. Also, for LoRaWAN, sensor data packets are coded\
    \ according to the LoRa PHY\nformat and encrypted according to the AES algorithm\
    \ determined by the LoRaWAN standard.\nFor Generic LPWAN, plain sensor data is\
    \ transmitted directly to the receiving end, which is\nalways an MQTT broker.\
    \ There is a sizeable diﬀerence in the payload generated by SenSE in the\nconﬁgurations\
    \ with LoRaWAN and generic LPWAN. With LoRaWAN, SenSE sends ChirpStack a\nJSON\
    \ over MQTT message with information about the emulated LoRa modulation in addition\
    \ to\nthe actual encrypted payload, composing a message of 314 bytes. In the conﬁgurations\
    \ without\nLoRaWAN, SenSE sends an Ultralight 2.0-structured MQTT 65-byte message\
    \ to the IoT Agent,\nsigniﬁcantly smaller than the LoRa message\n•\nS1-Thing and\
    \ S2-Mist: the SenSE simulator abstracts L1-Device in both S1-Thing and S2-Mist\n\
    for all conﬁgurations. In other words, since our experiments are controlled and\
    \ performed in a\ntestbed, L1-Device is not present, except for the LoRa PHY format\
    \ that is generated by SenSE,\nin order to understand the real eﬀect of ChirpStack.\n\
    •\nChirpStack: an open source LoRa server composed of two main components, the\
    \ ChirpStack\nNetwork Server and the ChirpStack application server. Both communicate\
    \ via MQTT with each\nother and with sensors and actuators, as well as platform\
    \ components, e.g., FIWARE IoT Agent.\nAlso, they use Redis and PostgreSQL as\
    \ databases.\n•\nWAN Emulation: to emulate the network link between the fog and\
    \ the cloud, we used a WAN\nemulator (WANem) with 45 ms of latency and 5 ms of\
    \ jitter. We deﬁned the parameters to input\nin the WANem through a simple experiment\
    \ performed the ping command to a VM located in the\nAmazon cloud in São Paulo,\
    \ sent through 4G.\n•\nInfrastructure:\nexperiments were performed in an OpenStack-powered\
    \ private cloud.\nAs experiments were in a testbed, they are not inﬂuenced by\
    \ other virtual machines running in the\nsame physical servers. VMs for cloud\

    \ per minute for the\nsmart city scenario. Each experiment took 2 min with 30\
    \ replications, totalizing 36 h.\n4.3. Metrics\nThe experiments collected two\
    \ categories of metrics:\n•\nElapsed Time: The average time taken since a sensor\
    \ data point is generated by SenSE until the\nconsumer receives it. This metric\
    \ represents how long it takes for sensor data to be available to\nany subscribed\
    \ application. We present the Thing-to-Cloud Elapsed Time that encompasses the\n\
    end-to-end path taken by data from its inception by SenSE in S1-Thing up to its\
    \ consumption in\nS4-Cloud, and Thing-to-Fog Elapsed Time speciﬁcally for conﬁgurations\
    \ C1 and C2 that contains\nan L4-Model Consumer application in S4-Cloud.\n•\n\
    System metrics: CPU and RAM usage per Docker container, which allows observing\
    \ each\ncomponent, located in S3-Fog or in S4-Cloud, collected every 5 s.\n5.\
    \ Performance Analysis: Results\nFigure 7 summarizes the key results of Thing-to-Cloud\
    \ Elapsed Times for smart agriculture and\nsmart city for the six conﬁgurations\
    \ C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6. The bars ﬁlled with horizontal, diagonal\nand zigzag\
    \ patterns mean that the experiments did not ﬁnish correctly due to higher workloads,\n\
    even after numerous repetitions. Also, conﬁguration C1 did not run at all for\
    \ smart agriculture with\n1500 messages per minute-15,000 sensor probes-as VMs\
    \ always failed shortly after the beginning of\nthe experiments.\nComparing both\
    \ scenarios, we can observe that smart city (Figure 7a) had a slightly better\
    \ result,\nespecially for the highest workload of each scenario. Those results\
    \ show that the components tested\nperformed better with messages arriving in\
    \ bursts-event-driven sensors-instead of messages arriving\nwith a constant ﬂow-time-driven\
    \ sensors. Notably, conﬁgurations, including LoRaWAN (C1, C4, and\nC5), achieved\
    \ higher scalability than the ones with generic LPWAN. Besides performing its\
    \ intrinsic\nfunction, ChirpStack works as a cushion for sensor data and softens\
    \ message spikes. Regarding an\noverall comparison of the experiments using LoRaWAN\
    \ (conﬁguration C1, C4, and C5) and generic\nLPWAN (conﬁguration C2, C3, and C6),\
    \ it can be noted that for lower workloads ChirpStack adds\nabout 200 ms to the\
    \ processing, since more software components are needed for addressing issues\n\
    such as security and authorization.\nSensors 2020, 20, 84\n17 of 24\n \nFigure\

    \ did not finish correctly due to higher \nworkloads, even after numerous repetitions.\
    \ Also, configuration C1 did not run at all for smart \nagriculture with 1500\
    \ messages per minute-15,000 sensor probes-as VMs always failed shortly after\
    \ \nthe beginning of the experiments. \n \n(a) Smart Agriculture (time-driven\

    \ highest workload (1500 messages per minute), only\ntwo conﬁgurations ran up\
    \ smoothly to the end of the experiments without failing, namely C4 and C5.\n\
    This result was not expected since C6 failed, and it is the lightest conﬁguration\
    \ in terms of the number\nof software components that are placed in the robust\
    \ VM in the cloud. Nevertheless, both scenarios\nhighlight the stability and scalability\
    \ of conﬁgurations C4 and C5, mainly due to the improved data\nﬂow control of\
    \ ChirpStack. On the other hand, when the workload is placed directly on the IoT\
    \ Agent,\nthe experiment fails, e.g., C6.Conﬁgurations C1 and C2 use a heavy fog,\
    \ where the Consumer uses\ndata directly in S3-Fog, allowing applications to process\
    \ part of the data closer to the user and thus to\nrespond to changes in real-time.\n\
    In Figure 8, we see that for C1, most of the time budget is elapsed up to S3-Fog,\
    \ whereas for C2,\nthe time to reach and process data in the cloud dominates the\
    \ path for both scenarios. This behavior\ncomes from the ChirpStack processing\

    \ and scalability. Some findings are worth \nhighlighting: \n• \nThe LoRaWAN IoT\
    \ Agent located at S3-Fog crashes in configuration C1 with the high workload \n\
    for the smart city scenario due to spikes in CPU usage as depicted in Figure 9.\
    \ A few seconds \nafter a certain threshold of messages per second is reached,\
    \ the CPU usage goes up to 100%, and \nFigure 8. Device-to-Fog elapsed time for\

    \ components, located both in S3-Fog and\nS4-Cloud, which helped us to understand\
    \ the behavior of the elapsed time metric. In all experiments\nthat did not ﬁnish\
    \ correctly, the cause was a failure in IoT Agent. However, it is relevant to\
    \ notice\nthat we used two diﬀerent implementations: (a) a specially developed\
    \ LoRaWAN IoT Agent; (b) the\nFIWARE oﬃcial Ultralight 2.0 IoT Agent. Although\
    \ both play the same role in converting IoT protocols\ninto NGSI JSON and share\
    \ the same programing language–JavaScript using Node.js–they diﬀer in\nterms of\
    \ performance and scalability. Some ﬁndings are worth highlighting:\n•\nThe LoRaWAN\
    \ IoT Agent located at S3-Fog crashes in conﬁguration C1 with the high workload\n\
    for the smart city scenario due to spikes in CPU usage as depicted in Figure 9.\
    \ A few seconds after\na certain threshold of messages per second is reached,\
    \ the CPU usage goes up to 100%, and this\ncomponent presents a type of instability\
    \ similar to a phase transition, leading it to crash soon after\n341 s of the\
    \ experiment.\n•\nThe Ultralight 2.0 IoT Agent located at both S3-Fog and S4-Cloud\
    \ crashes in conﬁgurations C2,\nC3, and C5 with the high workload for the smart\
    \ agriculture scenario due to a linear and constant\nincrease in memory usage.\
    \ Figure 10a shows it keeps allocation memory up to 239 s and crashes,\nwhich\
    \ corresponds to the CPU usage of MongoDB, and also Orion, at S4-Cloud. Figure\
    \ 10b shows\nthat after the IoT Agent crashes, the CPU usage of MongoDB drops\
    \ from more than 70% to almost\nzero after 40 s. In other words, the crash of\
    \ the IoT Agent in S3-Fog is instead a consequence of\nanother performance bottleneck\
    \ located at S4-Cloud. The service time of the IoT Agent is shorter\nthan the\
    \ joint service time of Orion and MongoDB so that the former queues messages waiting\
    \ for\nHTTP REST requests to be answered by the latter. In other words, the IoT\
    \ Agent waits for a TCP\nACK packet to free the memory allocated for the messages.\
    \ As the message ﬂow is constant in the\nsmart agriculture scenario, the memory\
    \ allocated by the IoT Agent increases boundlessly up to a\npoint the operating\
    \ system fails to provide more space, and it crashes. The high usage of CPU by\n\
    MongoDB does not aﬀect the performance of the platform since the IoT Agent crashes\
    \ before the\ndatabase starts to present signiﬁcant problems.\n•\nChirpStack is\
    \ a well-developed and stable software component that adequately uses system\n\
    resources. The combined CPU Usage of all individual components that make up ChirpStack\n\
    was around 40% for high workloads and 6% for low workloads, whereas the sum of\
    \ memory\nusage was approximately 30 MB for high workloads and 22 MB for low workloads.\
    \ Except for\nC1, all the conﬁgurations that crashed during the experiments were\
    \ not based on LoRaWAN and\nconsequently did not use ChirpStack. We conclude that,\
    \ in addition to performing his LoRaWAN\nfunctions, the ChirpStack also works\
    \ as a cushion for sensor data that softens message spikes that\nprevent IoT Agent\
    \ to queue too many messages.\nSensors 2020, 20, 84\n19 of 24\n•\nThe smart agriculture\

    \ and C5 ran to the end of the experiment, and C3 was the only one\nwith LoRaWAN\
    \ that faced problems. This behavior indicates that the system can better handle\n\

    \ Also,\nthat directly aﬀects the critical application metric to determine the\
    \ duration of data transfer (elapsed\ntime) from its inception in S1-Thing by\
    \ SenSE to its consumption in S4-Cloud by the consumer. Also,\nour results show\
    \ that individual software components have diﬀerent scalability behaviors that\
    \ may\nchange when they are connected to each other.\nThe complexity in understanding\
    \ diﬀerent tradeoﬀs complicates the choice of particular\ndeployment conﬁgurations\
    \ for speciﬁc IoT smart applications. In those cases, the help of an expert\n\
    on the IoT platform will be required to correctly identify the most suitable set\
    \ of components and\nconﬁguration deployment for each scenario, considering typical\
    \ workloads, as well as characteristics\nand constraints of the infrastructure\
    \ and applications.\nWe believe that our concepts related to\narchitecting and\
    \ deploying IoT smart applications, together with the practical performance analysis\n\
    results, increased the understanding and awareness involved in the development\
    \ and operation of\na new breed of IoT-enabled systems. However, there is still\
    \ the need for automating the process of\napplication deployment, not only the\
    \ static procedures for conﬁguring and installing an application\ninto the stages\
    \ of IoTinuum, but also the dynamic analysis which may generate consequent system\n\
    reconﬁgurations. The issue of static and dynamic conﬁguration is currently an\
    \ open research question.\nOur experiments revealed that FIWARE general enablers—in\
    \ their current version—are not\ndesigned for higher workload applications, which\
    \ is a paradox because IoT Platforms should be\nintrinsically able to deal with\
    \ thousands or millions of sensors simultaneously. When a FIWARE-based\nIoT platform\
    \ is submitted to a workload of 1500 messages per minute, the system crashes due\
    \ to the\nmalfunctioning of the Ultralight IoT Agent. As IoT smart applications\
    \ must handle a large number of\nconnected devices sending messages continuously,\
    \ 25 messages per second should not be considered\na workload high enough to cause\
    \ the system to fail. Therefore, even though Orion is considered a\nstable component,\
    \ its joint use with the IoT Agent produces a bottleneck that puts a ceiling in\
    \ the\nsystem scalability. This problem was not identiﬁed before in the literature\
    \ because most FIWARE-based\nimplementations are not deployed in large-scale scenarios–i.e.,\
    \ thousands of devices connected, as they\nfocus on simple examples with just\
    \ a few sensors, which does not stress the system enough to detect\nsystem bottlenecks.\
    \ The scalability of IoT platforms—–FIWARE, in our case—to support the operation\n\
    of applications using thousands or millions of sensors is another open research\
    \ question.\nWhen it comes to the six conﬁgurations analyzed in our experiments,\
    \ we conclude that all of them\nhave a practical use, depending on requirements,\
    \ characteristics, constraints, and workload of smart\napplications and deployment\
    \ scenarios. For example, in a scenario with stricter constraints on low\nlatency,\
    \ e.g., the smart city scenario for automated traﬃc lights, LoRaWAN powered by\
    \ ChirpStack\nmay not fulﬁll the demand. Also, such a conﬁguration may require\
    \ data to be consumed in the\nfog (S3-Fog), in order to avoid the latency of the\
    \ network link between the edge device (S1-Thing)\nand the cloud (S4-Cloud). On\
    \ the other hand, in smart agriculture, usually, there is no need for low\nlatency.\
    \ However, in some agriculture frontiers such as in the countryside of Brazil,\
    \ highly unstable\ninternet connections between S3-Fog and S4-Cloud are still\
    \ common. Thus, application uptime can\nbe increased, if it can survive to disconnections\
    \ from S4-Cloud by processing simpler models in\nS3-Fog, e.g., conﬁgurations C1\
    \ and C2 where Orion and consumer are placed in S3-Fog. Increasing the\nunderstanding\
    \ and awareness of design choices and best practices for deploying layered IoTecture\n\
    components into staged IoTinuum is an open research question.\nConﬁgurations C3\
    \ and C4 rely on a lightweight S3-Fog only for communication purposes,\nsince\
    \ they have no way of consuming data locally. This choice lies in the fact farm\
    \ infrastructure\nand connectivity with the Internet may be harnessed, but the\
    \ local server installed in S3-Fog may\nSensors 2020, 20, 84\n21 of 24\ncontinuously\
    \ be under a low workload, so that its resources may be used in some creative\
    \ ways, such\nas load balancing. This behavior was observed in the experiments\
    \ with C4, which achieved better\nresults compared to C6, where everything is\
    \ processed in S4-Cloud. However, the opposite happened\nwith C3, due to the poor\
    \ scalability of IoT Agent. Therefore, using up idle capacity in S3-Fog requires\n\
    careful analysis and an improved understanding of the behavior of speciﬁc software\
    \ components. The\ntradeoﬀs in using fog resources are another open research question.\n\
    6.2. IoT Architectural Layers vs. Deployment Stages\nIoTecture architectural layers\
    \ paired together with IoTinuum deployment stages provide a simple\nand unambiguous\
    \ way to bind software, hardware, and communication components to physical\ninfrastructure\
    \ in an IoT context. The physical location where a software component is executed\
    \ has\na high impact on the performance and brings diﬀerent tradeoﬀs, as revealed\
    \ by our performance\nanalysis results. IoT smart applications have their speciﬁc\
    \ characteristics and peculiarities regarding\nthe location of physical infrastructure—stages\
    \ S2-Mist, S3-Fog, and S4-Cloud—compared to traditional\nWeb-based distributed\
    \ applications.\nThere is no direct association between speciﬁc layers and stages,\
    \ even though some choices make\nfor sense than others. For example, components\
    \ from layers L2-Transport, L3-Data, L4-Model, and\neven L5-Service can be deployed\
    \ into an intermediary stage, such as conﬁgurations C1 and C2 that\nplaced L2-Transport\
    \ to L4-Model components into S3-Fog. On the other hand, all of them can be\n\
    executed in S4-Cloud, such as conﬁgurations C5 and C6. Also, if S3-Fog implements\
    \ a lightweight fog\nwith no local L4-Model, there is no way to consume data locally\
    \ from an edge device. Conﬁgurations\nbased on lightweight S3-Fog for communication\
    \ only are not able to consume data locally or decrease\napplication latency,\
    \ avoiding long internet delays. However, they can still be used for load balance\n\
    purposes. Also, we evaluated conﬁgurations where ChirpStack is deployed in S3-Fog\
    \ and S4-Cloud.\nEven though it could be installed in S2-Mist, we do not consider\
    \ it a stable solution, since the mist node\nmay not adequately fulﬁll the performance\
    \ and reliability requirements of IoT smart applications.\nApplications requiring\
    \ strict compliance with low latency—such as smart city applications—should\n\
    be designed having in mind layer L4-Service deployed in stages S2-Mist or 3S-Fog,\
    \ as data can be\nconsumed locally, thus, faster. On the other hand, for applications\
    \ with an unstable connection between\nS1-Thing and S4-Cloud—e.g., smart agriculture\
    \ applications—there is the need to store and process\ndata in an intermediary\
    \ stage, for increased uptime. Thus, such applications should have L3-Data\ncomponents\
    \ running in S2-Mist or S3-Fog. Here we presented some preliminary insights related\
    \ to the\ndeployment of layered components into staged locations, and further\
    \ research is necessary to provide\nmethods, mechanisms, algorithms, and best\
    \ practices to avoid the need of a specialist and allow an\nautomated deployment\
    \ process.\n6.3. Limitations and Future Work\nThis article does not exhaust the\
    \ subject of designing IoT architectures and using them to guide\nand support\
    \ the deployment of software, hardware, and networking components over distributed\n\
    locations. Examples of limitations of this article that are left as future work\
    \ include: (a) evaluating the\nperformance of components located in higher layers,\
    \ i.e., L4-Model and L5-Service; (b) automating\nthe deployment process, and;\
    \ (c) using diﬀerent technology sets. The performance analysis of higher\nlayer\
    \ components has not inherent challenges, though the results would be highly dependent\
    \ on\nspeciﬁc applications. On the other hand, we have already started to develop\
    \ an automated process\nfor application deployment, both for generating static\
    \ conﬁgurations at installation time, but also for\ndynamic on-the-ﬂy adaptation.\n\
    The set of IoT platforms and LPWAN technologies used in the performance analysis\
    \ study was\nﬁxed. Whereas FIWARE is a well-known IoT platform with a large user\
    \ base, other ones might reveal\ndiﬀerent results and trade-oﬀs, such as InterSCity\
    \ [60], Konker [61], and ThingsBoard [62]. As for\nLPWAN technologies, our study\
    \ only focused on LoRaWAN due to the do-it-yourself approach that\nSensors 2020,\
    \ 20, 84\n22 of 24\nfacilitates installing and using it. On the other hand, experimenting\
    \ with NB-IoT and SigFox with\na large number of sensors will require the development\
    \ of realistic emulation platforms based on\nextensive measurements with these\
    \ LPWAN technologies to capture their behaviors. Besides, other\nopen-source LoRaWAN\
    \ servers, such as the one provided by The Things Networks, could be compared\n\
    with ChirpStack.\n7. Conclusions\nAlthough IoT architectures play an essential\
    \ role in the design of distributed smart applications,\nthe development of IoT\
    \ platforms derived from these architectures and their deployment into\nreal scenarios\
    \ yield diﬀerent tradeoﬀs and thus require an improved understanding. We proposed\n\
    a layered IoT architecture (called IoTecture) whose components are mapped to stages\
    \ of an IoT\ncomputing continuum (called IoTinuum) in diﬀerent deployment conﬁgurations.\
    \ A performance\nanalysis study with six conﬁgurations revealed that diﬀerent\
    \ deployment conﬁgurations of layered\ncomponents into staged locations generate\
    \ diﬀerent hardware and software bottlenecks that aﬀect\nsystem performance and\
    \ scalability. Scalability problems that aﬀect FIWARE components under high\n\
    workloads were revealed.\nAuthor Contributions: I.Z., A.H., and D.S. designed\

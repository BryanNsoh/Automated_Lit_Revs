  description: Here, we describe a novel device for programming and replenishing water
    transpired by potted plants. To test the robustness of the system, vines were
    subjected to progressive water stress (WS), the severity of which was maintained
    in relation to transpiration (Tc) of well-watered (WW) plants. Throughout the
    40-day experiment, water supply in the WS treatment was progressively lowered
    to 70, 50, and 30% of WW Tc prior to rewatering. During the same stages, mean
    Tc of WS plants was 74, 48, 28, and 93% that of WW plants. Linear relationships
    between vine transpiration and water supply during the 40-day experiment (R2 =
    0.95 for WW and 0.94 for WS) confirmed the reliability of the system in providing
    a water supply that closely tracked measured transpiration. The emptying volume
    of the cylinder t ank was set at 265 m L and proved to be adequate for daily water
    losses, which ranged from ~300 to 2300 mL. In addition to relieving operators
    of laborious and time-consuming manual irrigation, the system provides the ability
    to adjust water supply to actual water use as measured concurrently in a grapevine-enclosure
    system and enables customization of the water supply according to the size and
    transpiration potential of each vine.

    Here, we describe a novel device for programming and replenishing water transpired
    by potted plants. To test the robustness of the system, vines were subjected to
    progressive water stress (WS), the severity of which was maintained in relation
    to transpiration (Tc) of well-watered (WW) plants. Throughout the 40-day experiment,
    water supply in the WS treatment was progressively lowered to 70, 50, and 30%
    of WW Tc prior to rewatering. During the same stages, mean Tc of WS plants was
    74, 48, 28, and 93% that of WW plants. Linear relationships between vine transpiration
    and water supply during the 40-day experiment (R2 = 0.95 for WW and 0.94 for WS)
    confirmed the reliability of the system in providing a water supply that closely
    tracked measured transpiration. The emptying volume of the cylinder tank was set
    at 265 mL and proved to be adequate for daily water losses, which ranged from
    ~300 to 2300 mL. In addition to relieving operators of laborious and time-consuming
    manual irrigation, the system provides the ability to adjust water supply to actual
    water use as measured concurrently in a grapevine-enclosure system and enables
    customization of the water supply according to the size and transpiration potential
    of each vine. chamber systemwater supplytranspirationpotted vines As traditionally
    rainfed viticultural regions experience more frequent, temporary summer drought,
    in-depth knowledge about the adaptation of grape genotypes to varying severity
    of water deficit is needed. In Italy, comprehensive surveys of the response of
    certain genotypes to water stress have been performed for a few varieties, especially
    Sangiovese and Montepulciano (Merli et al. 2014, Palliotti et al. 2014), but little
    is known about this subject for most varieties. This knowledge gap has adverse
    consequences for several reasons: (i) typically, when supplemental irrigation
    must be introduced in areas that have no previous experience with irrigation management,
    overuse is common, leading to obvious overirrigation and vine imbalances; (ii)
    gaps in knowledge about genotype-related vine water requirements and responses
    to water stress make it difficult to gauge the level of water deficit the plant
    can withstand without compromising grape yield and quality but while restricting
    excessive vegetative growth; and (iii) if direct measurements of soil or plant
    water status (i.e., predawn or midday leaf water potential) cannot be made, decisions
    about if, when, and how to irrigate are made according to empirical methods such
    as visual observation of vines. A second issue is the choice of field versus pot
    studies, each of which has advantages and drawbacks. An advantage of field studies
    is that they are unbiased toward mature and fully productive experimental vines
    with no apparent root restrictions. However, in environments marked by variable
    summer rainfall, it is likely that severe stress will not occur in any given year
    unless a labor-intensive treatment, such as covering the berm early in the season
    to limit rainfall infiltration, is applied (Poni et al. 1994). Another major concern
    is that due to erratic root distribution in vineyards, targeting a given fraction
    of evapotranspiration replacement as the ratio of absorbed-to-delivered water
    is difficult. Site-specific assessment of vine water use is feasible using methods
    such as field lysimeters (Williams et al. 2003), sap-flow techniques (Ginestar
    et al. 1998), and trunk-diameter variation (Intrigliolo and Castel 2007), although
    these methods are time-consuming and allow only a limited number of vine replicates.
    We chose a pot study because: (i) stress can be induced and relieved easily without
    interference from the surrounding climate; (ii) actual vine water use can be determined
    gravimetrically prior to water stress, thus allowing precise control of stress
    severity; and (iii) the use of pots assures that all water supplied is available
    for root uptake. The proposed system is a “closed-loop” process in which the operator
    defines a general control strategy, after which the control system determines
    when and how much water to apply based on feedback from one or more sensors (Zazueta
    et al. 1993). In this type of system, feedback and control occur continuously.
    The majority of commercial microirrigation closed-loop control systems base irrigation
    decisions on sensors that measure soil moisture status (water potential or volumetric
    water content), use climatic data to estimate plant water use, or use a combination
    of these approaches. Systems that base decision making on plant water status are
    less common than those that use soil water status; a broadly marketed example
    is the Dynagage Flow32-1K Sap Flow system (Dynamax Inc., Houston, TX) in which
    the closed loop is established through a pump controller programmed to continuously
    deliver actual transpiration volumes as scanned through sap-flow readings (Van
    Bavel 1992). Our aims in the present study were to (a) describe a new, custom-built
    system for running fully automated long-term water-deficit trials on potted plants
    by embedding a whole-canopy gas-exchange apparatus and a device for programmed
    water replenishment; (b) provide examples of the kinds of datasets the system
    can deliver; and (c) assess whether the automated water supply maintains soil
    and vine water status under the expected conditions. Materials and Methods Water-supply
    apparatus The new water-supply device is embedded in the whole-canopy gas-exchange
    system described in detail by Poni et al. (2014). The system can concurrently
    monitor up to 12 chambers, and the switching interval is set at 90 sec. Figure
    1 shows schematic and actual views of the automated water-supply apparatus, and
    Figure 2 shows the electrical wiring of the solenoid valve control system to the
    AM64 multiplexer. Items and relative costs needed to configure the system to measure

    of components and relative current costs (USD) for assessing vine transpiration
    by gravimetric or whole-canopy gas-exchange methods. Material and equipment quantities
    are calculated for a system that accommodates 12 potted vines and an ambient reference.
    The core of the system is the cylinder tank (Figure 1, component 4), which is
    programmed to deliver water to the vine based on real-time measurements of vine
    transpiration. In brief, the system set-up, functioning, and operations are as
    follows: (i) the volume of water contained in the tank is determined by the length
    of shaft run (5) × the cylinder cross-section. Acting on the adjustable shaft
    dead end (8), the tank volume (6) to be loaded and delivered at any watering event
    can be set from 10 to 460 mL; (ii) when solenoid valve 3 is commanded to open,
    valve 2 is manually regulated so that water pulled under pressure from the urban
    pipeline fills the tank in ~15 sec; (iii) when valve 3 is shut off and one of
    the solenoid valves is concurrently opened (11), valve 10 is manually regulated
    so that the cylinder tank is pushed by the spring and shaft (9) to empty in ~40
    sec; (iv) valve 3, the function of which is to fill the tank, is controlled by
    a Darlington transistor (item A in Figure 2) connected to the data logger through
    control line C4; (v) each of the 12 solenoid valves on the bench (11) is controlled
    by another Darlington transistor (item B in Figure 2) that functions to deliver
    water to each pot; cycling activation of the solenoid valves (11) is accomplished
    by the multiplexer AM416 via the control line Com H2 connected to the C3 clamp
    on the data logger (Figure 2). In summary, each watering event is activated by
    the following three steps: (1) the data logger activates the opening of valve
    3 for 20 sec to allow filling of the cylinder from the urban pipeline; (2) the
    data logger deactivates valve 3 and waits for 0.5 sec; (3) the data logger activates
    the opening of one of the solenoid valves on the bench (11) and waits for up to
    50 sec until the cylinder tank driven by the springs (9) returns to its initial,
    normally closed condition. The first decision required is the working volume of
    the cylinder tank, which must initially be set by the operator at a value between
    10 and 470 mL and adjusted against the expected total diurnal vine transpiration.
    Volumes that are too small must be avoided because a significant proportion of
    the supplied water would evaporate from the soil surface and thus be unavailable
    for root absorption. Moreover, depending on the soil texture and infiltration
    rate, a low-volume supply may wet only the upper part of the root system. Conversely,
    when used under low vine-water demand, volumes that are too high may result in
    only one application per day, thus increasing diurnal soil-moisture fluctuations.
    Here, daily vine transpiration varied between ~300 and 2300 mL depending on the
    severity of the water deficit, and the volume of the cylinder tank was set at
    265 mL. The system operates on the principle that the daily water supply to the
    vines can be replaced based on concurrent measurements of canopy transpiration.
    This makes water replenishment sensitive to large fluctuations in water use, which
    can occur depending on evaporative demand (e.g., cloudy days with low air vapor
    pressure deficit [VPD] versus clear days with high VPD) or as a result of new
    leaf development. For a water stress (WS) experiment, the system can be programmed
    to supply a group of plants with a specified fraction of the water delivered to
    a well-watered (WW) treatment. The replenishment coefficient that sets the fraction
    of water to be metered to WS can be adjusted according to prestress transpiration
    rates of each vine so that, for example, a more vigorous WS plant will receive
    more water than one with lower vigor. Plant material and treatment layout Data
    for system testing were derived from a water-stress experiment conducted in 2014
    on twelve 2-year-old nonfruiting Vitis vinifera L. cv. Sangiovese grafted on SO4
    rootstock and grown outdoors in 40-L pots. The pots were filled with a loam soil
    with 41% sand, 39% loam, 20% clay, pH 8.02, and organic matter content of 1.22%.
    Water content by volume, calculated after Saxton and Willey (2005) based on soil
    texture and organic matter, was 26.3% for maximum pot capacity and 12.9% for wilting
    point. Pots were painted white before the trial to limit radiation-induced overheating,
    and each vine was fertilized twice (one week before and two weeks after budbreak)
    with 5 g of Greenplant (15% N, 2.2% P, 20.7% K + 1.2% Mg + micronutrients) (Green
    Has Italia, Cuneo, Italy). Four shoots per vine were allowed to grow from the
    two 2-node spurs retained at winter pruning. Shoot growth was directed upward
    along the catch wires to fill all available space while providing optimal light
    exposure and minimizing mutual shading. Twelve vines of vertically positioned
    shoots were arranged along a single, 35° NE–SW-oriented row and randomly assigned
    to a WW or WS treatment. All vines were kept well watered until day of year (DOY)
    174 (23 June) by supplying 1950 mL/vine daily, which corresponded to the actual
    mean canopy transpiration (Tc) measured by the whole-canopy system over the four
    days before beginning restricted irrigation. Starting on DOY 175, a progressive
    water deficit was imposed on half of the vines by programming the water-supply
    system to deliver 70% of WW Tc to each vine until DOY 183. From DOY 184 to DOY
    196, the supply was reduced to 50% of WW Tc. Maximum stress (30% of WW Tc) was
    applied from DOY 197 to DOY 199; rewatering with 100% of Tc was performed on DOY
    200 (19 July). During water stress, the pot surface in both treatments was covered
    with a plastic sheet to prevent infiltration of rainfall and to minimize losses
    due to soil evaporation. Gas-exchange and vine measurements Whole-canopy transpiration
    measurements were taken using the multichamber system described above. The chambers
    were set up on each vine and operated continuously (24 hr) from DOY 171 (20 June,
    4 days before beginning the stress treatment) until DOY 209 (28 July, 9 days after
    rewatering). The flow rate fed to the polyethylene chambers (0.602 m3 ± 0.060)
    was set at 10 L/s and was kept constant throughout the measuring season; a complete
    volume air change occurred at intervals of ~60 sec. Tc (mmol H2O/sec) was calculated
    from flow rates and water vapor differentials after Long and Hallgren (1985).
    Upon dismantling the system on DOY 208, the vines were entirely defoliated and
    the surface of each blade was measured in the laboratory with a leaf-area meter
    (LI-3000A; LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). Progression of water stress was monitored by
    measuring predawn leaf water potential (Ψpd) on DOY 169, 184, 188, 197, 200, and
    209. Measurements were taken before sunrise on three leaves per vine using a Scholander
    pressure chamber (Model 3500; Soilmoisture Equipment Corp., Santa Barbara, CA).
    On DOY 184, 188, 197, and 200, the chambers were snipped for quick access to the
    foliage and then were immediately resealed with transparent tape. Statistical
    analysis The degree of variation around means was given as standard error (SE).
    Linear regression analysis was used when appropriate. The SyStat Software (San
    Jose, CA) was used. Results and Discussion There was a close linear relationship
    between vine transpiration and water supply for the 40 days of measurement data
    (Figure 3). Deviation from the 1:1 relationship was between 3 and 6%, and root
    mean square error was 72 mL for WW and 127 mL for WS. Such a close relationship
    confirms the reliability of the system for supplying vines with a volume of water
    that closely tracks measured transpiration. As the severity of the water stress
    increased from 100% to 70%, 50%, and 30% of WW, the actual fraction of water supplied
    to WS vines was 102% (average of prestress and rewatering), 67%, 46%, and 26%,
    respectively; these rates indicated that under water deficit, the system tended
    to deliver slightly less water than the defined threshold. This suggests that
    at the low daily transpiration rates recorded for WS plants (~300 to 1000 mL/vine),
    a slight reduction of the cylinder tank operating volume would be advisable. However,
    as shown in Figure 3, the defined threshold of 265 mL per watering event was well
    suited to the 400 to 2300-mL range of vine transpiration values. These metering
    rates are low compared to those measured in the field (Williams et al. 2003) because
    of the small canopy size of our vines, which had a final leaf area of 1.55 ± 0.107
    m2 (WW) and 1.48 ± 0.077 m2 (WS). Specific transpiration rates calculated over
    the rewatering period when all vine canopies had reached full size were ~0.8 L/m2·day,
    a value close to those measured by Poni et al. (2014) and Palliotti et al. (2014)
    under comparable conditions. Download figureOpen in new tab Figure 3 Relationship
    between daily canopy transpiration measured by the chambers and daily vine water
    supply for the well-watered (•) or water stressed (○) treatments. Data are single
    daily values averaged from dawn to dusk during the chamber operating period (DOY
    171–209). Linear equations: WW, y = 1.068x, R2 = 0.95; WS, y = 0.974, R2 = 0.94.
    Slopes of single regressions of WW and WS data did not differ according to the
    test of equality of slopes (p = 0.05). The dashed line indicates the 1:1 relationship.
    Clearly, reliability of the system also depends upon accurate assessment of canopy
    transpiration, its driving factor. Close correlations have also been found between
    gravimetric daily vine water loss and canopy transpiration calculated by gas exchange
    on vines with final leaf area ranging from 3 to 14 m2 (Poni et al. 1999, 2014).
    Given that whole-canopy gas-exchange systems are sophisticated and specialized,
    the automated water-supply device easily fits with other methods, including gravimetric,
    heat-balance sap flow, and trunk diameter measurements. Predawn leaf water potential
    (Ψpd) progressively decreased with the gradual reduction of the Tc fraction supplied
    and reached its lowest value (≅ −0.8 MPa) toward the end of the 30% Tc replenishment
    (data not shown). A steep decrease in Ψpd occurred when the water supply in WS
    was lowered from 50 to 30% of WW. One week after rewatering on DOY 200, Ψpd of
    previously stressed vines promptly recovered to the same level as that of the
    WW vines (−0.1 MPa). The experimental period (DOY 171–209) had notably variable
    weather, with large fluctuations in average daily PAR and VPD (Figure 4A). Overall,
    stable weather with conditions conducive to high evaporative demand occurred only
    at the end of the 50% Tc deficit period and for 3 days during 30% Tc. The seasonal
    trends of canopy transpiration measured in WW and WS reflected these fluctuations,
    and average Tc during the prestress, 70, 50, 30%, and rewatering supply levels
    was 103, 74, 48, 28, and 93% of the Tc rates recorded in WW, respectively. Thus,
    despite day-to-day variability, the restriction in water use was fairly proportional
    to the severity of the imposed shortage, indicating that the system worked properly.
    The Ψpd value (−0.8 MPa) reached at the end of the stress cycle confirms that
    the system is suitable for short-term water deficit experiments in which progressive
    water stress is applied to vines. Download figureOpen in new tab Figure 4 (A)

    incoming PAR. There were 7.5 watering events that yielded a total of 1987 mL water
    supply versus the cumulative daily Tc value of 1897 mL. In WS, the Tc trend was
    slightly more variable throughout the day, during which 3.5 watering events provided
    927 mL of total supplied water versus a cumulative Tc value of 975 mL. Download

    Vertical bars indicate SE (n = 6). Conclusions A new system designed to perform
    automated, unattended water-deficit experiments on potted plants was successfully
    tested. In addition to exempting operators from laborious and time-consuming manual
    irrigation, the system has the ability to calibrate water supply according to
    actual water use measured concurrently using a vine-enclosure system, and it can
    customize the water supply according to plant size and transpiration potential.
    If a whole-canopy gas-exchange apparatus cannot be put in place, the system is
    preconfigured to log signals from a set of scales that can measure gravimetric
    vine water loss. This equipment would be valuable for automating trials examining
    genotype response to drought, a subject for which data are needed given the effects
    of global warming on grapevine water relations. Footnotes Received September 2014.

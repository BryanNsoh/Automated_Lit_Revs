    Yusoof Ismail1 1 Dhofar University, Oman Abstract Internet of things has acquired
    attention all over the globe. It has transformed the agricultural field and allowed
    farmers to compete with massive issues they face. The aim of this paper is to
    review the various challenges and opportunities associated with the applications
    of internet of things in agricultural sector. This research makes use of secondary
    sources that have been gathered from existing academic literature such as journals,
    books, articles, magazines, internet, newsletter, company publications and whitepapers.
    Applications reviewed in this research are about crop sensing, mapping and monitoring
    the croplands pattern, managing and controlling with the help of radio frequency
    identification and real-time monitoring of environment. Some of the challenges
    that were taken into consideration for reviewing the applications of internet
    of things are software complexity, security, lack of supporting infrastructure
    and technical skill requirement. Complexity in the software has to be rectified
    in order to support the IoT network. Therefore software must be developed as user-friendly
    for improving the farming, production and quality of the crop. Security is the
    major threat in the IoT applications. Security has to be enhanced through proper
    access control, data confidentiality and user authentication. Technical skill
    is required for farming to enhance the organizational abilities and to perform
    the farming functions, solving problems and more. Proper supporting infrastructure
    can be developed with proper internet availability and connectivity. Some of the
    opportunities were taken for reviewing the applications of internet of things
    are low power wireless sensor, better connectivity, operational efficiency and
    remote management. Journal of Computer Science Volume 14 No. 2, 2018, 132-143  DOI:

    Internet of Things (IoT) and smart computing technologies have revolutionized
    every sphere of 21 st century humans. IoT technologies and the data driven services
    they offer were beyond imagination just a decade ago. Now, they surround us and
    influence a variety of domains such as automobile, smart home, healthcare, etc.
    In particular, the Agriculture and Farming industries have also embraced this
    technological intervention. Smart devices are widely used by a range of people
    from farmers to entrepreneurs. These technologies are used in a variety of ways,
    from finding real-time status of crops and soil moisture content to deploying
    drones to assist with tasks such as applying pesticide spray. However, the use
    of IoT and smart communication technologies introduce a vast exposure to cybersecurity
    threats and vulnerabilities in smart farming environments. Such cyber attacks
    have the potential to disrupt the economies of countries that are widely dependent
    on agriculture. In this paper, we present a holistic study on security and privacy
    in a smart farming ecosystem. The paper outlines a multi layered architecture
    relevant to the precision agriculture domain and discusses the security and privacy
    issues in this dynamic and distributed cyber physical environment. Further more,
    the paper elaborates on potential cyber attack scenarios and highlights open research
    challenges and future directions. A Roadmap of Cybersecurity Research and Challenges

    and Motivation According to the United Nations (UN), the world population is expected
    to exceed 9 billion people by 2050, growing by almost a third of the current population
    [1], [2]. Such an increase in the population demands a boost of almost 70 percent
    in the food production rate, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization
    of the United Nations.1 This rapidly growing population also introduces a variety
    of other problems such as increasing competition and exploitation of land, water
    and other natural resources. These issues present an urgent need to reduce the
    dependence of food system on our environment. Consequently, the need for an evolutionary
    agricultural paradigm to keep up with growing demand of food and crop production
    is necessary to guarantee a sustainable development [3]. Smart farming technologies2
    and precision agriculture3 [4] are gaining more attraction for their potential
    to fulfill such an increasing demand and meet global food supply needs. Smart
    farming technologies involve integration of technology and data driven agriculture
    applications to increase crop yield and quality of food products. There are numerous
    smart farming use cases [5]–[7] present globally indicating the impact of this
    new paradigm of practicing agriculture. As an example, the use of remote sensors
    placed in the soil for measuring blueberry irrigation in Chile has reduced the
    volume of water used in farming by 70 percent [8]. In India, farm data has been
    used to predict and prevent crop diseases, which reduced the risk associated with
    the failure of crop production [9]. Similar data driven approaches have helped
    fruit farmers in Slovenia effectively fight against pests.4 Smart farming, however,
    goes beyond primary production. In fact, it has impacted the complete food supply
    chain, by employing big data analytics to provide useful insights about the entire
    farming process [10] by facilitating real-time operational decision making, and
    revolutionizing existing agriculture business models. Smart farming enhances conventional
    farming practices by introducing on-field smart sensors and devices. These sensors
    and devices work in a synergistic manner to provide efficient farming experiences,
    as well as, an improved crop yield. Although beneficial to the productivity of
    the industry, the use of heterogeneous, internet-connected devices has exposed
    potential cyber attacks and vulnerabilities in the agriculture sector. These attacks
    introduce the ability to remotely control and exploit on-field sensors and autonomous
    vehicles (tractors, aerial vehicles, etc). Potential agricultural attacks can
    create an unsafe and unproductive farming environment. For example, exploits that
    have the ability to destroy an entire field of standing grown crops, flood the
    farmlands, over spray pesticides using smart drones, etc. can cause unsafe consumption
    as well as economic deterioration. Such attacks in a large coordinated manner,
    also referred to as agro-terrorism [11], also have the potential of disrupting
    the economy of an agriculture-dependent nation. A report [12] released by the
    U.S. Department of Homeland Security extensively elaborates various cyber threat
    scenarios in precision agriculture, further emphasizing the need for research
    in this critical domain. The Agriculture industry adds 6.4 percent of the world’s
    economic production with a total of $5,084,800 million.5 Agriculture, food, and
    related industries contributed $1.053 trillion to U.S. gross domestic product
    (GDP) in 2017.6 At the same time, United State’s farms contributed $132.8 billion
    of this sum which is almost 1 percent of GDP. Agriculture contributed 1.2 % to
    the European Union’s (EU) GDP in 2017 whereas EU’s agricultural industry added
    gross value of EUR 188.5 billion in 20177 at a record high. Out of 226 countries,
    nine countries have agriculture sector as the dominant sector in their economy.
    The U.S. food and agriculture system has a total economic impact of $7.06 trillion8
    and one-fourth of the overall jobs in the country are connected to it. Most countries
    globally export agricultural products. As a result, cyber vulnerabilities can
    have a significant impact on global food security. A sophisticated agro-terrorism
    attack on a (large) exporting country like the U.S. could harm the health of millions
    of consumers world-wide. In addition, attacks could reduce confidence on domestic
    consumption and destroy the United State’s status as a trusted food exporter.
    A report released in 2018 by the Council of Economic Advisors,9 “The Cost of Malicious
    Cyber Activity to the U.S. Economy” suggests the agriculture sector as one of
    the 16 critical infrastructure sectors that are important to both the U.S. economy
    and national security for which cyber protection is particularly important. It
    also reported that the agriculture sector experienced 11 cyber incidents in 2016.
    According to the World Health Organization,10 420,000 people die every year from
    food-related illnesses and 600 million people fall ill as a result of food contaminated
    with bacteria, viruses, toxins or chemicals. A cyber attack on the food ecosystem
    targeted at farms, transportation system, or food processing industrial control
    systems (ICSs) may increase these numbers exponentially. Other important industries
    like energy, financial or healthcare have understood the need for resilient infrastructure
    and have hardened their defenses. However, the food and agriculture industry is
    still a low hanging fruit for threat actors. Food Protection and Defense Institute
    (FPDI) at the University of Minnesota has discovered that food industry ICSs may
    be distinctly vulnerable to cyberattacks.11 Food industry operations technology
    personnel, in particular, those responsible for operating and maintaining ICSs,
    are experts trained in food and production safety production and not in cybersecurity.
    This presents a huge gap between employing smart farm technology and securing
    it correctly and persistently. If not continuously monitored, cyber attacks on
    smart agriculture technologies can have grave implications on several stakeholders
    in the ecosystem. These groups include farmers, end consumers, food processing
    industries, agriculture co-operatives, livestock, government agencies and nations
    critically dependent on agriculture. Figure 1, shows an end to end interaction
    among various entities involved in smart farming ecosystem. Physical sensors and
    livestock in the field generate data and receive command operations via user applications.
    These on-farm devices are connected to gateway supported edge nodes, which help
    enable in-farm device communication, filter sensor data and real time agronomy
    analytics. At the same time, data lakes in the cloud hold a large amount of data
    and information including but not limited to, environmental information (e.g.
    soil moisture level and fertility status), monitoring information (e.g. sensors
    and smart machinery status), energy management data, and other sensitive information.
    In terms of security and data privacy, it is needless to say that manipulation
    and leakage of such data, as well as the impairment of physical equipment and
    software systems, can induce serious consequences. FIGURE 1. A model of end-to-end
    interaction between various stakeholders in smart farming. Show All Extensive
    research on secure IoT devices [13]–[15], smart vehicles [16]–[19], drones [20],
    [21], edge cloud [22]–[24], wireless communication [25]–[27] is already available
    and might be extended to the smart farming ecosystem. However, most of the time,
    research is conducted on these technologies without consideration of the environment
    they are used. The dynamic smart farming environment, has unique characteristics
    such as farm equipment, labor sharing, and operational decisions, influenced by
    environmental conditions. Domain specific issues such as like location, user skill
    set, insider threats, generated data, need smart-farming-specific security mechanisms.
    The development of smart farm technologies therefore, demands further research
    before wide adoption in the community. The current state of the art and our review
    (discussed in Section V) on smart farming, demands further research in security
    and privacy aspects of this evolving domain. As the research, on cybersecurity
    for smart farming is in its infancy, our objective in this review is to provide
    a holistic view of cybersecurity developments in smart farming. In this paper,
    we discuss current threats, analyze potential cybersecurity attacks, review the
    existing scattered security research, and summarize open research challenges in
    the smart farming field as illustrated in Figure 2. FIGURE 2. A roadmap of cybersecurity
    research and challenges in smart farming. Show All This paper has the following
    key contributions: It provides an overview of smart farming focused multi-layered
    architecture, highlighting multiple entry points and communication across layers.
    It identifies potential cybersecurity issues in smart farming and illustrates,
    scenario specific cyber attacks, which have been categorized into data, network,
    supply chain, and other common attacks. It presents an extensive evaluation of
    the current cybersecurity research, countermeasures in smart farming, and also
    enlists the focus, contributions and weaknesses of current research works. It
    provides a clear view of the open security research challenges in different areas
    including next generation network security, trustworthy supply chain and compliance,
    adversarial machine learning and AI, and access control, trust and information
    sharing. The remainder of this paper is as follows. Multi-layered architecture
    for smart farming is discussed in Section II. Section III elaborates security
    and privacy issues, whereas Section IV discusses different attacks on the smart
    farming ecosystem including the supply chain side. Existing research and state
    of the art in smart farming security is discussed in Section V. Section VI highlights
    open research challenges and possible approaches to solutions. Finally, Section
    VII draws conclusion to this research paper. SECTION II. Smart Farming Landscape
    & Architecture Figure 3, depicts a multi layer architecture for the smart farming
    ecosystem. The proposed architecture adapts and extends widely discussed IoT and
    Cyber Physical System (CPS) multi-layer architectures [28]–[31]. These architectures
    recognize the use of cloud and edge services, and the infinite capabilities provided
    by them to fully harness the data generated from smart devices at the physical
    layer [32]–[37]. Our smart farming architecture, also reflects different user
    applications which can be envisioned at various layers. It also considers, vast
    amounts of data collected at edge or cloud layers, and highlights the need for
    various multi-cloud or edge-cloud scenarios. Overall the architecture consists
    of four layers: Physical layer, Edge layer, Cloud layer, and Network Communication
    layer. The latter spans across all three previous layers and connect them. FIGURE
    3. Multi layer smart farming architecture. Show All A. Physical Layer The bottom
    layer in the architecture comprises of real physical sensors and gateway devices
    which are spread across agriculture farms or in greenhouse buildings. These devices
    include drones flying in the air, autonomous tractors, sensors embedded in livestock,
    or hub devices installed to provide communication among smart objects or with
    a central cloud. These devices are responsible for data sensing and based on the
    information gathered, help in actuating other devices to realise various smart
    farming use cases. They collect real time information about weather conditions,
    soil moisture level, or cattle’s body temperature, which can be sent to the edge
    or cloud supported intelligent decision making systems to provide recommendations
    and enable automation. For example, data gathered from soil moisture sensing device
    in the field, after getting processed in the edge or cloud, can help in determining
    the amount of water needed at the farm, optimize irrigation schedule and offers
    a convenient experience to the end farmers. B. Edge Layer This layer is near to
    the end-users and end-devices for local real-time computations and decisions.
    It reduces the computation load off the centralized cloud layer and also the network
    load. Edge computing layer consists of multiple edge nodes. Each node represents
    a gateway that include services such as: data capturing, security monitoring and
    detection, prediction and real-time decision support. Data capturing services
    include, data aggregation, filtering, encrypting and encoding of real-time data
    streams. Prediction services usually rely on machine learning models trained on
    the central cloud and deployed on the edge layer. They are used to predict and/or
    categorize certain events related to plant or livestock such as, prediction of
    crop yield, categorization of plants or livestock health, predictions about the
    amount of fertilizer and water needed for a patch of land, so as to maximize yield,
    or estimating soil erosion. Security monitoring and detection mechanisms can be
    deployed for real-time monitoring of anomalous events and classifying these events
    as malicious or benign. This includes services like, anomaly detection and device
    failures prediction. C. Cloud Layer Precision Agriculture (PA) and cloud computing
    paradigms offer advances to enhance PA connectivity. The cloud layer is generally
    virtualized in data centers and communicates with the other layers using the Internet.
    Generally, these cloud layer platforms follow the Platform as a Service (PaaS)
    architecture model where the users can focus on running applications and importing
    their data. The PaaS provider runs and maintains a data broker that collects data
    being pushed in from the edge layer and saves these records in a Distributed File
    System (DFS). This stored data is used by analytic software to mine knowledge.
    This data analytics component computes insights and these are pushed to the end
    user through a client application running on the users’ machine. Popular farm
    equipment manufacturers like, John Deere,12 Farmers Business Network,13 etc. have
    created several cloud based products that help users monitor various sensors and
    vehicles used on a farm. These PaaS systems generally run on popular cloud computing
    platforms like Amazon Web Services,14 Google Cloud,15 etc. The way these farming
    PaaS systems are built using these popular cloud computing platforms also introduce
    various security challenges in smart farming ecosystem. D. Network Communication
    Layer The common theme for most, if not all, current technologies is “connectivity”.
    With a growing need for a boundary-less Internet, the idea of a network of smart
    devices has become a reality. This concept, known as the Internet of Things (IoT),
    allows connected devices to be monitored, controlled, and shared data among each
    other. This data can be analyzed and used by multiple applications. In smart farming,
    as shown in Figure 3, the network layer not only facilitates edge and physical
    layer connectivity, but also provides an interface for them to interact with the
    cloud layer. From exchanging soil temperature through a peer-to-peer sensor communication
    system, to sending farm monitoring data to the cloud data stores through high
    speed mobile networks such as 5G [38], or updating the farmer about corp quality
    via a wireless adhoc topology [39], network layer offers a means of communication
    to bind all other layers. Network layer has two main responsibilities in a smart
    farming system. Firstly, there are diverse set of heterogeneous devices in every
    layers of a smart farming system. The network layer provides a secure and efficient
    network stack where, wire, wireless and mobile sub-networks can communicate in
    a compatible and cross-layer manner. The second responsibility of the layer is
    to preserve connectivity and therefore, increase availability. From bigdata processing
    systems used to analyze collected data to individual sensors that collect information
    from the field, this layer is needed for system-wide cyber communication. Real
    World Smart Farming Use Cases: The proposed smart farming architecture is constructed
    based on multiple literature and real world smart farming use cases. It can be
    viewed as a general smart farming architecture that satisfies most of the use
    cases. However, it should be noted that not all use cases will include all four
    layers as proposed in the architecture. Blackhills Farm in New Zealand, a 400-hectare
    property with over 2000 cattle and 800 sheep, has adopted the use of SCADAfarm16
    system which allows the owners to remotely monitor water and energy consumption,
    location of irrigators, soil moisture measurements and real-time weather information.
    The farm uses Schneider Electrics’s EcoStuxture IoT architecture17 which corresponds
    to our physical layer and sensors. It also utilizes Microsoft Azure18 IoT suite
    with communication provided by the Vodafone New Zealand cellular network which
    corresponds to the cloud and network layer in out framework. Similarly, a 7,000-acre
    farm at Beltsville Area Research Center, was developed by the United States Department
    of Agriculture (USDA) to act as a testbed for smart farming technologies. The
    farm was equipped with a physical layer including sensors, drones and IoT-enabled
    farm equipment for a public-private program called Farmbeats [5]. The farm adopts
    a two-layer hybrid network: a layer based on TV White Spaces [40] technology for
    connectivity over long range which connects the farmer’s home Internet connection
    to IoT base stations on the farm, and a layer based on Wi-Fi technology which
    connects smart sensors to the IoT base stations. Such IoT base stations (gateways)
    are equivalent to the edge cloud layer (Figure 3) in our proposed general architecture.
    Additionally, the data collected at the IoT stations are pushed to the cloud layer
    which employs AI algorithms for data analysis. Another usecase is a revolutionary
    step towards smart crop health monitoring. A group of researchers19 along with
    local farmers are developing a distributed airborne monitoring system to detect
    possible zones of crop damage or nutrient deficiency at a 492-acre farm in in
    North Carolina, United States. In order to accommodate rapidly-growing food demands
    and increase the quality and quantity of agricultural production, it is necessary
    to improve farming management practices and technological developments in agricultural
    fields. Accordingly, unlike traditional crop management methods that use farmers
    or ground vehicles for assessing crop health status, this collaborative smart
    farming project is using autonomous technology to perform aerial monitoring of
    agricultural fields to save time and money, while preventing damage to crops.
    In this project, a group of drones which monitor the field are working in the
    physical layer, as depicted in Figure 3. Drones communicate with each other through
    network layer, using which they also send collected data and images to land processing
    bases (i.e. the edge layer in our proposed architecture) for initial data cleaning
    and pre-processing. Finally, pre-processed data is sent to the cloud layer for
    storing and knowledge extraction functionalities. SECTION III. Security & Privacy
    Issues The adoption of sensor based technologies and cloud supported smart applications
    in agriculture has unleashed opportunities for adversaries to orchestrate cyber
    attacks. Therefore, it is important to first understand major security and privacy
    issues in smart farming domain before discussing specific cyber attacks. In this
    section, we will elaborate these issues in detail followed by attacks in the following
    section. A. Data Security & Privacy In a smart farm, an enormous amount of complex,
    dynamic and spatial data gets generated from many heterogeneous sensors, devices
    and equipment. Leakage of such information either through unauthorized access
    or by an insider can cause potential threats. For example, leakage of agriculture
    anti-jamming devices information can help an attacker bypass these security measures,
    while leakage of soil, crop, and agriculture purchase information can cause severe
    economic losses to farmers, if such information is used by competitors or hostile
    actors. On a larger scale, aggregating important agricultural information on a
    particular country is also a potential threat. As such data security and privacy
    is a very important requirement and one of the primary objectives to ensure the
    reliable operation in a smart farming ecosystem. Data on the Edge: Smart farms
    leverage Internet of Things (IoT), state-of-the-art communications (e.g., 5G),
    and artificial intelligence. Such systems mostly require fast response times,
    than those of a traditional model in which data is transmitted to a centralized
    data center (e.g., cloud) for processing and results are returned to a user. As
    such, the need of edge cloud is on the rise. Although moving data processing and
    analytics to the edge enhances agility and efficiency, to say the least, it also
    imposes huge security risks due to the increased attack surface primarily because
    of the highly diverse use of IoT devices which are usually not built with security
    in mind. This gives attackers an easy entry point to the network since remote
    access to the edge layer, in most cases, is essential. Additionally, finding the
    IP addresses of edge endpoints become an easy task especially when considering
    websites like Shodan,20 a search engine for all IoT connected devices. Beside
    directly compromising IoT devices or edge endpoints to gain access to the smart
    farm network, an indirect attack to compromise third parties is also a potential
    risk. As an example, smart farms often use third party agronomy analytics to analyze
    the collected data which can be used in many research areas such as plant biology
    and genetics, agriculture economy, supply forecasts, and disease predictions.
    Those parties might be given direct access to smart farm data on the edge for
    real-time analytics. An attacker might phish for such third parties, compromise
    their systems and inject malicious software to redirect the data sent to external
    servers for data theft. Such attacks are very hard to detect, since attackers
    are using legitimate stolen third party credentials. B. Authorization & Trust
    In smart farming applications, connected entities including autonomous tractors,
    flying drones, on field sensors etc. communicate and interact with each other,
    and issue command and control operations to provide automated and efficient experience.
    Such communication can be direct machine to machine or via a cloud or edge assisted
    network which can support Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT21), Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP22) or other IoT communication protocols. In either
    case, it is essential to ensure that the messages are sent from a trusted authorized
    entity, rather from a malicious adversary. This exchange of information, like
    moisture level of soil, information about crop yield, cost of fertilizer, or sensitive
    data about the livestock like health, current location, breeding decision information
    and other farm related private data sent to the cloud or to a third-party application
    must be authorized by the owner of the field or a concerned party. Livestock are
    important part of agriculture, and a big component of a farmer’s income. Sensors
    can be embedded in the cattle [41]–[43] which can monitor their health and can
    be used to remotely inject medicines or enable preventive actions from a doctor.
    Even in case of livestock purchase, buyer can be given temporary access to the
    data of an animal they are interested in, which can help them analyse it before
    purchase. As these animals are kept in monitored environments, remotely controlling
    the temperature or making adverse conditions in barn can affect the yield of animals,
    and can also result in epidemics and widespread disease. Over the air (OTA) updates
    for the equipment’s firmware must be from a trusted party, a bad software patch
    received for a critical agriculture equipment can curtail a farmer from using
    it at the needed time of harvesting and planting. Cross cloud and multi cloud
    trust models [44], [45] are needed when entities associated at different cloud
    providers interact and access data remotely. In case of a mechanic trying to diagnose
    an engine of an autonomous tractor, or a doctor trying to access data of a cattle
    located in a private cloud, trust levels need to be established so as to enable
    such access. Several access control models have been proposed for IoT [46]–[58]
    like systems, however their feasability in dynamic smart farming is still to be
    investigated. Proper authorization is needed for a farmer to issue a command,
    to a smart water sprinkler, or to fetch the latest readings from a soil moisture
    sensor. Farm rivalry can exploit such connectivity to the sensors, and may flood
    a farmer’s field, or make it parched. Usually in farms, labor is hired on a temporary
    basis mostly at the time of harvesting and sowing, therefore, temporary access
    to smart equipment can be delegated to on field workers for non-critical operations.
    It may be the case that a critical operation, like running an autonomous tractor
    on the field, or flying a drone over the field to spray pesticides may need multi
    level authorization. C. Authentication & Secure Communication One of the most
    important aspects of security and privacy in smart farming is authentication of
    connected devices. Devices need to be authenticated first in order to get connected
    to various services on a smart farming system. They are usually low power devices,
    with limited processing power, memory, and storage, so legacy public-key infrastructure
    (PKI) authentication mechanisms cannot be considered as feasible solutions. Alternatively,
    secure lightweight multi-factor authentication protocols which are offered as
    a service [13], [59] are more realistic solutions in a smart farming network environment.
    In fact, an intermediary Certifying Authority (CA) can facilitate the authentication
    of a connecting device [60]. Such authentication mechanisms do not consume devices’
    limited resources for authentication processing, but also unauthorized devices
    will be prevented from connecting and accessing the network in an efficient way
    [61]. Moreover, devices may sometime join or leave different layers of a smart
    farming ecosystem. This entails dynamic authenticated mechanisms that apply authentication
    on demand to ensure that only legitimate devices are allowed to have access to
    different services spanning over different layers. Providing end to end secure
    communication in a smart farming setting requires securing the communication between
    devices in a particular layer and also securing the inter-layer communication
    [62]. While cryptography-based solutions prove their effectiveness in securing
    both intra-layer and inter-layer communications, employing them on constrained
    IoT devices is a big concern. There are, however, limited attempts to apply lightweight
    cryptography solutions to a smart farming ecosystem [14]. Additionally, quantum-based
    cryptography for a secure end to end communication for IoT devices is under active
    investigation [63] as a futuristic solution. However, the feasibility of such
    solutions have not been evaluated in real world scenarios. D. Compliance and Regulations
    Smart farming and precision agriculture raises various legal issues, which remain
    partially unanswered. The following are some of the major issues in this area.
    1) Contracts and Agreements A smart farm involves different parties like the farmers,
    the cloud service providers, the networking infrastructure providers, to name
    a few (See Section II). These different parties need to negotiate and agree on
    various parts of contracts [12], [64]. These contracts include data privacy, security
    and intellectual property protection clauses. Data protection is essential for
    the development of smart farms and is a major part of these contracts. Such contracts
    between interested parties are crucial to protect the value and confidentiality
    of the data as an important asset. Farmers who use smart farming tools also need
    to negotiate in advance finer elements of these contracts. For example, which
    party shall be responsible in case data processing and analysis lead to wrong
    decisions affecting different downstream tasks in the pipeline. Another important
    contractual element example is the decision involving use of self-driving tractors,
    which are subject to the set of obligations applicable to self-driving cars. In
    this scenario, strong compensation and limitation of liability clauses may help
    the farmers. 2) Data Security and Privacy Farmers who deploy smart infrastructure
    fear that their data might be stolen by competitors or be publicly released. Hence,
    data security is crucial and agreements with technology providers should include
    specific clauses. Although most smart farming techniques process non-personal
    data, linking of such information to a particular personally identifiable information
    (PII) poses serious concerns [12], [64]. For example, data of livestock directly
    referring to their owner; crops conditions linked to farmers’ personal details.
    In this case, privacy clauses should be included to prohibit personal data processing
    to a certain degree. Further issues may arise when smart farming equipment, such
    as drones or tractors, have the functionality to monitor their users [12], [64].
    3) Intellectual Property (IP) An important question from a compliance perspective
    is who owns the data collected on a smart farm. This is specially important as
    data privacy laws cannot solve this issue. As per the current regulatory setup,
    data itself cannot be protected, however copyright provisions can be utilized
    to achieve high level of safeguards. Most farmers include IP protection clauses
    [64] in contracts that they create with smart farming technology providers [12].
    4) Regulatory Agriculture and livestock production is a highly regulated industry.
    Various countries across the globe have many laws, regulations, and supervisory
    authorities [65]–[67]. These touch upon specific compliance requirements for producing
    and selling of products. Such compliance can be achieved easier by using smart
    farming technology that help farmers and regulators track, audit, and inspect
    every step of the production pipeline. 5) Cyber Insurance Cyber Insurance allows
    victims to protect themselves from various cyber risks. However, cyber insurance
    policies in agriculture have lagged in the coverage of cyber incidents and events.
    Most of the current available agriculture based cyber insurances are very ambiguous
    and limited in their coverage [64]. SECTION IV. Smart Farming Ecosystem Cyber
    Attacks This section elaborates possible cyber attacks in smart farming ecosystem.
    We have categorized attacks into four different classes as shown in Figure 4.
    We have discussed data specific and network specific attacks orchestrated on smart
    farms including IoT based farming sensors. We have also explored cyber attacks
    from the supply chain side to highlight the vulnerabilities as more and more systems
    get connected to the internet and generating sensitive data. FIGURE 4. Smart farming
    ecosystem cyber attacks. Show All A. Data Attacks 1) Insider Data Leakage Farmers
    fear leakage of confidential data the most among other threats as it can be used
    against them in the commodity market. An insider (like a disgruntled employee)
    can leak such data to intentionally cause harm or sell data for money. For example,
    a former engineer at Allen and Hoshall was able to access the company’s data over
    a period of two years.23 Data this employee accessed included engineering schematic,
    project proposals, and marketing information which had an estimated value of $500,000.
    2) Cloud Data Leakage Smart farming data is very sensitive and can reveal a lot
    of confidential agriculture and economic information about the entire country.
    Cloud data centers are distributed across the world and, in some instances, virtual
    machines might be placed in data centers located in different countries. Data
    might be less secure if it is stored in data centers in other countries. These
    countries could place less strict security requirements on companies. Additionally,
    their governments might also intercept or collect that data stored on servers
    within their own jurisdictions. For these reasons, countries have started adding
    laws for sensitive data localization. For instance, China has placed a new cybersecurity
    law24 into effect in 2017 stating, among other things, that personal data must
    be stored on domestic servers. As such, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon
    started taking steps to transfer control of Chinese data to Chinese firms. 3)
    False Data Injection Attack In this attack, an attacker attempts to change/falsify
    data that contributes to important real-time decisions, with the assumption that
    adversary has the knowledge of the system and its configuration. For example,
    injecting false information about the soil moisture level will result in over
    watering and, in turn, damaging the crops. 4) Misinformation Attack In this attack,
    the aim is to endanger data integrity. An attacker may release false data about
    a smart farm claiming the outbreak of a disease in crops or livestock. Such false
    data reports mimic the form of an actual report released by the targeted smart
    farm. As a result, it will take a lot of time, effort and money to prove that
    the released report is false. B. Networking and Equipment Attacks 1) Radio Frequency
    (FR) Jamming Attack In many cases, smart farming equipment rely on radio frequency
    communication, like cellular or satellite networks. A smart farming equipment
    often use global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) to improve efficiency with
    products and techniques such as path planning, auto steering, seeding and spray
    rates. GNSS is achieved by combining GPS with real time kinematics (RTK) technology
    to enhance the precision of real-time position data. Attackers may jam GNSS for
    malicious purpose by deploying many distributed low power jammers to disrupt GNSS
    over wide areas and, in turn, prevent smart farming equipment from functioning
    properly. 2) Malware Injection Attack One of the most prevalent threats to smart
    farming is malware injection attack [68], where an attacker injects a malware
    into a connected smart device. Malware is a very common threat in large scale
    systems since, in most cases, it acts and propagates through the system automatically,
    hence making it a very attractive target to attackers. Precision agriculture is
    being adopted widely, meaning that more farms are connected to the internet. Typically,
    most of these farm deployments use similar software components (e.g., usage of
    LoRa25 and ZigBee26). As a result, a malware that infects a particular smart farm
    will most likely infect other farms with similar deployments. The damage caused
    by malware comes in many shapes and types. Malware can steal information about
    the consumption of agricultural materials, purchase information of fruits, vegetables
    and livestock, data about agricultural machinery etc. It can also recruit smart
    devices as part of a botnet which will be used for committing malicious acts controlled
    by an attacker. Further, malware can hinder the functions of physical smart equipment
    which, in turn, can have a devastating effect on a particular crop harvest or
    farm area. 3) Denial of Service Attack IoT devices used in smart farming environments
    can always be used to launch large scale denial of service (DoS) attacks [69]
    similar to what happened in 2016 using Mirai botnet [70]. In that occasion, an
    army of dummy CCTVs was exploited to launch one of the biggest DoS attacks that
    happened recently. There are usually a large number of inter-connected nodes and
    groups in a farm, and thus, similar type of attacks are possible in context of
    smart farming. These attacks not only can disrupt normal functions of different
    modules in an individual farm but also can be leveraged to interrupt legitimate
    cyber services in other domains. 4) Botnet With IoT everything is capable of getting
    connected to the internet. In smart farming ecosystem, there are many IoT related
    devices at each architectural layer. These devices are prone to attacks and can
    then be controlled by a central malicious system. This forms a so called ‘Botnet
    of Things’ [71]. A zombie army of infected farm IoT devices [72] can easily be
    used to infect many other networks through different mediums and hence a smart
    farm may turn out to be an internet of vulnerabilities for cyber criminals. Smart
    farm devices are not built with security as a concern and even if they do, users
    usually neglect the basic steps of setting adequate cybersecurity defense mechanisms.
    5) Side Channel Attack Attacks which have their roots in gaining information from
    how a system is implemented rather than what weakness exists in the system implementation
    are called side channel attacks. Smart farming is one of the IoT use case and
    hence it inherits some common IoT vulnerabilities including side channel attacks
    [73]. In such attacks, there are different channels which can be exploited by
    attackers. In timing channel attacks, for example, computation time along with
    cache miss and cache hit timing patterns are among those attacks vectors which
    can be exploited by adversaries. Hardware glitching in forms of voltage fluctuations
    and variances in system clock period during execution tasks are other possible
    attack channels. Other channels for launching a successful attack are power consumption
    patterns, possible electromagnetic leaks or even sound and acoustic channels.
    C. Supply Chain Attacks The entire agriculture ecosystem and the notion of ‘farm
    to plate’ involves several entities which work in tandem to provide quality food
    to the end consumer in a just-in time environment. This supply chain system [74]
    starts from the farm, which produces raw material that, in turn, is stored and
    processed by the food industry. The processed food is packed and sent to distribution
    retailer from where the end customer purchases processed goods. With IoT technology
    at each stage of the supply chain, it introduces potential cybersecurity threats
    since a security breach in just-in-time distribution system could also have a
    serious cascading effects on the entire supply chain. The massive scale of attacks
    like WannaCry27 ransomware, and the recent spate of ransomwares in cities28 across
    the US, suggest that even a breach or data freeze at a single inter-dependent
    entity will be enough to disrupt the whole chain and possibly the economy of a
    country. An attack on the agriculture equipment and fertilizer provider companies
    could potentially disable critical connected machinery needed at a prime time.
    It could manipulate the amount of nutrients in the fertilizers [64] which could
    seriously destroy the crops rather than nourishing them. The smart devices can
    be infected by malware which are controlled and commanded remotely. In such a
    scenario, large scale attacks can be orchestrated on all the smart farms utilizing
    those compromised machinery resulting in massive disruption in the sector. Needless
    to say that the suppliers of such machinery might loose trust and confidence of
    their customers. Such smart machinery needs dynamic calibration to determine the
    distance at which seeds need to be planted or the amount of fertilizers to be
    sprayed based on historical crop data. This calibration related information is
    uploaded in the machine software over-the-air (OTA), which suggests that deliberate
    uploading of false information to the machine software can have larger scale impact.
    US Foods29 has more than 250,000 customers which purchase supplies, will be affected
    badly if US Foods IT infrastructure is hit by a ransomware or a cyber attack disrupting
    its computer assisted facility and impacting critical processes. Temperature and
    conditions under which the produce is transferred is an important factor to maintain
    the freshness of the product. Smart monitors ensure that products are processed
    and packed at appropriate temperatures. Adversaries can manipulate these sensor
    readings or issue a command to change the temperature that could result in inappropriate
    temperature conditions for produce, which can impact the end consumers as well
    as the entire supply chain. These attacks are not limited to direct stakeholders,
    but for example, contaminated water from a compromised water treatment facility
    used in irrigation can destroy the whole crop field. Even attacks on smart grid
    due to sudden surge in demand and grid overloading can result in blackout which
    in-turn can spoil the stored produce in large storage houses, inducing huge losses
    to the supplier. Blockchain30 based solutions have been proposed to ensure the
    provenance of the food products in the chain, which offers transparency and assure
    quality of the food. However, the entire cost to use this system will not be clear
    unless widely adopted [75]. Smart farming goes beyond agriculture where livestock
    sector is also considered an important part. An attack on this sector can also
    have massive disruptions, where a malicious actor can publish false data about
    a disease outbreaks or unapproved genetic modifications of crops. Similarly, sensors
    and smart devices in the buildings where these livestock are kept can be attacked
    or altered to change the temperature, which can put to harm the entire livestock
    on the farm. Also, for livestock feed products, if an IT system monitoring the
    ingredients of the feed is compromised, it can potentially lead to wide-spread
    contamination in livestock which can easily reach humans as well. D. Other Relevant
    Attacks 1) Compliance and Regulation Food production and farming are a highly
    regulated industry with different countries having multiple national agencies
    monitoring food production. In the United States, Environment Protection Agency
    [65] and the Department of Agriculture [66] enforce various regulations and industry
    standards. In the European Union, Department of Agriculture and Rural Development
    [67] undertakes this responsibility with similar authorities in other countries.
    These federal authorities issue compliance directives to ensure quality food production.
    With the advent of smart farming technology these agencies are relying more and
    more on data produced by farm based sensors. An adversary attacking a smart farm
    can specifically inject false data that will then impact various compliance certification
    processes. This certification process if invalidated, can impact a nation’s food
    supply, affect crop price, etc. The complex smart farming ecosystem, creates a
    broad attack surface that needs to be protected to ensure data integrity. 2) Cyber
    Terrorism The increased use of digital interconnected system in agriculture sector
    brings new opportunities for terrorists to attack places that previously were
    too remote or difficult to strike. Cyber terrorism is a relatively low-cost venture
    with high payoff potential, making the risks of agro-terrorism too large to ignore.
    Therefore, it is important to find solutions that guarantee trust and transparency
    within smart farming concept, as well as protect critical resources. 3) Cloud
    Computing Attacks Cloud is a very diverse, decentralized, heterogeneous and powerful
    ecosystem. The enormous amount of distributed resources make the cloud a hard
    target. However, with the introduction of new cloud concepts (e.g., on-demand
    services, auto-scaling, and self provisioning), attackers have used such resources
    in their favor and, in turn, cloud has become one of the most desirable targets
    to attacker. For example, with the introduction of auto-scaling in cloud, a large
    part of the virtual machines hosted on cloud are similarly configured. If one
    of the virtual machines is vulnerable, it is highly likely that all auto-scaled
    virtual machines are vulnerable as well. As such, a malware that infected one
    virtual machine can propagate to other virtual machines quickly. The infected
    machines can be employed as a part of global botnets which, consequently, can
    be used to launch a large scale distribute DoS (DDoS) attacks enough to hinder
    the functionality of cloud. For example, in 2018, a large scale DDoS attack was
    launched on github resulting in a record-breaking sudden traffic increase to 1.35
    terabits per second. Inevitably, DDoS attacks are becoming more frequent, more
    powerful and more sophisticated. A large scale DDoS attack with an overwhelming
    number of requests, packets or messages can deny services to smart farms, thereby
    paralyzing the brain of smart farms. Further, DDoS attacks might not be specifically
    targeting smart farms’ virtual machines. Even though, an attack might be directed
    at a different target, if virtual machines used by smart farms are on the save
    physical server, it will naturally block off other’s traffic as well. SECTION
    V. Existing Research Table 1 summarizes state-of-the-art research, challenges
    and contributions with respect to security and privacy issues in smart farming.
    We have categorized the literature into different subsections based on the focus
    areas they address. TABLE 1 Projects and Research Addressing Cybersecurity in
    Smart Farming A. Cyber Attacks, Threats and Proposed Solutions Researchers and
    federal agencies have started gauging the impact cyber-attacks as more and more
    farmers and communities are adopting technologies in the farms. The U.S. Department
    for Homeland Security released a report [12] which emphasizes the importance of
    precision agriculture (PA) and associated cybersecurity threat and potential vulnerabilities.
    The report highlights the confidentiality, integrity, and availability model of
    information security in farming. It defines different technologies involved in
    PA including in-farm devices, location and remote sensing technologies, machine
    learning, etc. It briefly discusses the impacted groups by the misuse of technologies
    in farming including farmers, livestock producers, and also industries that support
    or rely on agriculture. This report also discusses hypothetical threat scenarios
    on real life examples. Another promising work [76] highlights the vulnerabilities
    and risks due to introduction of technologies in the field of precision agriculture.
    This thesis work illustrates data collection and related empirical study, however
    falls short of security solutions in the domain. The work from Jahn [64] discuss
    implications of using smart devices in the agriculture sector. The authors make
    strong argument about how the lack of a cyber insurance framework is going to
    have a big impact on various agribusinesses. They also highlight the fact that
    a regulatory response is needed to protect the interests of farmers who adopt
    the use of smart devices. Barreto and Amaral [77] use empirical methodology based
    on the analysis of information and experiences collected in the Internet Security
    Alliance,31 the European Cyber Security Organization32 and the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology33 to highlight security challenges in smart farming.
    Some major threats discussed include security and privacy issues, social engineering,
    denial of service, cyber-espionage agroterrorism, ransomware etc. The research
    also highlights a security framework to enable farmers to better understand security
    implications. However, the paper is unable to discuss open research issues, and
    challenges to secure the environment without evidence of how the discussed attacks
    are orchestrated in the domain. Peer to Peer (P2P) is a network paradigm which
    has use cases in smart farming communication. The device authentication methods
    in this type of communication, however, rely heavily on public key infrastructure.
    Although the system is trustworthy, it puts unnecessary computation load on resource
    constrained smart farm IoT devices participating in a secure P2P communication.
    Accordingly, authors in [78] proposed a lightweight device authentication solution
    in which session keys and public keys are combined to expedite the encryption/decryption
    tasks. It results in a fast and light-weight authentication solution which is
    a good fit for smart farming communication purposes. Additionally, West [79] introduced
    a framework to understand vulnerabilities in emerging technologies and the use
    of such technologies in a smart-farming-specific environment. The framework goal
    is to quantify the degree to which the use of smart farming new technologies are
    vulnerable to cyber-attacks. It uses the common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS)
    for the threat prediction model assessment. The work shows the trade-offs between
    technology maturity and adaptation in the smart farming environment which can
    lead to system compromise. The approach in the paper uses three parameters: basic
    parameters, temporal parameters and environmental parameters for constructing
    a CVSS score. Basic parameters indicate the intrinsic and severity of a vulnerability,
    whereas temporal parameters indicate how a vulnerability might change and affect
    the system over time due to technical changes. Environmental parameters reflect
    the specifications of a vulnerability present in a smart-farming-specific environment.
    Although CVSS score has become a standard in the industry for understanding the
    severity of vulnerabilities and prioritizing their patches, it has some shortcomings.
    Smart farming is a diverse environment with many connected devices and systems.
    CVSS score deals with individual vulnerabilities and fails to accurately capture
    impact of connections within the entire system. B. Blockchain Related Research
    Recently, the usefulness of blockchain in domains other than cryptocurrency and
    financial transactions has been acknowledged [93]–[95]. Agriculture and food supply
    chain is one of the domains in which blockchain technology has shown its capabilities.
    Accordingly, the authors in [81] study overall implications, challenges and potential
    of existing blockchain-based projects in the field. Besides, it critically reviews
    maturity of such projects and elaborates on possible barriers and challenges,
    which hinder acceptability of such projects among farmers and existing cyber farming
    systems. Lin et al. [80] also focused on the use of blockchain technology for
    food safety. Authors created a system that tracks and monitors food production
    cycle, including the processes of raw materials, cultivation/breeding, processing,
    transporting, warehousing, and selling. The system also uses various IoT based
    sensors to replace manual recording and verification with sensor based verification.
    Other works [82], [84], [96] focused on providing case studies of using blockchain
    and smart contracts in smart farming. Awan et al. [82] proposed a framework based
    on IoT and blockchain technology for agriculture product tracking life cycle.
    They used smart contracts to eliminate the involvement of middlemen or third-party
    intermediaries and as such increase credibility and trust. The authors implemented
    a use case based on their proposed framework which included 120 IoT nodes and
    20 blockchain producers. Further, they validated their system based on it’s throughput
    considering different block sizes. However, this work has several drawbacks. Very
    few related works are included and comparison to other works in the literature
    is lacking. Additionally, the authors didn’t include much details about the nature
    of workload used in their experiments and they failed to add a baseline benchmark
    for the validation results for a fair comparison. Patil et al. [84] proposed a
    light-weight security framework for smart greenhouse farms based on blockchain.
    Every IoT node can elect cluster head leader which helps preventing a single point
    of failure in case an attacker targets the leader node. Additionally, the authors
    provided discussion of the security threats on their proposed framework following
    the traditional confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA) triad model
    as well as their corresponding attacks. Although, this work is interesting, the
    framework is conceptual with no implementation or experiments. Further, the paper
    didn’t include related work nor a comparison to other proposed frameworks. Besides
    proposing blockchain-based frameworks and implementations [97], real world use
    cases of blockchain in smart farming are discussed in the blockchain research
    institute article [83]. In this work, authors explore applications of blockchain
    beyond the typical financial use cases in agriculture. Accordingly, they focused
    on three classes of applications: food safety, sustainable agriculture and the
    local economy and agriculture finance. The authors accompanied each class of applications
    with real world use cases. However, these use cases are discussed on a very high
    level aspect with no implementation details or results. C. AI and Machine Learning
    Assisted Work The advent of new age technologies such as artificial intelligence
    (AI) and machine learning (ML) not only facilitate the adaptation of advanced
    analytics in smart farming, but also create an ecosystem for improving the cybersecurity
    of services. Fusion of these technologies enable farmers to achieve higher average
    yield and better price control over their products in highly competitive markets.
    Design and implementation of a low cost IoT based security monitoring system have
    been proposed by Shabadi and Biradar [85]. The system focuses on physical layer
    of smart farming where it collects data from sensors. This data is sent to a controller
    where data is analyzed to make decisions like activating the actuators for water
    sprinkler in the farms. The proposed work is focused more on implementing the
    basic functionalities of smart farming than addressing security and privacy issues.
    It is very limited to simple threshold based decisions, like, if the soil temperature
    is above a certain threshold, then activate water sprinkler. Real time security
    monitoring for a remote farm is another current application of ML in smart farming.
    In scenarios where real time monitoring and notifications are paramount to farm
    and cybersecurity, the image(s) detected through a surveillance system can be
    processed by open-source computer vision programming supported by AI. For example,
    Abuan et al. [86] proposed a neural based face recognition system which is able
    to be invariant to changes in illumination for background and illumination conditions
    through a neural network training. The agricultural and farming industries have
    been widely influenced by the disruption of the IoT. However, the impact of the
    IoT is limited in countries with less penetration of mobile internet. The boom
    of low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN) in the last decade, with technologies
    such as LoRa or NB-IoT, has mitigated this by providing a relatively cheap infrastructure
    that enables low-power and long-range transmissions. Nonetheless, the benefits
    that LPWAN technologies have the disadvantage of low-bandwidth transmissions.
    Therefore, the integration of edge and fog computing, moving data analytics and
    compression near end devices, is key in order to extend functionality. By integrating
    AI at the local network layer, referred as edge AI, authors in [87] proposed a
    system architecture and implementation that expands the possibilities of smart
    agriculture and farming applications with edge and fog computing using LPWAN technology
    for large area coverage. In another research work [88], Support Vector Machines
    (SVM) along with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are used to create an integration
    platform for big data analysis for smart farming. Such a platform not only expedites
    processing huge amounts of data collected from farms and livestocks, but also
    gives smart farming stakeholders the ability to detect and respond against possible
    cyber attacks more efficiently. D. Other Relevant Literature Chi et al. [89] present
    a framework for cybersecurity approaches in precision agriculture and discussed
    challenges of using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) in digital virtual farms. They
    also present a framework for secure data capture. Security challenges in agrifood
    sector has been extensively discussed in [90]. The report provides an overview
    of emerging technologies in smart farming. Most smart farms are data-driven with
    respect to automating agriculture processes, decision making, and predictions.
    It also raises important questions of how important is data security? How risk
    assessment is done considering the entire supply chain? Who should take responsibility
    and who should be involved? The report serves to raise awareness addressing the
    importance of cybersecurity in agrifood sector. Authors in [98] provide an overview
    of cross-section of cybersecurity in food and agriculture sectors. They also discuss
    cyber-terrorism, policies, and plans. Spaulding and Wolf [99] detail the needs
    for educating farmers about various cybersecurity threats. Authors in [100] show
    the impact of cyber attacks on smart farming infrastructure via simulations using
    NETA with OMNET++ framework. Huning et al. [101] created a system to enable privacy
    preserving crowd sourcing techniques to estimate different smart farming parameters.
    Cybersecurity perception is also changing among farmers and agribusiness owners.
    Geil et al. [91] conducted an assessment of cybersecurity practices in the United
    States agriculture industry. Insights from their work reflect that over half of
    the respondents have been victims of a computer security incident, demonstrating
    that even individuals working in agriculture can be impacted by cybersecurity
    incidents. Cyberbiosecurity [92] is a multidisciplinary domain consists of cybersecurity,
    bio-security, and cyber-physical security. It discusses how current and emerging
    information technologies affect the cybersecurity of large portion of U.S. economy
    which is based on food and agriculture (i.e. Bio-economy). As Peccoud et al. [102]
    discuss, food and agricultural sectors are immensely diverse and require advanced
    technologies and efficiencies that rely on computer technologies, big data, cloud-based
    data storage, and internet accessibility, at the same time are vulnerable to cybersecurity
    incidents. Based on our literature review, it can be emphasised that, there is
    a dearth of security related research done in smart farming domain. There are
    numerous unanswered important security questions and open research challenges
    as discussed in the following section. SECTION VI. Open Challenges and Research
    Areas This section discusses open research challenges for improving security and
    privacy in smart farming ecosystem, as well illustrated in Figure 5. These open
    problems have been divided into four subsections as follows. FIGURE 5. Open research
    challenges and future directions for cybersecurity in smart farming. Show All
    A. Access Control, Trust & Privacy Perspective The multi-layered architecture
    discussed in section II recognizes possibilities of cyber threat challenges, which
    needs to be addressed by extending and adapting current access control foundational
    research, as well as developing sophisticated access control solutions to assist
    dynamic and agile environments in cyber-physical systems like smart farms. In-farm
    and cross farm operations need authorized interaction among sensors and labor/farmers
    working at multiple farms operating different sets of smart devices. What kind
    of operations they can do must be checked, which may require single level or multiple
    level access control depending on the risk factor associated with the operation?
    For example, consider sowing the field with autonomous tractor as compared to
    turning ON an irrigation system during the rainy season. Delegation and revocation
    of access rights to operate on a farm must be automatically performed based on
    the contract agreement, for example, in case temporary labor hired during harvesting
    season. Such access control requirements need further investigation to be adopted
    in such dynamic environment. The notion of trust can also be developed where labor
    who has worked earlier or an equipment borrowed from a ‘known’ old friend may
    have higher trust level as compared to machine and manpower hired from co-operative
    market. Self-configurable AI assisted smart access control policies need to be
    developed in a sharing-dominated CPS domain like smart farming. Cyber physical
    systems introduce the notion of virtual objects (which can be created in cloud
    or edge environment) corresponding to real physical sensors. An important challenge
    here is the location of cyber entities created as a part of connection with cloud
    or edge environments, for example, AWS device shadows34 or Microsoft Azure device
    twins.35 Research needs to determine: a) how cyber entity will move from one cloud
    (or edge) to another if the corresponding device is borrowed from one farmer to
    another? b) how the control of virtual entities will be delegated to the lending
    farmer, whether both the farmers need to use same application? c) how the applications
    will allow to delegate access for machine operation? d) Can the virtual objects
    or equipment across farms communicate with each other, whether at the physical
    level or using the virtual entities? If it is the virtual entity across different
    accounts in the same cloud provider, how such interaction will take place? In
    case it is across different cloud providers, how cross cloud and federated cloud
    environments will ensure such trust levels? Suppose in case a farmer has borrowed
    an equipment from a friend farmer, will the original owner be able to have access
    to it, or the access will be completely revoked? Is it possible to control a device
    through different remote clouds? All are relevant questions in smart farming domain.
    Further, how to establish trust mechanisms among different cloud service providers
    which the farmer is using for services and alerts? Manufacturer of the device
    may hold digital twin [103] and the cloud used by farmers will get data from on-field
    sensor and the cloud provider via pre-defined and signed negotiations. Such negotiations
    can also define what kind of data will be shared with required permissions of
    the owner farmer. Another important question is, how to establish trust between
    physical sensor objects? One approach is sensors at the same farm trust each other
    more for the shared information as compared to sensors across different farms.
    IoT and CPS specific cross cloud access controls and related security models are
    still in infancy stage and need more attention. Livestock and animals also have
    sensors embedded, which require appropriate authorized access. However, current
    literature does not provide strong access control mechanisms that can restrict
    such operations and secure critical data sharing from cattle and livestock at
    the farm. These wearable and health monitoring devices are attached to livestock
    and collect sensitive data, which can be used by adversaries to control the animal
    or even effect the sale/purchase of a cattle, for example, having the information
    about which cow is having low milk production. Efficient access controls [104]–[106]
    are needed to safeguard such sensitive data in cloud, which needs more research
    considering the spate of breaches heard every now and then. Usually in case of
    wearable IoT devices, a human which has the device controls what kind of data
    he/she wants to be shared. However, it is not in case of livestock which has a
    master (like the owner of the farm or caretaker) to decide control. Also, as a
    cattle is sold/purchased and moves from one owner to another, relevant data sharing
    security policies need to be specified and will require automatically configured
    information sharing. Studies [107], [108] have shown vulnerabilities in human
    used fitness devices, however, such studies and research are still an open challenge
    in case of livestock devices. Since data is collected from smart devices spread
    across farms, different applications require to access to this data. Consequentially,
    it is important to limit the sharing of data across applications and across nearby
    friend farmers, who may also get some value or receive alerts for their farms.
    How and when to share such information requires adaptive security policies to
    control and supervise data transferred by sensors to the cloud platform. Further,
    if data is sharing across multi cloud systems, cross cloud trust also needs to
    be addressed. Appropriate attribute based fine grained access controls [109],
    [110] and privacy preserving schemes need to be deployed to ensure confidentiality
    of the data. Evidently, farmers must decide the level and type of data sharing
    needed to ensure the privacy of critical information. B. Data Perspective The
    most noticeable feature of smart farming is its communication ability between
    the smart devices, resulting in an unprecedented amount of generated data [7],
    [111]. This provides many challenges as discussed in section III and open doors
    for several research opportunities. Machine learning is an attractive solution
    for processing big data, and implementing effective security solutions. Insider
    data leakage detection has always been a daunting task as users already have legitimate
    access to the system, making it hard to detect and predict such attacks. Several
    research works have been conducted on insider data leakage [22], [112], [113];
    however, none has been targeting smart farming settings. Further investigation
    is needed to understand the possibility of adopting insider data leakage defense
    mechanisms into smart farming and whether unique characteristics of smart farming
    can help to improve these mechanisms. Smart farms are highly connected systems,
    which allow malware to easily propagate through the network infecting all interconnected
    devices. An interesting question is how to detect malware in smart farming IoT
    environment, especially considering all heterogeneous devices in place. For instance,
    a malware detection technique that works against a malware that infects smart
    farming equipment might not work against malware that infects edge or cloud systems
    since the malware’s end goal is different. Many AI assisted malware detection
    techniques [114]–[120] are proposed and used in practice; however, there are no
    smart-farming-specific malware detection techniques that consider the context
    and environment in which smart farms reside. Smart farms generate diverse and
    vast amount of unstructured data. It is almost impossible for one party to analyze
    and make use of the entire datasets. For this reason, threat information sharing
    is a viable approach for data security. For instance, each smart farm can employ
    a malware detection technique; however, it is guaranteed that none of these employed
    techniques is comprehensive enough to catch all types of malware. Information
    sharing between smart farms can prove very useful. It can be used as an asset
    to share threat information about attack patterns or malware that was detected
    by collaborating smart farms. In a similar case, if a deployed detection technique
    in a farm detected supplied water with high toxin content, it is relevant to share
    that information with nearby farms who may also be impacted by similar issue.
    This can save analysis cost and money for every participating smart farm as it
    prevents doing work that someone else already did before. What kind of data, meta-data
    or analysis can be shared remains an open question and what kind of threat information
    sharing process can be used remain an open question for resource constrained farmers.
    Smart farming is an emerging field, so it is highly likely to encounter zero-day
    attacks which have not been detected before. Anomaly detection [121]–[125] is
    a very appealing solution against such attacks. Anomaly detection techniques look
    for any abnormal behavior that deviates from the pre-established database of normal
    behavior. These normal behaviour profiles are constructed based on collection
    of historical observations and patterns. Building smart farms behavior profiles
    is a challenging task since their behaviors are so dynamic in nature. External
    factors are a major reason for this dynamism. For example, less irrigation is
    needed during a rainy weather than dry weather which will cause a different behavior
    for irrigation systems. Can weather forecast information be used as an indication
    of such change of behavior? What kind of data contribute to building smart farms
    behavior profiles? Do some data fields weigh more than others? These are all open
    research questions that need to be investigated. Detection mechanisms are used
    to detect faulty and compromised sensors by monitoring the data sent for any tampered
    or abnormal values. Employing a simple threshold based mechanism can easily be
    bypassed by an attacker, so in most cases, more sophisticated machine learning
    based mechanisms need to be deployed. However, smart attackers can still bypass
    these models by (1) exploiting the sensors and a little tweaking of data sent
    by these sensors just to lead the machine learning model in place to misclassify/mispredict
    the outcome (such attack is called adversarial machine learning attack), and (2)
    poisoning the model during training phase by injecting bad data into the model’s
    training database, and in turn get it to learn something it shouldn’t. Some research
    addressed mitigation against adversarial attacks; however, it is not clear whether
    these technologies can be adopted to smart farming domain which is very dominant
    on changing environment conditions. Another open research challenge is to create
    various artificial intelligence systems that collect and parse Cyber Threat Intelligence
    (CTI36) about smart devices, software, cloud systems etc. used in the smart farming
    ecosystem. These systems have been developed to collect CTI in other areas [126]–[129]
    and need to be extended to ensure coverage of various smart farming devices, equipment
    and software. C. Network Perspective Cybersecurity threats to smart farming and
    its devices include a diverse range of security risks due to certain characteristics
    of the underlying networking and communication technologies which are used in
    the domain. First, both virtual and physical communication environments get connected.
    Many IoT devices in a smart farm system are capable of functioning on the data
    they receive from their respective environments which shortens the distance between
    virtual and physical systems. While convenient for the users, it allows cyber
    threats to convert to physical consequences more quickly, thereby having a bigger
    impact. Second, devices and layers involved in a smart farm system create a complex
    communication environment. Hyper connected farming environments exist due to the
    growing availability and diversity of IoT devices. ‘Complex’ in this context means
    that large number of devices are working in a single smart farm environment such
    that dynamic interactions between them are possible. This complexity expands the
    capabilities of an environment, but at the cost of a wider attack surface. Smart
    farming like other emerging technologies is embracing new networking paradigms
    to tackle today’s sophisticated attacks. Software defined network (SDN) [130]–[132]
    is one such promising networking revolution. Through decoupling control plane
    from data plane and giving credit to network programmable, it offers interesting
    technical capabilities to network providers. This causes an intense adaption of
    SDN in almost every fields of networking, from data center networks to WANs, wireless,
    5G and recently IoT. Using SDN in smart farm networking is attracting to both
    academia and industry for certain reasons. SDN supports both physical and virtual
    networking scenarios very well. It also offers a reliable way of practicing networking
    in highly diverse and naturally heterogeneous smart farms networking environment.
    Moreover, using SDN, smart farms are able to form a holistic view of all the connected
    devices along with how they interact in a near real time manner. Such a holistic
    view not only improves agility, scalability, and manageability of smart farm networking
    but also empowers a large smart farm network to enforce robust security counter
    measure against possible sophisticated cyber attacks. It is important to research
    further the adaptability of SDN and other 5G related next generation communication
    technologies in smart farming and precision agriculture domain. SDN can enable
    smart farms to get the most benefit out of complex machine learning and AI algorithms
    to automate network management of large number of sensors, wireless and wired
    networks used in a smart farming ecosystem. It also facilitates implementing advanced,
    cross-layer network security solutions which are very time and resource consuming,
    if not impossible, otherwise. Finally, SDN expedites edge networking and hence
    cloud-based security-as-a-service delivery model becomes a more approachable solution
    in large smart farming deployments. D. Compliance and Supply Chain Perspective
    With the ubiquitous use of sensors, automated drones, blockchain, artificial intelligence
    integration, different agricultural businesses are falling back on compliance,
    regulation and cyber insurance to protect themselves [64]. With the development
    of targeted malware and other cyber threats, the entire food supply chain is at
    risk [12], [64]. A hostile actor specifically interested in disrupting the supply
    chain can target various organizations and companies that supply raw material
    to farms or process food for the end user. A potential solution to this problem
    is to develop industry standards that enable trust between various raw material
    suppliers and downstream food processors [64]. The development of these standards
    enforced by national governments through regulation, has been slow. One example
    of such a shortcoming, is the existence of a few cybersecurity standards for the
    many smart devices used in the food supply chain. Various legislation are being
    introduced to set ‘minimal cybersecurity operational standards for internet connected
    devices’. In specific cases where various governments do not wish to regulate
    these interactions, it is up to various agriculture businesses to protect themselves
    by asking their supply chain to ‘self-regulate’ cybersecurity best practices [64].
    Such developments can be pushed through market demands, competitive pressure,
    etc. The food supply chain also lacks robust cyber insurance policies. With the
    constant development of smart applications, AI, smart farming equipment, etc.
    cyber insurance providers are unable to predict and quantify various cyber risks
    involved in these systems. Specific research needs to be done so as to develop
    standard legal jargon and metrics to quantify cyber risk in smart farming. These
    will help create robust cyber insurance markets for precision agriculture. Various
    systems [133]–[136] also need to be built to make it easier for the end users
    to understand and parse these complex legal documents, cyber insurance policies,
    agreements, contracts, etc. Research on these open challenges will help wide adoption
    of precision agriculture technologies. SECTION VII. Conclusion The proliferation
    of smart devices with communication and sensing capabilities have unleashed plethora
    of user services, and at the same time made tasks more convenient and efficient
    for humans. However, wide adoption of such internet connected devices and data
    driven applications across various domains have raised security and privacy issues,
    making these systems vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This paper discusses such cybersecurity
    challenges in smart farming and elaborates open research questions. The paper
    first outlines a multi-layer smart farming architecture illustrating different
    entities pertinent to real time use-cases supported by edge and cloud environments.
    Based on the architecture, the paper outlines security and privacy issues and
    highlights different attacks scenarios in smart farms as well as scenarios affecting
    the entire food supply chain. Thereafter, this article surveys the state-of-the-art
    research and acknowledges important works related to cybersecurity in the domain.
    Finally, the paper illustrates several open challenges and research problems pertinent
    to security and privacy aspects in precision agriculture. We envision this paper
    will simulate research to solve platitude of security and data privacy issues
    in fast growing and economically important smart farming sector. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    revolution, and the same technologies that created the Internet and are transforming
    medicine are now being applied in our farms and on our fields. Overall, this digital
    agricultural revolution is being driven by the low cost of collecting data on
    everything from soil conditions to animal health and crop development along with
    weather station data and data collected by drones and satellites. The promise
    of these technologies is more food, produced on less land, with fewer inputs and
    a smaller environmental footprint. At present, however, barriers to realizing
    this potential include a lack of ability to aggregate and interpret data in such
    a way that it results in useful decision support tools for farmers and the need
    to train farmers in how to use new tools. This article reviews the state of the
    literature on the promise and barriers to realizing the potential for Big Data
    to revolutionize agriculture. Keywords digital revolution, precision agriculture,
    economics, policy, Big Data Keywords JEL Q15, JEL Q16, JEL Q55   1.  INTRODUCTION  Data
    on farm inputs, such as fertilizer application rates, and outputs, such as yields,
    have traditionally been collected by farmers and others involved in agricultural
    production. Similarly, data on the environmental impacts of production have traditionally
    been gathered by government agencies to monitor ecological health. While data
    have always been the basis for making management decisions, the amount of data
    collected on farms through sensors like yield monitors, portable devices, drones,
    and smart phones has increased dramatically over the last decade. Not only are
    there far more data, but their form has also changed, transitioning from simple
    numerical values attached to variables (e.g., yield, water quality) to including
    more qualitative measures (e.g., type of practice, odor). Both types of variables
    are being gathered more precisely and at a highly localized scale. Excitement
    over the potential ability of the upcoming digital agricultural revolution to
    increase productivity while reducing the sector''s environmental impact has coincided
    with increased investment in agricultural data management by multinational corporations—firms
    that are typically involved in other areas of agricultural production. For example,
    Monsanto purchased the hardware and software company Precision Planting in 2012
    and subsequently purchased the weather data and modeling technology company The
    Climate Corporation the following year (Carolan 2017). In addition, DuPont has
    partnered with John Deere to provide a wireless data transfer system and then
    with the DTN company to provide market and weather information. In order to increase
    the machine-learning capabilities of its farm equipment, John Deere has subsequently
    bought Precision Planting from Monsanto and recently bought Blue River Technology
    (Lev-Ram 2017). Broadly speaking, devices for gathering data in agriculture are
    projected to grow from 30 million in 2015 to over 75 million devices by 2020 (Chi
    et al. 2017). Other entrepreneurs have followed this wave of investment into digital
    services for the agricultural sector. Despite the huge amount of interest, this
    much-heralded technological revolution has been slow to actually change agricultural
    practices (Brown 2017). For instance, whereas venture capital investments in agri-food
    have nearly doubled in each of the last two years, there has been a shift away
    from a focus on data (Pitchbook 2017). The potential benefits from Big Data remain,
    particularly if the applications are expanded to include genomics and traceability
    rather than precision agriculture alone. That said, the shift in investment suggests
    the need to take stock and consider the potential role of policy in this space.
    The purpose of this article is to review the opportunities and challenges presented
    by Big Data for the agricultural sector, with a focus on how the natural environment
    is affected by agri-food digitalization. We focus primarily on the policy issues
    arising from the development of Big Data and the associated analysis required
    to help address these policy issues. We begin by defining Big Data and its potential
    application for agriculture in developed countries across three domains: genomics,
    precision farming, and traceability. We do not extend the analysis to include
    developing countries, although their benefits from Big Data are also potentially
    large, such as through the collection of national statistics, enhanced banking
    services, and improved extension delivery (Deichmann et al. 2016, Kshetri 2016).  2. 
    BIG DATA AND AGRICULTURE 4.0  The emerging use of data in agriculture heralds
    a new digital agricultural revolution driven by a number of innovations that have
    affected manufacturing more broadly for decades (Deichmann et al. 2016). First,
    advances in robotics have allowed a far greater degree of automation than has
    previously been possible (Faulkner & Cebul 2014, Wolfert et al. 2017). Second,
    the declining cost of sensor technology has allowed farmers to monitor factors
    such as animal movement, soil health, and soil moisture in almost real-time conditions
    (Faulkner & Cebul 2014). Third, computing power to analyze these data is now sufficiently
    accessible and affordable to allow the creation of decision support tools such
    as on-tractor dashboards and mobile applications that help farmers become more
    precise with their management practices, such as with input applications (Antle
    et al. 2017, Krintz et al. 2016, Rose et al. 2016). All of this is possible because
    of emerging Big Data analytical platforms, such as cloud computing and machine
    learning algorithms, that drive artificial intelligence (Ali et al. 2016, Chen
    et al. 2014, Krintz et al. 2016, Wolfert et al. 2017). Together, these technologies
    have allowed an exponential increase in the volume, velocity, variety, and veracity
    of data generated in agriculture (De Mauro et al. 2016, Sonka 2014, Wolfert et
    al. 2017). In turn, agricultural data are rapidly becoming a major driver not
    only of innovations in output and the food chain but also in environmental management
    (Caron et al. 2014). Often defined under the broad umbrella of precision agriculture,
    agriculture 4.0 technologies refer to production systems that deploy robotics,
    sensors, and Big Data analytics to enable farmers to manage their farms on much
    smaller, and thus more precise, spatial and temporal scales (Lesser 2014, Wolfert
    et al. 2017). Although precision agricultural technologies have been in use for
    approximately a decade and generally take the form of yield monitors in cropping
    systems and robotic milking parlors for dairy, the pace of innovation in this
    field has picked up as the cost of sensors and robotics has fallen. The technological
    innovations associated with Big Data herald a potentially profound change to farming
    that, for 50 years, has been dominated by Green Revolution technologies. The Green
    Revolution was based on the introduction of hybridized seeds, irrigation, mechanization,
    and low-cost fertilizers and pesticides (Tilman 1998). These technologies had
    the effect of increasing the scale of agriculture, in essence giving farmers the
    tools to boost yields by standardizing management practices across large areas
    of land (Duffy 2009, Matson et al. 1997). The same trends occurred in the livestock
    industry where confined animal feeding operations, concentrated feeds, yield-boosting
    genetics, and mechanization have led to economies of size, resulting in significant
    increases in herds or flocks managed in essentially the same way (Weis 2013).
    As noted above, the tools of agriculture 4.0, such as robotics, sensors, and Big
    Data analytics platforms, will, when fully realized, allow farmers to be more
    precise in their application of inputs. Therefore, in many ways, agriculture 4.0
    represents a fundamentally different approach to farming than the Green Revolution.
    In particular, artificial intelligence, decision support systems, sensors, and
    robotics allow farmers the opportunity to tailor management at much finer scales.
    Ultimately, these technologies may even allow farmers to manage the needs of individual
    animals or plants in real time. For instance, smart tractors know where they are
    in the field, plant the right seed in the right place, and give it the correct
    amount of fertilizer (Gebbers & Adamchuk 2010, Ramundo et al. 2016, Wolfert et
    al. 2017). Similarly, smart livestock operations identify each animal as they
    approach a feeding station and deliver a tailor-made ration designed to meet the
    needs of that animal''s genetics, health, and life stage (Busse et al. 2015).
    In essence, the tools of agriculture 4.0 provide the equivalent of personalized
    medicine but applied to crops and livestock. The third component of these technological
    developments—the Big Data analytics platforms—underpin agriculture 4.0 and are
    therefore the most relevant for the purposes of this review. In particular, the
    vast amounts of data being currently generated on farms by the robotic milkers
    and yield monitors currently in use are useless unless those data can be curated
    in ways that can be turned into useful decision support tools for farmers (Janssen
    et al. 2017, Lindblom et al. 2017). As a result, Big Data analytic platforms will
    need to act as the backbone of the new agricultural revolution and will be essential
    to aligning and interpreting data, as well as to creating decision support tools
    that support actors across the agri-food sector.  3.  OPPORTUNITIES FOR BIG DATA
    IN AGRICULTURE AND THE ENVIRONMENT  Proponents of agriculture 4.0 suggest that
    it offers the potential for profound advances in agri-food systems in a number
    of key dimensions. ▪  First, it is expected that these technologies will speed
    up and reduce the cost of improving the genetics of our crops and livestock, not
    only by making breeding plants and animals more precise but also through novel
    technologies such as gene editing. Improving the genetics of our crops and livestock
    will have many benefits, such as providing the opportunity to develop genotypes
    that are adapted to changing local conditions. ▪  Second, these technologies will
    likely offer some farmers the opportunity to produce more food on less land with
    fewer environmental impacts, commonly referred to as sustainable intensification
    (Garnett et al. 2013). ▪  Finally, these technologies offer the potential to create
    much greater transparency and traceability in complex global food supply chains
    (Opara 2003). Each of these opportunities is discussed in more detail below. 3.1.   Genomics
    Although farmers have been breeding plants and animals since the dawn of agriculture
    approximately 10,000 years ago, recent advances in genomic technology, and in
    particular, our newfound ability to edit genes, provide us with an exponentially
    greater degree of control over the genotypes that farmers utilize without raising
    the same ethical and environmental concerns as have been common with transgenic
    organisms. In particular, cutting-edge gene editing technologies allow plant and
    animal breeders, once they have identified a plant or animal with a specific trait,
    to determine what alleles are responsible for that trait. Subsequently, by turning
    on or off relevant genes, they use gene editing technology to ensure that the
    specific trait is present or absent in future generations. This process greatly
    speeds up plant and animal breeding for specific traits, such as pest resistance
    or feed efficiency, without introducing novel genetic material into a plant or
    animal''s genotype (Ballenger et al. 2016, Goddard 2012). In essence, gene editing
    allows traditional plant breeding to proceed at a much faster pace and with far
    fewer regulatory, consumer, health, or environmental concerns. In theory, this
    technology is also much cheaper to deploy than more traditional biotechnology
    approaches [such as transgenic or genetic modification (GM)], which may offer
    the opportunity for local biotech companies serving small markets to develop tailor-made
    crop and livestock phenotypes suitable for local environments. Additionally, by
    reducing the amount of time it takes to create new plant and livestock variations,
    gene editing may also offer the ability to adapt crops and livestock more quickly
    to changing environmental conditions (Edwards 2016). In the future, where we expect
    existing farmland to be subjected to more extreme weather conditions, as well
    as changes in temperatures and precipitation, the opportunity to quickly adapt
    crops to local conditions may become extremely important. Other environmental
    benefits from genetic improvements include the possibility of introducing genes
    encoding nitrogenase directly into cereal crops, thereby giving these plants the
    ability to fix their own nitrogen from the air (Beatty & Good 2011). The associated
    reduction in fertilizer use, and thus the potential reductions in nutrient emissions
    into either water bodies or the atmosphere, could also be achieved through understanding
    how genotypic expression interacts with environmental conditions to affect traits
    and impacts such as nitrogen emissions (Ng et al. 2016). 3.2.   Precision Agriculture
    The overarching objective of precision agriculture is to increase agricultural
    management efficiency through identifying ways to tailor planting, fertilizing,
    irrigating, and pesticide applications to the spatial and temporal microclimates
    that exist on each farm. This represents a major departure from recent farm history.
    Nearly all farming systems used to be labor intensive, and farmers managed the
    unique characteristics of their small operations differently according to their
    own assessments. Since the 1940s, however, developments in mechanization, along
    with other Green Revolution technologies such as hybridized seeds and relatively
    low-cost fertilizer and pesticides, drove many farmers to increase farm size by
    replacing labor with capital. One consequence of this was that the management
    of individual farms evolved into one in which the entire farm was treated as a
    single unit with relatively uniform management practices (Sonka 2016). This has
    had the consequence of creating extremely homogenous agricultural landscapes and
    has reduced the biological, crop, and social diversity of rural North America.
    Precision agriculture, which allows for much smaller-scale management, may theoretically
    change this. On one hand, precision agriculture should facilitate a return to
    more intense agro-ecological systems that allow for an increase in heterogeneity
    across space and time on the farm by giving farmers the ability to manage at the
    level of the individual animal or within field variability. This is likely to
    increase both biodiversity and crop diversity. On the other hand, precision agricultural
    technologies tend to be very capital intensive, which may lead to continued farm
    consolidation and socioeconomic homogeneity (Wolfert et al. 2017). Although the
    benefits of the digital agricultural revolution to individual farmers will likely
    be recognized in the future, the promise of using these technologies to improve
    the environmental management of our food system is real. For instance, in livestock
    operations, many animals in any given herd typically have access to more feed
    than they can efficiently metabolize, and this results in nutrients being lost
    to the environment through manure. Similarly, it is estimated that large-scale
    crop systems in North America receive up to 50% more fertilizer than the plants
    can absorb. These surplus nutrients from both crops and livestock operations end
    up either as a source of water pollution or as a greenhouse gas (GHG) that contributes
    to global warming (Tilman et al. 2002). Therefore, one consequence of uniform
    management over a large scale and the subsequent excess input use is that agriculture
    is the world''s largest contributor to global water pollution and is responsible
    for more than 30% of global GHG emissions (IPCC 2014). Precision agriculture should
    be able to address at least some of these issues. For instance, Balafoutis et
    al. (2017) present a review of precision agriculture technologies and conclude
    that global positioning system (GPS) guidance systems combined with variable-rate
    nutrient application can help limit the number of times a tractor drives over
    a field, which will reduce GHG emissions. But despite these obvious benefits,
    it must be noted that the value of the additional information provided from precision
    agriculture relative to its cost is another likely barrier hindering its widespread
    adoption. In particular, the history of how farmers use technologies such as yield
    monitors and variable application rate fertilizers suggests a relatively flat
    payoff function for these technologies that in many cases means there is no real
    financial incentive for farmers to invest. Hence, the existing evidence points
    to extremely varied uptake. In terms of livestock, precision agricultural technologies
    that include robotic milkers and mobility trackers to identify the estrous cycle
    are becoming commonplace in dairy operations. Regarding crop production, studies
    across a number of jurisdictions ranging from Europe ( http://www.cema-agri.org/page/farming-40-future-agriculture
    ), the US Midwest (Erickson & Widmar 2015), Kansas (Griffin et al. 2017), and
    Ontario, Canada (Mitchell et al. 2018) have found widespread adoption of GPS automated
    steering systems, yield monitors, and grid soil sampling. In contrast, these studies
    found that variable-rate technologies that can apply different rates of inputs
    (such as seed or fertilizer) to different management zones across a field have
    not been adopted to the same level. The GPS technologies are referred to as embodied-knowledge
    technologies because no additional skills are required to capture their value.
    Rather, such technologies rely on the knowledge that farmers already possess regarding
    how to operate their machinery (Griffin et al. 2017). These technologies either
    simplify the work (e.g., auto-steer systems) or passively collect data (e.g.,
    yield monitors). In contrast, information-intensive technologies (e.g., variable-rate
    technologies) use data collected from the farm as input into a decision support
    system that generates a prescription for the variable application of inputs to
    reap the benefits (Griffin et al. 2017). The spatial detail captured by yield
    monitors that are now standard equipment on most combines has increased significantly
    over the last two decades. These spatial maps indicate productivity zones across
    a field based on previous years’ yields (hence, zones can vary across years depending
    on microconditions). Identifying high- and low-productivity management zones is
    useful and should help farmers turn parts of their field that are chronically
    underproductive into set-asides, while farming the highest quality zones most
    intensively. To reach such a potential, however, a decision model along with other
    soil and weather data is necessary to determine whether a high- or low-yielding
    area should receive more or less fertilizer than the uniform rate currently applied.
    By contrast, such decision support systems are not required for precision agriculture
    technologies such as GPS systems that increase the accuracy of input application
    by reducing overlap and underlap. The adoption rates of these GPS technologies
    suggest that the benefit of easier operation, in addition to the value of reducing
    input use by only applying inputs where necessary (no overlap) or of ensuring
    that all locations or animals are sufficiently treated (no underlap), is greater
    than the cost of adopting these technologies (Schimmelpfennig 2016). The difficulty
    of generating significant information value from precision technologies is illustrated
    through two conclusions that emerged from a series of studies examining why farmers
    tend to apply more than the recommended rates of fertilizer (Pannell 2006, Rajsic
    & Weersink 2008). First, the response of yield to nitrogen is flat around the
    optimum within a given year, whereas the decline in the yield is small for a large
    range of input levels around the rate that maximizes profit. Thus, while different
    spatial units could receive significantly different rates of an input, the differences
    in profit relative to applying a uniform rate are fairly small. Second, the response
    function shifts depending on the year. The temporal variation in yield to a given
    nitrogen rate is greater than the spatial variation; thus, adjusting rates from
    year to year is more important than adjusting rates within a field or even between
    fields. The value of Big Data for farmers may primarily accrue through the identification
    of problem areas for a given site or through the development of improved analysis
    derived from the integration of data across many production sites (Bennett 2015).
    The information from an individual producer can be integrated with data from other
    farmers to enhance the value of those data through the development of decision
    models such as dashboards, apps, and other software applications. Because the
    production cycles in agriculture tend to be comparatively long, there are not
    enough repeated observations from a single farm to generate a predictive model
    for that farm. However, the inclusion of variables, such as soil quality, weather
    conditions, and management practices, from a number of operations across a broader
    spatial and temporal scale than a single farm allows for a more robust analysis
    of the factors determining yield (Sonka 2016). Achieving such an integration,
    however, requires that numerous farmers use a range of different types of equipment
    to be able to aggregate and pool their data. Currently, such integration is lacking,
    which represents another likely reason why the potential environmental benefits
    of precision agricultural technologies have not been fully realized to date. In
    the future, the core of any such decision model must be derived from the data
    collected across a number of producers and will be a production function relating
    output to inputs and very specific geographic conditions. Most agricultural and
    resource economists are well versed in the importance of this technical relationship
    between inputs and outputs; a decision model would use the estimated production
    function to suggest application rates depending on the specific objectives of
    the producer. Economists are also aware that the production function is not deterministic
    but inherently stochastic. Exogenous variables, such as soil moisture, may not
    have been measured accurately at the appropriate time in the initial collection
    of the data, or they are not known when the input decision has to be made; in
    turn, a forecast must be made. Even if the variables can be observed or determined
    with certainty, the effect of these variables on production often depends on a
    number of unobserved variables. This uncertainty influences the accuracy of the
    decision model and the subsequent value of the information from precision agriculture.
    The ability to derive decision rules in agriculture with high information value
    will be highest for sectors with (a) valuable output (single animal versus single
    plant), (b) a short cycle (daily versus annual), (c) small uncertainty in production,
    (d) high within-field or between-animal heterogeneity, and (e) technologies to
    accurately and reliably measure that heterogeneity. For example, the value of
    precision agriculture will likely be higher for feed use in hog production where
    feed comprises 70% of the costs of raising a hog than for nitrogen use in field
    corn production; hence, it would be expected that the uptake of precision agriculture
    technologies would be faster among hog farmers than corn producers. Within crop
    production, the net benefits of precision agriculture for nutrient decisions will
    likely be higher for intense greenhouse-based systems than for field crop production.
    Overall, the promise of precision agriculture is more food produced on less land
    and with fewer inputs. As such, precision agriculture is one tool that farmers
    will use to sustainably intensify food systems (Garnett et al. 2013). This harkens
    back to debates around agriculture and the fate of wild nature from approximately
    10 years ago when scholars debated whether it was better for the environment to
    intensify agriculture, thereby sparing land from farming, or to adopt agricultural
    management practices that tried to blend ecosystem services and food production
    [also known as the land sharing strategy (Green et al. 2005, Luskin et al. 2018)].
    While there was no specific resolution to this sparing versus sharing debate,
    most scholars writing about sustainable intensification suggest that the emerging
    agricultural technologies associated with precision agriculture will help us intensify
    food production while reducing inputs (Benton et al. 2011, Phalan et al. 2016).
    3.3.   Traceability Another major benefit of the emerging agricultural technologies
    is the opportunity to ensure greater transparency across global food supply chains.
    Food system transparency is emerging as a major issue for a number of reasons
    (Badia-Melis et al. 2015). First, there have been mounting concerns over the past
    decade around issues such as food fraud, where inferior food is intentionally
    mislabeled (Aung & Chang 2014, Van Rijswijk & Frewer 2012). Issues around food
    fraud entered the public''s consciousness in 2013 when it was discovered that
    horsemeat had been mixed into ground beef in the European Union (Walker et al.
    2013). Since then, issues around food fraud have emerged with some regularity.
    For instance, research in Canada suggests that 25% of seafood sold is mislabeled
    as a commercially more expensive product (Van Rijswijk & Frewer 2012, Wong & Hanner
    2008). Similarly, increasingly discriminating middle-class consumers in Asia are
    demanding guarantees about the identity and providence of their food. Finally,
    research in North America suggests that consumers are increasingly demanding to
    know where their food comes from and that the media plays a significant role in
    consumers’ perceptions (McCluskey et al. 2015). As a result, genomic-based technologies,
    such as DNA barcoding, are increasingly used to verify the origins of food within
    global supply chains (Pizzuti & Mirabelli 2015). Similarly, voluntary accounting
    systems are becoming increasingly common as a way to offer the consumer guarantees
    as to the identity of their food. In an increasingly fractured and competitive
    global marketplace, farmers view such systems as a way of guaranteeing to consumers
    the identity and composition of their food. Increasingly, industry players look
    to technologies such as IBM''s blockchain ( https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/ ),
    which refers to a system of bookkeeping that “chains” entries in a computerized
    ledger in such a way that they cannot be tampered with. Therefore, they can be
    used by a range of stakeholders to verify the authenticity of a product that has
    moved from producer to processor to shipper to retailer. Because blockchain ledgers
    are stored on a range of cloud computing servers, and multiple copies exist in
    multiple locations, there are no single points of failure or vulnerability for
    a blockchain. This characteristic has led to the pioneering use of blockchain
    to track cryptocurrency (e.g., bitcoin) transactions. The agri-food sector is
    just now considering how to use blockchain to guarantee transparency; in one of
    the first applications of this to food, blockchain is being pioneered by Walmart
    as a way of tracking pork chops (Popper & Lohr 2017). The digital revolution in
    agriculture also allows expansion of the concept of traceability to include characteristics
    associated with the process by which the food item has been produced (Lusk 2017,
    Marvin et al. 2017). Niche markets have arisen for the delivery of characteristics
    that are often associated with adjectives surrounding the food product, such as
    organic, local, and free range. Economic growth has provided consumers with the
    opportunity to satisfy their concerns about how their food is produced rather
    than just an assurance of low cost (Campbell 2009, Caracciolo et al. 2016). Currid-Halkett
    (2017) describes inconspicuous consumption as a means for the elite to signal
    their difference from others through activities such as buying niche products
    such as pasture-raised eggs and quinoa crackers. Information technology has not
    only fostered the spread of awareness of alternative food products (as well as
    potential misinformation), but it has also allowed producers to verify to consumers
    that the product contains the desired attributes. In many cases, the desired attribute
    of the food is associated with production practices that have relatively low environmental
    impacts, as discussed below.  4.  CHALLENGES FOR BIG DATA IN AGRICULTURE AND THE
    ENVIRONMENT  The challenges for Big Data and for achieving the potential benefits
    for agricultural productivity and environmental health are classified by Wolfert
    et al. (2017) as technical or organizational. The technical issues regarding the
    quality, accuracy, and compatibility of the data can be solved if the costs of
    data acquisition continue to fall and value can be generated by innovations (Lesser
    2014). The organizational issues regarding data governance and market power from
    possessing the data are discussed below. 4.1.   Data Governance The development
    of Big Data analytics platforms is extremely challenging. To move data from equipment
    to servers, farms usually need access to the Internet, which is still challenging
    even in many rural parts of North America, let alone across the Global South (Pant
    & Odame 2017). Data must be collected in a consistent fashion and compliant with
    protocols that allow them to be pooled into centralized servers that must be protected
    from cyber security attacks while hiding the identity of individual farm managers
    (Chi et al. 2017). Ownership agreements between farmers, app developers, and equipment
    manufacturers need to be established. There are, therefore, extremely challenging
    issues pertaining to the governance, oversight, ownership, and regulation of agricultural
    and food data along with profound technical challenges to ensure widespread interoperability
    (e.g., ensuring that the data collected from numerous individual operators can
    be pooled consistently) (Banham 2014, Janssen et al. 2017, McAfee et al. 2012,
    Porter et al. 2014). The difficulty in linking data across spatial and temporal
    scales is also a major challenge for using Big Data to address environmental health
    issues (Fleming et al. 2017, Marden et al. 2016). At present, there is a somewhat
    chaotic and fractured data ecosystem as major corporations, government bodies,
    and universities all grapple with the challenge of establishing coherent data
    regulation frameworks or standardized protocols to allow the promise of the technologies
    to be realized. The interest in agricultural technology by large companies, such
    as Monsanto and John Deere, presents both opportunities and challenges in this
    respect. Large vertically integrated multinational enterprises could create much-needed
    integrated data systems to support agriculture and food production. As demonstrated
    by Walmart''s use of blockchain in the pork sector (see above), such companies
    have the resources and connectivity across the food value chain to establish the
    large-scale data analytics framework that is needed. However, there are questions
    of equity, and in particular, whether a corporate-controlled data analytics platform
    for agriculture is the most efficient way of promoting the public good, protecting
    the consumer, and helping the world''s small-scale farmers who have already been
    marginalized and stand to be further disenfranchised by this new wave of data-intensive
    technologies. It is the role of policy, therefore, to proactively identify and
    address such equity issues and potential market failures (Shin & Choi 2015). We
    note that the GODAN (Global Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition) ( https://www.godan.info
    ) initiative is attempting to create an open data platform for agriculture and
    nutrition based on the partnership of both public and private players. In Canada,
    work is underway between the University of Guelph and a range of government agencies
    along with IBM to provide a Canadian-made solution to the challenge of data integration
    and the need for a Big Data analytics platform for the food and agriculture sector.
    Towards Precision Farming 2.0 is a collaborative effort in the Netherlands involving
    several universities, government, and industry to integrate data collection, management,
    analysis, and decision making at the farm level. Similarly, Woodard (2016) proposes
    a single comprehensive data warehouse that would coordinate the aggregation, sourcing,
    and distribution of the increasing amount of economic and environmental data on
    the agri-food sector. Another barrier that inhibits precision agriculture relates
    to rural connectivity. Across many rural areas of North America and Europe, there
    is a lack of broadband (Pant & Odame 2017). This is particularly pronounced in
    Canada where the government has identified rural connectivity as a major priority
    (Gov. Can. 2016). Additionally, demographic trends may also be a barrier (Pierpaoli
    et al. 2013). In particular, older farmers are less likely than younger farmers
    to utilize the Internet and therefore adopt precision agriculture technologies
    involving accessing the Internet and analyzing data (Tey & Brindal 2012). Given
    that the average age of farmers across North America and Europe is around 55 years
    of age and increasing, an aging farm population may present a barrier to adoption
    (Stat. Can. 2017). 4.2.   Asymmetric Market Information Monsanto''s acquisition
    of The Climate Corporation and John Deere''s purchase of Blue River Technology
    are recent examples of mergers within the realm of Big Data, but these deals are
    part of a bigger trend within the agricultural sector (Clapp & Fuchs 2009, Howard
    2016). In recent years, the chemical company Bayer purchased Monsanto, DuPont
    and Dow Chemical merged, and Syngenta was purchased by ChemChina. Altogether,
    these mergers and acquisitions have led to significant industry concentration,
    with the percentage of global corn and cotton seeds accountable by the largest
    of companies growing from 60% to 85% for corn and 50% to 75% for soybeans (MacDonald
    2016). Increased concentration at both producer and retail ends of the agri-food
    supply chain has led to concern about corporate control over data flows (Bronson
    & Knezevic 2016). For example, Monsanto''s Integrated Farming Systems platform
    collects information for farmers on variables such as soil health and pest pressures,
    but these data could also be used by the company to promote their own pesticides
    and to identify new R&D needs. Similarly, at the other end of the chain, food
    processors and retailers monitor social media to predict consumer trends and attributes
    valued by the marketplace. The information collected on production costs and market
    demand has implications for market power between players in the food system. The
    extent of the asymmetry in market information and its potential impact on the
    distributional impacts of the digital revolution are the impetus for the negotiations
    regarding data ownership alluded to in the previous section.  5.  POLICY ISSUES  5.1.   Agricultural
    Policy Agricultural policy was initially designed to help improve the financial
    well-being of the farm family and subsequently the rural economy (Gardner 1992,
    Schmitz 2010). Given the historic homogeneity of the farm sector, in which a single
    farm tended to be operated by a single farmer and supported a single farm family,
    policies such as extension efforts or commodity price support programs were effective
    at enhancing farm family income (Poon & Weersink 2014). The distribution of farm
    size tended to be normal; for example, the average and median herd size for dairy
    farms in Ontario was approximately 40 cows in the early 1990s. Technical innovations
    including the digital revolution have led to a significant reduction in the number
    of farms, with the decline largely occurring in mid-sized units and resulting
    in farm size distribution (Weersink 2018). In addition to changes in the number
    of farms and their size (horizontal boundaries), the degree of specialization
    (vertical boundaries) and the resulting structure of the sector have also been
    altered by the reductions in the cost of monitoring production. Farms generally
    perform a number of activities internally; for example, many livestock farms have
    grown and harvested their own feed. The gains from specialization, such as harvesting
    feed or raising livestock, have been limited due to the short and infrequent production
    stages in farming and from the greater efficiencies of farmers doing the work
    themselves due to the cost of monitoring hired labor and the stochastic nature
    of farm production (Allen & Lueck 2004). However, the emerging Big Data revolution
    is in the process of reducing measurement cost of operations and, given the associated
    fall in transaction costs, farms have become more specialized. These larger, more
    specialized farms may or may not be selling into niche markets that have arisen
    with developments in information and communication technologies, as discussed
    earlier. The net result is a continuation of the trend from many homogeneous farms
    to fewer that are more heterogeneous (when compared with other farms) but more
    specialized in terms of the specific actions and practices employed in a single
    operation. The growing differentiation of the farm sector fostered by the digital
    revolution complicates the assessment and design of farm policy. In North America,
    the rapidly declining number of mid-sized farms, combined with a growing share
    of farms producing for niche markets as well as the rise of very large farms producing
    for commodity markets, means that it is difficult to define the average farmer
    or an average farm (Weersink 2018). Whereas the average numbers generated through
    statistical databases were representative of the typical producer a generation
    ago, this is less and less true as mid-sized operations decrease (Lyson et al.
    2008). Thus, assessing the economic conditions for farmers, and the consequent
    need for agricultural policy, requires looking beyond the average numbers. Whereas
    one-size-fits-all programs were perhaps more appropriate when farms were similar,
    the growing heterogeneity requires targeting programs to particular producers
    to deliver policies that effectively support farms of all scales. The policy objective
    of improving the livelihood of farmers has shifted toward improving the competitiveness
    of the sector, but for which of its components: the farm or farmer, the small
    or large farm, the owner or operator, or the niche or commodity producer? Traditional
    North American support programs that address commodity production and price risk
    may need to be complemented by other programs that address market and supply chain
    risks associated with farming for niche markets. The growth in niche markets and
    specialization has meant that exchange is now done through contracts between growers
    and processors to ensure the timing and quality of delivery (Adjemian et al. 2016).
    In turn, risk has subsequently shifted from price risk to contract risk. The trend
    toward greater farm-sector heterogeneity is likely to continue and, in turn, so
    will the internal and external support for any policies targeted toward the farm
    sector. Regardless of the objective and subsequent target of the policy, any evaluation
    of that policy will have to extend the traditional welfare analysis approach to
    examine its distributional effects given the growing diversity of the farm sector
    along with the increased concentration through the agri-food sector and the growing
    reliance on vertical coordination to supply products with the desired attributes
    (Sexton 2012). Crop insurance is another policy that helps reduce the risk of
    crop failure for all participating farmers regardless of size. In North America,
    crop insurance programs are financially supported by government through subsidized
    premiums, yet many farmers do not insure despite the inherent uncertainty in crop
    production (Ker et al. 2017). Big Data offers the potential to increase the efficiency
    of the program by reducing adverse selection and moral hazard issues plaguing
    current designs. Improved understanding of the reasons for yield differences and
    better measurement of the actual yields by site will allow premiums to be appropriately
    set for individual producers, thereby either increasing the overall demand for
    crop insurance where governments have not been involved or reducing the financial
    burden of governments where premiums have been subsidized (Coble et al. 2016).
    Enhanced measurement could also potentially reduce moral hazard behavior, such
    as not fully harvesting a crop that yields below the coverage level, thereby further
    improving the financial viability of the risk management program. In this way,
    Big Data and Big Data analytics platforms should also aid the expansion of crop
    and production insurance options available to farmers. An efficient weather insurance
    program requires measurable data on a climatic variable that directly influences
    output. However, spatial differences in the variable, such as rainfall or frost,
    result in significant basis risk using random weather station data. The increased
    ability to measure weather data at a small local scale at relatively low cost
    reduces basis risk and thus increases the efficiency of weather insurance (Castillo
    et al. 2016). Similarly, the feasibility of livestock production insurance increases
    with the ability to measure factors affecting disease and its actual prevalence
    (Koontz et al. 2006). With advances in communication and information technologies,
    government''s role in enhancing human capital will also be increased. Advances
    in automation and artificial intelligence will require a demanding new skill set.
    As a result, education programs will be needed to prepare workers to fill this
    demand (Rainie & Anderson 2017). Disruption in the labor market and the associated
    demand for skills training are occurring in all sectors but are particularly acute
    in agri-food. There is currently a labor shortage within the sector for unskilled
    and skilled workers across developed countries. For instance, there are over 50,000
    unfilled jobs in Canadian agriculture (Conf. Board Can. 2016). 5.2.   Agri-Environmental
    Policy The design of environmental policy to deal with residuals from the agricultural
    sector, such as GHG emissions or nitrates, has been complicated by the nature
    of the production process generating those negative environmental impacts. Like
    many of the environmental problems associated with farming, there are many small
    potential contributors to most environmental problems in agriculture, making it
    costly to measure specific problems such as GHG emissions from each individual
    farm. Confounding these issues is the fact that the environmental impact of everything
    from GHGs to water pollution and antibiotic use depends on site-specific characteristics,
    such as soil type, management practice, and distance to nearby water bodies. Hence,
    the specific relationship between a farm, the farm''s management practices, and
    the environmental impact of those practices is also stochastic and influenced
    by variables such as climate that are outside the farmer''s control. Even if there
    was a direct relationship between actions and emissions, many farming practices,
    such as the timing or rate of nutrient application, are costly for an outside
    policy agency to observe and hence regulate. The net result of these complications
    is that a range of policy options has been implemented with varying degrees of
    success. For instance, in North America, the most common means of encouraging
    farmers to change on-farm practices has been through voluntary cost-share programs
    for a suite of beneficial management practices (BMPs) deemed to reduce the negative
    impacts of agricultural production (see Baumgart-Getz et al. 2012 for a review
    of the drivers of BMP adoption). These design-based programs are common because
    of both their political feasibility and their focus on observable practices, sidestepping
    the often high uncertainty around the correlation between the BMP and the environmental
    objective. Here again, we see the potential for technological developments associated
    with Big Data to create new opportunities for policy, but these have yet to be
    fully realized. For instance, using sensors to monitor GHG emissions or water
    pollution on a sample of farms should make it possible to create predictive algorithms
    that are able to handle the stochasticity of local environmental microniches.
    Such tools will become more widely used and will allow policy makers to stop subsidizing
    BMPs in a more targeted whole-farm approach that focuses on directly reducing
    specific impacts such as GHG emissions. In addition to identifying who should
    be targeted through the agri-environmental policy while also facilitating a shift
    from design-based management (e.g., management governed by the adoption of BMPs)
    to performance-based management (e.g., management driven by emission targets),
    the digital revolution may also alter the choice of mechanism. That said, governments
    must decide on who should bear the cost of any program. Governments have tended
    to provide payments to farmers (hence adoption of a beneficiary-pays principle)
    to change their existing practices, and they generally only use polluter-pays
    mechanisms (such as penalties or taxes) when attempting to prevent farmers from
    using environmentally harmful practices (Weersink & Pannell 2017). Subsidizing
    the adoption of BMPs reflects the political support the farm sector has garnered
    over time. However, the increasing use of robotics in farming systems has shifted
    the public''s view of commodity agriculture from a family-operated traditional
    farm to an anonymously operated industrial business. This shift in community perception
    may also shift the political feasibility of beneficiary-pays programs for agricultural
    producers and cause a shift toward policies based on the polluter-pays principle.
    Advances in traceability further enhance the feasible choice of agri-environmental
    policy options. Labeling allows firms or governments to both signal and create
    a demand for environmental performance. A market is thereby created that allows
    those desiring such an improvement to pay for it. The clearest current example
    is the marketing of organic products. Producer organizations and/or governments
    across many countries have established criteria for products to be sold as organic
    at a price premium. Farmers can then voluntarily decide whether to produce according
    to those standards and thus sell their products for a premium as organic. In order
    for the organic produce market to develop, information and verification systems
    were required to ensure compliance to the organic standard. Part of the externality
    associated with excess pesticide use is internalized, allowing consumers who desire
    a reduction in pesticide use to pay farmers to do so through their purchase of
    organic products. Methods designed to enhance food system traceability also allow
    the certification of goods in terms of either their direct environmental performance
    (i.e., carbon footprint) or the practices used to produce them (i.e., organic,
    free range). Messer et al. (2017) suggest that governments should encourage the
    labeling of food processes but only mandate labeling if the process results in
    a food that could harm human health. It is important to note, however, that the
    ability to use labeling to enhance the ecological benefits of the agri-food sector
    will be greater for those further along the food supply chain (e.g., producers
    selling fruit at a farmers’ market) than for farmers selling a bulk commodity
    farm removed from final consumption. Consumer demand may also be greater for attributes
    that are consumptive (e.g., organic) as opposed to nonconsumptive (e.g., farming
    methods that improve wildlife habitat). For any environmental performance attribute,
    Big Data should reduce the cost of providing enhanced traceability once the tracking
    systems are in place, thereby ensuring that food claiming certain attributes is
    actually delivered by the farmer to the consumer, lowering the transaction costs
    of certification. Thus, the likelihood is that Big Data will allow a growth of
    farms who use self-regulation to meet the consumer demands for improved environmental
    performance increases. Big Data can further extend the list of viable environmental
    policy options to include litigation, which has typically been limited to acute
    polluting events involving significant damages and a small number of parties.
    Moreover, in such cases, the linkages between cause and effect are often well
    understood (Weersink et al. 1998). A potential example of Big Data''s role in
    litigation is the case of the herbicide dicamba. Specifically, Big Data may aid
    in determining who and what is responsible for damages caused to soybeans from
    the drift of dicamba in 2017; official injury investigations are underway on approximately
    2.5 million acres in the US Midwest (Bradley 2017). Using data on the rate and
    timing of dicamba application from farmers and agricultural retailers, combined
    with weather data, scouting reports, and in-season plant tissue maps of soybean
    crops, fields can be linked to postharvest yield maps to help determine responsibility
    for the damage (Janzen 2017). Many farm groups are concerned about environmental
    groups or government regulatory agencies using data collected on farm operations
    against farms who fail to comply with regulations, particularly with regard to
    nutrient management (Coble et al. 2016). However, the digitalization of data may
    also aid farms in demonstrating more clearly and precisely how their management
    plan satisfies external sustainability certifications, thereby reducing litigation
    risk (Coble et al. 2016). For instance, recent studies indicate that nutrient
    loadings are likely caused by a few individuals rather than all producers as a
    group. Accordingly, documentation using data may aid more farmers and groups in
    verifying environmental compliance generally while exposing the small number of
    farmers who are polluting the environment. This would thus create a naming and
    shaming approach to environmental management where peer pressure is an important
    tool in promoting best practices (Leslie et al. 2017). Although the digital revolution
    reduces some of the complexities associated with designing environmental policy
    for the agri-food sector, the use of digital technologies has also fostered the
    growing separation between ownership and management at the farm level, as farmland
    owners can monitor the activities and output of farmer tenants. When combined
    with the growing attractiveness of farmland as an investment by nonfarmers, there
    has been a continual increase in the amount of farmland that is rented: Approximately
    40% of farmland is rented in the United States and Canada, and much of it is on
    a cash rent basis (Bigelow et al. 2016, Bryan et al. 2015). Under this tenure
    relationship, tenants make the management decisions regarding practices for which
    agri-environmental policies are typically applied, but the farmland owners are
    the ones who may receive the payments from policy. The potential disconnect between
    the incentives of the program and the tenant/owner can lead to limited uptake
    of the policy and thus limited agri-environmental accountability (Rotz et al.
    2017). For example, Palm-Forster et al. (2016) found the participation rate in
    a conservation auction to reduce phosphates into Lake Erie to be particularly
    low on rented farmland.  6.  SUMMARY  As documented by Cukier & Mayer-Schoenberger
    (2013), the digital revolution has already transformed how we live, work, and
    think. This is beginning to include the agri-food sector, where there is a huge
    amount of optimism among the industry as well as policy makers and environmental
    activists that, in the future, food will be produced with a smaller environmental
    footprint. Bioinformatics advances are speeding up the processes by which we breed
    plants and animals and are doing so at significantly lower cost. Precision agriculture
    technologies are allowing farmers to better apply inputs by giving them the tools
    to manage the spatial and temporal variation existing on their farm. The developments
    in information and communication technology are creating systems that allow for
    exponentially greater transparency and traceability throughout the food chain,
    which should not only improve environmental and human health but also allow the
    industry to develop markets around those performance attributes that increasingly
    discriminating consumers are demanding. However, the opportunities created by
    digital tools to boost both productivity and environmental improvement are limited
    by a number of issues, including data governance, a lack of skills in how to handle
    and interpret data at the farm level, and an unclear return on investment for
    farmers who may consider investing in new technologies. More specifically, at
    present, our ability to generate data exceeds our ability to manage, analyze,
    and use those data. This is made clear by the relative rate of adoption of GPS
    technologies, which require no additional skills, versus the adoption of variable-rate
    application technologies, which require new skills and decision-making models.
    In effect, the value added from precision agriculture technologies has not, in
    all cases, exceeded the costs. Because the agricultural production process is
    biological and subject to uncertainty, a range of information is necessary to
    understand the underlying science and develop a decision model. These huge amounts
    of data need to be gathered consistently and accurately across a range of scales
    and then analyzed and interpreted using tools such as deep learning and artificial
    intelligence. Finally, the interpreted data must be presented back to producers
    in the form of decision support tools. The difficulty of constructing, maintaining,
    analyzing, and sharing such data limits the opportunity to derive effective decision
    rules with high information value to producers. Thus, these barriers limit the
    potential of Big Data across the entire sector. Relatedly, as data are increasingly
    seen as a significant input to innovation and production, major questions are
    currently being asked about who owns data and who will ultimately benefit from
    the potential of Big Data analysis. The pace of industrial mergers in the past
    few years signals that major industry players are positioning themselves to take
    advantage of these opportunities, which leads many to wonder if a small number
    of tech-savvy companies reap all of the rewards. Or will the benefits of this
    new revolution be widespread and socially inclusive? More critical voices in this
    debate point to lessons from the Green Revolution that provided significant gains
    to consumers and a bonus for farmers who could take advantage of new capital-intensive
    technology but likely marginalized small farmers unable to adapt. Will the same
    thing happen with the digital agricultural revolution? More specifically, because
    many of the technologies discussed in this review require little in the way of
    human labor, will their adoption spell a decline in our rural communities? Although
    these issues are relevant to North America, they take on even greater significance
    in the Global South, where many economies are still structurally dependent on
    agricultural labor. If the urban economy is not sufficiently developed to provide
    meaningful jobs for people, will a decline in rural labor simply spell an increase
    in urban slums? It will partially fall to policy makers to determine the extent
    to which we steer a course toward a greater democratization of technology and
    promote widespread public benefits. There is also a question of training. A recent
    report by the Canadian Government''s Advisory Council on Economic Growth identified
    that investing in agriculture and agricultural technologies is a solid strategy
    to boost middle-class incomes and create jobs ( http://www.budget.gc.ca/aceg-ccce/pdf/key-sectors-secteurs-cles-eng.pdf
    ). But it is important to note that these new jobs do not necessarily look like
    traditional farm jobs. Although animal husbandry and crop science will continue
    to be important, in addition to understanding how to maintain healthy soil, the
    upcoming jobs in the new digital agricultural economy are more related to software
    engineering, database management, and robotics. It will also be important to have
    workers with appropriate legal and policy expertise to develop and adjudicate
    new data-sharing arrangements. Consequently, colleges and universities need to
    quickly revise their training curricula to ensure that the next generation of
    agri-entrepreneurs has the skills it needs to take advantage of the opportunities
    afforded by technology. To close, the digital revolution has accelerated the changes
    in farm structure, with consequences for agricultural policy. The growing heterogeneity
    in the farm sector means that traditional support programs in North America that
    address production and price risk may need to be complemented by other programs
    that address market and supply chain risks associated with farming for niche markets.
    As it stands, the external benefits from the digital revolution may be greater
    than the on-farm benefits, and thus there is a role for public policy, depending
    on the extent of those benefits. The range of agri-environmental policy options
    has increased with the reduction in cost of monitoring and the ability to ensure
    that the use of environmentally beneficial practices is employed.   disclosure

    • Next generation agricultural models could benefit from recent developments in
    information and communications technology and data • Integrated development of
    modeling technologies, ICT infrastructures and user interaction is highlighted
    through use cases • Interoperability of data, granular models, reference data
    sets and requirements analysis are identified research challenges. Abstract Agricultural
    modeling has long suffered from fragmentation in model implementation. Many models
    are developed, there is much redundancy, models are often poorly coupled, model
    component re-use is rare, and it is frequently difficult to apply models to generate
    real solutions for the agricultural sector. To improve this situation, we argue
    that an open, self-sustained, and committed community is required to co-develop
    agricultural models and associated data and tools as a common resource. Such a
    community can benefit from recent developments in information and communications
    technology (ICT). We examine how such developments can be leveraged to design
    and implement the next generation of data, models, and decision support tools
    for agricultural production systems. Our objective is to assess relevant technologies
    for their maturity, expected development, and potential to benefit the agricultural
    modeling community. The technologies considered encompass methods for collaborative
    development and for involving stakeholders and users in development in a transdisciplinary
    manner. Our qualitative evaluation suggests that as an overall research challenge,
    the interoperability of data sources, modular granular open models, reference
    data sets for applications and specific user requirements analysis methodologies
    need to be addressed to allow agricultural modeling to enter in the big data era.
    This will enable much higher analytical capacities and the integrated use of new
    data sources. Overall agricultural systems modeling needs to rapidly adopt and
    absorb state-of-the-art data and ICT technologies with a focus on the needs of
    beneficiaries and on facilitating those who develop applications of their models.
    This adoption requires the widespread uptake of a set of best practices as standard
    operating procedures. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    Information and computer technology (ICT) is changing at a rapid pace. Digital
    technologies allow people to connect across the globe at high speeds at any time
    (Gartner, 2016). Even those in remote, developing regions increasingly have the
    ability to connect online via telephone and Internet providers (Danes et al.,
    2014). Satellite and drone capabilities can provide remotely sensed data in real-time
    regarding in-season crop growth and development, soil moisture, and other dynamic
    variables (e.g. Capolupo et al., 2015). High performance computing can be used
    to process large amounts of data in a short time frame, to make sense of large
    quantities of structured and unstructured data (i.e. “big data”; NESSI, 2012)
    collected using new sensing technologies, and to scale and validate models in
    ways not previously possible. Web and cloud technologies permit these capabilities
    to be made available to large numbers of end users with a convenience and cost
    that was previously inconceivable (Foster, 2015). As a result of these and other
    developments, society expects more and higher-quality information to be available
    in support of daily decision-making. Our enthusiasm for these new technologies
    in the agricultural sciences must be tempered by a realization that our modeling
    and decision support systems have not kept up with technology. Indeed, many frameworks
    used in these systems date back to the 1970s through the 1990s, prior to the availability
    of today''s advanced data collection, computing, storage, access, processing technologies,
    software languages and coding standards. Thus, we see two distinct opportunities
    for applying modern ICT to agricultural systems modeling. First, advances such
    as big data, crowdsourcing (i.e. sourcing data and information through distributed
    networks of respondents), remote sensing, and high performance computing can be
    used to advance the science of agricultural systems modeling. Second, new technologies
    can be used to transform the practice and application of agricultural systems
    modeling by making it far more collaborative, distributed, flexible, and accessible.
    As clearly shown in a recent thematic issue of Environmental Modeling and Software
    (Holzworth et al., 2014a, Athanasiadis et al., 2015), the science of agricultural
    systems modeling is progressing steadily and adopting various new ICT technologies
    to advance the science on a case-by-case basis. However, the practice and application
    of agricultural systems modeling is not progressing as fast, leading to lack of
    applications using agricultural systems models. Thus, an important feedback from
    application to science is absent and needs to be established, as also discussed
    by Holzworth et al. (2015) for cropping systems models. The focus of this review
    is thus not on relevant ICT technologies for the modeling scientist working at
    a university or research institute, but on ways to facilitate the involvement
    of actors beyond the academy. As discussed in the companion article by Antle et
    al. (this issue), the result of achieving such involvement will be a “next generation”
    modeling community (NextGen) that includes not only modelers and model developers
    working across disciplines, spatial scales, and temporal scales to exploit new
    data sources and to produce and apply new models, but also software developers
    to produce the NextGen modeling frameworks, data processing applications, and
    visualization tools. In this paper, we approach the envisioned NextGen of agricultural
    models and the supporting modeling community from the ICT perspective. Our objective
    is to assess relevant technologies for their maturity, expected development, and
    potential to benefit the agricultural modeling community. The technologies considered
    encompass methods for collaborative development and for involving stakeholders
    and users in development in a transdisciplinary manner. We assess recent ICT developments
    through five use cases that have been formulated to support the vision for a NextGen
    modeling community (see also the introductory overview by Antle et al. (submitted,
    a) and accompanying papers by Jones et al. (2017) and Antle et al. (2017)). A
    NextGen of applications based on agricultural systems modeling can help companies,
    governments, and farmers in the food chain to make informed decisions. The concepts
    of knowledge chain (Fig. 1) and application chains (Fig. 2) provide complementary
    perspectives on the value and positioning of modeling in the broader context of
    decision making and ICT, and are used to loosely organize the content of this
    paper. A knowledge chain is a set of linked steps by which data are processed
    into information, knowledge and finally wisdom as used in decision making. This
    perspective postulates that data comprise a raw material that, when combined with
    description and quality attributes, leads to information. Information can be linked
    to other information sources and placed in causal chains to produce knowledge.
    Ultimately, knowledge serves as an input for decisions based on wisdom, which
    cannot be digitized and which exists in the mind of a decision-maker. A second
    perspective focuses on application chains. Agricultural models must be engaged
    in an infrastructure consisting of both software (e.g. in layers of data access,
    processing, analysis and visualization) and hardware (i.e., servers, computing
    capacity, and storage) as depicted in Fig. 2. Based on the data in the infrastructure,
    applications targeted at end-users serve information and knowledge, e.g. a yield
    forecast to a supply chain manager; effects on farm income of a policy change;
    estimates of disease related crop damage to a farmer. Application chains may be
    simple or complex, and may include, for example, data access, extraction, transformation
    (e.g. summarization or interpolation), and integration operations; one or multiple
    models; integration of output from different models; and model output transformation,
    analysis, and visualization steps. Design of the application chains must consider
    not only the end-users, but the full spectrum of users of NextGen ICT infrastructure
    including primary data collectors, database professionals, software developers,
    modelers and the end-users of knowledge and information. Download : Download high-res

    to the different layers of the knowledge chain and the covering actors and elements
    of the application chains, focused on the NextGen of agricultural systems model
    applications. Section 2 introduces the users and the use cases where NextGen models
    could potentially play a large role. Section 3 describes the actors active along
    the application chain. 4 Agricultural data, 5 Visualizing and interpreting data
    and model outputs cover developments in data as the raw material of any modeling
    effort and new technologies that can assist with the presentation of modeling
    analyses to users. In Section 6, we discuss how agricultural models (in the strict
    sense) will need to be developed and implemented to enhance their usefulness in
    concert with parallel ICT advances, and in Section 7 we discuss the importance
    of new interfaces from software to users and between software artifacts. Finally,
    in Section 8 we make a set of recommendations for steps that need to be taken
    to enable knowledge and application chains to be created for the next generation
    of agricultural knowledge products. 2. Envisioning future uses of NextGen agricultural
    models 2.1. Reference use cases Numerous use cases can be developed to represent
    the stakeholders who define the outputs and characteristics of NextGen agricultural
    modeling applications. Five such use cases have been used to determine the most
    relevant ICT technologies to discuss in further detail as part of this paper;
    they have been described more fully in the introductory paper (Antle et al., submitted,
    a). The use cases are: 1. A farm extension officer in Africa who uses a decision
    support tool based on research results and modeling tools; 2. A researcher at
    an international agricultural research station, who tries to develop new technologies
    for sustainable intensification and wants to assess different technology options.
    3. An investment manager at a donor organization who seeks to evaluate different
    project proposals to identify the projects most likely to be effective. 4. A farm
    advisor in precision agriculture who assists farmers in using high tech data streams
    through farm management software. 5. A consultant to companies in the food supply
    chain who uses web-based tools to evaluate the footprint of products and value
    chains The use cases have been chosen to represent a wide range of farming systems,
    beneficiaries, and requirements for data and modeling components. Smallholder
    farming systems are featured in use cases 1, 2 and 3, as addressing the needs
    of these systems is considered to be essential to achieving food security in developing
    regions where smallholder farms account for most food production (Dixon et al.,
    2004). Note that a broad range of users was deliberately introduced into the use
    cases, in order to reveal the potential for developing the next generation of
    real-world model applications. The typical situation when thinking about ICT for
    agricultural modeling has previously been to consider mainly one user type only,
    that of the researcher/scientist. In this paper the 5 use cases have been analyzed
    from an ICT perspective and the deficiencies of current agricultural modeling
    systems for addressing each use case have been identified. We have then proposed,
    in narrative form, a draft application chain for each use case that would remedy
    these deficiencies.(i.e., a simple draft proposal intended to generate discussion)
    Finally, an overall synthesis of these 5 ICT solutions is used to motivate the
    rest of the paper. 2.2. Use case 1 - farm extension in Africa 2.2.1. Problem statement
    Jan works as a farm extension officer in an area in southern Africa where many
    farms are extremely small, incomes are low, and farmers typically grow maize and
    beans as staple crops for their family''s subsistence and to sell for cash. Some
    households may have livestock and/or grow vegetables. The aim of the extension
    service is to help farmers achieve higher and more stable yields of maize and
    also to advise them on improving their nutrition so that they obtain sufficient
    protein and micronutrients for healthy families. Jan obtains information on new
    varieties of maize and beans that are now available to farmers in the area. These
    new varieties are more drought and heat-tolerant, and the bean varieties are more
    resistant to a common foliar disease. Jan also has information on how to improve
    nutrient management of these crops using small doses of inorganic fertilizer along
    with animal manure and crop residues. He also has information on a new technique
    developed by CGIAR to partially harvest rainfall to increase water availability
    to the field and vegetable crops. 2.2.2. Current deficiencies Jan is not a modeler,
    but he can benefit from the outputs of agricultural production models and farm-scale
    economic models. In this case, the NextGen tool used by Jan must be able to combine
    or be combined with existing data about localized conditions (soils, weather,
    genetics, household economics, local markets, etc.) with farm-scale models to
    predict the viability of using the new varieties. These data are often difficult
    to access, if they exist at all. In many areas, weather data are considered to
    be proprietary and are not distributed freely. Good quality, localized soil data
    suitable for crop production modeling are usually non-existent or available only
    at a scale that is not practical at a field level. Information about household
    demographics and economics is rarely available except in cases where a research
    survey has been conducted recently in the area. In any case, these data may contain
    sensitive information, which should not be made publicly available until the data
    are anonymized. Pre-configured models appropriate to the smallholder systems of
    this region are needed, including components for mixed livestock/cropping systems
    driven by data relevant to management practices in common in the region (e.g.,
    planting date “rules”, cropping densities, varieties cultivated, etc.). The current
    infrastructure would not allow an easy answer for Jan. Existing models can simulate
    such systems, but the required data collection and model configuration would entail
    considerable efforts and direct collaboration with modelers and primary data collectors.
    Studies such as this, using current technology, would typically be performed to
    give generic suggested management for a region, with results not tailored to individual
    farms. 2.2.3. A draft NextGen application chain Because farms vary in size, labor
    availability, soils, and other characteristics, Jan uses the NextGen tools to
    help tailor advice to each farm family that is practical, likely to be adopted,
    and provide the best outcome in terms of more stable production, higher income,
    and better nutrition. Jan obtains information from the farmer to input into his
    smart phone, which has NextGen apps that were developed for the farming systems
    of his region and that help him determine combinations of system components that
    might best fit specific farm situations. This software also provides template
    files for extension information sheets written in the local language(s) that describe
    the components of crop and farming systems that are likely to succeed with the
    farm family. The design-time narrative – shown graphically in Fig. 3 and its caption
    – a describes the components of an application chain could allow Jan to deliver
    the necessary information to the smallholder farmers that he serves. Download

    the components of the data, modeling and delivery infrastructure according to
    application chains to deliver use case 1, with as explanation: Jan has used the
    NextGen apps previously for evaluating improvements to cropping system management
    and so he is already familiar with the user interfaces and options available.
    He uses the NextGen Farm Tradeoffs Evaluation Tool (FTET) for use in evaluating
    the efficacy of the new varieties. The improved varieties of maize and beans have
    been developed by scientists at the CGIAR centers, who work closely with the NextGen
    cultivar library and have used the NextGen parameter estimation tool to develop
    crop model parameters for a suite of NextGen models for their new cultivars. These
    cultivar parameters are now stored in the cultivar library and are available for
    use in the NextGen suite of applications. Jan obtains information from the farmer
    and inputs these data into the NextGen Farm Management App on his smartphone,
    which has an interface developed specifically for the farming systems of his region.
    The app will help him determine combinations of system components that might best
    fit specific farm situations and register these management systems within the
    Global Farming Systems Typology Database. Soil attribute and weather records specific
    to the farm locations in Jan''s region are already available in the NextGen database
    for use with the FTET. The FTET is a workflow that was generated for evaluating
    tradeoffs and synergies between management decisions and overall farm/household
    level profit and nutrition. Components of the tool include farm production using
    biophysical models, a nutritional analysis based on inputs and outputs to the
    farm, and prediction of household income under each scenario. Jan''s input data
    from each household and the proposed improved varieties can be added to the workflow
    using the FTET user interface. Based on outputs from the FTET, Jan populates,
    distributes and discusses extension information sheets written in the local language
    that describe the components of crop and farming systems that are likely to succeed
    with the farm family. 2.3. Synthesis of the reference use cases Our analysis of
    the five use cases concludes that they require a mix of recent innovations in
    both technology and data (Table 1). This overall analysis is necessarily qualitative
    and dependent in its details on the specifics of the 5 use cases and of our draft
    application chains; clearly the latter could have been developed in different
    ways. We see a clear emphasis on data integration in the broadest sense, with
    a need to deal with data from different domains and from different (and both private
    and public) sources. All use cases thus require a more intensive use and combination
    of data, which so far has not frequently occurred (Section 4). Only one of the
    5 case studies (nr 3) relies on the synthesis of large masses of well-structured
    sensor data. In the other 4 cases, “big data” techniques will mainly be needed
    to synthesize multi-purpose databases such as farming systems typologies from
    diverse sources of relatively unstructured information. (See Section 5). Table

    relatively unsure who the user really is, and this needs to be further investigated;
    (2) Complexity is a subjective assessment of the overall complexity of the use
    case as judged from the number of data sources, ICT innovations and visualization
    techniques; (3) User requirements refers to the extent to which additional user
    requirements analysis is needed to progress. Most of the use cases depend on the
    availability of good quality, accessible and preferably open input data, suitable
    for use in modeling applications (Section 4). These data requirements seem to
    be the low-hanging fruit of any modeling system, but they are often surprisingly
    difficult to obtain in today''s modeling world. Soil data, for example, are needed
    that have relevance to localized agricultural fields, are complete, and are suitable
    for use in crop models. The GlobalSoilMap program (Arrouays et al., 2104; globalsoilmap.org)
    will help relieve this constraint as it is completed, however, local data will
    be need to improve on these generic data sets to capture the heterogeneity. Semantic
    web and linked data mechanisms can help to realize the use cases more easily and
    to enable data sharing across use cases, but they never appear to be crucial.
    Standardized data protocols, on the other hand, are vital: they will allow data
    to be shared, discovered, combined with other data from different sources, and
    used in multiple applications and analyses in various modeling domains. It seems
    likely that the use of Linked Open Data principles (see, Lokers et al., 2016)
    will ultimately be a central component of a NextGen framework (Section 4). As
    a result of taking a use-case approach, the users of our draft application chains
    are already quite clearly identified; the main requirement for NextGen is to more
    explicitly define what these users really need through state-of-the-art requirements
    analysis techniques (Section 3). Each of the use cases formulates some general
    ideas and directions, but clearly much more information would be required to elaborate
    real applications. Targeted visualization is needed to communicate results to
    users (Section 5). In one use case (#2), existing techniques could be used to
    visualize data in tables that are generated and analyzed for each realization.
    The other use cases require visualizations that are integrated into interfaces
    that are specific to the corresponding knowledge products, with a clear link to
    underlying data and assumptions. The means to efficiently design and generate
    such visualizations are not available in current tools. Interestingly, we identify
    that in some cases there are clear benefits from deploying knowledge through mobile
    and web channels rather than via desktop-based solutions. Finally, in terms of
    modeling methods (Section 6), we see a clear to need to move from monolithic models
    to stable, robust, granular, and well-defined components. With the latter approach,
    models are no longer large containers of analytical steps, but instead services
    that can be driven flexibly by external programs. Models thus need to become advanced
    algorithms that can be called robustly in a service-oriented system (i.e. a set
    up in which an application can readily draw on a library of services available
    through online protocols for data access, processing and computation). From an
    infrastructure point of view, the availability of services for data and models
    (analytics) is crucial for realizing the service-oriented infrastructures underlying
    the applications. Model linking and modeling frameworks play a role in some use
    cases, but to a lesser extent than a flexible environment in which a user can
    explore the potential of models (with the exception of Use Case 2). Once a workflow
    has been implemented, it is important that users be able to run the resulting
    configuration repeatedly in a stable environment. Methods such as virtual machines
    and containers (i.e. pre-configured set-up of an operating environment with installed
    programs that can be deployed flexibly on hardware) will likely play an important
    role in capturing such environments. A framework that allows researchers to generate
    and share such workflows, including connections to multiple data sources, will
    likely be a key element of the NextGen modeling infrastructure (Section 7). 3.
    Envisaged application chain users 3.1. Beneficiaries Information and knowledge
    provided by NextGen applications can not only improve understanding but also change
    the balance of power, by allowing beneficiaries to better understand both the
    biological systems that they manage through their farming practices and each other''s
    modes of operation. The rapidly increasing digitization of society along with
    the increasing availability of internet and mobile technologies in agricultural
    communities provides massive opportunities for the hitherto under-served (Danes
    et al., 2014). For example, farmers in Africa can now receive text messages regarding
    current crop prices, seed and fertilizer locations, and crop insurance, thus allowing
    them to make informed decisions based on up-to-date information (Rojas-Ruiz and
    Diofasi, 2014). NextGen applications need to break through from the scientist
    – end user dipole, and consult with a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including
    businesses, farmers, citizens, government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs),
    and research institutions. As noted in the introductory paper (Antle et al., submitted,
    a), NextGen model development starts with an understanding of information required
    by various stakeholders and then works back from those requirements to determine
    the models and data needed to deliver that information in the form that users
    want. ICT offers various techniques for scoping user requirements, from more traditional
    methods of user requirements analysis to modern techniques of user-centered design,
    in which software is built in direct contact with the end-user in short iterations.
    In the latter approach, user needs and requirements guide and modify the development
    in each iteration (Cockburn, 2006). To our knowledge, no application of user-centered
    design methodologies has been published in the scientific literature for agricultural
    models. Agricultural models – in contrast to some decision-support interfaces
    to existing models (McCown, 2002, Hochman et al., 2009) – were mostly developed
    with a push perspective in mind to expose the functionality and the rich data
    needs of the model, not to improve the usage of the end-user. This comes as a
    consequence of the way models have been historically developed: the primary user
    has always been the scientist. However, this will most likely not be the case
    for the NextGen of applications. At the same time, opportunities to be in touch
    with end-users have become more numerous with the advent of mobile technology,
    social media, text messaging, radio and TV shows, and apps designed for tablets
    and mobile phones. At the moment there are still geographic areas where smallholder
    farmers lack the mobile networks for sharing data; however, access to SMS and
    voice message services is increasing rapidly and it is expected that end-users
    in rural areas in developing countries will skip the step of personal computers
    and make direct use of mobile phones and possibly tablets (Danes et al., 2014).
    This trend suggests that there is a huge untapped potential to boost the amount
    of information provided to farmers and processors in the chain, both because their
    needs are not yet defined and because services specifically focused on their use
    are not yet developed. Mobile technology offers a different user experience, as
    screens are smaller and handled under different circumstances. Thus mobile visualizations
    must be simple yet powerful if they are to motivate users to persist in their
    use. Often they only work with just a few data points, communicated to the end-user
    with stronger visual emphasis on color and readability. 3.2. Application chain
    developers Data collectors, software and model developers, database experts, and
    user interaction specialists are needed to contribute new capabilities to the
    envisaged applications of NextGen agricultural models. Nonetheless, existing model
    development teams need to play a key role in defining the capabilities of future
    infrastructure oriented towards application development. Such interactions between
    model development teams and application developers can happen via existing agricultural
    modeling communities such as the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement
    Project (AgMIP; Rosenzweig et al., 2013) and MACSUR (macsur.eu) and by application
    oriented projects such as FACE-IT (faceit-portal.org, Montella et al. 2014), GeoShare
    (geoshareproject.org), and BIOMA (Donatelli and Rizzoli, 2008). Continued model
    development and application partnerships using collaborative design methodologies
    are a necessary component of successful development infrastructure (Holzworth
    et al., 2014a, Holzworth et al., 2014b). A long-term strategy of the NextGen modeling
    system will need to be to entrain new model developers and other knowledge system
    specialists from the application community, especially in developing regions of
    the world, as also argued by Holzworth et al. (2015). Users and developers from
    emerging economies can bring unique perspectives that can guide the model development
    and application process to include key relevant components critical to their user
    communities. For example, a model developer in West Africa might emphasize the
    importance of soil phosphorus in yield limitations of that region – a modeling
    component lacking in many existing agricultural production models that were generated
    in regions where phosphorus is used at much higher input levels. Model users with
    deep knowledge of the decision-making requirements of emerging-economy actors,
    and of the ICT technologies available to them (e.g. mobile phones), can contribute
    to components that meet the unique needs of these actors. Finally, software development
    is required to provide for access of NextGen data products and delivery of the
    final products to users. This top layer, represented in Fig. 2, is likely to include
    both proprietary products developed by private industry and non-proprietary products
    developed in the public sector. We envision that with the proper infrastructure,
    enabling rapid data discovery and use, the delivery of agricultural data products
    may become the realm of many small and medium-sized local enterprises that can
    profit from the opportunities provided by the data and products to develop mobile
    and web service applications for use directly by farmers and NGOs. 4. Agricultural
    data 4.1. Traditional data sources We identify three main traditional methods
    of data collection of relevance for agricultural systems modeling: 1. Governments
    collect data for monitoring purposes, management of information and administrative
    procedures. These data, which include national statistics, weather data, monitoring
    data for subsidies and taxes, and data to monitor environmental performance, are
    generally uniform in format and are usually collected on a regularly scheduled
    basis for as long as they are relevant for policies. 2. Research projects collect
    data (e.g., field and household surveys, multi-dimensional panel data, soil sampling,
    measurements in laboratories) to meet specific project needs. These data are often
    incidental (i.e., collected on an irregular schedule) and not structured (i.e.,
    non-uniform in format). In most cases, these data are not usable because they
    are not shared. We will discuss this point further in Section 4.4. 3. Industries
    (including farmers and business-to-business service operators) collect data for
    their own operations. They do not usually share data due to competitive or privacy
    concerns. The availability of data at the level of farming households and communities
    is low in the developing world compared to the developed world. These sources
    have led to much data being potentially available for research. However, these
    data are often closed, being available only for specific purposes or not well
    managed for future accessibility. In recent years, the open data movement has
    been raising the awareness of the value of data and promoting methods of availability,
    accessibility and provenance. Within this open data movement, governments, international
    organizations, research institutions, and businesses work to offer open access
    to their data sets to make re-use easier. This work also requires infrastructure
    to serve the data, such as data.gov, data.gov.uk, data.overheid.nl, and data.fao.org.
    Global Open Data for Agricultural and Nutrition (GODAN, godan.info) is a particularly
    relevant initiative for open data in the area of food security; it is a multi-party
    discussion and advocacy forum initiated by the U.S. and UK governments and supported
    by many different parties. In science, several specialized journals to publish
    data files are appearing, for example the Open Data Journal for Agricultural Research
    (www.odjar.org) that originated from AgMIP. 4.2. New data sources for agricultural
    modeling New data technologies are achieving maturity for use in agricultural
    systems modeling: mobile technology, crowdsourcing, and remote sensing. The emergence
    of mobile technology significantly supports the advancement of crowdsourcing (sometimes
    called citizen science or civic science, or volunteered geographic information
    systems).) Mobile phones, GPS, and tablet devices act as sensors or instruments
    that directly place data online, with accurate location and timing information.
    These techniques are often seen as an opportunity for near sensing: the use of
    sensor-equipped tools in the field for capturing observations, e.g., temperature
    measurements on the basis of data derived from a mobile device. There are also
    special tools such as leaf area index sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV),
    which obtain more location-specific data. These crowdsourcing technologies offer
    the opportunity to gather more data and at lower cost. In these cases, citizens
    help to collect data through voluntary efforts, for example biodiversity measurements,
    mapping, and early warning. Smallholders, citizens, and organizations can thus
    manage their own data as well as contribute to public data. This offers many possibilities
    (especially as the technology is still in its infancy), with some successful applications
    such as IIASA''s Geowiki (geo-wiki.org). Crowdsourcing is sometimes organized
    as public events, for example, air quality measurements in the Netherlands on
    the same day at the same time (Zeegers, 2012). Earth observation through satellites
    now provides a continuous record since the early 1980s, forming a data source
    for time-series observations at any location. More detailed satellite data are
    coming online through NASA and EU space programs. This leads to an increasing
    demand for satellite-borne data analyses and applications. 4.3. Data quality and
    interoperability Making data available to models requires processing (geo-spatial
    and temporal) and transformation (aggregation, completeness checking, semantic
    alignment) to ensure quality (provenance, ownership, units), consistency (resolution,
    legacy), and compatibility with other sources. For most current integrated modeling
    approaches, these steps are done in a semi-automated way and on an ad hoc basis
    for each modeling project. Laniak et al. (2013) report that solutions to this
    issue are beginning to emerge including the GeoSciences Network (GEON, Ludäscher
    et al., 2003), Data for Environmental Modeling (D4EM, Johnston et al., 2011),
    and the Consortium of University for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science (CUAHSI:
    Maidment et al., 2009). With increased data availability, needs grow to ensure
    interoperability by aligning both syntax (formats) and semantics (definitions)
    (Antoniou and van Harmelen, 2004). Improved data interoperability creates new
    opportunities for all types of analysis and the development of new products. However,
    the necessary standardization has not yet been reached. There are technical standards
    that are maintained by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO),
    W3C (World Wide Web Consortium), and Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), which,
    however, do not cover connection to the content level of the significance and
    usefulness of the data. To this end, there are several developments around semantics,
    which are intended to lead to better descriptions of concepts and relationships
    between concepts in data sources: AGROVOC from FAO, CABI''s Thesaurus, and the
    CGIAR crop ontology. These efforts have limited practical application for modeling
    because quantitative data are not effectively treated. For example, ontologies
    and thesauri rarely include a specification of units. Efforts have been made to
    fill this gap: Janssen et al., 2009, Fig. 4 combined vocabularies from different
    agricultural domains, thus facilitating linkage between crop and economic models.
    The ICASA data standard for cropping systems modeling (White et al., 2013) was
    re-used in the AgMIP data interoperability tools (Porter et al., 2014) as a means
    of harmonizing data from various sources for use in multiple crop models and other
    types of quantitative analyses. Such efforts are, however, still in their infancy
    (for a discussion see Athanasiadis, 2015), and will benefit from a merging of
    data translation tools with semantic ontologies for wider discovery of data and
    tools (Lokers et al., 2016). Download : Download high-res image (263KB) Download

    relationships between farms, climate and soil information for Europe, based on
    Janssen et al. (2009). 4.4. Openness, confidentiality, privacy, and intellectual
    property issues A major motivation for NextGen agricultural systems modeling is
    to open up access to data and software that have previously been inaccessible
    for various reasons, in ways that facilitate discovery, composition, and application
    by a wide variety of researchers and disciplines. However, while NextGen will
    certainly benefit from a growing interest in open data and open source software,
    confidentiality, privacy, and intellectual property issues remain important. Openness
    and confidentiality (and related topics) are interconnected (see Antle et al.
    (2017) for more discussion on cooperation models). Openness refers to facilitating
    access to data and software. This entails appropriate licensing schemes being
    endorsed to allow access to information. While reproducibility of science has
    always been advocated, the typical interpretation in natural sciences does not
    include providing access to data sources and software as a default position. The
    reasons for this vary in different parts of the world, but include most notably
    lack of legislation that obliges public access to data, limited credit to authors
    who release datasets or software, a lack of sustainable funding mechanisms for
    long-term collection and curation of important classes of data, and technical
    difficulties in managing and sharing data. These obstacles can be overcome: there
    has been significant progress in promoting open access to data in other disciplines,
    as evidenced by collections such as the iPlant collaboration for genetics data
    (iplantcollaborative.org), the National Ecological Observatory Network (neonscience.org)
    for environmental science observations, and the Earth System Grid Federation (earthsystemgrid.org)
    for climate simulation data (Williams et al., 2009). One important aspect is that
    licensing arrangements should facilitate ease of access. In our view, simple open-access
    licenses that give clear rights and obligations to the users of data need to be
    endorsed for use in agricultural modeling. In other disciplines, scientists have
    struggled to cope with complex licenses that ultimately are introduced only for
    enforcing certain wishes of the data owners, and that hinder those who try to
    reuse the dataset. For the purposes of NextGen agricultural knowledge products,
    data (and software) licenses need to be (i) as simple as possible; (ii) compatible
    with one another (as in the Creative Commons); and (iii) non-invasive, i.e. they
    should not oblige licensees to pass all licence conditions on to their users.
    These attributes that support openness will need to be balanced with a range of
    levels of permit control over access to data and software (e.g. to require attribution).
    Many kinds of data that are critical to NextGen (for example weather records)
    are curated on behalf of many users by distinct communities of practice. In these
    situations, NextGen will need to have an influencing rather than a leading role
    in structuring data-licensing arrangements. This is not the case for data collected
    primarily in the process of agricultural production such as management practices,
    yields or cultivars. There NextGen community needs to actively shape a licensing
    environment for this information that facilitates sharing and reuse. Privacy and
    confidentiality issues arise in several regards. Agricultural data may come packaged
    with sensitive or confidential information: for example, nominal records, geographic
    location, economic information, and agronomic practices can reveal a subject''s
    identity, location, or entrepreneurial knowledge. While such information can be
    protected by not disclosing it, data anonymization or obfuscation mechanisms are
    sometimes needed to permit disclosure while protecting privacy (CAIDA, 2010).
    There are also techniques for ensuring privacy preservation during computations
    (e.g., see Drosatos et al., 2014). The NextGen community needs to invest in protocols
    for protecting privacy and confidentiality. 5. Visualizing and interpreting data
    and model outputs 5.1. Traditional visualizations Tools to enable visualization
    of agricultural source data, model outputs and synthesized data products are used
    to enhance the discovery and understanding of information for all users, including
    data collectors, model developers, model users, integrative research, application
    developers, and end-users. To make sense of large amounts of unfamiliar or complex
    data, humans need overviews, summaries, and the capability to identify patterns
    and discover emergent phenomena, empirical models, and theories related to the
    data (Fekete, 2013). Currently most visualization in agricultural systems modeling
    is organized in an ad-hoc way. Visualization modules are added to models to produce
    graphs, tables and maps, or else model outputs are transferred to other packages
    (typically spreadsheet or statistical programs) for analysis. In these types of
    packages, visualizations are prepared as messages for scientific papers. In cases
    where models are applied on a more regular basis for a specific purpose, more
    elaborated visualizations have been built, for example for Monitoring Agricultural
    Resources (MARS) Unit of the European Union (https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/mars)
    or FEWS-NET (www.fews.net), which account for specific user needs, going beyond
    those of scientific visualizations. 5.2. Visual analytics and big data A major
    challenge for NextGen is to include data visualization tools that support the
    routine exploration of, and interaction with, big data. The traditional workflow
    of loading a file, processing it, and computing some analytical quantities may
    not work well when exploring large datasets. The analyst may need to try several
    processes and methods in order to find relevant results. With big data, a loose
    coupling between visualization and analysis presents problems, as data transfer
    time can exceed the time used for data processing. Visual analytics is a branch
    of computer science that blends analytical algorithms with data management, visualization,
    and interactive visual interfaces. Visual analytics tools and techniques are used
    to synthesize information from massive, frequently updated, ambiguous and often
    conflicting data; to detect the expected and discover the unexpected; to provide
    timely, defensible and understandable assessments; and to communicate those assessments
    effectively (Thomas and Cook, 2005). Visual analytics consists of algorithms,
    representations, and big data management. Currently operationally used state-of-the-art
    analytics and data management do not yet meet the requirements for big data visual
    analytics (Fekete, 2013), as they cannot yet process enough data rapidly or in
    a suitable way to process them and help in obtaining understanding. Data management
    and analysis tools have begun to converge through the use of multiple technologies,
    including grids, cloud computing, distributed computing and general-purpose graphics
    processing units. However, visualization has not adequately been taken into account
    in these new infrastructures. New developments in both data management and analysis
    computation will be required to incorporate visual analytic tools into these infrastructures
    (Fekete, 2013, Fekete and Silva, 2012). High Performance Computing (HPC) has been
    used to accelerate the analytics of big data, but for data exploration purposes,
    data throughput may limit its usefulness. Implementations of existing algorithms
    such as hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis have been used
    to pre-process data. New types of workflows are being developed for use in visual
    analytics, including reactive workflows (e.g., EdiFlow, Manolescu et al., 2009),
    which specify that a set of operations occur each time the data change, and interactive
    workflows (e.g., VisTrails, Callahan et al., 2006), which interactively build
    and run a sequence including visualizations. VisTrails tracks workflow changes
    to create a provenance record for visual outputs. 6. Modeling concepts and methods
    of model development 6.1. Model creation, composition and reuse Modeling of agricultural
    systems is influenced simultaneously by the creators'' scientific viewpoints and
    institutional settings, and by differing views on the relationship between models
    and software. Alternative perspectives in each of these domains emerged in the
    early days of the discipline and persist to this day. For example, in cropping
    systems modeling, the physiologically-driven, bottom-up scientific strategy of
    orderly generalization that is discernable in the Wageningen group of crop models
    (van Ittersum et al., 2003) contrasts with a more top-down, ecosystem-oriented
    perspective exemplified by the SPUR rangeland model (Wight and Skiles, 1987).
    These different perspectives result in different choices about the detail with
    which biophysical processes are represented. Even when working from a similar
    scientific perspective, a scientist who constructs a model as a single individual
    (for example in a PhD dissertation: Noble, 1975) will follow a different process
    of model specification and implementation from that used by a large team working
    in a formally managed project (e.g., the Ecosystem Level Model: ELM, Innis, 1978).
    Researchers who view a model as primarily a mathematical system tend to implement
    them within generic computational packages such as ACSL (Mitchell and Gauthier,
    1976), CSMP (the Continuous System Modeling Program) or Simile (Muetzelfeldt and
    Massheder, 2003), in which the model proper is a document. In contrast, researchers
    for whom models are engineering artifacts tend to implement them as stand-alone
    programs (e.g., CERES-Maize, Ritchie et al., 1991), or as part of modeling frameworks.
    6.2. Modularity, components and “plug-and-play” approaches Over time, bottom-up
    models at lower spatial scales have expanded their scope and models at higher
    spatial scales have included greater detail. One consequence has been a clear
    trend towards modularization of models, in terms of both concepts (Reynolds and
    Acock, 1997) and the way they are coded. In a continuation of this trend, several
    modeling disciplines have adopted a modular approach to constructing particular
    simulations as well as the models on which simulations are based, i.e., modularity
    in the configuration of simulations (for example, Jones et al., 2003, Keating
    et al., 2003, Donatelli et al., 2014, Janssen et al., 2010). The rationale for
    this approach to model development is threefold: (i) to allow model users to configure
    simulations containing alternative formulations of biophysical processes, based
    on the need for a particular level of detail or else to compare alternative sub-models;
    (ii) to permit specialists in particular scientific disciplines to take on custodianship
    of sub-models, while ensuring that the larger systems model remains coherent;
    and (iii) to minimize, and facilitate easier diagnosis of, unexpected consequences
    when a sub-model is changed. In practice, encapsulation of sub-model logic in
    components needs to be accompanied by transparency through adequate documentation
    and/or open source implementations, if the confidence of model users is to be
    maintained; black box sub-models are less likely to be trusted. As the number
    of components has increased, it has become natural to assemble them together.
    While composing large models this way seems both natural and trivial, this is
    not the case. New limitations are introduced when a model is encoded in a programming
    language, and seldom are these assumptions represented in the model design or
    implementation (Athanasiadis and Villa, 2013). Models, as implemented in software,
    do not usually declare their dependencies or assumptions and leave the burden
    of integration to modelers. This situation has been the driving force behind many
    efforts focused on automating integration by providing modeling frameworks (i.e.
    computerized e-science tools for managing data and software) so as to assist scientists
    with the technical linking of models to create scientific workflows. A modeling
    framework is a set of software libraries, classes, and components, which can be
    assembled by a software developer to deliver a range of applications that use
    mathematical models to perform complex analysis and prognosis tasks (Rizzoli et
    al., 2008). Modeling frameworks claim to be domain-independent; however, many
    of them originate from a certain discipline that drives several of their requirements.
    In agro-ecosystem modeling, several frameworks have been developed and used by
    different research groups, such as ModCom (Hillyer et al., 2003), the Common Modeling
    Protocol, (Moore et al., 2007), BIOMA (Donatelli and Rizzoli, 2008), and the Galaxy-based
    FACE-IT (Montella et al., 2015). No consensus on how to implement component-level
    modularity in agro-ecosystem models can be expected in the near future (Holzworth
    et al., 2015). While the various frameworks show a strong family resemblance,
    the differences between them, which reflect different points of departure on the
    mathematics-to-engineering spectrum and also different views on the trade-offs
    involved in decentralizing model development, mean that the technical barriers
    to linking them together are quite high. Arguably mosdt framework development
    has occurred within disciplines in linking models together in operational model
    chains (see Holzworth et al., 2015 for a discussion of these developments in cropping
    systems models), while truly interdisciplinary modeling has only been achieved
    occasionally and hardly at all with rigorous scientific methods. Thus, a methodological
    and conceptual challenge for a NextGen modeling community is to extend the lessons
    learnt in building modeling frameworks for specific domains so that inter-disciplinary
    modeling analyses can be constructed that that produce robust and defensible results,
    are calibrated with observations, are transparent in methods and calculations,
    and are useful for answering scientific or policy questions. Experience from SEAMLESS
    (Janssen et al., 2011), the AgMIP model intercomparisons (Asseng et al., 2013,
    Bassu et al., 2014), and pSIMS (Elliott et al., 2014) suggests that even when
    a rigorous modeling framework is used, a considerable amount of software for converting
    and translating data between different units, formats, grids, and resolutions
    needs to be written. In some cases, translation tools are required to integrate
    data sources and models that do not adhere to common standards. In other cases,
    translation tools are required because different communities adhere to different
    standards. Lloyd et al. (2011) compared four modeling frameworks11 for implementing
    the same model. They investigated modeling framework invasiveness (i.e. the amount
    of change required in model code to accommodate a framework), and observed (i)
    a five-fold variation in model size and (ii) a three-fold variation in framework-specific
    function usage compared to total code size. These findings imply that there is
    a large impact of the framework-specific requirements on model implementation,
    and that lightweight frameworks do indeed have a smaller footprint. Despite the
    advantages that modeling frameworks were supposed to deliver in easing software
    development, they are mostly used within the groups that originally developed
    them, with little reuse of models developed by other researchers (Rizzoli et al.,
    2008). At the same time, modeling software reuse is hindered by other issues such
    as model granularity. 6.3. Model granularity The goal of software for integrated
    modeling is to ensure soundness of results and to maximize model reuse. This can
    be achieved by finding the right balance between the invasiveness of the modeling
    framework, as measured by the amount of code change to a model component required
    to include it in a framework, and the expected benefit of component reuse. A key
    factor in this balance is the granularity (i.e., the extent to which a larger
    entity must be decomposed into smaller parts) of the model components. The choice
    of module granularity involves setting the boundary between one model or sub-model
    and the next, which can be a subjective and subtle process (Holzworth et al.,
    2010). Also, if a modeling framework is to support a range of different process
    representations of differing complexity (for example sub-models for multi-species
    radiation interception), then data structures and software interfaces need to
    be carefully designed to be both highly generic in the way they describe the relevant
    features of the system, and also to have unambiguous semantics. This design work,
    which is essentially a form of conceptual modeling, can improve the clarity of
    scientific understanding of ecosystems, but it is unavoidably time-consuming and
    has been considered an overhead by most modelers either developing their own components
    or using components developed by others. Most currently used agricultural models
    tend to have their subcomponents tightly coupled (possibly for better performance),
    which makes component substitution a laborious task that needs heavy code disaggregation
    and restructuring, while additional calibration may be needed. Highly disaggregated
    components increase the complexity of finding sub-models that are compatible with
    both the software interfaces and the scientific requirements of a model. The number
    of connections increases with finer granularity. In contrast, larger, more complex
    sub-modules reduce the probability that a re-user can find a suitable component
    due to the more complex interface. Integrated model calibration and validation,
    in addition to unit testing of individual components, is an important aspect of
    any modeling system, but becomes even more critical as components are shared and
    can be pulled from a wider selection. So far there are no good documented examples
    of component re-use over modeling frameworks indicating that this has not happened
    much so far. There needs to be a phase a trial and error of incorporating components
    across modeling frameworks, after which best practices for granularity can be
    defined for component design. 6.4. Process of model development Most of the collaborative
    development methodologies have been developed by the open-source movement. Open-source
    methods are not a prerequisite for collaborative development, however; many closed-source
    products follow similar methods for project management. The seminal work of Raymond
    (1999) introduced two major project governance models, the Cathedral and the Bazaar,
    that still dominate software development in various ways. In the Cathedral model,
    code is shared only among the members of the development group, and decisions
    are taken through a strict hierarchy of roles. In contrast, the Bazaar model allows
    a large pool of developers to contribute with improvements, changes and extensions
    over the Internet. In the development of agricultural models, almost solely Cathedral
    models of development have been used with one custodian managing all the code.
    Where a single organization or a small group of individuals takes responsibility
    for specifying the design of a modeling system, then the simplest method of collaborative
    development is a Cathedral approach. The main benefit of the approach is that
    there is a clear definition of what constitutes a given model at a given time.
    However, Cathedral approaches to collaboration are unlikely to be workable for
    many elements of a NextGen agricultural modeling system; there will simply be
    too many peer stakeholders. The ‘Bazaar’ alternative approach to collaboration
    introduces the use of a common code repository with a version control system together
    with social technologies to manage modifications. Collaborative approaches to
    model and application development are a consequence of open-source development
    and carry transaction costs such as meetings, increased communication, and increased
    effort in documentation and quality control; and benefits that include better
    transparency, lowering the barrier to new contributors, and peer-reviewing of
    design and code implementation. The costs to the modeling community of maintaining
    software quality assurance technologies and governance mechanisms are non-trivial;
    but the costs to a model developer of joining an open-source community (to translate
    existing code or adjust to a different conceptual framework) can also be significant.
    Most important is the cost of paradigm shift. With respect to NextGen models,
    creating an open-source community around a model will not be as straightforward
    as converting an existing individual model to open source. In merging different
    communities and scientific approaches, a medium-to-long-term investment by a core
    group of adopters is vital to achieve the critical mass of benefits that are required
    to make participation attractive. 7. Infrastructure and interfaces 7.1. Interfaces
    for end users Much consumer and business software today is not installed on PCs
    but is instead delivered by cloud-hosted services accessed over the network from
    a Web browser, often running on a mobile phone or tablet: this approach is called
    software as a service (SaaS: Dubey and Wagle, 2007). Intuitive Web 2.0 interfaces
    make user manuals largely a thing of the past. The result of these developments
    is a considerable reduction in operating cost, often an increase in usability,
    and above all a dramatic increase in the number of people who are involved to
    design, deliver and maintain these systems. The technology for delivering information
    through mobile and other devices has rapidly developed in a short time. This does
    not mean that agricultural models were extensively adopted these developments,
    as they seem not to be ready to do so in terms of their design, flexibility and
    ease of deployment. Many of agricultural models and their interfaces have been
    developed with the researcher as user in mind and are based on Microsoft Windows-based
    PC''s, as the start of their design was often more than 20 years ago. Many models
    have yet to be rigorously improved to adhere to SaaS principles with respect to
    data, licensing, model design and granularity and general robustness of application
    to allow them to be linked in operational tools for end-users. 7.2. Data and model
    discovery Use of big data, component-based models, synthesized information products,
    and apps for delivering knowledge through mobile devices can all be easily envisioned
    using technologies that exist today. A grand challenge for the NextGen agricultural
    applications will be to provide common protocols for making these numerous databases,
    models, and software applications discoverable and available to users and developers
    through web services and distributed modeling frameworks. By using common semantic
    and ontological properties in Web 3.0 interfaces, the data and modeling components
    can be made available for coherent use in a proposed NextGen platform. Web 3.0,
    also called the Semantic Web, refers to standards being developed by the World
    Wide Web Consortium (W3C) for data discovery, sharing, and reuse across applications,
    enterprises and community boundaries (www.w3c.org). Linked data refers to connections
    between the contents of datasets to build a “web of data.” This technology is
    relatively new and as yet unproven for practical use in the scientific and big
    data realms (Janssen et al., 2015). Many claims have been made regarding the potential
    of linked open data using W3C protocols, but it is not yet clear whether the complexity
    and cost of designing these systems is worth the benefits. Tools for working with
    linked data are not yet easy to use and few people have access to the technology
    and skills to publish linked datasets (Powell et al., 2012). However, despite
    the lack of maturity of this technology, it holds great promise for use in a distributed
    ICT modeling framework, provided that the Web 3.0 protocols continue to develop
    and coalesce around common standards and that tools are introduced that allow
    more rapid development of customized and complementary ontologies. Other elements
    of a distributed modeling framework, such as cloud and web-based computing, movement
    of big data across the web, and software-as-a-service (SaaS) are already in wide
    use. For example, SaaS is being used to deliver research data management (Foster,
    2011), data publication (Chard et al., 2015), agricultural modeling (Montella
    et al., 2015), genome analysis (Goecks et al., 2010), and plant modeling (Goff
    et al., 2011) capabilities to researchers. Commercial cloud offerings such as
    those provided by Amazon Web Services, Google, and Microsoft Azure provide both
    on-demand computing and storage and powerful platform services. Standards have
    been established for many aspects of cloud computing (e.g., the Open Cloud Computing
    Interface and Cloud Data Management Interface). However, standardization gaps
    still exist for many other areas as delineated by the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST, 2013). These standardization gaps include SaaS interfaces
    for data and metadata formats to support interoperability and portability and
    standards for resource description and discovery. The NIST report lists 15 groups
    that are actively working on development of standards for all aspects of cloud-based
    computing. 8. Conclusions and research agenda Overall agricultural systems modeling
    needs to rapidly adopt and absorb state-of-the-art data and ICT technologies with
    a focus on the needs of beneficiaries and on facilitating those who develop applications
    of their models. This adoption requires the widespread uptake of a set of best
    practices as standard operating procedures. Focussing on single technologies will
    be insufficient if agricultural models are to achieve their true potential for
    societal benefit, simultaneous improvements in practice will be needed across
    the full range of information & communication technologies and methods addressed
    in this paper. First, modeling developers of models and application chains need
    to follow good coding practices as long established in software engineering. For
    example, with respect to the modeling itself, clearly separating code that implements
    model equations from their user interfaces will make constructing computational
    chains easier. At the same time, coding a model needs to become simpler. By providing
    appropriate domain-specific structures and functions as libraries, we can enable
    NextGen model implementations that are significantly smaller, in terms of lines
    of model-specific code, than today''s models. As development and maintenance costs
    tend to scale with lines of code (Boehm, 1987), such developments will have a
    considerable positive impact. Second, interoperability of both data and models
    has to become the operating standard. All elements of the system should be linked
    via intuitive, Web 2.0 interfaces, with associated REST (Representational State
    Transfer) application programming interfaces for programmatic access. This approach
    will allow for self-documenting applications and interfaces and will facilitate
    navigation and integration of the various modeling and data components. Not many
    agricultural models follow this design to date. Software and data should be cloud-hosted
    or delivered via services to permit access by any authorized user, without the
    need to install local software. Third, access to data and software needs to be
    rapidly improved. Ideally, most data and modeling components will be free in both
    senses of the word, with little to no cost and few to no restrictions on use,
    so as to encourage an active community of application developers to provide value-added
    products to end users The modeling community must stimulate and organize ease
    of upload and publication of new data, software, and workflows. The principle
    of “publish then filter” must be followed, to encourage sharing of data and software.
    Feedback mechanisms (such as ratings and post-publication review) could be provided
    to identify what is good—rather than interposing onerous curation processes that
    will inevitably limit data and code sharing. Mechanisms (e.g. digital object identifiers)
    should be integrated for citing contributions of data and software and for tracking
    accesses to contributions, in order to provide positive and quantitative feedback
    to contributors. Fourth, the data integration challenge needs to be ubiquitously
    addressed. Data are now siloed in different domain-specific repositories, and
    interoperability across domains and scales is very weak, slowing the efficiency
    of analytical solutions that modeling is (Lokers et al., 2016). As a first step,
    common vocabularies and ontologies need to be constructed to allow for data interchange
    among disciplines. Development of vocabularies has the important side effect of
    requiring that the disciplines work in a coordinated way, thus breaching the disciplinary
    silos that currently impede progress in integrated modeling. Use of linked data
    protocols will allow interpretation of data from multiple, distributed sources.
    While an ontological framework may seem an overhead for many researchers, still
    there is an emergent need for standardization actions for both terminology and
    data formats (i.e., see Porter et al., 2014, Janssen et al., 2011, Lokers et al.,
    2016). Fifth, NextGen agricultural models must be applied to reference data with
    quality standards, i.e., as those proposed by Kersebaum et al. (2015). Such reference
    data sets for applications (at different scales, domains and purposes) need to
    be defined and published as open access, so that new implementations can be tested
    and benchmarked easily. Sixth and last, user requirements of beneficiaries benefiting
    from applications of agricultural systems models need to be investigated using
    state-of-the-art software design techniques. This could enable the development
    of a suite of output-presentation components that are in the public domain, well-designed
    for agricultural problems, and suitable for use across many different applications.
    In conclusion, as an overall research challenge, the interoperability of data
    sources, modular granular models, reference data sets for applications and specific
    user requirements analysis methodologies need to be addressed to allow agricultural
    modeling to enter in the big data era. This will enable much higher analytical
    capacities and the integrated use of new data sources. We believe that a NextGen
    agricultural modeling community that follows these good practices and addresses
    the research agenda is likely to gain a substantial following and to spur increased
    collaboration within and between communities. We expect it to provide significantly
    enhanced tools to help deliver sustainable food production under both today''s
    and tomorrow''s changing climate conditions. Acknowledgements The authors like

    Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing humanity, and we, as machine
    learning (ML) experts, may wonder how we can help. Here we describe how ML can
    be a powerful tool in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and helping society adapt
    to a changing climate. From smart grids to disaster management, we identify high
    impact problems where existing gaps can be filled by ML, in collaboration with
    other fields. Our recommendations encompass exciting research questions as well
    as promising business opportunities. We call on the ML community to join the global
    effort against climate change. Skip 1INTRODUCTION Section 1 INTRODUCTION The effects
    of climate change are increasingly visible.1 Storms, droughts, fires, and flooding
    have become stronger and more frequent [239]. Global ecosystems are changing,
    including the natural resources and agriculture on which humanity depends. The
    2018 intergovernmental report on climate change estimated that the world will
    face catastrophic consequences unless global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are
    eliminated within 30 years [372]. Yet year after year, these emissions rise. Addressing
    climate change involves mitigation (reducing emissions) and adaptation (preparing
    for unavoidable consequences). Both are multifaceted issues. Mitigation of GHG
    emissions requires changes to electricity systems, transportation, buildings,
    industry, and land use. Adaptation requires planning for resilience and disaster
    management, given an understanding of climate and extreme events. Such a diversity
    of problems can be seen as an opportunity: there are many ways to have an impact.
    In recent years, machine learning (ML) has been recognized as a broadly powerful
    tool for technological progress. Despite the growth of movements applying ML and
    artificial intelligence (AI) to problems of societal and global good,2 there remains
    the need for a concerted effort to identify how these tools may best be applied
    to tackle climate change. Many ML practitioners wish to act, but are uncertain
    how. On the other side, many fields have begun actively seeking input from the
    ML community. This article aims to provide an overview of where ML can be applied
    with high impact in the fight against climate change, through either effective
    engineering or innovative research. The strategies we highlight include climate
    mitigation and adaptation, as well as meta-level tools that enable other strategies.
    In order to maximize the relevance of our recommendations, we have consulted experts
    across many fields (see Acknowledgments) in the preparation of this article. 1.1
    Who is this Article Written For? We believe that our recommendations will prove
    valuable to several different audiences (detailed below). Given the wide diversity
    of technical areas involved, we do not assume any prior familiarity with application
    domains (such as agriculture or electric grids) and have tried to provide relevant
    keywords and background reading within each section of the article. While we use
    basic terminology from ML, knowledge of the specific ML techniques we reference
    is not necessary to understand any of our key points. For an overall introduction
    to ML, see e.g., [78]. Researchers and engineers:. We identify many problems that
    require conceptual innovation and can advance the field of ML, as well as being
    highly impactful. For example, we highlight how climate models afford an exciting
    domain for interpretable ML (see Section 8.1). We encourage researchers and engineers
    across fields to use their expertise in solving urgent problems relevant to society.
    Entrepreneurs and investors:. We identify many problems where existing ML techniques
    could have a major impact without further research, and where the missing piece
    is deployment. We realize that some of the recommendations we offer here will
    make valuable startups and nonprofits. For example, we highlight techniques for
    providing fine-grained solar forecasts for power companies (see Section 2.1),
    tools for helping reduce personal energy consumption (see Section 11.2), and predictions
    for the financial impacts of climate change (see Section 14). We encourage entrepreneurs
    and investors to fill what is currently a wide-open space. Corporate leaders:.
    We identify problems where ML can lead to massive efficiency gains if adopted
    at scale by corporate players. For example, we highlight means of optimizing supply
    chains to reduce waste (see Section 5.1) and software/hardware tools for precision
    agriculture (see Section 6.2). We encourage corporate leaders to take advantage
    of opportunities offered by ML to benefit both the world and the bottom line.
    Local and national governments:. We identify problems where ML can improve public
    services, help gather data for decision-making, and guide plans for future development.
    For example, we highlight intelligent transportation systems (see Section 3.4),
    techniques for automatically assessing the energy consumption of buildings in
    cities (see Section 4.2), and tools for improving disaster management (see Section
    9.4). We encourage policymakers to consider opportunities for working with ML
    experts and building ML capacity in relevant public sector bodies. We further
    encourage public entities to release data that may be relevant to climate change
    mitigation and adaptation goals. (For further policy-related recommendations on
    this topic, see e.g., [406].) 1.2 How to Read this Article The article is broken
    into sections according to application domain (see Table 1). To help the reader,
    we have also included the following flags at the level of individual strategies.
    Table 1. Table 1. Climate Change Solution Domains, Corresponding to Sections of
    this Article, Matched with Selected Areas of ML that are Relevant to Each denotes
    bottlenecks that domain experts have identified in climate change mitigation or
    adaptation and that we believe to be particularly well-suited to tools from ML.
    These areas may be especially fruitful for ML practitioners wishing to have an
    outsized impact, though applications not marked with this flag are also valuable
    and should be pursued. denotes applications that will have their primary impact
    after 2040. While extremely important, these may in some cases be less pressing
    than those which can help act on climate change in the near term. denotes applications
    where the impact on GHG emissions is uncertain (for example, rebound effects may
    apply3) or where there is potential for undesirable side effects (negative externalities).
    These flags should not be taken as definitive; they represent our understanding
    of more rigorous analyses within the domains we consider, combined with our subjective
    evaluation of the potential role of ML in these various applications. Despite
    the length of the article, we cannot cover everything. There will certainly be
    many applications that we have not considered, or that we have erroneously dismissed.
    We look forward to seeing where future work leads. 1.3 A Call for Collaboration
    All of the problems we highlight in this article require collaboration across
    fields. Collaboration reduces the chance of failure modes such as working on a
    problem that is not actually impactful, overly simplifying a complicated issue,
    or using advanced computational tools when simple tools will do the job. Collaboration
    is also essential to ensure that innovations will be deployed with the intended
    impact. Relevant stakeholders should be involved in the full pipeline of problem
    scoping and development, so that the final solution is well-tailored to the setting
    in which it will be used. For example, code can be written using a language and
    a platform that are already popular with the intended users, or can be integrated
    into an existing, widely used tool. We realize that finding partners, as well
    as relevant resources such as data, can often be difficult. We encourage readers
    to visit the website that accompanies this article, www.climatechange.ai , where
    we offer additional resources, as well as opportunities for knowledge-sharing
    and networking. 1.4 The Broader Picture We emphasize that ML is not a silver bullet.
    The applications we highlight are impactful, but no one solution will “fix” climate
    change. There are also many areas of action where ML is inapplicable, and we omit
    these entirely. Moreover, while we focus here on ways in which ML can help address
    climate change, ML can also be applied in ways that make climate change worse.
    For instance, ML is used widely to accelerate activities such as fossil fuel exploration
    and extraction [303, 406, 814], while some ML models are themselves energy-intensive
    to train and run [69, 459, 720, 764].4 Finally, technology is not in itself enough
    to solve climate change, nor is it a replacement for other aspects of climate
    action such as policy. Many technological tools useful in addressing climate change
    have been available for years but have yet to be adopted at scale by society.
    While we hope that ML will be useful in accelerating effective strategies for
    climate action, humanity also must decide to act. Skip 2Electricity Systems by
    Priya L. Donti Section 2 Electricity Systems by Priya L. Donti AI has been called
    the new electricity, given its potential to transform entire industries [591].
    Interestingly, electricity itself is one of the industries that AI is poised to
    transform. Many electricity systems are awash in data, and the industry has begun
    to envision next-generation systems (smart grids) driven by AI and ML [559, 623,
    661, 814]. Electricity systems5 are responsible for about a quarter of human-caused
    GHG emissions each year [370]. Moreover, as buildings, transportation, and other
    sectors seek to replace GHG-emitting fuels (Section 3–4), demand for low-carbon
    electricity will grow. To reduce emissions from electricity systems, society must
    Rapidly transition to low-carbon6 electricity sources (such as solar, wind, hydro,
    and nuclear) and phase out carbon-emitting sources (such as coal, natural gas,
    and other fossil fuels). Reduce GHG emissions associated with existing fossil
    fuel and electricity infrastructure, since the transition to low-carbon power
    will not happen overnight. Implement these changes across all countries and contexts,
    as electricity systems are everywhere. ML can contribute on all fronts by informing
    the research, deployment, and operation of electricity system technologies (Figure
    1). Such contributions include accelerating the development of clean energy technologies,
    improving forecasts of demand and clean energy, improving electricity system optimization,
    and enhancing system monitoring. These contributions require a variety of ML paradigms
    and techniques, as well as close collaborations with the electricity industry
    and other experts to integrate insights from operations research, electrical engineering,
    physics, chemistry, the social sciences, and other fields. Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Selected
    opportunities to reduce GHG emissions from electricity systems using ML, as described
    in Section 2. 2.1 Enabling Low-Carbon Electricity Low-carbon electricity sources
    are essential to tackling climate change. These sources come in two forms: variable
    and controllable. Variable sources fluctuate based on external factors; for instance,
    solar panels produce power only when the sun is shining, and wind turbines only
    when the wind is blowing. On the other hand, controllable sources such as nuclear
    or geothermal plants can be turned on and off (though not instantaneously7). These
    two types of sources affect electricity systems differently, presenting distinct
    opportunities for ML techniques. 2.1.1 Variable Sources. Most electricity is delivered
    to consumers using a physical network called the electric grid, where the power
    generated must equal the power consumed at every moment. This means that solar
    panels, wind turbines, and other variable electricity generators are supported
    by some mix of natural gas plants, storage, or other controllable sources ready
    to buffer changes in their output (e.g., when unexpected clouds block the sun
    or the wind blows less strongly than predicted). Today, this buffer is often provided
    by coal and natural gas plants run in a CO 2 -emitting standby mode called spinning
    reserve. In the future, this role is expected to be played by energy storage technologies
    such as batteries (Section 3.3), pumped hydro, or power-to-gas [226]; see [27]
    for an overview.8 ML can both reduce emissions from today’s standby generators
    and enable the transition to carbon-free systems by helping improve necessary
    technologies (namely forecasting, scheduling, and control) and by helping create
    advanced electricity markets that accommodate both variable electricity and flexible
    demand. Forecasting supply and demand. Since variable generation and electricity
    demand both fluctuate, they must be forecast ahead of time to inform real-time
    electricity scheduling and longer-term system planning. Better short-term forecasts
    can allow system operators to reduce their reliance on polluting standby plants
    and to proactively manage increasing amounts of variable sources. Better long-term
    forecasts can help system operators (and investors) determine where and when variable
    plants should be built. While many system operators today use basic forecasting
    techniques, forecasts will need to become increasingly accurate, span multiple
    horizons in time and space, and better quantify uncertainty to support these use
    cases. ML can help on all these fronts. To date, many ML methods have been used
    to forecast electricity supply and demand. These methods have employed historical
    data, physical model outputs, images, and even video data to create short- to
    medium-term forecasts of solar power [9, 19, 161, 478, 524, 771, 818], wind power
    [216, 285, 450, 512], “run-of-the-river” hydro power [623], demand [351, 429,
    458, 673], or more than one of these [402, 857] at aggregate spatial scales. These
    methods span various types of supervised ML, fuzzy logic, and hybrid physical
    models, and take different approaches to quantifying (or not quantifying) uncertainty.
    At a more spatially granular level, some work has attempted to understand specific
    categories of demand, for instance by clustering households [63, 421] or by disaggregating
    electricity signals using game theory, optimization, regression, and/or online
    learning [24, 409, 473]. While much of this previous work has used domain-agnostic
    techniques, ML algorithms of the future will need to incorporate domain-specific
    insights. For instance, since weather fundamentally drives both variable generation
    and electricity demand, ML algorithms forecasting these quantities should draw
    from innovations in climate modeling and weather forecasting (Section 8) and in
    hybrid physics-plus-ML modeling techniques [161, 818, 822]. Such techniques can
    help improve short- to medium-term forecasts, and are also necessary for ML to
    contribute to longer-term (e.g., year-scale) forecasts since weather distributions
    shift over time [404]. In addition to incorporating system physics, ML models
    should also directly optimize for system goals [198, 220, 842]. For instance,
    the authors of [198] use a deep neural network to produce demand forecasts that
    optimize for electricity scheduling costs rather than forecast accuracy; this
    notion could be extended to produce forecasts that minimize GHG emissions. In
    non-automated settings where power system control engineers (partially) determine
    how much power each generator should produce, interpretable ML and automated visualization
    techniques could help engineers better understand forecasts and thus improve how
    they schedule low-carbon generators. More broadly, understanding the domain value
    of improved forecasts is an interesting challenge. For example, previous work
    has characterized the benefits of specific solar forecast improvements in a region
    of the United States [523]; further study in different contexts and for different
    types of improvements could help better direct ML work in the forecasting space.
    Improving scheduling and flexible demand. When balancing electricity systems,
    system operators use a process called scheduling and dispatch to determine how
    much power every controllable generator should produce. This process is slow and
    complex, as it is governed by NP-hard optimization problems such as unit commitment
    and optimal power flow that must be coordinated across multiple time scales (from
    sub-second to days ahead). Further, scheduling will become even more complex as
    electricity systems include more storage, variable generators, and flexible demand,
    since operators will need to manage even more system components while simultaneously
    solving scheduling problems more quickly to account for real-time variations in
    electricity production. Scheduling processes must therefore improve significantly
    for operators to manage systems with a high reliance on variable sources. ML can
    help improve the existing (centralized) process of scheduling and dispatch by
    speeding up power system optimization problems and improving the quality of optimization
    solutions [333, 608]. For instance, ML can be used to approximate or simplify
    existing optimization problems [75, 242, 311, 871], find good starting points
    for optimization [52, 196, 382], identify redundant constraints [541], learn from
    the actions of power system control engineers [197], or do some combination of
    these [858]. Dynamic scheduling [225, 546] and (safe) reinforcement learning (RL)
    could also be used to balance the electric grid in real time; in fact, some electricity
    system operators have started to pilot similar methods at small, test case-based
    scales [520]. While many modern electricity systems are centrally coordinated,
    recent work has examined how to (at least partially) decentralize scheduling and
    dispatch using energy storage, flexible demand, low-carbon generators, and other
    resources connected to the electric grid. One strategy is to explicitly design
    local control algorithms; for instance, recent work has controlled energy storage
    and solar inverters using supervised learning techniques trained on historical
    optimization data [191, 192, 410, 411]. Another strategy is to let storage, demand,
    and generation respond to real-time prices9 that reflect (for example) how emissions-intensive
    electricity currently is. In this case, ML can help both to design real-time prices
    and to respond to these prices. Previous work has used RL and dynamic programming
    to set real-time electricity prices [30, 90] and more broadly for power market
    design [30, 881]. Techniques such as (deep) RL [291, 292, 810, 881], agent-based
    models [173, 662, 663, 863], online optimization [99], and dynamic programming
    [704] can then help maximize profits for decentralized storage, demand, and generation,
    given real-time prices. See also [30] for an overview of deep learning techniques
    for demand response. In general, much more work is needed to test and scale existing
    decentralized solutions; barring deployment on real systems, platforms such as
    PowerTAC [638] and Grid2Op [519] can provide large-scale simulated environments
    on which to perform these tests. Accelerating materials science. Scientists are
    working to develop new materials that can better store or otherwise harness energy
    from variable natural resources. For instance, creating solar fuels (synthetic
    fuels produced from sunlight or solar heat) could allow us to capture solar energy
    when the sun is shining and then store this energy for later use. However, the
    process of discovering new materials can be slow and imprecise; the physics behind
    materials are not completely understood, so human experts often manually apply
    heuristics to understand a proposed material’s physical properties [49, 105].
    ML can automate this process by combining existing heuristics with experimental
    data, physics, and reasoning to apply and even extend existing physical knowledge.
    For instance, recent work has used tools from ML, AI, optimization, and physics
    to figure out a proposed material’s crystal structure, with the goal of accelerating
    materials discovery for solar fuels [49, 298, 773]. Other work seeking to improve
    battery storage technologies has combined first-principles physics calculations
    with support-vector regression to design conducting solids for lithium-ion batteries
    [257]. (Additional applications of ML to batteries are discussed in Section 3.3.)
    Recent work has also proposed the use of ML for scalable simulation of electrocatalysts
    for power-to-gas applications [894]. More generally in materials science, ML techniques
    including supervised learning, active learning, and generative models have been
    used to help synthesize, characterize, model, and design materials, as described
    in reviews [105, 490] and more recent work [299]. As discussed in [105], novel
    challenges for ML in materials science include coping with moderately sized datasets
    and inferring physical principles from trained models [800]. In addition to advancing
    technology, ML can inform policy for accelerated materials science; for instance,
    previous work has applied natural language processing to patent data to understand
    the solar panel innovation process [813]. We note that while our focus here has
    been on electricity system applications, ML for accelerated science may also have
    significant impacts outside electricity systems, e.g., by helping design alternatives
    to cement (Section 5.2) or create better CO 2 sorbents (Section 7.1). Additional
    applications. There are many additional opportunities for ML to advance variable
    power generation. For instance, it is important to ensure that low-carbon variable
    generators produce energy as efficiently and profitably as possible. Prior work
    has attempted to maximize electricity production by controlling solar panels [1,
    3, 678] or wind turbine blades [2, 833] using RL or Bayesian optimization. Other
    work has used graphical models to detect faults in rooftop solar panels [377]
    and genetic algorithms to optimally place wind turbines within a wind farm [188].
    ML can also help control batteries located at solar and wind farms to increase
    these farms’ profits, for instance by storing their electricity when prices are
    low and then selling it when prices are high; prior work has used ML to forecast
    electricity prices [460, 838] or RL to control batteries based on current and
    historical prices [825]. ML can also help integrate rooftop solar panels into
    the electric grid, particularly in the United States and Europe. Rooftop solar
    panels are connected to a part of the electric grid called the distribution grid,
    which traditionally did not have many sensors because it was only used to deliver
    electricity “one-way” from centralized power plants to consumers. However, rooftop
    solar and other distributed energy resources have created a “two-way” flow of
    electricity on distribution grids. Since the locations and sizes of rooftop solar
    panels are often unknown to electricity system operators, previous work has used
    computer vision techniques on satellite imagery to generate size and location
    data for rooftop solar panels [165, 514, 868]. Further, to ensure that the distribution
    system runs smoothly, recent work has employed techniques such as matrix completion
    and deep neural networks to estimate the state of the system when there are few
    sensors [199, 388, 626]. 2.1.2 Controllable Sources. Controllable low-carbon electricity
    sources can help achieve climate change goals while requiring very few changes
    to how the electric grid is run (since today’s fossil fuel power plants are also
    controllable). ML can support existing controllable technologies while accelerating
    the development of new technologies such as nuclear fusion power plants. Managing
    existing technologies. Many controllable low-carbon technologies are already commercially
    available; these technologies include geothermal, nuclear fission, and (in some
    cases10) dam-based hydropower. ML can provide valuable input in planning where
    these technologies should be deployed and can also help maintain already-operating
    power plants. For instance, recent work has proposed to use ML to identify and
    manage sites for geothermal energy, using satellite imagery and seismic data [593].
    Previous work has also used multi-objective optimization to place hydropower dams
    in a way that satisfies both energy and ecological objectives [856]. Finally,
    ML can help maintain nuclear fission reactors (i.e., nuclear power plants) by
    detecting cracks and anomalies from image and video data [129] or by preemptively
    detecting faults from high-dimensional sensor and simulation data [107]. (The
    authors of [794] speculate that ML and high performance computing could also be
    used to help simulate nuclear waste disposal options or even design next-generation
    nuclear reactors.) Accelerating fusion science. Nuclear fusion reactors [577]
    have the potential to produce safe and carbon-free electricity using a virtually
    limitless hydrogen fuel supply, but currently consume more energy than they produce
    [146]. While considerable scientific and engineering research is still needed,
    ML can help accelerate this work by, e.g., guiding experimental design and monitoring
    physical processes; see also [360]. Fusion reactors require intelligent experimental
    design because they have a large number of tunable parameters; ML can help prioritize
    which parameter configurations should be explored during physical experiments.
    For instance, Google and TAE Technologies have developed a human-in-the-loop experimental
    design algorithm enabling rapid parameter exploration for TAE’s reactor [53].
    Physically monitoring fusion reactors is also an important application for ML.
    Modern reactors attempt to super-heat hydrogen into a plasma state and then stabilize
    it, but during this process, the plasma may experience rapid instabilities that
    damage the reactor. Prior work has tried to preemptively detect disruptions for
    tokamak reactors, using supervised learning methods such as support-vector machines,
    adaptive fuzzy logic, decision trees, and deep learning [110, 413, 567, 811, 846,
    850] on previous disruption data. While many of these methods are tuned to work
    on individual reactors, recent work has shown that deep learning may enable insights
    that generalize to multiple reactors [413]. More generally, rather than simply
    detecting disruptions, scientists need to understand how plasma’s state evolves
    over time, e.g., by finding the solutions of time-dependent magnetohydrodynamic
    equations [57]; speculatively, ML could help characterize this evolution and even
    help steer plasma into safe states through reactor control. ML models for such
    fusion applications would likely employ a combination of simulated11 and experimental
    data, and would need to account for the different physical characteristics, data
    volumes, and simulator speeds or accuracies associated with different reactor
    types. 2.2 Reducing Current-System Impacts While switching to low-carbon electricity
    sources will be essential, in the meantime, it will also be important to mitigate
    emissions from the electricity system as it currently stands. Some methods for
    mitigating current-system impacts include cutting emissions from fossil fuels,
    reducing waste from electricity delivery, and flexibly managing demand to minimize
    its emissions impacts. Reducing life-cycle fossil fuel emissions. Reducing emissions
    from fossil fuels is a necessary stopgap while society transitions towards low-carbon
    electricity. In particular, ML can help prevent the leakage of methane (an extremely
    potent GHG) from natural gas pipelines and compressor stations. Previous and ongoing
    work has used sensor and/or satellite data to proactively suggest pipeline maintenance
    [213, 898] or detect existing leaks [81, 749, 823, 826], and there is a great
    deal of opportunity in this space to improve and scale existing strategies. In
    addition to leak detection, ML can help reduce emissions from freight transportation
    of solid fuels (Section 3), identify and manage storage sites for CO 2 sequestered
    from power plant flue gas (Section 7.2), and optimize power plant parameters to
    reduce CO 2 emissions. In all these cases, projects should be pursued with great
    care so as not to impede or prolong the transition to a low-carbon electricity
    system; ideally, projects should be preceded by system impact analyses to ensure
    that they will indeed decrease GHG emissions. Reducing system waste. As electricity
    gets transported from generators to consumers, some of it gets lost as resistive
    heat on electricity lines. While some of these losses are unavoidable, others
    can be significantly mitigated to reduce waste and emissions. ML can help prevent
    avoidable losses through predictive maintenance, e.g., by suggesting proactive
    electricity grid upgrades (see also Sections 5.3 and 9.2). Prior work has performed
    predictive maintenance using long short-term memory (LSTM) [76], bipartite ranking
    [702], and neural network-plus-clustering techniques [581] on electric grid data,
    and future work will need to improve and/or localize these approaches to different
    contexts. Modeling emissions. Flexibly managing household, commercial, industrial,
    and electric vehicle (EV) demand (as well as energy storage) can help minimize
    electricity-based emissions (Sections 3, 4, 5, and 11), but doing so involves
    understanding what the emissions on the electric grid actually are at any moment.
    Specifically, marginal emissions factors capture the emissions effects of small
    changes in demand at any given time. To inform consumers about marginal emissions
    factors, initiatives such as WattTime [832] and the electricityMap project [789]
    have used ML and regression-based techniques to forecast marginal emissions based
    on electricity and weather data. Recent work has also used ML for trend extraction
    and feature selection within marginal emissions forecasting models [476]. Great
    Britain’s National Grid ESO uses ensemble models to forecast average emissions
    factors, which measure the aggregate emissions intensity of all power plants [576].
    There is still much room to improve the performance of these methods, as well
    as to forecast related quantities such as electricity curtailments (i.e., the
    wasting of usually low-carbon electricity for grid balancing purposes). As most
    existing methods produce point estimates, it would also be important to quantify
    the uncertainty of these estimates to ensure that load-shifting techniques indeed
    decrease (rather than increase) emissions. 2.3 Ensuring Global Impact Much of
    the discussion around electricity systems often focuses on settings such as the
    United States with near universal electricity access and relatively abundant data.
    However, many places that do not share these attributes are still integral to
    tackling climate change [370] and warrant serious consideration. To ensure global
    impact, ML can help improve electricity access and translate electricity system
    insights from high-data to low-data contexts. Improving clean energy access. Improving
    access to clean electricity can address climate change while simultaneously improving
    social and economic development [430, 431]. Specifically, clean electricity provided
    via electric grids, microgrids, or off-grid methods can displace diesel generators,
    wood-burning stoves, and other carbon-emitting energy sources. Figuring out what
    clean electrification methods are best for different areas can require intensive,
    on-the-ground surveying work, but ML can help provide input to this process in
    a scalable manner. For instance, previous work has used image processing, clustering,
    and optimization techniques on satellite imagery to inform electrification initiatives
    [219]. ML can also help operate rural microgrids through accurate forecasts of
    demand and power production [120, 601] as well as tailored optimization and control
    schemes [493], since small microgrids are even harder to balance than country-scale
    electric grids. Generating data to aid energy access policy and better managing
    energy access strategies are therefore two areas in which ML may have promising
    applications. Approaching low-data settings. While ML methods have often been
    applied to grids with widespread sensors, system operators in many countries do
    not collect or share system data. Although these data availability practices may
    evolve, it may meanwhile be beneficial to use ML techniques such as transfer learning
    to translate insights from high-data to low-data settings (especially since all
    electric grids share the same underlying system physics). Developing data-efficient
    ML techniques will likely also be useful in low-data settings; for instance, in
    [680], the authors enforce physical or other domain-specific constraints on weakly
    supervised ML models, allowing these models to learn from very little labeled
    data. ML can also help generate information within low-data settings. For instance,
    recent work has estimated the layout of electricity grids in regions where they
    are not explicitly mapped, using computer vision and graph search techniques on
    satellite imagery [278, 359]. Companies have also used satellite imagery to measure
    power plant CO 2 emissions [114, 301] (also see Section 6.1). Other recent work
    has modeled electricity consumption using regression-based techniques on cellular
    network data [85], which may prove useful in settings with many cellular towers
    but few electric grid sensors. Although low-data settings are generally underexplored
    by the ML community, electricity systems research in these settings presents opportunities
    for both innovative ML and climate change mitigation. 2.4 Discussion Data-driven
    and critical to climate change, electricity systems hold many opportunities for
    ML research and practice. At the same time, applications in this space hold many
    potential pitfalls; for instance, innovations that seek to reduce GHG emissions
    in the oil and gas industries could actually increase emissions by making them
    cheaper to emit [814]. Given these domain-specific nuances, working in this area
    requires close collaborations with electricity system decision-makers and with
    practitioners in fields including electrical engineering, the natural sciences,
    and the social sciences. Interpretable ML may also enable practitioners to better
    understand, apply, and audit models in real-world settings. Similarly, it will
    be important to develop hybrid ML models that explicitly account for system physics
    (see e.g., [132, 164, 304, 680, 843]), directly optimize for domain-specific goals
    [198, 220, 842], or otherwise incorporate or scale existing domain knowledge.
    Finally, since many modern electric grids are not data-abundant (although they
    may be data-driven), understanding how to apply data-driven insights to these
    grids may be the next grand challenge for ML in electricity systems. Skip 3Transportation
    by Lynn H. Kaack Section 3 Transportation by Lynn H. Kaack Transportation systems
    form a complex web that is fundamental to an active and prosperous society. Globally,
    the transportation sector accounts for about a quarter of energy-related CO 2
    emissions [372]. In contrast to the electricity sector, however, transportation
    has not made significant progress to lower its CO 2 emissions [154] and much of
    the sector is regarded as hard to decarbonize [162]. This is because of the high
    energy density of fuels required for many types of vehicles, which constrains
    low-carbon alternatives, and because transport policies directly impact end-users
    and are thus more likely to be controversial. Passenger and freight transportation
    are each responsible for about half of transport GHG emissions [712]. Both freight
    and passengers can travel by road, by rail, by water, or by air (referred to as
    transport modes). Different modes carry vastly different carbon emission intensities.12
    At present, more than two-thirds of transportation emissions are from road travel
    [712], but air travel has the highest emission intensity and is responsible for
    an increasingly large share. Strategies to reduce GHG emissions13 from transportation
    consist of [712]: reducing transport activity; improving vehicle efficiency; alternative
    fuels and electrification; and modal shift (shifting to lower-carbon options,
    like rail). Each of these mitigation strategies offers opportunities for ML (Figure
    2). While many of us probably think of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and ride-sharing
    when we think of transport and ML, these technologies have uncertain impacts on
    GHG emissions [820], potentially even increasing them. We discuss these disruptive
    technologies in Section 3.1 but show that ML can play a role for decarbonizing
    transportation that goes much further. ML can improve vehicle engineering, enable
    intelligent infrastructure, and provide policy-relevant information. Many interventions
    that reduce GHG emissions in the transportation sector require changes in planning,
    maintenance, and operations of transportation systems, even though the GHG reduction
    potential of those measures might not be immediately apparent. ML can help in
    implementing such interventions, for example, by providing better demand forecasts.
    Typically, ML strategies are most effective in tandem with strong public policies.
    While we do not cover all ML applications in the transportation sector, we aim
    to include those areas that can conceivably reduce GHG emissions. Fig. 2. Fig.
    2. Selected opportunities to reduce GHG emissions from transportation using ML,
    as described in Section 3. 3.1 Reducing Transport Activity A colossal amount of
    transport occurs each day across the world, but much of this mileage occurs inefficiently,
    resulting in needless GHG emissions. With the help of ML, the number of vehicle-miles
    traveled can be reduced by making long trips less necessary, increasing loading,
    and optimizing vehicle routing. Here, we discuss the first two in depth—for a
    discussion of ML and routing, see for example [873]. Understanding transportation
    data. Many areas of transportation lack data, and decision-makers often design
    infrastructure and policy with uncertain information. In recent years, new types
    of sensors have become available, and ML can turn this raw data into useful information.
    Traditionally, traffic is monitored with ground-based counters that are installed
    on selected roads. A variety of technologies are used, such as inductive loop
    detectors or pneumatic tubes. Traffic is sometimes monitored with video systems,
    in particular when counting pedestrians and cyclists, which can be automated with
    computer vision [870]. Since counts on most roads are often available only over
    short time frames, these roads are modeled by looking at known traffic patterns
    for similar roads. ML methods, such as SVMs and neural networks, have made it
    easier to classify roads with similar traffic patterns [270, 454, 796]. As ground-based
    counters require costly installation and maintenance, many countries do not have
    such systems. Vehicles can also be detected in high-resolution satellite images
    with high accuracy [177, 390, 566, 747], and image counts can serve to estimate
    average vehicle traffic [405]. Similarly, ML methods can help with imputing missing
    data for precise bottom-up estimation of GHG emissions [583] and they are also
    applied in simulation models of vehicle emissions [46]. Modeling demand. Modeling
    demand and planning new infrastructure can significantly shape how long trips
    are and which transport modes are chosen by passengers and shippers—for example,
    discouraging sprawl and creating new transportation links can both reduce GHG
    emissions. ML can provide information about mobility patterns, which is directly
    necessary for agent-based travel demand models, one of the main transport planning
    tools [864]. For example, ML makes it possible to estimate origin-destination
    demand from traffic counts [504], and it offers new methods for spatio-temporal
    road traffic forecasting—which do not always outperform other statistical methods
    [223] but may transfer well between areas [776]. Also, short-term forecasting
    of public transit ridership can improve with ML; see for example [158, 586]. ML
    is particularly relevant for deducing information from novel data—for example,
    learning about the behavior of public transit users from smart card data [280,
    515]. Also, mobile phone sensors provide new means to understand personal travel
    demand and the urban topology, such as walking route choices [795]. Similarly,
    ML-based modeling of demand can help mitigate climate change by improving operational
    efficiency of modes that emit significant CO 2 , such as aviation. ML can help
    predict runway demand and aircraft taxi time in order to reduce the excess fuel
    burned in the air and on the ground due to congestion in airports [379, 474].
    Shared mobility. In the passenger sector, shared mobility (such as on-demand ride
    services or vehicle-sharing14), is undoubtedly disrupting the way people travel
    and think about vehicle ownership, and ML plays an integral part in running and
    optimizing these services (e.g., [768, 837]). However, it is largely unclear what
    the impact of this development will be on GHG emissions. For example, shared cars
    can actually cause more people to travel by car, as opposed to using public transportation.
    Similarly, on-demand taxi services add mileage when traveling without a customer,
    possibly negating any GHG emission savings [765]. On the other hand, shared mobility
    can lead to higher utilization of each vehicle, which means a more efficient use
    of materials [341]. The use of newer and more efficient vehicles, ideally electric
    ones, could increase with vehicle-sharing concepts, reducing GHG emissions. Some
    of the issues raised above could also perhaps be overcome by making taxis autonomous.
    Such vehicles also might integrate better with public transportation, and offer
    new concepts for pooled rides, which substantially reduce the emissions per person-mile.
    ML methods can help to understand the energy impact of shared mobility concepts.
    For example, they can be used to predict if a customer decides to share a ride
    with other passengers from an on-demand ride service [133]. For decision-makers
    it is important to have access to timely location-specific empirical analysis
    to understand if a ride share service is taking away customers from low-carbon
    transit modes and increasing the use of cars. Some local governments are beginning
    to require data-sharing from these providers (see Section 4.3). Car-sharing services
    using AVs could yield GHG emission savings when they encourage people to use public
    transit for part of the journey [552] or with autonomous EVs [408]. However, using
    autonomous shared vehicles alone could increase the total vehicle-miles traveled
    and therefore do not necessarily lead to lower emissions as long as the vehicles
    have internal combustion engines (or electrical engines on a “dirty” electrical
    grid) [131, 495]. We see the intersection of shared mobility, autonomous and EVs,
    and smart public transit—prioritizing low-carbon vehicle technologies and shared
    transportation—as a path where ML can make a contribution to shaping future mobility.
    See also Section 3.2 for more on AVs. When designing and promoting new mobility
    services, it is important that industry and public policy prioritize lowering
    GHG emissions. Misaligned incentives in the early stages of technological development
    could result in the lock-in to a service with high GHG emissions [36, 44]. Freight
    routing and consolidation. Bundling shipments together, which is referred to as
    freight consolidation, dramatically reduces the number of trips (and therefore
    the GHG emissions). The same is true for changing routing so that trucks do not
    have to return empty. As rail and water modes require much larger loads than trucks,
    consolidation also enables shipments to use these modes for part of the journey
    [407]. Freight consolidation and routing decisions are often taken by third-party
    logistics service providers and other freight forwarders, such as in the less-than-truckload
    market, which deals with shipments of smaller sizes. ML offers opportunities to
    optimize this complex interaction of shipment sizes, modes, origin-destination
    pairs, and service requirements. Many problem settings are addressed with methods
    from the field of operations research. There is evidence that ML can improve upon
    these methods, in particular mixed-integer linear programming [70]. Other proposed
    and deployed applications of ML include predicting arrival times or demand, identifying
    and planning around transportation disruptions [279], and clustering suppliers
    by their geographical location and common shipping destinations. Proposed planning
    approaches include designing allocation algorithms and freight auctions, and ML
    has for example been shown to help pick good algorithms and parameters to solve
    auction markets [708]. Alternatives to transport. Disruptive technologies that
    are based on ML could replace or reduce transportation demand. For example, additive
    manufacturing (AM) or 3-D printing has (limited) potential to reduce freight transport
    by producing lighter goods and enabling production closer to the consumer [407].
    ML can be a valuable tool for improving AM processes [859]. ML can also help to
    improve virtual communication [733]. If passenger trips are replaced by telepresence,
    travel demand can be reduced, as has been shown for example in public agencies
    [34] and for scientific teams [518]. However, it is uncertain to what extent virtual
    meetings replace physical travel, or if they may actually give rise to more face-to-face
    meetings [762]. 3.2 Improving Vehicle Efficiency Most vehicles are not very efficient
    compared to what is technically possible: for example, aircraft carbon intensity
    is expected to decline by more than a third with respect to 2012, simply by virtue
    of newer models replacing aging jets [713]. Both the design of the vehicle and
    the way it is operated can increase the fuel economy. Here, we discuss how ML
    can help design more efficient vehicles and the impacts that autonomous driving
    may have on GHG emissions. Encouraging drivers to adopt more efficient vehicles
    is also a priority; while we do not focus on this here, ML plays a role in studying
    consumer preferences in vehicle markets [103]. Designing for efficiency. There
    are many ways to reduce the energy a vehicle uses—such as more efficient engines,
    improved aerodynamics, hybrid electric engines, and reducing the vehicle’s weight
    or tire resistance. These different strategies require a broad range of engineering
    techniques, many of which can benefit from ML. For example, ML is applied in advanced
    combustion engine design [384]. Hybrid EVs, which are more efficient than combustion
    engines alone, rely on power management methods that can be improved with ML [15].
    Aerodynamic efficiency improvements need turbulence modeling that is often computationally
    intensive and relies heavily on ML-based surrogate models [865]. Aerodynamic improvements
    can not only be made by vehicle design but also by rearranging load. Lai et al.
    [461] use computer vision to detect aerodynamically inefficient loading on freight
    trains. AM (3-D printing) can produce lighter parts in vehicles, such as road
    vehicles and aircraft, that reduce energy consumption [341, 407]. ML is applied
    to improve those processes, for example through failure detection [722, 730] or
    material design [309]. Autonomous vehicles. ML is essential in the development
    of AVs, including in such basic tasks as following the road and detecting obstacles
    [87].15 While AVs could reduce energy consumption—for example, by reducing traffic
    congestion and inducing efficiency through eco-driving—it is also possible that
    AVs will lead to an increase in overall road traffic that nullifies efficiency
    gains. (For an overview of possible energy impacts of AVs, see [95, 820], and
    for broader impacts on mobility, see [327].) Two advantages of AVs in the freight
    sector promise to cut GHG emissions: First, small AVs, such as delivery robots
    and drones, could reduce the energy consumption of last-mile delivery [758], though
    they come with regulatory challenges [517]. Second, trucks can reduce energy consumption
    by platooning (driving very close together to reduce air resistance), thereby
    alleviating some of the challenges that come with electrifying long-distance road
    freight [318]. Platooning relies on autonomous driving and communication technologies
    that allow vehicles to brake and accelerate simultaneously. ML can help to develop
    AV technologies specifically aimed at reducing energy consumption. For example,
    Wu et al. [851, 852] develop AV controllers based on RL to smooth out traffic
    involving non-AVs. Their studies of emergent behaviors in mixed-autonomy environments
    aim to understand the impact that varying shares of AVs can have on potentially
    reducing congestion-related energy consumption ML methods can also help to understand
    driving practices that are more energy efficient. For example, Jiménez et al.
    [392] use data from smart phone sensors to identify driving behavior that leads
    to higher energy consumption in EVs. 3.3 Alternative Fuels and Electrification
    Electric vehicles. EV technologies—using batteries, hydrogen fuel cells, or electrified
    roads and railways—are regarded as a primary means to decarbonize transport. EVs
    can have very low GHG emissions—depending, of course, on the carbon intensity
    of the electricity. ML is vital for a range of different problems related to EVs.
    Rigas et al. [684] detail methods by which ML can improve charge scheduling, congestion
    management, and vehicle-to-grid algorithms. ML methods have also been applied
    to battery energy management (for example charge estimation [330] or optimization
    in hybrid EVs [15]), and to detect faults and lateral misalignment in wireless
    charging of EVs [780]. As more people drive EVs, understanding their use patterns
    will become more important. Modeling charging behavior will be useful for grid
    operators looking to predict electric load. For this application, it is possible
    to analyze residential EV charging behavior from aggregate electricity load (energy
    disaggregation, see also Section 4.1) [827]. Also, in-vehicle sensors and communication
    data are increasingly becoming available and offer an opportunity to understand
    travel and charging behavior of EV owners, which can for example inform the placement
    of charging stations [779] or alternatives such as battery swapping stations.
    Battery EVs are typically not used for more than a fraction of the day, allowing
    them to act as energy storage for the grid at other times, where charging and
    discharging is controlled for example by price signals [265] (see Sections 2.1.1
    and 2.2). There is much potential for ML (e.g., RL [810]) to improve such vehicle-to-grid
    technology, which, like other mechanisms for grid energy storage (see Section
    2.1.1), can help to reduce GHG emissions from electricity generation. Vehicle-to-grid
    technology comes with private and social financial benefits. However, consumers
    are expected to be reluctant to agree to such services, as they might not want
    to compromise their driving range [343]. Finally, ML can also play a role in the
    research and development of batteries, a decisive technology for EV costs and
    usability. Work in this area has focused on predicting battery state, degradation,
    and remaining lifetime using supervised learning techniques, fuzzy logic, and
    clustering [42, 104, 218, 358, 414, 725, 735, 819, 854]. However, many models
    developed in academia are based on laboratory data that do not account for real-world
    factors such as environmental conditions [735, 819, 854]. By contrast, industry
    lags behind in ML modeling, but real-world operational data are readily available.
    Merging these two perspectives could yield significant benefits for the field.
    Alternative fuels. Much of the transportation sector is highly dependent on liquid
    fossil fuels. Aviation, long-distance road transportation, and ocean shipping
    require fuels with high energy density and thus are not conducive to electrification
    [162]. Electrofuels [98], solar fuels (Section 2.1.1), biofuels [6], hydrogen
    [111, 803], and perhaps natural gas [792] offer alternatives, but the use of these
    fuels is constrained by factors such as cost, land-use, and (for hydrogen and
    natural gas) incompatibility with current infrastructure [162]. Electrofuels and
    biofuels have the potential to serve as low-carbon drop-in fuels that retain the
    properties of fossil fuels, such as high energy density, while retaining compatibility
    with the existing fleet of vehicles and the current fuel infrastructure [407].
    Fuels such as electrofuels and hydrogen can be produced using electricity-intensive
    processes and can be stored at lower cost than electricity. Thus, as a form of
    energy storage, these fuels could provide services to the electricity grid by
    enabling flexible power use and balancing variable electricity generators (Section
    2.1.1). Given their relative long-term importance and early stage of development,
    they present a critical opportunity to mitigate climate change. ML techniques
    may present opportunities for improvement at various stages of research and development
    of alternative fuels (similar to applications in Section 2.1.1). 3.4 Modal Shift
    Shifting passengers and freight to low carbon-intensity modes is one of the most
    important means to decarbonize transport. This modal shift in passenger transportation
    can for example involve providing people with public transit, which requires analyzing
    mode choice and travel demand data. ML can also make low-carbon freight modes
    more competitive by helping to coordinate intermodal transport. Passenger preferences.
    ML can improve our understanding about passengers’ travel mode choices, which
    in turn informs transportation planning, such as where public transit should be
    built. Some recent studies have shown that supervised ML based on survey data
    can improve passenger mode choice models [322, 571, 597]. Seo et al. propose to
    conduct long-term travel surveys with online learning, which reduces the demand
    on respondents, while obtaining high data quality [724]. Sun et al. [770] use
    SVMs and neural networks for analyzing preferences of customers traveling by high
    speed rail in China. There is also work on inferring people’s travel modes and
    destinations from social media or various mobile phone sensors such as GPS (transportation
    mode detection), e.g., [156, 798]. Also in the freight sector, ML has been applied
    to analyze modal trade-offs, for example, by imputing data on counterfactual mode
    choices [706]. Enabling low-carbon options. In order to incentivize more users
    to choose low-carbon transport modes, their costs and service quality can be improved.
    Many low-carbon modes must be integrated with other modes of transportation to
    deliver the same level of service. For example, when traveling by train, the trip
    to and from the station will often be by car, taxi, bus, or bike. There are many
    opportunities for ML to facilitate a better integration of modes, both in the
    passenger and freight sectors. ML can also help to improve the operation of low-carbon
    modes, for example, by reducing the operations and maintenance costs of rail [383]
    and predicting track degradation [746]. Bike sharing and electric scooter services
    can offer low-carbon alternatives for urban mobility that do not require ownership
    and integrate well with public transportation. ML studies help to understand how
    usage patterns for bike stations depend on their immediate urban surroundings
    [364]. ML can also help solve the bike sharing rebalancing problem, where shared
    bikes accumulate in one location and are lacking in other locations, by improving
    forecasts of bike demand and inventory [675]. Singla et al. [739] propose a pricing
    mechanism based on online learning to provide monetary incentives for bike users
    to help rebalancing. By producing accurate travel time estimates, ML can provide
    tools that help to integrate bike shares with other modes of transportation [281].
    Many emerging bike and scooter sharing services are dockless, which means that
    they are parked anywhere in public space and can block sidewalks [25]. ML has
    been applied to monitor public sentiment about such bike shares via tweets [775].
    ML could also provide tools and information for regulators to ensure that public
    space can be used by everyone [741]. Coordination between modes resulting in faster
    and more reliable transit times could increase the amount of people or goods traveling
    on low-carbon modes such as rail. ML algorithms could be applied to make public
    transportation faster and easier to use. For example, there is a rich literature
    exploring ML methods to predict bus arrival times and their uncertainty [18, 526].
    Often freight is packaged so that it can switch between different modes of transport
    easily. Such intermodal transportation relies on low-carbon modes such as rail
    and water for part of the journey [407]. ML can contribute by improving predictions
    of the estimated time of arrival (for example, of freight trains [56]) or the
    weight or volume of expected freight (for example, for roll-on/roll-off transport—often
    abbreviated as Ro-Ro [560]). Intelligent transport systems of different modes
    could be combined and enable more efficient multimodal freight transportation
    [407]. Some modes with high GHG emissions, such as trucks, can be particularly
    cost-competitive in regions with lax enforcement of regulation, as they can benefit
    from overloading and not obeying labor or safety rules [407]. ML can assist public
    institutions with enforcing their regulations. For example, image recognition
    can help law enforcement detect overloading of trucks [888]. 3.5 Discussion Decarbonizing
    transport is essential to a low-carbon society, and there are numerous applications
    where ML can make an impact. This is because transportation causes a large share
    of GHG emissions, but reducing them has been slow and complex. Solutions are likely
    very technical, are highly dependent on existing infrastructure, and require detailed
    understanding of passengers’ and freight companies’ behavior. ML can help decarbonize
    transportation by providing data, gaining knowledge from data, planning, and automation.
    Moreover, ML is fundamental to shared mobility, AVs, EVs, and smart public transit,
    which, with the right incentives, can be used to enable significant reductions
    in GHG emissions. Skip 4Buildings & Cities by Nikola Milojevic-Dupont & Lynn H.
    Kaack Section 4 Buildings & Cities by Nikola Milojevic-Dupont & Lynn H. Kaack
    Buildings offer some of the lowest-hanging fruit when it comes to reducing GHG
    emissions. While the energy consumed in buildings is responsible for a quarter
    of global energy-related emissions [372], a combination of easy-to-implement fixes
    and state-of-the-art strategies16 could reduce emissions for existing buildings
    by up to 90% [802]. It is possible today for buildings to consume almost no energy
    [595].17 Many of these energy efficiency measures actually result in overall cost
    savings [754] and simultaneously yield other benefits, such as cleaner air for
    occupants. This potential can be achieved while maintaining the services that
    buildings provide—and even while extending them to more people, as climate change
    will necessitate. For example, with the changing climate, more people will need
    access to air conditioning in regions where deadly heat waves will become common
    [553, 554]. Two major challenges are heterogeneity and inertia. Buildings vary
    according to age, construction, usage, and ownership, so optimal strategies vary
    widely depending on the context. For instance, buildings with access to cheap,
    low-carbon electricity may have less need for expensive features such as intelligent
    light bulbs. Buildings also have very long lifespans; thus, it is necessary both
    to create new, energy-efficient buildings, and to retrofit old buildings to be
    as efficient as possible [150]. Urban planning and public policy can play a major
    role in reducing emissions by providing infrastructure, financial incentives,
    or energy standards for buildings [536].18 ML provides critical tools for supporting
    both building managers and policymakers in their efforts to reduce GHG emissions
    (Figure 3). At the level of building management, ML can help select strategies
    that are tailored to individual buildings, and can also contribute to implementing
    those strategies via smart control systems (Section 4.1). At the level of urban
    planning, ML can be used to gather and make sense of data to inform policymakers
    (Section 4.2). Finally, we consider how ML can help cities as a whole to transition
    to low-carbon futures (Section 4.3). Fig. 3. Fig. 3. Selected opportunities to
    reduce GHG emissions from buildings and cities using ML, as described in Section
    4. 4.1 Optimizing Buildings In designing new buildings and improving existing
    ones, there are numerous technologies that can reduce GHG emissions, often saving
    money in the process [276, 499, 595, 754, 802]. ML can accelerate these strategies
    by (i) modeling data on energy consumption and (ii) optimizing energy use (in
    smart buildings). Modeling building energy. An essential step towards energy efficiency
    is making sense of the increasing amounts of data produced by meters and home
    energy monitors (see for example [723]). This can take the form of energy demand
    forecasts for specific buildings, which are useful for power companies (Section
    2.1.1) and in evaluating building design and operation strategies [20]. Traditionally,
    energy demand forecasts are based on models of the physical structure of a building
    that are essentially massive thermodynamics computations. ML has the potential
    to speed up these computations greatly, either by ignoring physical knowledge
    of the building entirely [452, 617], by incorporating it into the computation
    [195], or by learning to approximate the physical model to reduce the need for
    expensive simulation (surrogate models) [274]. Learning how to transfer the knowledge
    gained from modeling one building to another can make it easier to render precise
    estimations of more buildings. For instance, Mocanu et al. [544] modeled building
    load profiles with RL and deep belief networks using data on commercial and residential
    buildings; they then used approximate RL and transfer learning to make predictions
    about new buildings, enabling the transfer of knowledge from commercial to residential
    buildings, and from gas- to power-heated buildings. Within a single building,
    understanding which appliances drive energy use (energy disaggregation) is crucial
    for targeting efficiency measures, and can motivate behavioral changes. Promising
    ML approaches to this problem include hidden Markov models [445], sparse coding
    algorithms for structured prediction [443], harmonic analysis that picks out the
    “signatures” of individual appliances [750], and deep neural networks [423]. To
    verify the success or failure of energy efficiency interventions, statistical
    ML offers methods for causal inference. For example, Burlig et al. [102] used
    Lasso regression on hourly electricity consumption data from schools in California
    to find that energy efficiency interventions fall short of the expected savings.
    Such problems could represent a useful application of deep learning methods for
    counterfactual prediction [332]. Smart buildings. Intelligent control systems
    in buildings can decrease their carbon footprint both by reducing the energy consumed
    and by providing means to integrate lower-carbon sources into the electricity
    mix [277]. Specifically, ML can reduce energy usage by allowing devices and systems
    to adapt to usage patterns. Further, buildings can respond to signals from the
    electricity grid, providing flexibility to the grid operator and lowering costs
    to the consumer (Section 2.1.1). Many critical systems inside buildings can be
    made radically more efficient. While this is also true for various appliances
    such as refrigerators and lightbulbs, we focus on the example of heating, ventilation,
    and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, both because they are notoriously inefficient
    and because they account for more than half of the energy consumed in buildings
    [499]. There are several promising ways to enhance HVAC operating performance,
    each providing substantial opportunities for using ML: forecasting what temperatures
    are needed throughout the system, better control to achieve those temperatures,
    and fault detection. Forecasting temperatures, as with modeling energy use in
    buildings, has traditionally been performed using detailed physical models of
    the system involved; however, ML approaches such as deep belief networks can potentially
    increase accuracy with less computational expense [4, 255] (see also Section 5.3).
    For control, Kazmi et al. [417] used deep RL to achieve a scalable 20% reduction
    of energy while requiring only three sensors: air temperature, water temperature,
    and energy use (see also Section 5.3 for similarly substantial gains in datacenter
    cooling). Finally, ML can automate building diagnostics and maintenance through
    fault-detection. For example, the energy efficiency of cooling systems can degrade
    if refrigerant levels are low [435]; ML approaches are well-suited to detect faults
    in these systems. Wang et al. [829] treated HVAC fault-detection as a one-class
    classification problem, using only temperature readings for their predictions.
    Deep autoencoders can be used to simplify information about machine operation
    so that deep neural networks can then more easily predict multiple kinds of faults
    [387]. Many systems within buildings—such as lights and heating—can also adjust
    how they operate based on whether a building or room is occupied, thereby improving
    both occupant comfort and energy use [614]. ML can help these systems dynamically
    adapt to changes in occupancy patterns [669]. Moreover, occupancy detection itself
    represents an opportunity for ML algorithms, ranging from decision trees [193,
    882] to deep neural networks [896] that take input from occupancy sensors [193],
    WiFi signals [896, 897], or appliance power consumption data [882]. Energy game-theoretic
    frameworks can also incentivize occupants to actively minimize their energy demand,
    and ML can help here to develop tailored incentives based on different energy
    usage behaviors [159]. In Section 2.1.1, we discussed how using variable low-carbon
    energy can mean that the supply and price of electricity vary over time. Thus,
    energy flexibility in buildings is increasingly useful to schedule consumption
    when supply is high [683]. For this, automated demand-side response [357] can
    respond to electricity prices, smart meter signals, or learned user preferences
    [393]. Edge computing can be used to process data from distributed sensors and
    other Internet of Things devices, and deep RL can then use this data to efficiently
    schedule energy use [489], at the level of single or multiple buildings, or at
    the microgrid and grid level [631]. While smart building technologies have the
    capability to significantly increase efficiency, we should note that there are
    potential drawbacks [346]. First, smart building devices and connection networks,
    like wireless sensor networks, consume energy themselves. Deep neural networks
    can be used to monitor and optimize such operations [39]. Second, rebound effects
    are likely to happen in certain cases [45], leading to additional building energy
    consumption typically ranging between 10 and 20% [671]. Third, if control systems
    optimize for costs, interventions do not necessarily translate into energy efficiency
    measures or GHG reductions. Therefore, public policies are needed to mandate,
    support and complement the actions of individual building managers [499]. Another
    concern in the case of widespread adoption of smart meters is the impact on mineral
    use and embodied energy use arising from their production [736]. Finally, smart
    home applications present security and privacy risks [144] that require adequate
    regulation. 4.2 Urban Planning For many impactful mitigation strategies—such as
    district heating and cooling, neighborhood planning, and large-scale retrofitting
    of existing buildings—coordination at the district and city level is essential.
    Policymakers use instruments such as building codes, retrofitting subsidies, investments
    in public utilities, and public–private partnerships in order to reduce GHG emissions
    without compromising equity. Where energy-use data on individual buildings exist,
    ML can be used to derive higher-level patterns. However, many regions of the world
    have almost no energy consumption data, which can make it difficult to design
    targeted mitigation strategies. ML is uniquely capable of predicting energy consumption
    and GHG mitigation potential at scale from other types of available data, thereby
    guiding policy design [536]. Modeling energy use across buildings. Urban Building
    Energy Models (UBEMs) provide simplified information on the energy use of all
    buildings across a city. These are different from individual building models,
    which model energy use of only specific buildings, but with finer details and
    temporal granularity (Section 4.1). While UBEMs have yet to be adopted at scale,
    they are expected to become fundamental for enabling localized action by city
    planners [677]. UBEMs can for example be used for planning and operating district
    heating and cooling, where a central plant supplies many households in a district.
    In turn, district heating and cooling reduces HVAC energy consumption and can
    provide flexible load [808], but it needs large amounts of data at the district
    level for implementation and operation. UBEMs include features such as the location,
    geometries, and various other attributes of interest like building footprint,
    usage, material, roof type, immediate surroundings, and the like. ML can be used
    to held predict energy consumption from such features. For example, Kolter and
    Ferreira used Gaussian process regression to predict energy use from features
    such as property class or the presence of central air conditioning [444]. Based
    on energy data disclosed by residents of New York City, Kontokosta and colleagues
    used various ML methods to predict the energy use of the city’s 1.1 million buildings
    [448], analyzed the effect of energy disclosure on the demand [610], and developed
    a system for ranking buildings based on energy efficiency [611]. Zhang et al.
    [879] matched residential energy consumption survey data with public use microdata
    samples to estimate residential energy consumption at the neighborhood level.
    Using five commonly accessible features of buildings and climate, Robinson et
    al. predict commercial building energy use across large American cities [689].
    Beyond energy prediction, buildings’ features can be used by ML algorithms to
    pinpoint which buildings have the highest retrofit potential. Simple building
    characteristics and surrounding environmental factors—both potentially available
    at scale—can be used [83, 432]. There have also been attempts to upscale individual-building
    energy models to the district scale. Using deep neural networks for hybrid ML-physical
    modelling, Nutkiewicz et al. provided precise energy demand forecasts that account
    for inter-building energy dynamics and urban microclimate factors for all buildings
    on a campus [589]. Gathering infrastructure data. Specifics about building infrastructure
    can often be predicted using ML techniques. Remote sensing is key to inferring
    infrastructure data [79, 224, 339, 496, 535, 868] as satellite data19 present
    a source of information that is globally available and largely consistent worldwide.
    For example, using remote sensing data, Geiß et al. [273] clustered buildings
    into types to assess the potential of district heat in a German town. The resolution
    of infrastructure data ranges from coarse localization of all buildings at the
    global scale [224], to precise 3D reconstruction of a neighborhood [79]. It is
    possible to produce a global map of human settlement footprints at meter-level
    resolution from satellite radar images [224]. For this, Esch et al. used highly
    automated learners, which make classification at such scale possible by retraining
    locally. Segmentation of high-resolution satellite images can now generate exact
    building footprints at a national scale [535]. Energy-relevant building attributes,
    such as the presence of photovoltaic panels, can also be retrieved from these
    images [868] (see Section 2.1.1). To generate 3D models, LiDAR data are often
    used to retrieve heights or classify buildings at city scale [339, 496], but its
    collection is expensive. Recent research showed that heights can be predicted
    even without such elevation data, as demonstrated by [77, 537], who predicted
    these from real estate records, census data and features characterizing the neighborhood
    of each building. Studies, which for now are small scale, aim for complete 3D
    reconstruction with class labels for different components of buildings [79]. 4.3
    The Future of Cities Since most of the resources of the world are ultimately channeled
    into cities, municipal governments have a unique opportunity to mitigate climate
    change. City governments regulate (and sometimes operate) transportation, buildings,
    and economic activity. They handle such diverse issues as energy, water, waste,
    crime, health, and noise. Recently, data and ML have become more common for improving
    efficiency in such areas, giving rise to the notion of smart city. While the phrase
    smart city encompasses a wide array of technologies [579], here we discuss only
    applications that are relevant to reducing GHG emissions. Data for smart cities.
    Increasingly, important aspects of city life come with digital information that
    can make the city function in a more coordinated way. Habibzadeh et al. [319]
    differentiate between hard-sensing, i.e., fixed-location-dedicated sensors like
    traffic cameras, and soft-sensing, for example, from mobile devices. Hard sensing
    is the primary data collection paradigm in many smart city applications, as it
    is adapted to precisely meet the application requirements. However, there is a
    growing volume of data coming from soft sensing, due to the widespread adoption
    of personal devices like smartphones that can provide movement data and geotagged
    pictures.20 Urban computing [886] is an emerging field looking at data analytics
    in urban spaces, and aiming to yield insights for data-driven policies. For example,
    clustering anonymized credit card payments makes it possible to model different
    communities and lifestyles—of which the sustainability can be assessed [181].
    Jiang et al. provides a review of urban computing from mobile phone traces [391].21
    Relevant information on the urban space can also be learned from social media
    activity, e.g., on Twitter, as reviewed in [367, 703]. There are, however, numerous
    challenges in making sense of this wealth of data (see [558]), and privacy considerations
    are of paramount importance when collecting or working with many of these data
    sources. First, cities need to obtain relevant data on activities that directly
    or indirectly consume energy, and such data are often proprietary. To obtain these
    data, the city of Los Angeles now requires all mobility as a service providers,
    i.e., vehicle-sharing companies, to use an open-source application programming
    interface. Data such as location, use, and condition of all those vehicles, which
    can be useful in guiding regulation, are thus transmitted to the city [134]. ML
    can also distill information on urban issues related to climate change through
    web-scraping and text-mining, e.g., [775]. As discussed above (Section 4.2), ML
    can also be used to infer infrastructure data. Second, smart city applications
    must transmit high volumes of data in real-time. ML is key to preprocessing large
    amounts of data in large sensor networks, allowing only what is relevant to be
    transmitted, instead of all the raw data that is being collected [480, 672, 804].
    Similar techniques also help to reduce the amount of energy consumed during transmission
    itself [563]. Third, urban policy-making based on intelligent infrastructure faces
    major challenges with data management [286]. Smart cities require the integration
    of multiple large and heterogeneous sources of data, for which ML can be a valuable
    tool, which includes data matching [89, 190], data fusion [885], and ensemble
    learning [451]. Low-emissions infrastructure. When smart city projects are properly
    integrated into urban planning, they can make cities more sustainable and foster
    low-carbon lifestyles (see [563, 602, 853] for extensive reviews on this topic).
    Different types of infrastructure interact, meaning that planning strategies should
    be coordinated to achieve mitigation goals. For instance, urban sprawl influences
    the energy use from transport, as wider cities tend to be more car-oriented [151,
    189, 228]. ML-based analysis has shown that the development of efficient public
    transportation is dependent on both the extent of urban sprawl and the local development
    around transportation hubs [547, 737]. Cities can reduce GHG emissions by coordinating
    between infrastructure sectors and better adapting services to the needs of the
    inhabitants. ML and AI can help, for example, to coordinate district heating and
    cooling networks, solar power generation, and charging stations for EVs and bikes
    [602], and can improve public lighting systems by regulating light intensity based
    on historical patterns of foot traffic [169]. Due to inherent variability in energy
    demand and supply, there is a need for uncertainty estimation, e.g., using Markov
    chain Monte Carlo methods or Gaussian processes [602]. Currently, most smart city
    projects for urban climate change mitigation are implemented in wealthier regions
    such as the United States, China, and the European Union.22 The literature on
    city-scale mitigation strategies is also strongly biased towards the Global North
    [466], while key mitigation challenges are expected to arise from the Global South
    [570]. Infrastructure models described in Section 4.2 could be used to plan low-carbon
    neighborhoods without relying on advanced smart city technologies. To transfer
    strategies across cities, it is possible to cluster similar cities based on climate-relevant
    dimensions [326, 494]. Creutzig et al. [151] related the energy use of 300 cities
    worldwide to historical structural factors such as fuel taxes (which have a strong
    impact on urban sprawl). Other relevant applications include groupings of transportation
    systems [326] using a latent class choice model, or of street networks [494] to
    identify common patterns in urban development using hierarchical clustering. 4.4
    Discussion We have shown many different ways that ML can help to reduce GHG emissions
    from buildings and cities. A central challenge in this sector is the availability
    of high-quality data for training the algorithms, which rarely go beyond main
    cities or represent the full spectrum of building types. Techniques for obtaining
    these data, however, can themselves be an important application for ML (e.g.,
    via computer vision algorithms to parse satellite imagery). Realizing the potential
    of data-driven urban infrastructure can advance mitigation goals while improving
    the well-being of citizens [50, 150, 802]. Skip 5Industry by Anna Waldman-Brown
    Section 5 Industry by Anna Waldman-Brown Industrial production, logistics, and
    building materials are leading causes of difficult-to-eliminate GHG emissions
    [162]. Fortunately for ML researchers, the global industrial sector spends billions
    of dollars annually gathering data on factories and supply chains [310]—aided
    by improvements in the cost and accessibility of sensors and other data-gathering
    mechanisms (such as QR codes and image recognition). The availability of large
    quantities of data, combined with affordable cloud-based storage and computing,
    indicates that industry may be an excellent place for ML to make a positive climate
    impact. ML demonstrates considerable potential for reducing industrial GHG emissions
    under the following circumstances: When there is enough accessible, high-quality
    data around specific processes or transport routes. When firms have an incentive
    to share their proprietary data and/or algorithms with researchers and other firms.
    When aspects of production or shipping can be readily fine-tuned or adjusted,
    and there are clear objective functions. When firms’ incentives align with reducing
    emissions (for example, through efficiency gains, regulatory compliance, or high
    GHG prices). In particular, ML can potentially reduce global emissions (Figure
    4) by helping to streamline supply chains, improve production quality, predict
    machine breakdowns, optimize heating and cooling systems, and prioritize the use
    of clean electricity over fossil fuels [74, 227, 416, 880]. However, it is worth
    noting that greater efficiency may increase the production of goods and thus GHG
    emissions (via rebound effects) unless industrial actors have sufficient incentives
    to reduce overall emissions [748]. Fig. 4. Fig. 4. Selected opportunities to reduce
    GHG emissions in industry using ML, as described in Section 5. 5.1 Optimizing
    Supply Chains In 2006, at least two Scottish seafood firms flew hundreds of metric
    tons of shrimp from Scotland to China and Thailand for peeling, then back to Scotland
    for sale—because they could save on labor costs [147]. This indicates the complexity
    of today’s globalized supply chains, i.e., the organizational processes and shipping
    networks that are required to bring a product from producer to final consumer.
    ML can help reduce emissions in supply chains by intelligently predicting supply
    and demand, identifying lower-carbon products, and optimizing shipping routes.
    (For details on shipping and delivery optimization, see Section 3.) However, for
    many of these applications to reduce emissions, firms’ financial incentives must
    also align with climate change mitigation through carbon pricing or other policy
    mechanisms. Reducing overproduction. The production, shipment, and climate-controlled
    warehousing of excess products is a major source of industrial GHG emissions,
    particularly for time-dependent goods such as perishable food or retail goods
    that quickly fall out of fashion [828]. Global excess inventory in 2011 amounted
    to about $8 trillion worth of goods, according to the Council of Supply Chain
    Management Professionals [847]. This excess may be in part due to mis-estimation
    of demand, as the same organization noted that corporate sales estimates diverged
    from actual sales by an average of 40% [847]. ML may be able to mitigate these
    issues of overproducing and/or overstocking goods by improving demand forecasting
    [12, 797]. For example, the clothing industry sells an average of only 60% of
    its wares at full price, but some brands can sell up to 85% due to just-in-time
    manufacturing and clever intelligence networks [294]. As online shopping and just-in-time
    manufacturing become more prevalent and websites offer more product types than
    physical storefronts, better demand forecasts will be needed on a regional level
    to efficiently distribute inventory without letting unwanted goods travel long
    distances only to languish in warehouses [685]. Nonetheless, negative side effects
    can be significant depending on the type of product and regional characteristics;
    just-in-time manufacturing and online shopping are often responsible for enabling
    product fads with shorter lifespans, in addition to smaller and faster shipments
    of goods (mostly by road) that lack the energy efficiency of freight aggregation
    and slower shipping methods such as rail [685, 799]. Recommender systems. Recommender
    systems can potentially direct consumers and purchasing firms toward climate-friendly
    options, as long as one can obtain information about GHG emissions throughout
    the entire life-cycle of some product. The challenge here lies in hunting down
    usable data on every relevant material and production process from metal ore extraction
    through production, shipping, and eventual use and disposal of a product [336,
    674]. One must also convince companies to share proprietary data to help other
    firms learn from best practices. If these datasets can be acquired, ML algorithms
    could hypothetically assist in identifying the cleanest options. Reducing food
    waste. Globally, society loses or wastes 1.3 billion metric tons of food each
    year, which translates to one-third of all food produced for human consumption
    [316]. In developing countries, 40% of food waste occurs between harvest and processing
    or retail, while over 40% of food waste in industrialized nations occurs at the
    end of supply chains, in retail outlets, restaurants, and consumers’ homes [316].
    ML can help reduce food waste by optimizing delivery routes and improving demand
    forecasting at the point of sale (see Section 5.1), as well as improving refrigeration
    systems [532] (see Section 5.3). ML can also potentially assist with other issues
    related to food waste, such as helping develop sensors to identify when produce
    is about to spoil, so it can be sold faster or removed from a storage crate before
    it ruins the rest of the shipment [256]. 5.2 Improving Materials Climate-friendly
    construction. Cement and steel production together account for over 10% of all
    global GHG emissions [243]; the cement industry alone emits more GHGs than every
    country except the USA and China [477]. ML can help minimize these emissions by
    reducing the need for carbon-intensive materials, by transforming industrial processes
    to run on low-carbon energy, and even by redesigning the chemistry of structural
    materials. To reduce the use of cement and steel, researchers have combined ML
    with generative design to develop structural products that require less raw material,
    thus reducing the resulting GHG emissions [416]. Novel manufacturing techniques
    such as 3D printing allow for the production of unusual shapes that use less material
    but may be impossible to produce through traditional metal-casting or poured concrete;
    ML and finite element modeling have been used to simulate the physical processes
    of 3D printing in order to improve the quality of finished products [62]. Assuming
    future advances in materials science, ML research could potentially draw upon
    open databases such as the Materials Project [380] and the UCI Machine Learning
    Repository [271] to invent new, climate-friendly materials [830]. Using semi-supervised
    generative models and concrete compression data, for example, Ge et al. proposed
    novel, low-emission concrete formulas that could satisfy desired structural characteristics
    [271]. Climate-friendly chemicals. Researchers are also experimenting with supervised
    learning and thermal imaging systems to rapidly identify promising catalysts and
    chemical reactions [140, 686], as described in Section 2.1.1. Firms are unlikely
    to adopt new materials or change existing practices without financial incentives,
    so widespread adoption might require subsidies for low-carbon alternatives or
    penalties for high GHG emissions. Ammonia production for fertilizer use relies
    upon natural gas to heat up and catalyze the reaction, and accounts for around
    2% of global energy consumption [551]. To develop cleaner ammonia, chemists may
    be able to invent electrochemical strategies for lower-temperature ammonia production
    [551, 849]. Given the potential of ML for predicting chemical reactions [140],
    ML may also be able to help with the discovery of new materials for electrocatalysts
    and/or proton conductors to facilitate ammonia production. 5.3 Production and
    Energy ML can potentially assist in reducing overall electricity consumption,
    streamlining factories’ HVAC systems, and developing models for electrifying industrial
    processes so they can be run on low-carbon energy instead of coal, oil, or natural
    gas [305]. Again, the higher the incentives for reducing carbon emissions, the
    more likely that firms will optimize for low-carbon energy use. New factory equipment
    can be very expensive to purchase and set up, so firms’ cost–benefit calculations
    may dissuade them from retrofitting existing factories to run using low-carbon
    electricity or to save a few kilowatts [288, 633, 778]. Given the heterogeneity
    across industrial sectors and the secrecy of industrial data, firms will also
    need to tailor the requisite sensors and data analysis systems to their individual
    processes. ML will become a much more viable option for industry when factory
    workers can identify, develop, implement, and monitor their own solutions internally
    instead of relying upon outside experts [337]. The ML community can assist by
    building accessible, customizable industry tools (i.e., “low-code” or “no-code”
    user interfaces) tailored for people without a strong background in data science.
    Adaptive control. On the production side, ML can potentially improve the efficiency
    of HVAC systems and other industrial control mechanisms—if given necessary data
    about all relevant processes. To reduce GHG emissions from HVAC systems, researchers
    have suggested combining optimization-based control algorithms with ML techniques
    such as image recognition, regression trees, and time delay neural networks [5,
    202] (see also 4.1). DeepMind has used RL to optimize cooling centers for Google’s
    internal servers by predicting and optimizing the power usage effectiveness, thus
    lowering HFC emissions and reducing cooling costs [227, 268]. Deep neural networks
    could also be used for adaptive control in a variety of industrial networking
    applications [8], enabling energy savings through self-learning about devices’
    surroundings. Predictive maintenance. ML could also contribute to predictive maintenance
    (see also Sections 2.2 and 9.2) by more accurately modelling the wear and tear
    of machinery that is currently in use, and interpretable ML could assist factory
    owners in developing a better understanding of how best to minimize GHG emissions
    for specific equipment and processes. For example, creating a digital twin model
    of some industrial equipment or process could enable a manufacturer to virtually
    experiment with a new piece of code before uploading it to the factory floor,
    and to test out scenarios for lower GHG emissions without slowing down production
    [290, 777]. Digital twins can also reduce production waste by identifying broken
    or about-to-break machines before the actual factory equipment starts producing
    damaged products. Industrial systems can employ similar models to predict which
    pipes are liable to spring leaks, thus minimizing the direct release of GHGs such
    as HFCs and natural gas. Using cleaner electricity. ML may be particularly useful
    for enabling more flexible operation of industrial electrical loads, through optimizing
    a firm’s demand response to electricity prices (see also Section 2). Such optimization
    can contribute to cutting GHG emissions as long as firms have a financial incentive
    to optimize for minimal emissions, maximal low-carbon energy, or minimum overall
    power usage. Demand response optimization algorithms can help firms adjust the
    timing of energy-intensive processes such as cement crushing [880] and powder-coating
    [43] to take advantage of electricity price fluctuations, although published work
    on the topic has to date used relatively little ML. Online algorithms for optimizing
    demand response can reduce overall power usage for computer servers by dynamically
    shifting the internet traffic load of data providers to underutilized servers,
    although most of this research, again, has focused on minimizing costs rather
    than GHG emissions [99, 352]. Berral et al. proposed a framework that demonstrates
    how such optimization algorithms might be combined with RL, digitized controls,
    and feedback systems to enable the autonomous control of industrial processes
    [74]. 5.4 Discussion Given the globalized nature of international trade and the
    urgency of climate change, decarbonizing the industrial sector is becoming a key
    priority for both policymakers and factory owners worldwide. Many companies are
    now writing decarbonization strategies in response to increasing pressure from
    governments, financial institutions, and stockholders (see, e.g., [620, 793]).
    These strategies are evolving rapidly, using ML alongside many approaches not
    covered here. As we have seen, there are a number of highly impactful applications
    where ML can help reduce GHG emissions in industry, with several caveats. First,
    incentives for cleaner production and distribution are not always aligned with
    reduced costs, though policies can play a role in aligning these incentives. Second,
    despite the proliferation of industrial data, much of the information is proprietary,
    low-quality, or very specific to individual machines or processes; practitioners
    estimate that 60%–70% of collected industrial data goes unused [138, 310]. Before
    investing in extensive ML research, researchers should be sure that they will
    be able to eventually access and clean any data needed for their algorithms. Finally,
    misjudgments can be very costly for manufacturers and retailers, leading most
    managers to adopt risk-averse strategies towards relatively untested technologies
    such as ML [337]. For this reason, ML algorithms that determine industrial activities
    should be robust enough to guarantee both performance and safety, along with providing
    both interpretable and reproducible results [338, 709]. Skip 6Farms & Forests
    by Alexandre Lacoste Section 6 Farms & Forests by Alexandre Lacoste Plants, microbes,
    and other organisms have been drawing CO 2 from the atmosphere for millions of
    years. Most of this carbon is continually broken down and recirculated through
    the carbon cycle, and some is stored deep underground, e.g., as fossil fuels,
    but a large amount of carbon is sequestered in the biomass of trees, peat bogs,
    and soil. Our current economy encourages practices that are freeing much of this
    sequestered carbon through deforestation and unsustainable agriculture. On top
    of these effects, cattle and rice farming generate methane, a GHG far more potent
    than CO 2 itself. Overall, land use by humans is estimated to be responsible for
    about a quarter of global GHG emissions [370] (and this may be an underestimate
    [511]). In addition to this direct release of carbon through human actions, the
    permafrost is now melting, peat bogs are drying, and forest fires are becoming
    more frequent as a consequence of climate change itself – all of which release
    yet more carbon [573]. The large scale of this problem allows for a similar scale
    of positive impact. According to one estimate [335], about a third of GHG emissions
    reductions could come from better land management and agriculture. ML can play
    an important role in some of these areas. Precision agriculture could reduce carbon
    release from the soil and improve crop yield, which in turn could reduce the need
    for deforestation. Satellite images make it possible to estimate the amount of
    carbon sequestered in a given area of land, as well as track GHG emissions from
    it. ML can help monitor the health of forests and peatlands, predict the risk
    of fire, and contribute to sustainable forestry (Figure 5). These areas represent
    highly impactful applications, in particular, of sophisticated computer vision
    tools, though care must be taken in some cases to ensure that ML tools are used
    in ways aligned with decarbonization. Fig. 5. Fig. 5. Selected opportunities to
    reduce GHG emissions from land use using ML, as described in Section 6. 6.1 Remote
    Sensing of Emissions Having real-time maps of GHGs could help us quantify emissions
    from agriculture and forestry practices, which remain relatively uncertain [371],
    as well as monitor emissions from other sectors (Section 2.2). Such information
    would be valuable in guiding regulations or incentives that could lead to better
    land use practices. For example, data on emissions make it possible to set effective
    targets, and pinpointing the sources of emissions makes it possible to enforce
    regulations. While GHGs are invisible to our eyes, they must by definition interact
    with sunlight. This means that we can observe these compounds with hyperspectral
    cameras [428, 711]. These cameras can record up to several hundred different wavelengths
    (instead of simply red, green, and blue [RGB]), providing information on the interaction
    between light and individual chemicals. Many satellites are equipped with such
    cameras and can perform, to some extent, estimations of CO 2 , CH 4 (methane),
    H 2 O, and N 2 O (nitrous oxide) emissions [73, 378]. While extremely useful for
    studying climate change, most of these satellites have very coarse spatial resolution
    and large temporal and spatial gaps, making them unsuitable for precise tracking
    of emissions. Standard satellite imagery provides RGB images with much higher
    resolution, which could be used in an ML algorithm to fill the gaps in hyperspectral
    data and obtain more precise information about emissions.23 Some preliminary work
    [378] has studied this possibility, but this remains largely an open problem with
    high potential impact. 6.2 Precision Agriculture Crop production is a significant
    source of GHG emissions. This might come as a surprise, since plants take up CO
    2 from the air. However, modern industrial crop production involves more than
    just growing plants. First, the land is generally stripped of existing vegetation,
    releasing carbon sequestered there. Second, the process of tilling exposes topsoil
    to the air, thereby releasing carbon that had been bound in soil aggregates and
    disrupting organisms in the soil that contribute to sequestration. Finally, because
    such farming practices strip soil of nutrients, nitrogen-based fertilizers must
    be added back to the system. Synthesizing these fertilizers consumes massive amounts
    of energy, about 2% of global energy consumption [551] (see Section 5.2). Moreover,
    while some of this nitrogen is absorbed by plants or retained in the soil, some
    is converted to nitrous oxide,24 a GHG that is about 300 times more potent than
    CO 2 . Such industrial agriculture approaches are ultimately based on making farmland
    more uniform and predictable. This allows it to be managed at scale using basic
    automation tools like tractors, but can be both more destructive and less productive
    than approaches that work with the natural heterogeneity of land and crops. Increasingly,
    there is demand for sophisticated tools which would allow farmers to work at scale,
    but adapt to what the land needs. This approach is often known as “precision agriculture.”
    Smarter robotic tools can help enable precision agriculture. Robots are under
    development, for example, with the ability to perform mechanical weeding, targeted
    pesticide application, and vacuuming of pests [766], as well as the collection
    of large datasets for continual improvement [68]. Many corporate players now exist
    in the space of ML-aided robotics for precision agriculture [80, 212, 742, 788].
    There remains significant room for development, since many tasks remain challenging
    for robots, and furthermore there are a large number of specific tasks and agricultural
    settings to consider. There are many additional ways in which ML can contribute
    to precision agriculture. Intelligent irrigation systems can save large amounts
    of water while reducing pests that thrive under excessive moisture [335]. ML can
    also help in disease detection, weed detection, and soil sensing [482, 699, 821].
    ML can guide crop yield prediction [866] and even macroeconomic models that help
    farmers predict crop demand and decide what to plant at the beginning of the season
    [503]. These problems often have minimal hardware requirements, as devices such
    as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with hyperspectral cameras can be used for
    all of these tasks. Globally, agriculture constitutes a $2.4 trillion industry
    [785], and there is already a significant economic incentive to increase efficiency.
    However, efficiency gains do not necessarily translate into reduced GHG emissions
    (e.g., via rebound effects increasing consumption of particularly emissions-intensive
    products). Moreover, significantly reducing emissions may require a shift in agricultural
    paradigms, for example, widespread adoption of regenerative agriculture, silvopasture,
    and tree intercropping [335]. ML tools for policymakers and agronomists [126]
    could potentially encourage climate-positive action: for example, remote sensing
    with UAVs and satellites could perform methane detection and carbon stock estimation,
    which could be used to incentivize farmers to sequester more carbon and reduce
    emissions. 6.3 Monitoring Peatlands Peatlands (a type of wetland ecosystem) cover
    only 3% of the Earth’s land area, yet hold twice the total carbon in all the world’s
    forests, making peat the largest source of sequestered carbon on Earth [612].
    When peat dries, however, it releases carbon through decomposition and also becomes
    susceptible to fire [245, 612]. A single peat fire in Indonesia in 1997 is reported
    to have released emissions comparable to 20%–50% of global fossil fuel emissions
    during the same year [606]. Monitoring peatlands and protecting them from artificial
    drainage or droughts is essential to preserve the carbon sequestered in them [349,
    400]. In [538], ML was applied to features extracted from remote sensing data
    to estimate the thickness of peat and assess the carbon stock of tropical peatlands.
    A central database for peatland-monitoring has been established, but considerable
    data gaps remain [121]. Advanced ML could potentially help develop precise monitoring
    tools at low cost, as well as predicting the risk of fire. 6.4 Managing Forests
    Estimating carbon stock. Modeling (and pricing) carbon stored in forests requires
    us to assess how much is being sequestered or released across the planet. Since
    most of a forest’s carbon is stored in above-ground biomass [693], tree species
    and heights are a good indicator of the carbon stock. The height of trees can
    be estimated fairly accurately with LiDAR devices mounted on UAVs, but this technology
    is not scalable and many areas are closed to UAVs. To address this challenge,
    ML can be used to predict the LiDAR’s outcome from satellite imagery [48, 599,
    693]. From there, the learned estimator can perform predictions at scale. Despite
    progress in this area, there is still significant room for improvement. For example,
    LiDAR data are often not equally distributed across regions or seasons. Hence
    domain adaptation and transfer learning techniques may help algorithms to generalize
    better. Automating afforestation. Planting trees, also called afforestation, can
    be a means of sequestering CO 2 over the long term. According to one estimate,
    up to 0.9 billion hectares of extra canopy cover could theoretically be added
    [60] globally. However, care must be taken when planting trees to ensure a positive
    impact. Afforestation that comes at the expense of farmland (or ecosystems such
    as peat bogs) could result in a net increase of GHG emissions. Moreover, planting
    trees without regard for local conditions and native species can reduce the climate
    impact of afforestation as well as negatively affecting biodiversity. ML can be
    helpful in automating large-scale afforestation by locating appropriate planting
    sites, monitoring plant health, assessing weeds, and analyzing trends. For example,
    startups like Dendra Systems and Droneseed are developing UAVs that are capable
    of planting seed packets more quickly and cheaply than traditional methods [176,
    204], while Restor uses ML to learn from past afforestation projects about effective
    strategies for ecosystem restoration [681]. Managing forest fires. Besides their
    potential for harming people and property, forest fires release CO 2 into the
    atmosphere (which in turn increases the rate of forest fires [839]). On the other
    hand, small forest fires are part of natural forest cycles. Preventing them causes
    biomass to accumulate on the ground and increases the chances of large fires,
    which can then burn all trees to the ground and erode top soil, resulting in high
    CO 2 emissions, biodiversity loss, and a long recovery time [550]. Drought forecasting
    [682] is helpful in predicting regions that are more at risk, as is estimating
    the water content in the tree canopy [94]. In [266, 267], RL is used to predict
    the spatial progression of fire. This helps firefighters decide when to let a
    fire burn and when to stop it [355]. With good tools to evaluate regions that
    are more at risk, firefighters can perform controlled burns and cut select areas
    to prevent the progression of fires. Reducing deforestation. Only 17% of the world’s
    forests are legally protected [506]. The rest are subject to deforestation, which
    contributes to approximately 10% of global GHG emissions [370] as vegetation is
    burned or decays. About 80% percent of global deforestation is the result of agriculture
    (clearing land for pasture or crop production), while other significant causes
    include mining, logging, and urban development [353]. Tools for tracking deforestation
    can provide valuable data for informing policymakers, as well as law enforcement
    in cases where deforestation may be conducted illegally. ML can be used with remote
    sensing imagery to pinpoint changes in forest cover [241, 329, 369], or proxies
    for deforestation such as smoke from fires set to clear vegetation [505], as well
    as to differentiate selective cutting from clearcutting [342, 487]. ML can also
    be used with audio instead of visual data; one such project installs (old) smartphones
    powered by solar panels in the forest, which enables the detection of chainsaw
    sounds within a one-kilometer radius [657]. ML can also be used to help build
    incentive structures for sustainable forest management. Some companies are using
    ML-enabled tools to quantify the carbon impact of forestry decisions, enabling
    landowners to choose more beneficial actions as well as profit by selling carbon
    offsets [578, 603]. ML can also help in proving that tracts of forest are indeed
    being preserved (integrating data sources such as satellite imagery, UAV-based
    monitoring, and indigenous participatory mapping), thereby providing verification
    of carbon credits or other incentive structures for land custodians or owners
    [264, 501]. 6.5 Discussion Farms and forests make up a large portion of global
    GHG emissions, but reducing these emissions is challenging. The scope of the problem
    is highly globalized, but the necessary actions are highly localized. Many applications
    also involve a diversity of stakeholders. Agriculture, for example, involves a
    complex mix of large-scale farming interests, small-scale farmers, agricultural
    equipment manufacturers, and chemical companies. Each stakeholder has different
    interests, and each often has access to a different portion of the data that would
    be useful for impactful ML applications. Interfacing between these different stakeholders
    is a practical challenge for meaningful work in this area. Skip 7Carbon Dioxide
    Removal by Andrew S. Ross & Evan D. Sherwin Section 7 Carbon Dioxide Removal by
    Andrew S. Ross & Evan D. Sherwin Even if we could cut emissions to zero today,
    we would still face significant climate consequences from GHGs already in the
    atmosphere. Eliminating emissions entirely may also be tricky, given the sheer
    diversity of sources (such as airplanes and cows). Instead, many experts argue
    that to meet critical climate goals, global emissions must become net-negative—that
    is, we must remove more CO 2 from the atmosphere than we release [259, 269]. Although
    there has been significant progress in negative emissions research [260, 540,
    575, 580, 707], the actual CO 2 removal industry is still in its infancy. As such,
    many of the ML applications we outline in this section are either speculative
    or in the early stages of development or commercialization. Many of the primary
    candidate technologies for CO 2 removal directly harness the same natural processes
    which have (pre-)historically shaped our atmosphere. One of the most promising
    methods is simply allowing or encouraging more natural uptake of CO 2 by plants
    (whose ML applications we discuss in Section 6). Other plant-based methods include
    bioenergy with carbon capture and biochar, where plants are grown specifically
    to absorb CO 2 and then burned in a way that sequesters it (while creating energy
    or fertilizer as a useful byproduct) [155, 575, 690]. Finally, the way most of
    Earth’s CO 2 has been removed over geologic timescales is the slow process of
    mineral weathering, which also initiates further CO 2 absorption in the ocean
    due to alkaline runoff [718]. These processes can both be massively accelerated
    by human activity to achieve necessary scales of CO 2 removal [575]. However,
    although these biomass, mineral, and ocean-based methods are all promising enough
    as techniques to merit mention, they may have drawbacks in terms of land use and
    potentially serious environmental impacts, and (more relevantly for this article)
    they would not likely benefit significantly from ML. 7.1 Direct Air Capture Another
    approach is to build facilities to extract CO 2 from power plant exhaust, industrial
    processes, or even ambient air [701]. While this direct air capture (DAC) approach
    faces technical hurdles, it requires little land and has, according to current
    understanding, minimal negative environmental impacts [152]. The basic idea behind
    DAC is to blow air onto CO 2 sorbents (essentially like sponges, but for gas),
    which are either solid or in solution, then use heat-powered chemical processes
    to release the CO 2 in purified form for sequestration [575, 707]. Several companies
    have recently been started to pilot these methods [112, 136, 293]. While CO 2
    sorbents are improving significantly [117, 872], issues still remain with efficiency
    and degradation over time, offering potential (though still speculative) opportunities
    for ML. ML could be used (as in Section 2.1.1) to accelerate materials discovery
    and process engineering workflows [105, 299, 490, 653] to maximize sorbent reusability
    and CO 2 uptake while minimizing the energy required for CO 2 release. ML might
    also help to develop corrosion-resistant components capable of withstanding high
    temperatures, as well as optimize their geometry for air-sorbent contact (which
    strongly impacts efficiency [350]). 7.2 Sequestering CO 2 Once CO 2 is captured,
    it must be sequestered or stored, securely and at scale, to prevent re-release
    back into the atmosphere. The best-understood form of CO 2 sequestration is direct
    injection into geologic formations such as saline aquifers, which are generally
    similar to oil and gas reservoirs [575]. A Norwegian oil company has successfully
    sequestered CO 2 from an offshore natural gas field in a saline aquifer for more
    than twenty years [895]. Another promising option is to sequester CO 2 in volcanic
    basalt formations, which is being piloted in Iceland [744]. ML may be able to
    help with many aspects of CO 2 sequestration. First, ML can help identify and
    characterize potential storage locations. Oil and gas companies have had promising
    results using ML for subsurface imaging based on raw seismograph traces [31].
    These models and the data behind them could likely be repurposed to help trap
    CO 2 rather than release it. Second, ML can help monitor and maintain active sequestration
    sites. Noisy sensor measurements must be translated into inferences about subsurface
    CO 2 flow and remaining injection capacity [119]; recently, [542] found success
    using convolutional image-to-image regression techniques for uncertainty quantification
    in a global CO 2 storage simulation study. Deep learning can also help speed up
    simulation of carbon dioxide plume migration in sequestration reservoirs [836].
    Additionally, it is important to monitor for CO 2 leaks [557]. ML techniques have
    recently been applied to monitoring potential CO 2 leaks from wells [125]; computer
    vision approaches for emissions detection (see [826] and Section 6.1) may also
    be applicable. 7.3 Discussion Given limits on how much more CO 2 humanity can
    safely emit and the difficulties associated with eliminating emissions entirely,
    CO 2 removal may have a critical role to play in tackling climate change. Promising
    applications for ML in CO 2 removal include informing research and development
    of novel component materials, characterizing geologic resource availability, and
    monitoring underground CO 2 in sequestration facilities. Although many of these
    applications are speculative, the industry is growing, which will create more
    data and more opportunities for ML approaches to help. Skip 8Climate Prediction
    by Kelly Kochanski Section 8 Climate Prediction by Kelly Kochanski The first global
    warming prediction was made in 1896, when Arrhenius estimated that burning fossil
    fuels could eventually release enough CO 2 to warm the Earth by 5 ∘ C. The fundamental
    physics underlying those calculations has not changed, but our predictions have
    become far more detailed and precise. The predominant predictive tools are climate
    models, known as General Circulation Models or Earth System Models.25 These models
    inform local and national government decisions (see IPCC reports [370, 371, 372]),
    help people calculate their climate risks (see Sections 11 and 9) and allow us
    to estimate the potential impacts of solar geoengineering (see Section 10). Recent
    trends have created opportunities for ML to advance the state-of-the-art in climate
    prediction (Figure 6). First, new and cheaper satellites are creating petabytes
    of climate observation data.26 Second, massive climate modeling projects are generating
    petabytes of simulated climate data.27 Third, climate forecasts are computationally
    expensive [115] (the simulations in [415] took three weeks to run on NCAR supercomputers),
    while ML methods are becoming increasingly fast to train and run, especially on
    next-generation computing hardware. As a result, climate scientists have recently
    begun to explore ML techniques, and are starting to team up with computer scientists
    to build new and exciting applications. Fig. 6. Fig. 6. Schematic of a climate
    model, with selected opportunities to improve climate change predictions using
    ML, as described in Section 8. 8.1 Uniting Data, ML, and Climate Science Climate
    models represent our understanding of Earth and climate physics. We can learn
    about the Earth by collecting data. To turn that data into useful predictions,
    we need to condense it into coherent, computationally tractable models. ML models
    are likely to be more accurate or less expensive than other models where: (1)
    there are plentiful data, but it is hard to model systems with traditional statistics,
    or (2) there are good models, but they are too computationally expensive to use
    in production. 8.1.1 Data for Climate Models. When data are plentiful, climate
    scientists build data-driven models. In these areas, ML techniques may solve many
    problems that were previously challenging. These include black box problems, for
    instance sensor calibration [468], and classification of observational data, for
    instance classifying land cover or identifying pollutant sources in satellite
    imagery [457, 469]. More applications like these are likely to appear as satellite
    databases grow. The authors of [548] describe many opportunities for data scientists
    to assimilate data from diverse field and remote sensing sources, many of which
    have since been explored by climate informatics researchers. Numerous authors,
    such as [287], have identified geoscience problems that would be aided by the
    development of benchmark datasets. Efforts to develop such datasets include EnviroNet
    [565], the IS-GEO benchmark datasets [211], and ExtremeWeather [652]. We expect
    the collection of curated geoscience datasets to continue to grow; this process
    might even be accelerated by ML optimizations in data collection systems [287].
    We strongly encourage modellers to dive into the data in collaboration with domain
    experts. We also recommend that modellers who seek to learn directly from data
    see [354] for specific advice on fitting and over-fitting climate data. 8.1.2
    Accelerating Climate Models. Many climate prediction problems are irremediably
    data-limited. No matter how many weather stations we construct, how many field
    campaigns we run, or how many satellites we deploy, the Earth will generate at
    most one year of new climate data per year. Existing climate models deal with
    this limitation by relying heavily on physical laws, such as thermodynamics [214,
    300]. These models are structured in terms of coupled partial differential equations
    that represent physical processes like cloud formation, ice sheet flow, and permafrost
    melt. ML models provide new techniques (e.g., [658]) for solving such systems
    efficiently. Clouds and aerosols. Recent work has shown how deep neural networks
    could be combined with existing thermodynamics knowledge to fix the largest source
    of uncertainty in current climate models: clouds. Bright clouds block sunlight
    and cool the Earth; dark clouds catch outgoing heat and keep the Earth warm [371,
    729]. These effects are controlled by small-scale processes such as cloud convection
    and atmospheric aerosols (see uses of aerosols for cloud seeding and solar geoengineering
    in Section 10). Physical models of these processes are far too computationally
    expensive to include in global climate models—but ML models are not. Gentine et
    al. trained a deep neural network to emulate the behavior of a high-resolution
    cloud simulation, and found that the network gave similar results for a fraction
    of the cost [275] and was stable in a simplified global model [670]. Existing
    scientific model structures do not always offer great trade-offs between cost
    and accuracy. Neural networks trained on those scientific models produce similar
    predictions, but offer an entirely new set of compromises between training cost,
    production cost, and accuracy. Replacing select climate model components with
    neural network approximators may thus improve both the cost and the accuracy of
    global climate models. Additional work is needed to identify more climate model
    components that could be replaced by neural networks (we highlight other impactful
    components below), to optimize those models, and to automate their training workflows
    (see examples in [676]). Ice sheets and sea level rise. The next most important
    targets for climate model improvements are ice sheet dynamics and sea level rise.
    The Arctic and Antarctic are warming faster than anywhere else on Earth, and their
    climates control the future of global sea level rise and many vulnerable ecosystems
    [370, 372]. Unfortunately, these regions are dark and cold, and until recently
    they were difficult to observe. In the past few years, however, new satellite
    campaigns have illuminated them with hundreds of terabytes of data.28 These data
    could make it possible to use ML to solve some of the field’s biggest outstanding
    questions. In particular, models of mass loss from the Antarctic ice-sheet are
    highly uncertain [449] and models of the extent of Antarctic sea ice do not match
    reality well [263]. The most uncertain parts of these models, and thus the best
    targets for improvement, are snow reflectivity, sea ice reflectivity, ocean heat
    mixing, and ice sheet grounding line migration rates [328, 354, 449]. Computer
    scientists who wish to work in this area could build models that learn snow and
    sea ice properties from satellite data, or use new video prediction techniques
    to predict short-term changes in the sea ice extent. 8.1.3 Working with Climate
    Models. ML could also be used to identify and leverage relationships between climate
    variables. Pattern recognition and feature extraction techniques could allow us
    to identify more useful connections in the climate system, and regression models
    could allow us to quantify non-linear relationships between connected variables.
    For example, Nowack et al. demonstrated that ozone concentrations could be computed
    as a function of temperature, rather than physical transport laws, which led to
    considerable computational savings [587]. The best climate predictions are synthesized
    from ensembles of 20+ climate models [782]. Making good ensemble predictions is
    an excellent ML problem. Monteleoni et al. proposed that online ML algorithms
    could create better predictions of one or more target variables in a multi-model
    ensemble of climate models [549]; this idea has been refined in [530, 763]. More
    recently, Anderson and Lucas used random forests to make high-resolution predictions
    from a mix of high- and low-resolution models, which could reduce the costs of
    building multi-model ensembles [23]. In the further future, the Climate Modeling
    Alliance has proposed to build an entirely new climate model that learns continuously
    from data and from high-resolution simulations [717]. The proposed model would
    be written in Julia, in contrast to existing models which are mostly written in
    C++ and Fortran. At the cost of a daunting translation workload, they aim to build
    a model that is more accessible to new developers and more compatible with ML
    libraries. 8.2 Forecasting Extreme Events For most people, extreme event prediction
    means the local weather forecast and a few days’ warning to stockpile food, go
    home, and lock the shutters. Weather forecasts are shorter-term than climate forecasts,
    but they produce abundant data. Weather models are optimized to track the rapid,
    chaotic changes of the atmosphere; since these changes are fast, tomorrow’s weather
    forecast is made and tested every day. Climate models, in contrast, are chaotic
    on short time scales, but their long-term trends are driven by slow, predictable
    changes of ocean, land, and ice (see [734]).29 As a result, climate model output
    can only be tested against long-term observations (at the scale of years to decades).
    Intermediate time scales, of weeks to months, are exceptionally difficult to predict,
    although Cohen et al. [139] argue that ML could bridge that gap by making good
    predictions on four to six week timescales [363]. Thus far, however, weather modelers
    have had hundreds of times more test data than climate modelers, and began to
    adopt ML techniques earlier. Numerous ML weather models are already running in
    production. For example, Gagne et al. recently used an ensemble of random forests
    to improve hail predictions within a major weather model [262]. A full review
    of the applications of ML for extreme weather forecasting is beyond the scope
    of this article. Fortunately, that review has already been written, see [529].
    The authors describe ML systems that correct bias, recognize patterns, and predict
    storms. Moving forward, they envision human experts working alongside automated
    forecasts. 8.2.1 Storm Tracking. Climate models cannot predict the specific dates
    of future events, but they can predict changes in long-term trends like drought
    frequency and storm intensity. Information about these trends helps individuals,
    corporations, and towns make informed decisions about infrastructure, asset valuation
    and disaster response plans (see also Section 9.4). Identifying extreme events
    in climate model output, however, is a classification problem with a twist: all
    of the available datasets are strongly skewed because extreme events are, by definition,
    rare. ML has been used successfully to classify some extreme weather events. Researchers
    have used deep learning to classify [488], detect [652], and segment [456] cyclones
    and atmospheric rivers, as well as tornadoes [463], in historical climate datasets.
    Tools for more event types would be useful, as would online tools that work within
    climate models, labelled datasets for predicting future events, and statistical
    tools that quantify the uncertainty in new extreme event forecasts. 8.2.2 Local
    Forecasts. Forecasts are most actionable if they are specific and local. ML is
    widely used to make local forecasts from coarse 10–100 km climate or weather model
    predictions; various authors have attempted this using support vector machines,
    autoencoders, Bayesian deep learning, and super-resolution convolutional neural
    networks (e.g., [481]). Several groups are now working to translate high-resolution
    climate forecasts into risk scenarios. For example, ML can predict localized flooding
    patterns from past data [625], which could inform individuals buying insurance
    or homes. Since ML methods like neural networks are effective at predicting local
    flooding during extreme weather events [740], these could be used to update local
    flood risk estimates to benefit individuals. The start-up Jupiter Intelligence
    is working to make climate predictions more actionable by translating climate
    forecasts into localised flood and temperature risk scores. 8.3 Discussion ML
    may change the way that scientific modeling is done. The examples above have shown
    that many components of large climate models can be replaced with ML models at
    lower computational costs. From an ML standpoint, learning from an existing model
    has many advantages: modelers can generate new training and test data on-demand,
    and the new ML model inherits some community trust from the old one. This is an
    area of active ML research. Several papers have explored data-efficient techniques
    for learning dynamical systems [658], including physics-informed neural networks
    [659] and neural ordinary differential equations [132]; applications of physics-informed
    ML in climate science are now maturing rapidly [373, 412]. In the further future,
    researchers are developing ML approaches for a wide range of scientific modeling
    challenges, including crash prediction [497], adaptive numerical meshing [389],
    uncertainty quantification [464, 486], and performance optimization [786]. If
    these strategies are effective, they may solve some of the largest structural
    challenges facing current climate models. New ML models for climate will be most
    successful if they are closely integrated into existing scientific models. This
    has been emphasized, again and again, by authors who have laid future paths for
    artificial intelligence within climate science [287, 470, 529, 670, 676, 717].
    New models need to leverage existing knowledge to make good predictions with limited
    data. In 10 years, we will have more satellite data, more interpretable ML techniques
    [791], hopefully more trust from the scientific community, and possibly a new
    climate model written in Julia. For now, however, ML models must be creatively
    designed to work within existing climate models. The best of these models are
    likely to be built by close-knit teams including both climate and computational
    scientists. Skip 9Societal Impacts by Kris Sankaran Section 9 Societal Impacts
    by Kris Sankaran Changes in the atmosphere have impacts on the ground. The expected
    societal impacts of climate change include prolonged ecological and socioeconomic
    stresses as well as brief, but severe, societal disruptions. For example, impacts
    could include both gradual decreases in crop yield and localized food shortages.
    If we can anticipate climate impacts well enough, then we can prepare for them
    by asking: How do we reduce vulnerability to climate impacts? How do we support
    rapid recovery from climate-induced disruptions? A wide variety of strategies
    have been put forward, from robust power grids to food shortage prediction (Figure
    7), and while this is good news for society, it can be overwhelming for an ML
    practitioner hoping to contribute. Fortunately, a few critical needs tend to recur
    across strategies—it is by meeting these needs that ML has the greatest potential
    to support societal adaptation [251, 296, 648]. From a high level, these involve
    Fig. 7. Fig. 7. Selected opportunities to accelerate societal adaptation to climate
    change using ML, as described in Section 9. Sounding alarms: Identifying and prioritizing
    the areas of highest risk, by using evidence of risk from historical data. Providing
    annotation: Extracting actionable information or labels from unstructured raw
    data. Promoting exchange: Making it easier to share resources and information
    to pool and reduce risk. These unifying threads will appear repeatedly in the
    sections below, where we review strategies to help ecosystems, infrastructure,
    and societies adapt to climate change, and explain how ML supports each strategy
    (Figure 7). We note that the projects involved vary in scale from local to global,
    from infrastructure upgrades and crisis preparedness planning to international
    ecosystem monitoring and disease surveillance. Hence, we anticipate valuable contributions
    by researchers who have the flexibility to formulate experimental approaches,
    by industrial engineers and entrepreneurs who have the expertise to translate
    prototypes into wide-reaching systems, and by civil servants who lead many existing
    climate adaptation efforts. 9.1 Ecology Changes in climate are increasingly affecting
    the distribution and composition of ecosystems. This has profound implications
    for global biodiversity, as well as agriculture, disease, and natural resources
    such as wood and fish. ML can help by supporting efforts to monitor ecosystems
    and biodiversity. Monitoring ecosystems. To preserve ecosystems, it is important
    to know which are most at risk. This has traditionally been done via manual, on-the-ground
    observation, but the process can be accelerated by annotation of remote sensing
    data [91, 92, 513, 637] (see also Section 6.1). For example, tree cover can be
    automatically extracted from aerial imagery to characterize deforestation [362,
    528]. At the scale of regions or biomes, analysis of large-scale simulations can
    illuminate the evolution of ecosystems across potential climate futures [238,
    438]. A more direct source of data is offered by environmental sensor networks,
    made from densely packed but low-cost devices [184, 331, 361]. To monitor ocean
    ecosystems, marine robots are useful, because they can be used to survey large
    areas on demand [208, 306]. For a system to have the most real-world impact, regardless
    of the underlying data source, it is necessary to “personalize” predictions across
    a range of ecosystems. A model trained on the Sahara would almost certainly fail
    if deployed in the Amazon. Hence, these applications may motivate ML researchers
    interested in heterogeneity, data collection, transfer learning, and rapid generalization.
    In sensor networks, individual nodes fail frequently, but are redundant by design—this
    is an opportunity for research into anomaly detection and missing data imputation
    [178, 345]. In marine robotics, improved techniques for sampling regions to explore
    and automatic summarization of expedition results would both provide value [160,
    246]. Finally, beyond aiding adaptation by prioritizing at-risk environments,
    the design of effective methods for ecosystem monitoring will support the basic
    science necessary to shape adaptation in the long-run [231, 297, 521]. Monitoring
    biodiversity. Accurate estimates of species populations are the foundation on
    which conservation efforts are built. Camera traps and aerial imagery have increased
    the richness and coverage of sampling efforts. ML can help infer biodiversity
    counts from image-based sensors. For instance, camera traps take photos automatically
    whenever a motion sensor is activated—computer vision can be used to classify
    the species that pass by, supporting a real-time, less labor-intensive species
    count [64, 585, 643]. It is also possible to use aerial imagery to estimate the
    size of large herds [805] or count birds [282]. In underwater ecosystems, ML has
    been used to identify plankton automatically from underwater cameras [232] and
    to infer fish populations from the structure of coral reefs [867]. Citizen science
    can also enable dataset collection at a scale impossible in individual studies
    [93, 533, 634, 767]. For example, by leveraging public enthusiasm for birdwatching,
    eBird has logged more than 140 million observations [767], which have been used
    for population and migration studies [424]. Computer vision algorithms that can
    classify species from photographs have furthered such citizen science efforts
    by making identifications easier and more accurate [660, 806], though these face
    challenges such as class imbalances in training data [807]. Work with citizen
    science data poses the additional challenge that researchers have no control over
    where samples come from. To incentivize observations from undersampled regions,
    mechanisms from game theory can be applied [860], and even when sampling biases
    persist, estimates of dataset shift can minimize their influence [128]. Monitoring
    biodiversity may be paired with interventions to protect rare species or control
    invasive pests. ML is providing new solutions to assess the impact of ecological
    interventions [13, 502, 664] and prevent poaching [860]. 9.2 Infrastructure Physical
    infrastructure is so tightly woven into the fabric of everyday life—like the buildings
    we inhabit and lights we switch on—that it is easy to forget that it exists (see
    Section 4). The fact that something so basic will have to be rethought in order
    to adapt to climate change can be unsettling, but viewed differently, the sheer
    necessity of radical redesign can inspire creative thinking. We first consider
    the impacts of climate change on the built environment. Shifts in weather patterns
    are likely to put infrastructure under more persistent stress. Heat and wind damage
    roads, buildings, and power lines. Rising water tables near the coast will lead
    to faults in pipelines. Urban heat islands will be exacerbated and it is likely
    that there will be an increased risk of flooding caused by heavy rain or coastal
    inundations, resulting in property damage and traffic blockages [604]. A clear
    target is construction of physical defenses, for example, “climate proofing” cities
    with new coastal embankments and increased storm drainage capacity. However, focusing
    solely on defending existing structures can stifle proactive thinking about urban
    and social development—for example, floating buildings are being tested in Rotterdam—and
    one may alternatively consider resilience and recovery more broadly [621, 731].
    From this more general perspective of improving social processes, ML can support
    two types of activities: design and maintenance. Designing infrastructure. How
    can infrastructure be (re)designed to dampen climate impacts? In road networks,
    it is possible to incorporate flood hazard and traffic information in order to
    uncover vulnerable stretches of road, especially those with few alternative routes
    [314]. If traffic data are not directly available, it is possible to construct
    proxies from mobile phone usage and city-wide CCTV streams—these are promising
    in rapidly developing urban centers [252, 381]. Overall flood hazard maps can
    be improved using ML [455], and it is also possible to leverage data from real-world
    flooding events [616], and to send localized predictions to those at risk [841].
    For electrical, water, and waste collection networks, the same principle can guide
    investments in resilience—using proxy or historical data about disruptions to
    anticipate vulnerabilities [564, 574, 600, 609]. Robust components can replace
    those at risk; for example, adaptive islands, parts of an energy grid that continue
    to provide power even when disconnected from the network, prevent cascading outages
    in power distribution [235]. Infrastructure is long-lived, but the future is uncertain,
    and planners must weigh immediate resource costs against future societal risks
    [248]. One area that urgently needs adaptation strategies is the consistent access
    to drinking water, which can be jeopardized by climate variability [174, 366].
    Investments in water infrastructure can be optimized; for example, a larger dam
    might cost more up front, but would have a larger storage capacity, giving a stronger
    buffer against drought. To delay immediate decisions, infrastructure can be upgraded
    in phases—the technical challenge is to discover policies that minimize a combination
    of long-term resource and societal costs under plausible climate futures, with
    forecasts being updated as climates evolve [289, 651, 727]. Maintaining infrastructure.
    What types of systems can keep infrastructure functioning well under increased
    stress? Two strategies for efficiently managing limited maintenance resources
    are predictive maintenance and anomaly detection; both can be applied to electrical,
    water, and transportation infrastructure (see also Sections 2.2 and 5.3). In predictive
    maintenance, operations are prioritized according to the predicted probability
    of a near-term breakdown [201, 581, 702, 751]. For anomaly detection, failures
    are discovered as soon as they occur, without having to wait for inspectors to
    show up, or complaints to stream in [51, 186]. The systems referenced here have
    required the manual curation of data streams, structured and unstructured. The
    data are plentiful, just difficult to glue together. Ideas from the missing data,
    multimodal data, and AutoML communities have the potential to resolve some of
    these issues. 9.3 Social Systems While less tangible, the social systems we construct
    are just as critical to the smooth functioning of society as any physical infrastructure,
    and it is important that they adapt to changing climate conditions. First, consider
    what changes these systems may encounter. Decreases in crop yield, due to drought
    and other factors, will pose a threat to food security, as already evidenced by
    long periods of drought in North America, West Africa, and East Asia [157, 636].
    More generally, communities dependent on ecosystem resources will find their livelihoods
    at risk, and this may result in mass migrations, as people seek out more supportive
    environments. At first, these problems may seem beyond the reach of algorithmic
    thinking, but investments in social infrastructure can increase resilience. ML
    can amplify the reach and effectiveness of this infrastructure. See also Section
    12 for perspective on how ML can support the function and analysis of complex
    social environments. Food security. Data can be used to monitor the risk of food
    insecurity in real time, to forecast near-term shortages, and to identify areas
    at risk in the long-term, all of which can guide interventions. For real-time
    and near-term systems, it is possible to distill relevant signals from mobile
    phones, credit card transactions, and social media data [171, 434, 645]. These
    have emerged as low-cost, high-reach alternatives to manual surveying. The idea
    is to train models that link these large, but decontextualized, data with ground
    truth consumption or survey information, collected on small representative samples.
    This process of developing proxies to link small, rich datasets with large, coarse
    ones can be viewed as a type of semi-supervised learning, and is fertile ground
    for research. For longer-term warnings, spatially localized crop yield predictions
    are needed. These can be generated by aerial imagery or meteorological data (see
    Section 6.2), if they can be linked with historical yield data [123, 824]. Automatic
    crop type mapping can also be a valuable tool for yield prediction [426, 427].
    On the ground, it is possible to perform crop-disease identification from plant
    photos—this can alert communities to disease outbreaks, and enhance the capacity
    of agricultural inspectors. For even longer-run risk evaluation, it is possible
    to simulate crop yield via biological and ecological models [446, 698, 783], presenting
    another opportunity for blending large scale simulation with ML [605, 835]. Beyond
    sounding alarms, ML can improve resilience of food supply chains. As detailed
    in Section 5, ML can reduce waste along these chains; we emphasize that for adaptation,
    it is important that supply chains also be made robust to unexpected disruptions
    [203, 568, 639, 665]. Resilient livelihoods. Individuals whose livelihoods depend
    on one activity, and who have less access to community resources, are those who
    are most at risk [7, 692]. Resilient livelihoods can be promoted through increased
    diversification, cooperation, and exchange, all of which can be facilitated by
    ML systems. For example, they can guide equipment and information sharing in farming
    cooperatives, via growers’ social networks [37]. Mobile money efforts can increase
    access to liquid purchasing power; they can also be used to monitor economic health
    [253, 644]. Skill-matching programs and online training are often driven by data,
    with some programs specifically aiming to benefit refugees [54, 516, 646] (see
    also Section 13). Supporting displaced people. Human populations move in response
    to threats and opportunities, and ML can be used to predict large-scale migration
    patterns. Work in this area has relied on accessible proxies, like social media,
    where users’ often self-report location information, or aerial imagery, from which
    the extent of informal settlement can be gauged [82, 376, 650, 869]. More than
    quantifying migration patterns, there have been efforts directly aimed at protecting
    refugees, either through improving rescue operations [492, 628] or monitoring
    negative public sentiment [647]. It is worth cautioning that immigrants and refugees
    are vulnerable groups, and systems that surveil them can easily be exploited by
    bad actors. Designing methodology and governance mechanisms that allow vulnerable
    populations to benefit from such data, without putting them at additional risk,
    should be a research priority. Assessing health risks. Climate change will affect
    exposure to health hazards, and ML can play a role in measuring and mitigating
    their impacts across subpopulations. Two of the most relevant expected shifts
    are (1) heat waves will become more frequent and (2) outdoor and indoor air quality
    will deteriorate [324, 710]. These exposures have either direct or indirect effects
    on health. For example, prolonged heat episodes both directly cause heat stroke
    and can trigger acute episodes in chronic conditions, like heart or respiratory
    disease [194, 719]. Careful data collection and analysis have played a leading
    role in epidemiology and public health efforts for generations. It should be no
    surprise that ML has emerged as an important tool in these disciplines, supporting
    a variety of research efforts, from increasing the efficiency of disease simulators
    to supporting the fine-grained measurement of exposures and their health impacts
    [433, 705]. These disciplines are increasingly focused on the risks posed by climate
    change specifically. For example, new sources of data have enabled detailed sensing
    of urban heat islands [137, 348, 815], water quality [321, 440], and air pollution
    [130, 180]. Further, data on health indicators, which are already collected, can
    quantitatively characterize observed impacts across regions as well as illuminate
    which populations are most at risk to climate-change induced health hazards [831].
    For example, it is known that the young, elderly, and socially isolated are especially
    vulnerable during heat waves, and finer-grained risk estimates could potentially
    drive outreach [622, 697]. Across social applications, there are worthwhile research
    challenges—guiding interventions based on purely observational, potentially unrepresentative
    data poses risks. In these contexts, transparency is necessary, and ideally, causal
    effects of interventions could be estimated, to prevent feedback loops in which
    certain subgroups are systematically ignored from policy interventions. 9.4 Crisis
    Perhaps counterintuitively, natural disasters and health crises are not entirely
    unpredictable—they can be prepared for, risks can be reduced, and coordination
    can be streamlined. Furthermore, while crises may be some of the most distressing
    consequences of climate change, disaster response and public health are mature
    disciplines in their own right, and have already benefited extensively from ML
    methodology [118, 531, 862]. Managing epidemics. Climate change will increase
    the range of vector and water-borne diseases, elevating the likelihood that these
    new environments experience epidemics [324]. Disease surveillance and outbreak
    forecasting systems can be built from web data and specially-designed apps, in
    addition to traditional surveys [394, 467, 627]. While non-survey proxies are
    observational and self-reported, current research attempts to address these issues
    [472, 588]. Beyond surveillance, point-of-care diagnostics have enjoyed a renaissance,
    thanks in part to ML [598, 648]. These are tools that allow health workers to
    make diagnoses when specialized lab equipment is inaccessible. An example is malaria
    diagnosis based on photos of prepared pathology slides taken with a mobile phone
    [649]. Ensuring that these systems reliably and transparently augment extension
    workers, guiding data collection and route planning when appropriate, are active
    areas of study [97, 688]. Disaster response. In disaster preparation and response,
    two types of ML tasks have proven useful: creating maps from aerial imagery and
    performing information retrieval on social media data. Accurate and well-annotated
    maps can inform evacuation planning, retrofitting campaigns, and delivery of relief
    [59, 200]. Further, this imagery can assist damage assessment, by comparing scenes
    immediately pre- and post-disaster [315, 816]. Social media data can contain kernels
    of insight—places without water, clinics without supplies—which can inform relief
    efforts. ML can help properly surface these insights, compressing large volumes
    of social media data into the key takeaways, which can be acted upon by disaster
    managers [118, 368, 596]. 9.5 Discussion Climate change will have profound effects
    on the planet, and the ML community can support efforts to minimize the damage
    it does to ecosystems and the harm it inflicts on people. This section has suggested
    areas of research that may help societies adapt more effectively to these ever
    changing realities. We have identified a few recurring themes, but also emphasized
    the role of understanding domain-specific needs. The use of ML to support societal
    resilience would be a noble goal at any time, but the need for tangible progress
    towards it may never have been so urgent as it is today, in the face of the wide-reaching
    consequences of climate change. Skip 10Solar Geoengineering by Andrew S. Ross
    Section 10 Solar Geoengineering by Andrew S. Ross Airships floating through the
    sky, spraying aerosols; robotic boats crisscrossing the ocean, firing vertical
    jets of spray; arrays of mirrors carefully positioned in space, micro-adjusted
    by remote control; these images seem like science fiction, but they are actually
    real proposals for solar radiation management, commonly called solar geoengineering
    [375, 418, 419, 728]. Solar geoengineering, much like the GHGs causing climate
    change, shifts the balance between how much heat the Earth absorbs and how much
    it releases. The difference is that it is done deliberately, and in the opposite
    direction. The most common umbrella strategy is to make the Earth more reflective,
    keeping heat out, though there are also methods of helping heat escape (besides
    CO 2 removal, which we discuss in Sections 6 and 7). Solar geoengineering generally
    comes with a host of potential side effects and governance challenges. Moreover,
    unlike CO 2 removal, it cannot simply reverse the effects of climate change (average
    temperatures may return to pre-industrial levels, but location-specific climates
    still change), and also comes with the risk of termination shock (fast, catastrophic
    warming if humanity undertakes solar geoengineering but stops suddenly) [615].
    Because of these and other issues, it is not within the scope of this article
    to evaluate or recommend any particular technique. However, the potential for
    solar geoengineering to moderate some of the most catastrophic hazards of climate
    change is well-established [374], and it has received increasing attention in
    the wake of societal inaction on mitigation. Although [418] argue that the “hardest
    and most important problems raised by solar geoengineering are non-technical,”
    there are still a number of important technical questions that ML may be able
    to help us study. Overview. The primary candidate methods for geoengineering are
    marine cloud brightening [396] (making low-lying clouds more reflective), cirrus
    thinning [759] (making high-flying clouds trap less heat), and stratospheric aerosol
    injection [668] (which we discuss below). Other candidates (which are either less
    effective or harder to implement) include “white-roof” methods [10] and even launching
    sunshades into space [29]. Injecting sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere is
    considered a leading candidate for solar geoengineering both because of its economic
    and technological feasibility [527, 743] and because of a reason that should resonate
    with the ML community: we have data. (These data are largely in the form of temperature
    observations after volcanic eruptions, which release sulfates into the stratosphere
    when sufficiently large [691].) Once injected, sulfates circulate globally and
    remain aloft for 1 to 2 years. As a result, the process is reversible, but must
    also be continually maintained. Sulfates come with a well-studied risk of ozone
    loss [210], and they make sunlight slightly more diffuse, which can impact agriculture
    [642]. 10.1 Understanding and Improving Aerosols Design. The effects and side-effects
    of aerosols in the stratosphere (or at slightly lower altitudes for cirrus thinning
    [308]) vary significantly with their optical and chemical properties. Although
    sulfates are the best understood due to volcanic eruption data, many others have
    been studied, including zirconium dioxide, titanium dioxide, calcite (which preserves
    ozone), and even synthetic diamond [209]. However, the design space is far from
    fully explored. ML has had recent success in predicting specific chemical, material,
    and optical properties without the need for expensive experimentation or brute-force
    simulation [105, 299, 490, 653], including in aerosols [465, 500]. Although speculative,
    it is conceivable that ML could accelerate the search for aerosols that are chemically
    nonreactive but still reflective, cheap, and easy to keep aloft. Modeling. One
    reason that sulfates have been the focus for aerosol research is that atmospheric
    aerosol physics is not perfectly captured by current climate models, so having
    natural data is important for validation. Furthermore, even if current aerosol
    models are correct, their best-fit parameters must still be determined (using
    historical data), which comes with uncertainty and computational difficulty. ML
    may offer tools here, both to help quantify and constrain uncertainty, and to
    manage computational load. As a recent example, [247] use Gaussian processes to
    emulate climate model outputs based on nine possible aerosol parameter settings,
    allowing them to establish plausible parameter ranges (and thus much better calibrated
    error-bars) with only 350 climate model runs instead of > 100,000. Although this
    is important progress, ideally we want uncertainty-aware aerosol simulations with
    a fraction of the cost of one climate model run, rather than 350. ML may be able
    to help here too (see Section 8 for more details). 10.2 Engineering a Control
    System Efficient emulations and error-bars will be essential for what MacMartin
    and Kravitz [508] call “The Engineering of Climate Engineering.” According to
    [508], any practical deployment of geoengineering would constitute “one of the
    most critical engineering design and control challenges ever considered: making
    real-time decisions for a highly uncertain and nonlinear dynamic system with many
    input variables, many measurements, and a vast number of internal degrees of freedom,
    the dynamics of which span a wide range of timescales.” Bayesian and neural network-based
    approaches could facilitate the fast, uncertainty-aware nonlinear system identification
    this challenge might require. Additionally, there has been recent progress in
    RL for control [21, 84, 545], which could be useful for fine-tuning geoengineering
    interventions such as deciding where and when to release aerosols. For an initial
    attempt at analyzing stratospheric aerosol injection as a RL problem (using a
    neural network climate model emulator), see [170]. 10.3 Modeling Impacts Of course,
    optimizing interventions requires defining objectives, and the choices here are
    far from clear. Although it is possible to stabilize global mean temperature and
    even regional temperatures through geoengineering, it is most likely impossible
    to preserve all relevant climate characteristics in all locations. Furthermore,
    climate model outputs do not tell the full story; ultimately, the goal of climate
    engineering is to minimize harm to people, ecosystems, and society. It is therefore
    essential to develop robust tools for estimating the extent and distribution of
    these potential harms. There has been some recent work in applying ML to assess
    the impacts of geoengineering. For example, [179] use deep neural networks to
    estimate the effects of aerosols on human health, while [148] use them to estimate
    the effects of solar geoengineering on agriculture. References [101, 187] use
    relatively simple local and polynomial regression techniques but applied to extensive
    empirical data to estimate the past and future effects of temperature change on
    economic production. More generally, the field of Integrated Assessment Modeling
    [422, 840] aims to map the outputs of a climate model to societal impacts; for
    a general discussion of potential opportunities for applying ML to integrated
    assessment models (IAMs), see Section 12.2. 10.4 Discussion Any consideration
    of solar geoengineering raises many moral questions. It may help certain regions
    at the expense of others, introduce risks like termination shock, and serve as
    a “moral hazard”: widespread awareness of its very possibility may undermine mainstream
    efforts to cut emissions [485]. Because of these issues, there has been significant
    debate about whether it is ethically responsible to research this topic [420,
    640]. However, although it creates new risks, solar geoengineering could actually
    be a moderating force against the terrifying uncertainties climate change already
    introduces [374, 509], and ultimately many environmental groups and governmental
    bodies have come down on the side of supporting further research [145, 258, 592].
    In this section, we have attempted to outline some of the technical challenges
    in implementing and evaluating solar geoengineering. We hope the ML community
    can help geoengineering researchers tackle these challenges. Skip 11Individual
    Action by Natasha Jaques Section 11 Individual Action by Natasha Jaques Individuals
    may worry that they are powerless to affect climate change, or lack clarity on
    which of their behaviors are most important to change. In fact, there are actions
    which can meaningfully reduce each person’s carbon footprint, and, if widely adopted,
    could have a significant impact on mitigating global emissions [335, 845]. AI
    can help to identify those behaviors, inform individuals, and provide constructive
    opportunities by modeling individual behavior. 11.1 Understanding Personal Carbon
    Footprint We as individuals are constantly confronted with decisions that affect
    our carbon footprint, but we may lack the data and knowledge to know which decisions
    are most impactful. Fortunately, ML can help determine an individual’s carbon
    footprint from their personal and household data [790]. For example, natural language
    processing can be used to extract the flights a person takes from their email,
    or determine specific grocery items purchased from a bill, making it possible
    to predict the associated emissions. Systems that combine this information with
    data obtained from the user’s smartphone (e.g., from a ride-sharing app) can then
    help consumers who wish to identify which behaviors result in the highest emissions.
    Given such a ML model, counterfactual reasoning can potentially be used to demonstrate
    to consumers how much their emissions would be reduced for each behavior they
    changed. As a privacy-conscious alternative, emissions estimates could be directly
    incorporated into grocery labels [562] or interfaces for purchasing flights. Such
    information can empower people to understand how they can best help mitigate climate
    change through behavior change. Residences are responsible for a large share of
    GHG emissions [372] (see also Section 4). A large meta-analysis found that significant
    residential energy savings can be achieved [215], by targeting the right interventions
    to the right households [14, 16, 17]. ML can predict a household’s emissions in
    transportation, energy, water, waste, foods, goods, and services, as a function
    of its characteristics [399]. These predictions can be used to tailor customized
    interventions for high-emissions households [398]. Changing behavior both helps
    mitigate climate change and benefits individuals; studies have shown that many
    carbon mitigation strategies also provide cost savings to consumers [399]. Household
    energy disaggregation breaks down overall electricity consumption into energy
    use by individual appliances (see also Section 4.1) [33], which can help facilitate
    behavior change [772]. For example, it can be used to inform consumers of high-energy
    appliances of which they were previously unaware. This alone could have a significant
    impact, since many devices consume a large amount of electricity even when not
    in use; standby power consumption accounts for roughly 8% of residential electricity
    demand [507]. A variety of ML techniques have been used to effectively disaggregate
    household energy, such as spectral clustering, Hidden Markov Models, and neural
    networks [33]. ML can also be used to predict the marginal emissions of energy
    consumption in real time, on a scale of hours [832], potentially allowing consumers
    to effectively schedule activities such as charging an EV when the emissions (and
    prices [439]) will be lowest [143]. Combining these predictions with disaggregated
    energy data allows for the efficient automation of household energy consumption,
    ideally through products that present interpretable insights to the consumer (e.g.,
    [721, 760]). Methods like RL can be used to learn how to optimally schedule household
    appliances to consume energy more efficiently and sustainably [543, 679]. Multi-agent
    learning has also been applied to this problem, to ensure that groups of homes
    can coordinate to balance energy consumption to keep peak demand low [662, 863].
    11.2 Facilitating Behavior Change ML is highly effective at modeling human preferences,
    and this can be leveraged to help mitigate climate change. Using ML, we can model
    and cluster individuals based on their climate knowledge, preferences, demographics,
    and consumption characteristics (e.g., [66, 116, 166, 261, 861]), and thus predict
    who will be most amenable to new technologies and sustainable behavior change.
    Such techniques have improved the enrollment rate of customers in an energy savings
    program by 2–3x [14]. Other works have used ML to predict how much consumers are
    willing to pay to avoid potential environmental harms of energy consumption [167],
    finding that some groups were totally insensitive to cost and would pay the maximum
    amount to mitigate harm, while other groups were willing to pay nothing. Given
    such disparate types of consumers, targeting interventions toward particular households
    may be especially worthwhile; all the more so because data show that the size
    and composition of household carbon footprints varies dramatically across geographic
    regions and demographics [399]. Citizens who would like to engage with policy
    decisions, or explore different options to reduce their personal carbon footprint,
    can have difficulty understanding existing laws and policies due to their complexity.
    They may benefit from tools that make policy information more manageable and relevant
    to the individual (e.g., based on where the individual lives). There is the potential
    for natural language processing to derive understandable insights from policy
    texts for these applications, similar to automated compliance checking [67, 876].
    Understanding individual behavior can help signal how it can be nudged. For example,
    path analysis has shown that an individual’s psychological distance to climate
    change (on geographic, temporal, social, and uncertainty dimensions) fully mediates
    their level of climate change concern [397]. This suggests that interventions
    minimizing psychological distance to the effects of climate change may be most
    effective. Similarly, ML has revealed that cross-cultural support for international
    climate programs is not reduced, even when individuals are exposed to information
    about other countries’ climate behavior [65]. To make the effects of climate change
    more real for consumers, and thus help motivate those who wish to act, image generation
    techniques such as CycleGANs have been used to visualize the potential consequences
    of extreme weather events on houses and cities [716]. Gamification via deep learning
    has been proposed to further allow individuals to explore their personal energy
    usage [447]. All of these programs may be an incredibly cost-effective way to
    reduce energy consumption; behavior change programs can cost as little as 3 cents
    to save a kilowatt hour of electricity, whereas generating one kWh would cost
    5–6 cents with a coal or wind power plant, and 10 cents with solar [207, 313].
    11.3 Discussion While individuals can sometimes feel that their contributions
    to climate change are dwarfed by other factors, in reality individual actions
    can have a significant impact in mitigating climate change. ML can aid this process
    by empowering consumers to understand which of their behaviors lead to the highest
    emissions, automatically scheduling energy consumption, and providing insights
    into how to facilitate behavior change. Skip 12Collective Decisions by Tegan Maharaj
    & Nikola Milojevic-Dupont Section 12 Collective Decisions by Tegan Maharaj & Nikola
    Milojevic-Dupont Addressing climate change requires swift and effective decision-making
    by groups at multiple levels—communities, unions, NGOs, businesses, governments,
    intergovernmental organizations, and many more. Such collective decision-making
    encompasses many kinds of action—for example, negotiating international treaties
    to reduce GHG emissions, designing carbon markets, building resilient infrastructure,
    and establishing community-owned solar farms. These decisions often involve multiple
    stakeholders with different goals and priorities, requiring difficult trade-offs.
    The economic and societal systems involved are often extremely complex, and the
    impacts of climate-related decisions can play out globally across long time horizons.
    To address some of these challenges, researchers are using empirical and mathematical
    methods from fields such as policy analysis, operations research, economics, game
    theory, and computational social science; there are many opportunities for ML
    to support and supplement these methods. 12.1 Modeling Social Interactions When
    designing climate change strategies, it is critical to understand how organizations
    and individuals act and interact in response to different incentives and constraints.
    Agent-based models (ABMs) [168, 222] represent one approach used in simulating
    the actions and interactions of agents (people, companies, etc.) in their environment.
    ABMs have been applied to a multitude of problems relevant to climate change,
    in particular to study low-carbon technology adoption [320, 584, 656, 878]. For
    example, when modeling solar PV adoption [875], agents may represent individuals
    who act based on factors such as financial interest and the behavior of their
    peers [88, 655]; the goal is then to study how these agents interact in response
    to different conditions, such as electricity rates, subsidy programs, and geographical
    considerations. Here, ML can help identify the roles of these conditions directly
    from data [58]. Other applications of ABMs include modeling how behavior under
    social norms changes with external pressures [715], how the economy and climate
    may evolve given a diversity of political and economic beliefs [272], and how
    individuals may migrate in response to environmental changes [787]. While agent
    and environment models in ABMs are often hand-designed by experts, ML can help
    integrate data-driven insights into these models [874], for example, by learning
    rules or models for agents based on observational data [312, 875], or by using
    unsupervised methods such as variational autoencoders or generative adversarial
    networks to discover salient features useful in modeling a complex environment.
    While the hope of learning or tuning behavior from data is promising for generalization,
    many data-driven approaches lose the interpretability for which ABMs are valued;
    work in interpretable ML methods could potentially help with this. In addition
    to ABMs, techniques from game theory can be valuable in modeling behavior, e.g.,
    to explore cooperation in the face of a depleting resource [344]. Multi-agent
    RL can also be applied to understand the behavior of groups of agents who need
    to cooperate; see [607] for an overview and [385, 475] for recent examples. Combined
    with mechanism design,30 such approaches can be used to design methods for cooperation
    that lead to mutually beneficial outcomes, for example when formalizing procedures
    around international climate agreements [522, 641]. 12.2 Informing Policy The
    actions required to address climate change, both in mitigation and adaptation,
    require making policies31 at the local, national, and international levels [756].
    Various institutions act as policy makers: for instance, governments, international
    organizations, non-governmental organizations, standards committees, and professional
    institutions. Tools from policy analysis—the process of evaluating the outcomes
    of past policies and assessing future policy alternatives32—can help inform the
    choices these institutions make. Policy analysis uses quantitative tools from
    statistics, economics, and operations research such as cost–benefit analysis,
    uncertainty analysis, and multi-criteria decision-making to inform the policymaking
    process; see [555, 618] for an introduction. ML can provide data for policy analysis,
    help improve existing tools for assessing policy options, and provide new tools
    for evaluating the effects of policies. Gathering data. When creating policies,
    decision-makers must often negotiate fundamental uncertainties in the underlying
    data. ML can help alleviate some of this uncertainty by providing data. For instance,
    as detailed elsewhere in this article, ML can help pinpoint sources of emissions
    (Sections 2.2 and 6.1), approximate traffic patterns (Section 3.1), identify infrastructure
    at risk (Section 9.2), and mine information from companies’ financial disclosures
    (Section 14). Natural language processing, network analysis, and clustering techniques
    can also be used to analyze social media data to understand public opinions and
    discourse around climate change [436, 812, 844]. These data can then be used to
    identify areas of intervention, compute the benefits and costs of a project, or
    evaluate the effectiveness of a policy after it has been implemented. Assessing
    policy options. Decision-makers often construct mathematical models to help them
    assess or tradeoff between different policy alternatives. ML is particularly relevant
    to approaches that model large and complex socio-economic systems to assess outcomes
    of particular strategies, as well as optimization-based tools that help with navigating
    the decision. Policy-makers often wish to analyze how different policy alternatives
    may contribute to achieving a particular objective. Computational approaches such
    as simulation and (partial) equilibrium models can be used to compare different
    policy options, assess the effects of underlying assumptions, or propose strategies
    that are consistent with the objectives of decision-makers. Of particular relevance
    to climate change mitigation are IAMs, which incorporate economic models, climate
    models, and policy information (see [840] for an overview). IAMs are used to explore
    future societal pathways that are consistent with climate goals (e.g., 1.5 ∘ C
    mean global temperature increase), and play a prominent role in the IPCC assessments
    [561]. While these models can simulate interactions between many variables in
    great detail, this comes at the cost of computational complexity and presents
    opportunities for ML. Much as with Earth system models (Section 8), ML can be
    applied within any of the various sub-models that make up an IAM. One set of applications
    involves deriving results at the appropriate spatial resolution, since different
    components of an IAM operate at different scales. Outputs with high resolution
    may be aggregated via clustering methods to provide insights [183], while at coarser
    resolution, statistical downscaling can help to disaggregate data to an appropriate
    spatial resolution, as seen in applications such as crop yield [249], wind speed
    [479] or surface temperature [481]. ML also has the potential to help with sensitivity
    and uncertainty analysis [386], with finding numerical solutions for computational
    expensive submodels [206, 714], and assessing the validity of the models [556].
    In addition to assessing the outcomes of various policies, policymakers may also
    employ optimization-based tools to figure out what decisions to make. For example,
    combinatorial optimization is a powerful tool used widely for decision-making
    in operations research. See [70] for a survey of how ML can be employed to help
    solve combinatorial optimization problems. Tools from the field of multi-criteria
    decision-making can also help policymakers manage trade-offs between different
    policies by reconciling competing objectives and minimizing negative side-effects;
    in particular, in cases where policy objectives and constraints can be mathematically
    formalized, multi-objective optimization can provide a pragmatic approach to making
    decisions. Here, a decision-maker would formulate their decision-making process
    as an optimization problem by combining multiple optimization objectives subject
    to physical or other types of constraints; the goal is to then find a solution
    (or set of solutions) that is Pareto-optimal with respect to all of the objective
    functions. However, finding these solutions is often computationally expensive.
    Practitioners have applied bio-inspired algorithms such as particle swarm, genetic,
    or evolutionary algorithms to search for or compute Pareto-optimal solutions that
    satisfy the constraints. This approach has been applied in a number of climate
    change-related fields, including energy and infrastructure planning [38, 325,
    525, 635, 732, 856], industry [122, 334], land use [462, 809], and more [127,
    317, 539, 761]. Previous work has also employed parallel surrogate search, assisted
    by ML, to efficiently solve multi-objective optimization problems [11]. Optimization
    algorithms which have been successful in the context of hyperparameter tuning
    (e.g., Bayesian optimization [726, 745]) or guided search algorithms (e.g., tree
    search algorithms [738]) could also potentially be applied to this problem. Evaluating
    policy effects. When creating new policies, decision-makers may wish to understand
    previous policies (e.g., from other jurisdictions) and how these policies performed.
    ML can help analyze previous policy actions automatically and at scale by improving
    computational text analysis. In particular, natural language processing methods
    are already used in the field of political science to analyze political texts
    and legislation [307]; these approaches could be promising for systematically
    studying climate change policies. Causal inference techniques can also help assess
    the effect of a particular policy or climate-related event from observed outcomes.
    ML can play a role in causal inference [41, 340, 619], including in the context
    of policy problems [40, 453] and in climate-relevant scenarios such as estimating
    the effects of temperature on human mortality [356] and the effects of World Bank
    projects on vegetative cover [883]. 12.3 Designing Markets In economics, GHG emissions
    can be seen as a negative externality: while a changing climate results in a cost
    for society, this cost is often not reflected in the market price of goods or
    services that cause GHG emissions. This is problematic, since organizations and
    individuals making decisions solely on the basis of market prices will tend to
    favor cheaper goods, even if those goods emit a large amount of GHGs. Market-based
    tools33 such as cap-and-trade aim to enforce prices reflecting the societal cost
    of GHGs and thus encourage socially beneficial behavior through market forces.
    ML can help in understanding the impacts of market instruments; assessing their
    effectiveness at reducing emissions; and supporting a swift, effective and fair
    implementation.34 Predicting carbon prices. There are several approaches to pricing
    GHG emissions. Carbon taxes and quotas aim to influence the behavior of organizations
    by shaping supply and demand within an existing market. By contrast, cap-and-trade
    approaches such as those within the European Union involve a completely new market,
    an Emissions Trading Scheme, within which companies can buy and sell a limited
    number of GHG emissions permits. Prices within such cap-and-trade markets are
    highly sensitive to control elements such as the number of permits released at
    a given time. ML can be used to analyze prices within these markets, for example
    by predicting prices via supervised learning [769, 834, 890, 892] or analyzing
    the main drivers of prices via hierarchical clustering [891]. Non-carbon markets.
    Market design can influence GHG emissions even in settings where such emissions
    are not directly penalized. For instance, dynamic pricing in electricity markets—varying
    the price of electricity to consumers based on, e.g., how much wind power is available—can
    shape demand for low-carbon energy sources (see Section 2.1.1). Following seminal
    research on modeling pricing in markets as a bandit problem [700], many works
    have applied bandit and other RL algorithms to determine prices or other market
    values. For example, RL has been applied to predict bids [654] and market power
    [572] in electricity markets, and to set dynamic prices in more general settings
    [510]. ML can also help solve auctions in supply chains [708]. Assessing market
    effects. When designing market-based strategies, it is necessary to understand
    how effectively each strategy will reduce emissions, as well as how the underlying
    socio-technical system may be affected. Studies have considered effects of carbon
    pricing on economic growth and energy intensity [233, 234], or on electricity
    prices [569]. Effects of pricing mechanisms can also be indirect, as companies’
    strategic decisions can have longer-term effects. ML can be useful in analyzing
    these effects. For example, self-organizing maps have been used to analyze how
    R&D investment in green technologies changes in response to fuel prices [55],
    while a game theoretical framework using neural networks has been used to study
    the optimal production strategies for companies under carbon quotas [884]. To
    ensure that market-based strategies are effective and equitable, it is important
    to understand their distributional effects, as certain social groups or classes
    of stakeholders may be affected more than others. For example, a flat carbon tax
    on gasoline will have a larger effect on lower-income populations, as fuel expenses
    are a bigger share of their total budget. Here, clustering can help identify permit
    allocation schemes that maximize social welfare [855], and supervised learning
    has been used to predict winners and losers from changing electricity tariff schemes
    [302]. Hedonic pricing can also help identify how much different consumers may
    be willing to pay for a environmental good or a service, which is a noisy measure
    for the monetary value of that good or service; these values are typically inferred
    using regression or ML techniques on historical market data [175, 594, 613, 629].
    It is also important to analyze which organizations or individuals can actually
    participate in a given market. For example, carbon markets can be more flexible
    if viable offsets exist, including those offered by landowners who sequester carbon
    through forest conservation and management; ML has been used to examine the factors
    influencing the financial viability of such projects [425]. 12.4 Discussion The
    complexity, scale, and fundamental uncertainty inherent in the problems of climate
    change can pose challenges for collective decision-making. ML can help supplement
    existing mathematical frameworks that are employed to alleviate some of these
    challenges, including agent-based models, IAMs, multi-objective optimization,
    and market design tools. Interpretable and fair ML techniques may be of particular
    importance in this context, as they may enable decision-makers to more effectively
    and equitably employ insights from ML models. While these quantitative assessment
    tools can provide useful input to the decision-making process, it is worth noting
    that decisions regarding climate change may ultimately depend on qualitative discussions
    around norms, values, or equity considerations that may not be captured in quantitative
    models. Skip 13Education by Alexandra Luccioni Section 13 Education by Alexandra
    Luccioni Access to quality education is a key part of sustainable development,
    with significant benefits for climate and society at large. Education contributes
    to improving quality of life, helps individuals make informed decisions, and trains
    the next generation of innovators. Education is also paramount in helping people
    across societies understand and address the causes and consequences of climate
    change and provides the skills and tools necessary for adapting to its impacts.
    For instance, education can both improve the resilience of communities, particularly
    in developing countries that will be disproportionately affected by climate change
    [801], and empower individuals, especially from developed countries, to adopt
    more sustainable lifestyles [244]. As climate change itself may diminish educational
    outcomes for some populations, due to its negative effects on agricultural productivity
    and household income [666, 667], this makes providing high-quality educational
    interventions globally all the more important. AI in Education. There are a number
    of ways that AI and ML can contribute to education and teaching—for instance,
    by improving access to educational opportunities, helping personalize the teaching
    process, and stepping in when teachers have limited time. The field of Artificial
    Intelligence in EDucation (AIED) has existed for over 30 years, and until recently
    relied on explicitly modeling content, learners, and tutoring strategies based
    on psychological theories of learning. However, AIED is increasingly incorporating
    data-driven insights derived from ML techniques. One important area of AIED research
    has been Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs), which can adapt their behavior in
    real time according to the needs of individuals or to support collaborative learning
    [124]. While ITSs have traditionally been defined and constructed by hand, recent
    approaches have applied ML techniques such as multi-armed bandit techniques to
    adaptively personalize sequences of learning activities [135], LSTMs to generate
    questions to evaluate language comprehension [205], and RL to improve the strategies
    used within the ITS [365, 441]. However, there remains much work to be done to
    bridge the performance gap between digital and human tutors, and ML-based approaches
    have an important role to play in this endeavor—for example, via natural language
    processing techniques for creating conversational agents [295], learner analytics
    for classifying student profiles, [695], and adaptive learning approaches to propose
    relevant educational activities and exercises [774].35 While ITSs generally focus
    on individualized or small-group instruction, AIED can also help provide tools
    that improve educational outcomes at scale for larger groups of learners. For
    instance, scalable, adaptive online courses could give hundreds of thousands of
    learners access to learning resources that they would not usually have in their
    local educational facilities [694]. Furthermore, giving teachers guidance derived
    from computational teaching algorithms or heuristics could help them design better
    educational curricula and improve student learning outcomes [172]. In this context,
    AIED applications can be used either as a standalone tool for independent learners
    or as an educational resource that frees up teachers to have more one-on-one time
    with students. Key considerations for creating AIED tools that can be applied
    across the globe include adapting to local technological and cultural needs, addressing
    barriers such as access to electricity and internet [430, 431], and taking into
    account students’ computing skills, language, and culture [106, 590]. Learning
    about climate. Research has shown that educational activities centered on climate
    change and carbon footprints can engage learners in understanding the connection
    between personal and collective actions and their impact on global climate, and
    can enable individuals to make climate-friendly lifestyle choices such as reducing
    energy use [142]. There have also been proposals for interactive websites explaining
    climate science as well as educational interventions focusing on local and actionable
    aspects of sustainable development [22]. In these contexts, ML can help create
    personalized educational tools, for instance by generating images of potential
    future impacts of extreme weather events based on a learner’s address [716] or
    by anchoring an individual’s learning experience in a digital replica of their
    real-life location and allowing them to explore the way that climate change will
    impact a specific location [28]. Skip 14Finance by Alexandra Luccioni Section
    14 Finance by Alexandra Luccioni The rise and fall of financial markets is linked
    to many events, both sporadic (e.g., the 2008 global financial crisis) and cyclical
    (e.g., the price of gas over the years), with profits and losses that can be measured
    in the billions of dollars and can have global consequences. Climate change poses
    a substantial financial risks to global assets measured in the trillions of dollars
    [185], and it is hard to forecast where, how, or when climate change will impact
    the stock price of a given company, or even the debt of an entire nation. While
    financial analysts and investors focus on pricing risk and forecasting potential
    earnings, the majority of the current financial system is based on quarterly or
    yearly performance. This fails to incentivize the prediction of medium or long-term
    risks, which include most climate change-related exposures such as physical impacts
    on assets or distribution chains, legislative impacts on profit generation, and
    indirect market consequences such as supply and demand.36 Climate investment.
    Climate investment, the current dominant approach in climate finance, involves
    investing money in low-carbon assets [229]. The dominant ways in which major financial
    institutions take this approach are by creating “green” financial indexes that
    focus on low-carbon energy, clean technology, and/or environmental services [182]
    or by designing carbon-neutral investment portfolios that remove or under-weight
    companies with relatively high carbon footprints [284]. This investment strategy
    is creating major shifts in certain sectors of the market (e.g., utilities and
    energy) towards renewable energy alternatives, which are seen as having a greater
    growth potential than traditional energy sources such as oil and gas [72]. While
    this approach currently does not utilize ML directly, we see the potential in
    applying deep learning both for portfolio selection (based on features of the
    stocks involved) and investment timing (using historical patterns to predict future
    demand), to maximize both the impact and scope of climate investment strategies.
    Climate analytics. The other main approach to climate finance is climate analytics,
    which aims to predict the financial effects of climate change, and is still gaining
    momentum in the mainstream financial community [229]. Since this is a predictive
    approach to addressing climate change from a financial perspective, it is one
    where ML can potentially have greater impact. Climate analytics involves analyzing
    investment portfolios, funds, and companies in order to pinpoint areas with heightened
    risk due to climate change, such as timber companies that could be bankrupted
    by wildfires or water extraction initiatives that could see their sources polluted
    by shifting landscapes. Approaches used in this field include: natural language
    processing techniques for identifying climate risks and investment opportunities
    in disclosures made by companies [254, 442, 498, 752] as well as for analyzing
    the evolution of climate coverage in the media to dynamically hedge climate change
    risk [221]; econometric approaches for developing arbitrage strategies that take
    advantage of the carbon risk factor in financial markets [26]; and ML approaches
    for forecasting the price of carbon in emission exchanges37 [887, 889]. To date,
    the field of climate finance has been largely neglected within the larger scope
    of financial research and analysis. This leaves many directions for improvement,
    such as (1) improving existing traditional portfolio optimization approaches;
    (2) in-depth modeling of variables linked to climate risk; (3) designing a statistical
    climate factor that can be used to project the variation of stock prices given
    a compound set of events; and (4) identifying direct and indirect climate risk
    exposure in annual company reports. ML plays a central role in these strategies,
    and can be a powerful tool in leveraging the financial sector to mitigate climate
    change and in reducing the financial impacts of climate change on society. Skip
    15CONCLUSION Section 15 CONCLUSION ML, like any technology, does not always make
    the world a better place—but it can. In the fight against climate change, ML has
    significant contributions to offer across domain areas. ML can enable automatic
    monitoring through remote sensing (e.g., by pinpointing deforestation, gathering
    data on buildings, and assessing damage after disasters). It can accelerate the
    process of scientific discovery (e.g., by suggesting new materials for batteries,
    construction, and carbon capture). ML can optimize systems to improve efficiency
    (e.g., by consolidating freight, designing carbon markets, and reducing food waste).
    And it can accelerate computationally expensive physical simulations through hybrid
    modeling (e.g., climate models and energy scheduling models). These and other
    cross-cutting themes are shown in Table 2. We emphasize that in each application,
    ML is only one part of the solution; it is a tool that enables other tools across
    fields. Table 2. Table 2. Cross-Cutting Objectives that are Relevant to Many Climate
    Change Domains Applying ML to tackle climate change has the potential both to
    benefit society and to advance the field of ML. Many of the problems we have discussed
    here highlight cutting-edge areas of ML, such as interpretability, causality,
    and uncertainty quantification. Moreover, meaningful action on climate problems
    requires dialogue with fields within and outside computer science and can lead
    to interdisciplinary methodological innovations, such as improved physics-constrained
    ML techniques. The nature of climate-relevant data poses challenges and opportunities.
    For many of the applications we identify, data can be proprietary or include sensitive
    personal information. Where datasets exist, they may not be organized with a specific
    task in mind, unlike typical ML benchmarks that have a clear objective. Datasets
    may include information from heterogeneous sources, which must be integrated using
    domain knowledge. Moreover, the available data may not be representative of global
    use cases. For example, forecasts of electricity demand based on a dataset from
    the US will not necessarily generalize to India, where patterns of demand may
    be different. Tools from transfer learning and domain adaptation will likely prove
    essential in low-data settings. For some tasks, it may also be feasible to augment
    learning with carefully simulated data. Of course, the best option if possible
    is always more real data; we strongly encourage public and private entities to
    release datasets and to solicit involvement from the ML community. For those looking
    to use ML to help tackle climate change, we provide further resources via the
    Climate Change AI initiative ( www.climatechange.ai), and we offer the following
    roadmap: Learn. Identify how your skills may be useful—we hope this article is
    a starting point. Remember that often the most impactful work lies in solving
    well-defined, domain-specific bottlenecks, and is not always flashy. Collaborate.
    Find collaborators, who may be researchers, entrepreneurs, established companies,
    or policy makers. Every domain discussed here has experts who understand its opportunities
    and pitfalls, even if they are not experts in ML. Listen. Listen to what your
    collaborators and other stakeholders say is needed for addressing the problem
    effectively. Keep in mind that complex methodologies are not always needed. Deploy.
    Work with deployment partners to ensure a pathway to impact for your work, and
    incorporate deployment-related considerations during development. We call upon
    the ML community to use its skills as part of the global effort against climate
    change. Skip ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Section ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Electricity systems. We thank

    2 See the AI for social good movement (e.g., [71, 323]), ML for the developing
    world [163], the computational sustainability movement (e.g., [184, 296, 297,
    401, 471], the American Meteorological Society’s Committee on AI Applications
    to Environmental Science, and the field of Climate Informatics ( www.climateinformatics.org.)
    [548], as well as the relevant survey papers [231, 251, 403]. Footnote 3 Rebound
    effects occur when increased efficiency results in higher demand, partially or
    completely negating the benefits of efficiency gains [45]. For example, lowering
    the energy required to produce a product can lead to lower costs, which in turn
    can increase the consumption of the product. In such cases, specific policies,
    such as pricing mechanisms or caps on GHG emissions, can help to limit rebound
    effects. See also the literature on induced demand and the Jevons paradox. Footnote
    4 It is worth noting that many ML methods cited in this article require only minimal
    energy to train and run (e.g., can be run on a laptop or phone). Footnote 5 Throughout
    this section, we use the term “electricity systems” to refer to the procurement
    of fuels and raw materials for electric grid components; the generation and storage
    of electricity; and the delivery of electricity to end-use consumers. For primers
    on these topics, see [96, 141, 437, 817, 848]. Footnote 6 We use the term “low-carbon”
    here instead of “renewable” because of this article’s explicit focus on climate
    change goals. Renewable energy is produced from inexhaustible or easily replenished
    energy sources such as the sun, wind, or water, but need not necessarily be carbon-free
    (as in the case of some biomass [149]). Similarly, not all low-carbon energy is
    renewable (as in the case of nuclear energy). Footnote 7 Nuclear power plants
    are often viewed as inflexible since they can take hours or days to turn on or
    off, and are often left on (at full capacity) to operate as baseload. That said,
    nuclear power plants may have some flexibility to change their power generation
    for load-following and other electric grid services, as in the case of France
    [491]. Footnote 8 It is worth noting that in systems with many fossil fuel plants,
    storage may increase emissions depending on how it is operated [47, 347]. Footnote
    9 For discussions and examples of different types of advanced electricity markets,
    see [109, 483, 484, 877]. Footnote 10 Dam-based hydropower may produce methane,
    primarily due to biomass that decomposes when a hydro reservoir floods, but the
    amount produced varies between power plants [753]. Footnote 11 Plasma simulation
    frameworks for tokamak reactors include RAPTOR [236, 237], ASTRA [624], CRONOS
    [35], PTRANSP [100], and IPS [250]. Footnote 12 Carbon intensity is measured in
    grams of CO 2 -equivalent per person-km or per ton-km, respectively. Footnote
    13 For general resources on how to decarbonize the transportation sector, see
    the AR5 chapter on transportation [712], and [240, 407, 784]. Footnote 14 In this
    section, we discuss shared cars; see Section 3.4 for bike shares and electric
    scooters. Footnote 15 Providing details on the general role of ML for AVs is beyond
    the scope of this article. Footnote 16 The IPCC classifies mitigation actions
    in buildings into four categories: carbon efficiency (switching to low-carbon
    fuels or to natural refrigerants); energy efficiency (reducing energy waste through
    insulation, efficient appliances, better heating and ventilation, or other similar
    measures); system and infrastructure efficiency (e.g., passive house standards,
    urban planning, and district cooling and heating); and service demand reduction
    (behavioral and lifestyle changes) [499]. Footnote 17 There are even high-rise
    buildings, e.g., the Tower Raiffeisen-Holding NÖ-Vienna office, or large university
    buildings, e.g., the Technical University also in Vienna, that achieve such performance.
    Footnote 18 For example, see the case of New York City, which mandated that building
    owners collectively reduce their emissions by 40% by 2040: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/17/nyregion/nyc-energy-laws.html.

    to deploy, including GHGSat satellites in already orbit and plans by Carbon Mapper,
    Bluefield Technologies, and the Environmental Defense Fund to launch satellites
    in coming years [81, 113, 534]. Even once this technology comes online, ML will

    Footnote 29 This is one of several reasons why climate models produce accurate
    long-term predictions in spite of atmospheric chaos. Footnote 30 Mechanism design
    is often called “inverse game theory”—rather than determining optimal strategies
    for players, mechanism design seeks to design games such that certain strategies
    are incentivized. Footnote 31 Policy can refer, for example, to laws, measures,
    standards, or best practices. Footnote 32 The former is often referred to as ex-post
    policy analysis and the latter as ex-ante policy analysis. Footnote 33 For background
    on market-based strategies, see [217, 755, 757]. Footnote 34 For a review on ML
    for energy economics and finance, see [283]. Footnote 35 For further background
    on this area, see [395, 582, 630]. Footnote 36 For further reading regarding the
    impact of climate change on financial markets, see [61, 86, 108]. Footnote 37
    Carbon pricing, e.g., via CO 2 cap-and-trade or a carbon tax, is a commonly-suggested
    policy approach for getting firms to price future climate change impacts into
    their financial calculations. For an introduction to these topics, see [632] and

    \ (G.C.)\nAbstract: The increasing population across the globe makes it essential\
    \ to link smart and sustainable\ncity planning with the logistics of transporting\
    \ people and goods, which will signiﬁcantly contribute\nto how societies will\
    \ face mobility in the coming years. The concept of smart mobility emerged\nwith\
    \ the popularity of smart cities and is aligned with the sustainable development\
    \ goals deﬁned\nby the United Nations. A reduction in trafﬁc congestion and new\
    \ route optimizations with reduced\necological footprint are some of the essential\
    \ factors of smart mobility; however, other aspects\nmust also be taken into account,\
    \ such as the promotion of active mobility and inclusive mobility,\nencouraging\
    \ the use of other types of environmentally friendly fuels and engagement with\
    \ citizens.\nThe Internet of Things (IoT), Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain\
    \ and Big Data technology will serve\nas the main entry points and fundamental\
    \ pillars to promote the rise of new innovative solutions\nthat will change the\
    \ current paradigm for cities and their citizens. Mobility-as-a-service, trafﬁc\
    \ ﬂow\noptimization, the optimization of logistics and autonomous vehicles are\
    \ some of the services and\napplications that will encompass several changes in\
    \ the coming years with the transition of existing\ncities into smart cities.\
    \ This paper provides an extensive review of the current trends and solutions\n\
    presented in the scope of smart mobility and enabling technologies that support\
    \ it. An overview\nof how smart mobility ﬁts into smart cities is provided by\
    \ characterizing its main attributes and\nthe key beneﬁts of using smart mobility\
    \ in a smart city ecosystem. Further, this paper highlights\nother various opportunities\
    \ and challenges related to smart mobility. Lastly, the major services and\napplications\
    \ that are expected to arise in the coming years within smart mobility are explored\
    \ with\nthe prospective future trends and scope.\nKeywords: smart mobility; sustainability;\
    \ smart cities; smart services\n1. Introduction\nSmart mobility is an emerging\
    \ concept that is increasingly aligned with sustainable\nworld development, taking\
    \ into account the 17 sustainable development goals set by the\nUnited Nations\
    \ [1] for 2030. The concept of mobility, and how it will articulate with the\n\
    planning of cities and the logistics of transporting goods and people, will experience\
    \ drastic\nchanges in the coming years. Demographic growth continues to follow\
    \ an exponential\nroute, with 6 billion people registered in 1999, an approximate\
    \ number of 7.7 billion in\n2020 and a predicted number of approximately 9 billion\
    \ expected for 2040 [2]. This growth\nwe see in cities all over the world will\
    \ necessarily translate into the need for new route\noptimization algorithms for\
    \ vehicles and people, trafﬁc management to reduce congestion,\nand greater optimization\
    \ in logistic processes, among others. However, the concept of\nsmart mobility\
    \ goes far beyond solving these problems since future contributions are\nexpected\
    \ to represent differentiating and truly innovative solutions [3]. The focus on\
    \ the\nsustainability of the solutions developed, active transport, the use of\
    \ environmentally\nfriendly fuels and engagement with citizens are aspects that\
    \ should be part of smart\nSensors 2021, 21, 2143. https://doi.org/10.3390/s21062143\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2021, 21, 2143\n2 of 41\nmobility\
    \ in the coming years. The impacted dimensions will therefore be varied and\n\
    include sustainability, economy and living, which has a direct impact on citizens\
    \ and also\non government entities [3].\nTwo key concepts are at the base of what\
    \ will be the evolution of smart mobility in the\ncoming years: on one hand, the\
    \ transport of goods, and on the other, the paradigm shift in\nthe mobility of\
    \ people that will transition to mobility-as-a-service. Regarding transports\n\
    of goods, we already witness several robot prototypes around the world that deliver\n\
    basic necessities to people’s homes, which will mean an adjustment to how businesses\n\
    operate (supermarkets, delivery services, among others). Internet of Things (IoT),\
    \ Big\nData and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) will play a fundamental role in new\
    \ solutions. It\nshould be highlighted that the changes the coming years will\
    \ bring will promote inevitable\nchanges in what will be the jobs of the future.\
    \ Regarding the transport of people, trends are\nevolving towards a mobility-as-a-service\
    \ paradigm, with a drastic reduction in the number\nof private vehicles that will\
    \ be ﬁlled by electric, shared, lighter and smaller vehicles and\nwith autonomous\
    \ driving.\nThis paper provides an exhaustive literature review of several solutions\
    \ across mul-\ntiple domains that are related to smart mobility in smart cities.\
    \ The paper also provides\nan overview about what is smart mobility and the related\
    \ opportunities and challenges.\nFurther, the paper highlights the enabling technologies\
    \ that are being used in order to\ndeliver smart services to citizens. Lastly,\
    \ the future trends and conclusions are presented.\n1.1. Need and Importance of\
    \ Smart Mobility\nSmart mobility enables inhabitants to navigate and move freely\
    \ within the smart\ncity surroundings. Improved trafﬁc management, the availability\
    \ of alternative routes (in\ncase of trafﬁc or emergencies), and dedicated routes\
    \ and navigation for essential services\n(such as ambulances, government vehicles,\
    \ ofﬁcial movements) can be facilitated by smart\nmobility. Such mobility services\
    \ are needed to provide congestion free, environment\nfriendly and sustainable\
    \ alternatives for the inhabitants and administrations alike. With\nsmart mobility\
    \ solutions we can have two-fold advantages both for citizens as well as\nadministrations,\

    \ description about the research progress made in the\nﬁeld of smart mobility.\
    \ We also try to identify the research gaps in the existing literature.\nIn order\
    \ to conduct the survey, we have adopted the standard systematic literature re-\n\
    view methodology [4]. Firstly, we performed a keyword based search using the online\n\
    research paper databases Science Direct (https://www.sciencedirect.com/ accessed\
    \ on\n15 January 2021) and IEEE Xplore (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp\
    \ (accessed\non 15 January 2021)). We primarily used the keyword “Urban Smart\

    \ specifically discusses the articles on the applications of smart mobility \n\
    for the citizens of the smart city. These papers include framework based, application\
    \ and \ndeployment based systems. \nIn [5], the authors have presented a smart\

    \ Recommendation (UPR)”. The UTravel application is \nbased on context awareness\

    \ into account their Information and Communication Technol-\nogy (ICT) content\
    \ and objectives. The authors have introduced a novel action taxonomy\ninvolving\
    \ a systematic approach to smart mobility and analyzed the role of ICT in improv-\n\
    ing the quality of life of people, increasing the public value and promoting smart\
    \ mobility\nactions. A survey has been conducted that identiﬁes three stages of\
    \ smart mobility actions,\nviz. “Starting”, “Intermediate” and “Mature”. Moreover,\
    \ the authors state that smart\ncitizens are crucial for implementing a viable,\
    \ successful and sustainable smart mobility\nframework. A framework for developing\
    \ and implementing smart mobility applications,\n“Smart Mobility for All (SMAll)”,\
    \ is given in [8], which leverages the concept of “microser-\nvices orchestration”\
    \ to improve the handling of multiple data sources and the creation of\nnovel\
    \ services. The proposed system is aimed at assisting elderly and/or disabled\
    \ persons\nto move in an urban setting. To do this, a network of taxis is deployed\
    \ to fulﬁl the need of\neach applicant and SMAll synchronizes the involved taxi\
    \ operators, sometimes combining\ncalls that are nearby in an effective manner.\
    \ The authors maintain that the deployment\nof SMAll results in improved quality\
    \ of service with lower administrative expense. To\nhandle the issues regarding\
    \ the security, privacy, scalability and management of “Smart\nMobility Data-market\
    \ (BSMD)”, a six-layer Blockchain architecture is proposed in [9].\nThe architecture\
    \ enables the exchange of encrypted data to the blockchain among users\ncomplying\
    \ with the rules of the transaction provided by the data owner. The authors have\n\
    assessed the performance of BSMD over a 370-node blockchain and established that\
    \ BSMD\nsafeguards the users’ privacy and security by offering data access management\
    \ control and\npreventing message interception and spooﬁng. Within the bounds\
    \ of mobility, the authors\nhave classiﬁed three important elements in a general\
    \ blockchain, viz. “shared ledger”,\n“peer-to-peer network” and “consensus mechanisms”.\
    \ Smart contracts are added into\nBSMD nodes to control access to the shared mobility\
    \ information. In [10], the authors have\npresented a framework to aid in the\
    \ efﬁcient designing of a trafﬁc light network in an urban\nsetting to minimize\
    \ trafﬁc jams. The framework “HITUL” assists in the decision making of\ntrafﬁc\
    \ control management by determining the ideal trafﬁc light schemes by employing\n\
    micro-simulations and bio-inspired methods. The authors have evaluated HITUL through\n\
    a case study of the Spanish city of Malaga and observed that it is an effective\
    \ technique\ntowards minimizing trafﬁc jams. Moreover, the authors have used “Simulator\
    \ of Urban\nMobility (SUMO)” to obtain arrangements of practical scenarios based\
    \ on actual mobility\ntrends in a city. In [11], the authors attempt to demonstrate\
    \ the spectrum of development of\n“Spanish Smart City” measures with a view to\
    \ mobility and environmental concerns. The\nauthors have conducted a study in\
    \ 62 cities of “Spanish Smart Cities Network (RECI)” and\nprovided a synergistic\
    \ map displaying a comprehensive evaluation and advancement of\nthe cities on\
    \ the basis of demographic and socioeconomic variables. The ﬁndings indicate\n\
    that smart mobility is a vital element of smart cities and smart environment has\
    \ poor\noutcomes in Spanish cities. A novel approach to predict the occupancy\
    \ rate of car parking\nspace has been given [12], which is premised on deep learning\
    \ with Recurrent Neural\nNetworks (RNNs). The authors have presented two metaheuristic\
    \ techniques to optimize\nthe performance of the RNN design, one based on Genetic\
    \ Algorithms (GA) and the other\nbased on Evolution Strategy (ES). The authors\
    \ have examined the occupancy rates of 29 car\nparks in Birmingham, UK and observed\
    \ that the proposed approach is more useful and\nexceeds the performance of available\
    \ competition.\n2.2. Taxonomy, Surveys and Review Based Papers\nA taxonomy for\
    \ the formulation of smart city services is presented in [13]. For\nthis purpose,\
    \ the authors have analyzed the latest relevant works covering 42 services\nprovided\
    \ by 9 smart cities globally. The proposed taxonomy is eight-dimensional and\n\
    offers a standard vocabulary to facilitate communication regarding the services.\
    \ The\ntaxonomy is aimed at aiding policymakers and researchers in the further\
    \ improvement\nof the area. The authors have incorporated general deﬁnitions,\
    \ concepts and illustrations\nfor each dimension and speciﬁed service. In [14],\
    \ the author has presented a novel action\nSensors 2021, 21, 2143\n7 of 41\ntaxonomy\
    \ concerning an extensive methodology related to smart mobility. A thorough\n\
    survey has been performed covering 114 works regarding the inﬂuence of smart actions\n\
    on the quality of life of citizens, the expectations of stakeholders, regularly\
    \ applied smart\nmobility measures and the role of ICT in smart mobility. The\
    \ survey has resulted in the\nidentiﬁcation of three smart mobility action phases\
    \ and six smart mobility goals. Moreover,\nthe paper notes that though ICT is\
    \ not essential for the implementation of smart city actions,\nit is important\
    \ when smart mobility actions become increasingly complex, integrated and\nextended.\
    \ The authors have proposed a distributed adaptation method for ensemble-\nbased\
    \ systems in a smart mobility context in [15]. They have presented the “Collective\n\
    Adaptation Engine (CAE)” that can address multiple issues collectively in a feasible\
    \ and\nscalable manner. To assess the proposed model, the “DeMOCAS” framework\
    \ has been\nused to simulate the context of urban mobility. The ﬁndings indicate\
    \ that CAE solves urban\nmobility challenges and promotes sustainable mobility.\
    \ In [16], the authors have proposed\nthe application of system dynamics to simulate\
    \ substitutes for conventional human mobility.\nAn analysis of six scenarios is\
    \ presented for attaining optimized decision-making within\norganizations, deﬁning\
    \ the proﬁles of travelers and achieving sustainable smart mobility\nwith the\
    \ eventual goal of enhancing the citizens’ quality of life. The analysis is aimed\
    \ at\nunderstanding the principal dynamic interactions between all the variables\
    \ of the system\nand managing their complexity. A detailed and realistic structure\
    \ has been introduced\nin [17] to design a comparative analysis, which gauges\
    \ cities based on the smartness of their\ntransport frameworks. The authors have\
    \ gathered data from 26 cities globally, identiﬁed\n66 indicators of smartness\
    \ and observed that cities such as Seattle, London and Sydney\nhave the most advanced\
    \ smart transportation, with London having the best emergency\ntransport facilities,\
    \ Singapore and London having the best public transport facilities, and\nParis\
    \ and Seattle having the best private transport facilities. In [18], the authors\
    \ have\nanalyzed the likely transition of present issues of mobility governance\
    \ with the aim to\nsafeguard and increase the public value. Four case studies\
    \ have been conducted to study\ndistinct mobility governance issues and an analytical\
    \ structure has been presented to\nevaluate the smart mobility governance novelties.\
    \ Furthermore, the authors assert that the\ntransition in mobility governance\
    \ should be backed with technological transition. In [19],\nthe authors have focused\
    \ on enhancing a vital element of smart mobility, viz. positioning in\na smart\
    \ university setting acting as a representative for a smart city. An indoor positioning\n\
    system integrated with an outdoor positioning system has been proposed and implemented\n\
    to facilitate persistent indoor and outdoor navigation. The authors have implemented\n\
    the proposed framework on the smart university platform, “SmartUJI”, at Universitat\n\
    Jaume I, Spain. Moreover, two mobile applications have been created and implemented\n\
    by the authors—“SmartUJI APP” (to provide map-based information regarding various\n\
    campus services) and “SmartUJI AR” (to provide communication with the campus via\n\
    an augmented reality interface). The evaluation of the two applications indicates\
    \ their\nuseful assistance to visitors, faculty and students in enhancing spatial\
    \ position and ﬁnding\nuniversity facilities. The authors have speciﬁed a range\
    \ of mobility indicators to assess\nsmart urban mobility in [20]. They have presented\
    \ a relevant quantitative methodology that\nis applicable to any city globally\
    \ with the aim to benchmark smart cities. The authors have\nselected Italian cities\
    \ for the evaluation of sustainable transportation to gather crucial data,\nand\
    \ they observed that the city of Turin is the best with regard to smart transport.\
    \ Moreover,\nit is noted that the northern cities of Italy have overall better\
    \ ranking than the southern\ncities. The author has focused on the transformation\
    \ from an automobile community to\na multimodal community in [21], fostered by\
    \ the advent of smart mobility powered by\nICT. The paper highlights three outcomes\
    \ obtained from quantitative analysis of data from\nthe German region of Rhine-Main.\
    \ These include transport poverty, multimodal divide\nand critical thinking as\
    \ factors contributing to mistrust towards multimodal mobility, and\nthe paper\
    \ recommends a change in this perspective to enhance the debate surrounding\n\
    multimodality. Eleven metropolitan cities in Italy have been studied by the authors\
    \ in [22]\nto assess the possibility and degree of applying the smart city model\
    \ with the aim to\nSensors 2021, 21, 2143\n8 of 41\nboost the effectiveness and\
    \ living conditions of urban areas. The authors have identiﬁed\nkey smart city\
    \ measures and parameters and grouped them to underline the impact of\nthe smart\
    \ city model on the mobility systems and observed that a poor starting place\n\
    limits its implementation. The paper classiﬁes the smart mobility paradigm into\
    \ three\ngroups, “accessibility”, “sustainability” and “ICT”, and applies 28 parameters\
    \ to locate\ncontexts with the best accessibility and sustainability. Furthermore,\
    \ it is indicated that\nICT is ineffective when the transport framework is inadequate.\
    \ A distributed system\nfor mobility data management and semantic improvement\
    \ has been proposed in [23],\nwhich would beneﬁt the areas of trafﬁc management,\
    \ m-health, urban kinetics examination\nand emergency management, among others.\
    \ The proposed system, “SemanticMOVE”,\nenables the semantic management of mobile\
    \ things, and offers understanding of the\nmobility semantics as well as the identiﬁcation\
    \ of potential user movements, behaviors\nand activities. In [24], the authors\
    \ have focused on the importance of a multi-disciplinary\nand collective methodology\
    \ to smart mobility, which would enable the shift to a “smarter\nmobility” to\
    \ improve city development and citizens’ quality of life. A study has been\nconducted\
    \ in Belgium to analyze the advancement of smart mobility from techno-centered\n\
    to user-centered. The authors argue that although solutions to smart mobility\
    \ challenges are\nsought in novel technologies, these solutions are not absolute\
    \ and smart mobility outgrows\ntechnology and users. In [25], the author has highlighted\
    \ the relationship between smart\nmobility and social sustainability and clariﬁed\
    \ the deﬁnitions of the two concepts. The\npaper indicates that the social sustainability\
    \ of smart mobility depends on the path taken by\nthe latter. Two distinct scenarios\
    \ have been given, the ﬁrst of which involves increased ease\nof use promoting\
    \ the prevalence of cars, resulting in social discord, inequity, the scarcity\n\
    of car driving and parking spaces, etc. The second scenario involves the application\
    \ of\ntechnologies to enable services such as ride sharing and on demand rides,\
    \ resulting in\nnegative consequences on transportation workers but a positive\
    \ impact on social harmony,\nequity and availability. A theoretical assessment\
    \ of experimental governance is presented\nin [26] through the analysis of fundamental\
    \ literal and practical assumptions with respect\nto smart mobility. The authors\
    \ have selected an experimental study of smart mobility in\nSweden to examine\
    \ experimental governance as a policy tool to facilitate the objectives of\npublic\
    \ stakeholders and assert that these stakeholders have a special role in experimental\n\
    governance. In [27], the authors have presented a quantitative approach for assessing\
    \ the\nurban mobility in the Italian area of Cagliari and recommended the roadmap\
    \ to achieve the\nﬁnest mobility globally. The advantages of smart mobility have\
    \ been analyzed in Cagliari\nand similar urban areas by choosing indicators based\
    \ on the relevant data of the selected\ncontexts. The data for the indicators\
    \ have been collected from the year 2014 and classiﬁed\ninto groups, and it is\
    \ observed that mobility data sharing is not adequate so far. In [28], the\nauthor\
    \ has explored the framework of citizen engagement and efﬁciency of Japanese Smart\n\
    Communities to contemplate the collaborative design and development of a smart\
    \ mobility\nframework. The paper indicates the anticipation of little feedback\
    \ from the citizens and the\ndeployment of ICT to direct the participants and\
    \ modify their behavior. It is observed that\nthe current smart city initiatives\
    \ are in a nascent phase to comprehend that the objectives of\nthe administration,\
    \ focused on energy saving or developing alternate energy sources, have\nlimited\
    \ ICT deployment and the ICT related projects are poorly coordinated. A holistic\n\
    methodology to model the efﬁciency of public transport facilities is given in\
    \ [29], schemed\nas a whole in a multi-stakeholder context from an end-to-end\
    \ perspective. The authors\nseek to underline the key aspects of the quality of\
    \ service from distinct viewpoints and\nhave provided a holistic methodology to\
    \ modelling that supports the quality of service\ndesign, implementation and monitoring\
    \ in smart transport. Moreover, the paper presents\n“UCoMS” for the analysis of\
    \ the quality of service, and the proposed methodology has been\nvalidated in\
    \ the Italian region of Apulia. In [30], the author seeks to analyze the meaning\n\
    of “smart” in the context of smart urban mobility and the relationship between\
    \ smartness\nand sustainability. The author has uncovered discord and insufﬁciency\
    \ in the literature\npertaining to smart urban mobility and has presented and\
    \ analyzed the deﬁnition of smart\nSensors 2021, 21, 2143\n9 of 41\nurban mobility.\
    \ The paper attempts to bridge the gap between the concepts of smart and\nsustainable\
    \ for the growth of urban mobility. A comprehensive analysis of the role played\n\
    by “Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS)” in assisting urban smart mobility is\
    \ given in [31].\nA total of 71 papers have been analyzed, ranging from 2006 to\
    \ 2014, with 34% case studies\nand 21% simulations. The case study-based works\
    \ analyze the deployment of ITS in urban\ncities, while the simulation-based works\
    \ analyze the inﬂuence of ITS on urban mobility\nand measure cost, time and environmental\
    \ impacts. The paper aims to detect the gaps in\nthe literature and observes a\
    \ generic insufﬁciency of quantitative frameworks. The authors\nrecommend a roadmap\
    \ for future research based on the identiﬁed inadequacies.\nIn [32], the author\
    \ highlights the factors that link citizens to different facilities, espe-\ncially\
    \ mobility and ICT frameworks in the Senegalese city of Dakar. It is observed\
    \ that\nmotorized methods amount to 40% while non-motorized methods amount to\
    \ 60% of the\noverall mobility, and the public mobility sector is largely informal.\
    \ The author has noted\nthe measures taken by the administration to build a positive\
    \ setting for ICT development\nand deployment, including E-Infrastructure, E-Education\
    \ and E-Governance.\n2.3. Regional, Governance and Citizen Centric Papers\nA case\
    \ study in the Portuguese city of Lisbon has been presented in [33], which\nestablishes\
    \ a performance assessment of passenger and commercial vehicle redirection.\n\
    The results indicate that redirecting vehicles not only reduces travel duration,\
    \ but increases\nthe road effectiveness in the urban grids and the trafﬁc output\
    \ in the analysis of routes.\nMoreover, it is observed that the effectiveness\
    \ is higher at the route level (variation of\n16–32% in travel and 4–13% in delay\
    \ time) than at the network level (average variation\nof 2% in travel and 6% in\
    \ delay time for 10% driver conformity rate). The concept of\n“Vehicular Social\
    \ Networks (VSNs)” has been given in [34], focusing on the importance of\nhighly\
    \ efﬁcient and secure smart city transmission in VSNs. The paper proposes a use\
    \ case\non trajectory data-analysis-based trafﬁc anomaly detection for VSNs and\
    \ highlights VSN-\nrelated research challenges and potential solutions to facilitate\
    \ the realization and extensive\napplication of VSNs. In [35], the authors aim\
    \ to establish an indicator for assessing the\ndegree of smart mobility solutions\
    \ deployed in urban areas. The paper indicates that the\ninsufﬁciency of comprehensive\
    \ knowledge related to the evaluation of certain ratings of the\nexisting literature\
    \ and the inordinately general analysis of smart mobility challenges have\nprompted\
    \ the need for the indicator. The proposed indicator is intended for facilitating\n\
    the analysis of mobility scenarios in accordance with the notion of smart cities,\
    \ enabling\ncomparisons in varied urban areas for the identiﬁcation of best practices\
    \ to promote the\nadvancement of smart mobility. An analysis of “Mobility as a\
    \ Service (MaaS)” has been\npresented in [36] to evaluate its potential impact\
    \ for city policymakers with regards to\ngovernance and sustainability. The paper\
    \ stresses that MaaS is not a ﬁxed commodity\nbut a conceptual way of providing\
    \ services to customers. Moreover, the potential risk to\nmobility and social\
    \ sustainability due to over dependence on single operators of novel\nservices\
    \ and the potential impact of novel services on current services are given. In\
    \ [37],\nthe authors have focused on evaluating the smartness of transport systems\
    \ in the cities of\nGhana and illustrating the realization of the notion. It is\
    \ observed that Ghanaian cities are\npredominantly reliant on roads for the mobility\
    \ of people and cargo, and the swift increase\nin the number of vehicles accompanied\
    \ by insufﬁcient expansion of road networks has\nweakened the efﬁciency of urban\
    \ areas. The paper implies that the lack of smart mobility\nin these cities endangers\
    \ their sustainability and, as a result, necessitates investment in\nmobility\
    \ systems together with increased reception and technological awareness among\n\
    the citizens. A general framework for the implementation of fog computing features\
    \ in\na “Vehicular ad-hoc Networks (VANET)” context is introduced in [38]. The\
    \ proposed\narchitecture has been applied in two Fog applications, one for the\
    \ identiﬁcation of trafﬁc\naberrations, and the second for predicting bus arrival\
    \ time to supply passenger information.\nThe evaluation results indicate that\
    \ the outcomes of these two applications are akin to\nthose offered by Cloud,\
    \ the information offered is faster, reliable and real-time, and the\nSensors\
    \ 2021, 21, 2143\n10 of 41\noverall trafﬁc is reduced. In [39], the authors have\
    \ discussed the “autonomic transport\nmanagement system”, which is an ICT based\
    \ system for the management of transport. The\npresented approach enables the\
    \ formation of a “P2P-Overlay Network’ on the existing\nnetworks and applies IPv6\
    \ along with multicast and transparent routing for the effortless\nexpansion of\
    \ the network to the masses. The methodology enables users to join the network\n\
    using their personal devices as well as the integration of infrastructures such\
    \ as trafﬁc\nmanagement, trafﬁc lights, trains, etc., into the overlay network\
    \ with ease.\nAn analysis of existing IoT methods and notions concerning smart\
    \ cities and smart\nmobility is presented in [40]. Moreover, an analysis of different\
    \ properties and uses\nrelated to smart mobility and real-time trafﬁc management\
    \ systems has been given. The\npaper identiﬁes and addresses the major challenges\
    \ related to smart cities and smart\nmobility, such as unequal geographic advancement,\
    \ privacy concerns and the lack of\ncollaboration. Furthermore, signiﬁcant gaps\
    \ have been identiﬁed in the domain of smart\nmobility regarding “Vehicular Ad\
    \ hoc Networks (VANETs)” and “Smart Trafﬁc Lights”.\nIn [41], the authors have\
    \ illustrated the implementation of “Service-Dominant Business\nModel Radar (SDBM/R)”\
    \ in the context of smart mobility. The proposed framework is\naimed at designing\
    \ mobility related business models for the mobility of travelers and\ncargo in\
    \ a collaborative fashion. In a multi-stakeholder business context, the authors\
    \ have\ndesigned the system as a central element in the development of complex\
    \ digital novelties\nthat provide value to users. A survey has been conducted\
    \ to validate the model and\nthe input from the participants indicates the relevance\
    \ of the proposed model and its\npotential for practical use. In [42], the authors\
    \ have explored the correlation between urban\nintelligence and sustainable mobility\
    \ forms for the municipalities in Australia, to explore\nwhether the intelligence\
    \ of cities contributes to sustainable mobility forms. The impact of\ngrowing\
    \ broadband internet availability on sustainable mobility mode is analyzed using\
    \ a\nmultivariate multiple regression model, and it is observed that growing broadband\
    \ internet\navailability decreases the use of active, public mobility means, while\
    \ increasing the use\nof private commuting means. An analysis of the association\
    \ between the deployment of\nthe smart city notion and the sustainable mobility\
    \ notion is presented in [43]. The authors\nhave also analyzed the effect of carbon\
    \ dioxide release from smart city components as a\ndetermining factor of mobility.\
    \ The United Nations’ “ForFITS (For Future Inland Transport\nSystems)” model has\
    \ been used to predict the possible carbon dioxide release resulting\nfrom the\
    \ implementation of the Warsaw transport system. The ﬁndings indicate that a\n\
    thorough change in the mobility and energy domains is necessary to achieve the\
    \ reduction\ngoals identiﬁed by the “European Union 2011 White Paper on Transport”.\
    \ In [44], the\nauthor has focused on the notion of shared mobility and has presented\
    \ an analysis of the\npresent literature. The paper observes that most of the\
    \ literature is aimed at evaluating the\neffect of shared mobility on factors\
    \ such as modal transition, congestion, transit clientele,\nvehicle possession\
    \ and environmental aspects, while little consideration is given to female\nsafety,\
    \ accessibility and comfort during travelling, revealing a growing gender parity\
    \ in\nurban mobility.\n2.4. Summary and Research Gap Analysis\nThis section summarizes\

    \ urban\nplanning, recommendation systems, etc. In [7], it was concluded that\
    \ responsible behavior\nand the attitude of the inhabitants have a positive effect\
    \ on smart mobility initiatives. The\nsecurity aspects of smart mobility were\
    \ discussed in [8,9]. Some of the key points which\nwere found missing in the\

    \ a holistic review which covers the above aspects\nin addition to those previously\
    \ discussed. User privacy concerns and a lack of technical\nand operational knowhow\
    \ restrict common people, especially elderly people, women\nand laborer workers,\
    \ from using smart mobility services [45]. Several privacy preserving\napproaches\
    \ have been developed in recent years for the effective adoption and ease of use\n\
    of mobility services [46,47]. The governance issues in smart mobility services,\
    \ including\nSensors 2021, 21, 2143\n13 of 41\nconsent-based data capturing, manipulations\
    \ and usage, data integration and standard-\nization challenges, were covered\
    \ in [48–51]. The importance of sensor characteristics for\nsensing and capturing\
    \ the data about the subject and its surroundings plays a vital role\nin developing\
    \ effective and intelligent mobility initiatives [52–55]. The impact of external\n\
    environments on the performance of the sensors is an essential ﬁeld of study,\
    \ as discussed\nin [56,57]. The materials used in the development of sensors also\
    \ play an important role in\ndeciding their usage and life [57].\nApart from these,\
    \ a few open issues which are still prevalent in smart mobility include:\n•\n\
    Enforcing uniform and ubiquitous mobility laws, rules and regulations\n•\nCitizen\
    \ participation in mobility initiatives\n•\nCrowdsensing in smart mobility\n•\n\
    Interoperability\n•\nLegacy Infrastructure setups\n•\nAmicable Cooperation between\
    \ public-private mobility services players.\nWith the rapid technological transformations,\
    \ these open issues will surely be ad-\ndressed in years to come. As the smart\
    \ city initiative is slowly becoming a reality, extensive\nresearch is being conducted\
    \ to handle such open issues [58,59].\n3. Smart Mobility in Smart Cities\n3.1.\
    \ Overview\nUrban mobility is one of the major components of a smart city that\
    \ acts as a critical\nfactor behind smart and sustainable development. Today,\
    \ nations across the globe are\nheavily investing in transport infrastructure\
    \ as an approach to ensure smart and affordable\nmeans of transportation to citizens.\
    \ Smart mobility is one of the key deﬁning features of\nthe smart city [60]. In\
    \ most developing nations, where rapid urbanization is increasing\nthe demands\
    \ of smart and cleaner modes of transport, the need for smart mobility is ever\n\
    increasing. The key mobility challenge in such countries demands the mass adoption\
    \ of\npublic transport systems. The key attributes of the smart mobility concept,\
    \ as shown in\nTable 2, allow the users and other stakeholders clean, safe and\
    \ efﬁcient travel.\nTable 2. Smart mobility attributes.\nAttributes\nSigniﬁcance\n\

    \ time.\nIntegration\nEnsures end-to-end route plans independent of the\ntransportation\

    \ and sustainable so-\nlution [61]. It includes multiple modes of transportation\
    \ including on demand mobility\nsolutions, electric vehicles, bikes, rapid mass\

    \ citizens who help in following and enforcing these laws. This\nstep can promote\
    \ citizen centric participative governance.\nOpportunities for Builders, Businesses\
    \ and Manufacturers: Builders, businesses and\nmanufacturers can come up with\
    \ innovative solutions for providing sustainable and envi-\nronment friendly alternatives\
    \ for the classical approaches. The area/techniques focused\nstartups can exploit\
    \ this opportunity for growing their businesses.\nCheaper and Multiple Options\
    \ for Transportation: With smart mobility solutions in place,\ncitizens have the\
    \ option for a better quality of service (QoS) in terms of comparative costs,\n\
    improved and multiple options for transportation and hassle-free commuting experience.\n\
    Improved Serviceability: Data analytics approaches can be applied to provide citizen\n\
    centric services to the inhabitants of the smart city. Since the decisions and\
    \ policies are data\ndriven, they can surely improve the QoS.\n3.3. Challenges\n\
    Some of the main challenges that are presented to smart mobility nowadays include:\n\
    Infrastructure: Implementing smart mobility solutions in a smart city system has\n\
    high infrastructural demands to overcome the pressure on the suboptimal transportation\n\
    systems in most parts of the world. The increasing popularity of self-driving\
    \ and electric\nvehicles requires network connectivity, high bandwidth and electric\
    \ charging stations. To\nfully utilize the potential of smart mobility, there\
    \ is a need to develop the infrastructure\nthat can realize the concepts surrounding\
    \ smart systems.\nLast Mile Connectivity: One of the major issues in public transportation\
    \ systems is\nthe low-cost last mile connectivity. For efﬁcient smart mobility\
    \ solutions, there is a need for\ndoor-to-door connectivity irrespective of the\
    \ mode of transportation.\nSecurity and Privacy: The need for connected devices\
    \ and the rapid generation of rich\npersonal data pose serious privacy concerns\
    \ related to data sharing amongst devices and\nusers. Moreover, due to the connected\
    \ devices, the entire network is vulnerable to outside\nattack and breaches.\n\
    Governance: The concept of smart mobility has extended the scope of conventional\n\
    transportation systems to include other stakeholders such as tech companies and\
    \ service\nproviders. The inclusion of these new actors requires modiﬁed policies\
    \ and rules governing\nthe smart mobility. The regulations governing smart mobility\
    \ systems are still lagging\nbehind. With no standards governing the use of smart\
    \ mobility solutions, the mass adoption\nof these smart solutions is still far\
    \ from reality. There is a need to seamlessly integrate the\nexisting trafﬁc laws\
    \ to meet the demands of smart mobility solutions.\nInitial Adoption: One of the\
    \ major issues with smart transportation is creating aware-\nness amongst the\
    \ potential users for its adoption. The majority of solutions are in the early\n\
    stages of development, which does not provide signiﬁcant proof of the exact goals\
    \ of the\nmobility solutions.\nDynamic Routing and Transportation Mobility: The\
    \ efﬁcient solutions require dy-\nnamic routing systems to estimate the travel\
    \ demands of the users and optimize the\navailable resources to provide the solutions.\
    \ This process requires sophisticated software\nand technological solutions.\n\
    Network Management and Monitoring: The smart ecosystems comprise millions\nof\
    \ connected entities, which makes the network management and monitoring complex\n\
    and costly.\nSensors 2021, 21, 2143\n17 of 41\nData Acquisition and Integration:\
    \ The data are collected from heterogeneous sources\nwith different security and\
    \ privacy protocols. Handling the large volumes of real time data\ngenerated from\
    \ the connected devices is a complex task.\nLegal Challenges: The involvement\
    \ of multiple stakeholders such as payment compa-\nnies, governments, city administrations,\
    \ public-private transportation, users, etc., requires\na well-deﬁned legal system\
    \ and support policies for smart mobility.\n4. Smart Mobility Services and Applications\n\
    4.1. Mobility-as-a-Service\nThe emergence of the Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS)\
    \ paradigm is a trend that is expected\nin the coming years in the area of mobility\
    \ in smart cities. The current reality of door-to-\ndoor journeys seems to have\
    \ its days numbered as it does not comply with the sustainable\ndevelopment objectives\
    \ and lags behind the MaaS platforms in terms of costs and travel\ntime [63].\
    \ The objective of MaaS platforms is to provide an alternative to the use of\n\
    private transportation with several underlying consequences, including a reduction\
    \ in\ntrafﬁc congestion and volume restrictions on urban transport capacity. In\
    \ the coming\nyears, we will witness the emergence of a global platform that integrates\
    \ various modes\nof transport, with an on-demand service and where information\
    \ is available in real time\nand in a predictive manner in such a way that allows\
    \ the provision of services such as\nmultimodal routes. Several services have\
    \ appeared in recent years that promote the vision\nof the MaaS paradigm: carpooling\
    \ (sharing the car for a given trip in order to prevent\nseveral people from traveling\
    \ to the same place), ridesharing companies (companies that\nmatch passengers\
    \ and vehicle drivers), bicycle and e-scooters sharing systems (systems\nthat\
    \ allow the rental of bicycles or electric scooters for a short period of time)\
    \ or carsharing\n(car rental model for short periods of time). The recent advances\
    \ in autonomous cars are\na promise for the short-medium future to help materialize\
    \ the MaaS paradigm. This will\nput in perspective the need for people to own\
    \ a car, both in economic terms as well as\nin beneﬁts compared to using on-demand\
    \ services that are expected to have much more\naffordable costs when the use\
    \ of autonomous vehicles becomes widespread.\nOne of the challenges that the coming\
    \ years will bring includes the creation of a\nglobal MaaS platform integrating\
    \ several geographically dispersed MaaS platforms and\nheterogeneous in their\
    \ genesis, which could also lead to the creation of uniﬁed standards.\nTwo main\
    \ characteristics can be pointed out to a MaaS system [63,64]: (1) to be multimodal,\n\
    a MaaS platform must necessarily include different types and modes of transport,\
    \ and\n(2) to be user-centric, the result of a MaaS platform must be adapted to\
    \ the needs and\npreferences of each user, preferably collected in an implicit\
    \ and transparent way according\nto what is the history and patterns of their\
    \ mobility.\nSome of the challenges that a MaaS will help solve in a smart city\
    \ include [63,64]:\n•\nHigh number of private cars within a city\n•\nLittle attractiveness\
    \ for citizens when it comes to using public transport\n•\nLittle use of active\
    \ modes of transport\n•\nLess adequate location of speciﬁc places for bicycles,\
    \ scooters and parking links and\nits lack of integration with the transport network\n\
    •\nLack of accessibility to transport systems by people with disabilities or old\
    \ people\n•\nLack of information in real time for citizens\n•\nLack of an integrated\
    \ public transport platform, routes suitable for each user, on-\ndemand parking,\
    \ active mobility and uniﬁed payment systems for the entire trans-\nport network\n\
    •\nLack of understanding of citizens’ mobility patterns\n•\nLack of information\
    \ for citizens about the consequences of their fewer active habits in\nthe carbon\
    \ scab\nThe beneﬁts we can expect from a MaaS include [63,64]:\n•\nAn easier way\
    \ for citizens to plan, book and pay for mobility services (which will also\n\
    facilitate citizens abandoning the private vehicle)\nSensors 2021, 21, 2143\n\
    18 of 41\n•\nImproving the efﬁciency of the transit network\n•\nReduced costs\
    \ for citizens\n•\nDecreased trafﬁc congestion\n•\nReducing the ecological footprint\n\
    •\nPredicting demands\n•\nMaking personalized suggestions to citizens\n•\nAllowing\
    \ providers to plan ahead and meet citizens’ needs\n•\nIncreasing convenience,\
    \ effectiveness and customer satisfaction\n•\nEase of payment\n•\nRevenue growth\
    \ for transportation service providers.\n4.1.1. MaaS Implementation Challenges\n\
    The emergence of the smart city concept has brought a paradigm shift in urban\n\
    mobility systems. Today, with technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), Wireless\n\
    Sensor Networks, Data Analytics, Big Data, etc., the transportation sector is\
    \ seeing a new\nscope for signiﬁcant changes and transformations. Today, the transport\
    \ sector has become a\ncomplex system with services integrated into one platform\
    \ governed by technology. MaaS\ndescribes a transport system that integrates various\
    \ transport mediums along with other\nrelated services to provide a seamless on\
    \ demand experience to users [65]. An efﬁcient\nMaaS system provides signiﬁcant\
    \ potential to facilitate business and opportunities.\nToday, most cities face\
    \ challenges in terms of their transportation systems and other\nrelated services\
    \ such as parking, trafﬁc congestion, etc. MaaS platforms have huge potential\n\
    to provide solutions to overcome the existing challenges of transportation systems\
    \ and\nalso have a positive impact on the environment by promoting and supporting\
    \ renewable\nenergy resources [66]. However, despite this utopian concept of on\
    \ demand seamless\nmobility, there are still many challenges and issues pertaining\
    \ to the successful integration\nof MaaS in the existing smart city ecosystems.\
    \ Table 3 presents some of the major issues\nand challenges and the potential\
    \ solutions in the implementation of MaaS platforms in a\nsmart city ecosystem.\n\
    Table 3. Mobility as a Service (MaaS) implementation challenges and potential\
    \ solutions.\nS. No.\nChallenges\nSolution\n1\nMultiple Services\nintegration\n\
    Initiating goal directed discussions amongst the various service providers to\
    \ ensure\ncross border integrations.\n2\nPayment System\nTechnological interventions\
    \ based on emerging technologies such as blockchain, can\nbe used to ensure the\
    \ security and transparency of the ﬁnancial systems.\n3\nSubscription Models in\n\
    MaaS\nGovernment and other regulating bodies must promote collaborations through\n\
    various pilot programs. Customized subscription models need to be developed to\n\
    enhance the user experience.\n4\nData and information\nsharing amongst service\n\
    providers\nData sharing models can be developed regulating the general principles\
    \ of data and\ninformation sharing and ensuring agreements on the levels of data\
    \ sharing between\nservice providers.\n5\nLegal Challenges\nThere should be globally\
    \ recognized standards and laws governing the various\nservices provided under\
    \ the MaaS Platform.\n6\nAdoption Challenges\nThe MaaS platform developers must\
    \ take measures to build trust amongst the users\nand create awareness about the\
    \ ﬁnancial, societal and environmental beneﬁts of MaaS.\n7\nScalability\nInternational\
    \ governmental bodies must collaborate for the development of laws and\nstandards\
    \ governing the mobility services and to facilitate joint ventures across cities\n\
    and nations.\n8\nTrust and Collaboration\namongst stakeholders\nThe governing\
    \ bodies should ensure transparency in the processes by drafting\nwell-deﬁned\
    \ liabilities and mutual contractual agreements documenting the\nagreed-upon actions\
    \ and objectives.\nSensors 2021, 21, 2143\n19 of 41\nMultiple Services Integration:\
    \ MaaS focuses on aggregating various services such\nas public transport, private\
    \ transport, ride sharing, car pool services, payments, parking\nsystems, etc.,\
    \ on a single platform to ensure on demand seamless mobility to the users.\nHowever,\
    \ the heterogeneous nature of these services along with their different safety\
    \ and\nprivacy requirements makes the entire integration process difﬁcult and\
    \ challenging.\nPayment System Integration: the complete and efﬁcient implementation\
    \ of MaaS\nplatforms ensuring a seamless mobility experience requires a hassle\
    \ free payment system\nthat allows users to manage the various mobility services\
    \ through a single platform.\nIntegrating a single payment system involves multiple\
    \ stakeholders at different levels\nof hierarchies, such as banking systems, transport\
    \ companies, parking systems, vehicle\nowners, etc. This requires signiﬁcant technological\
    \ development in overcoming the security,\nsafety and privacy requirements of\
    \ multiple stakeholders and heterogeneous entities\nand services.\nMaaS Subscription\
    \ Models: currently, the existing transportation systems and compa-\nnies provide\
    \ their users with subscription models based on weekly, monthly and yearly\nservices.\
    \ These packages allow users to avail various services at lower costs as per the\n\
    terms and conditions of the particular company. Implementing a similar service\
    \ with\nthe MaaS platform requires cooperation and coordination amongst various\
    \ companies,\ntransportation service providers, governments, private players and\
    \ other related services.\nEnsuring a single subscription model for a MaaS platform\
    \ is still a challenge.\nData and Information Sharing Amounts Service Providers:\
    \ the implementation of\nan efﬁcient MaaS platform requires real time data sharing\
    \ amongst the various service\nproviders to ensure a real time seamless mobility\
    \ service to the users. This poses serious\nsecurity and privacy concerns as many\
    \ stakeholders do not wish to share their personal\ninformation, payment histories,\
    \ transportation preferences and habits with others. Ad-\nditionally, since MaaS\
    \ integrates multiple services at different hierarchical levels, the\nprivacy\
    \ concerns and security techniques vary signiﬁcantly. As per the General Data\n\
    Protection Regulation (GDPR), businesses must protect the personal information\
    \ of users\n(https://gdpr-info.eu (accessed on 3 February 2021)), and therefore\
    \ MaaS platforms must\nalso comply with the digital privacy of their users.\n\
    Legal Challenges: MaaS platforms facilitate the integration of multiple services\
    \ on a\nsingle platform and also provide opportunities for new business models.\
    \ The involvement\nof multiple services such as transport, trafﬁc systems, parking,\
    \ payments, ticketing, identity\nmanagement, data sharing, etc., requires standardized\
    \ laws and regulations governing\nthe entire process. Currently, there are no\
    \ legal services and laws that regulate the entire\nMaaS platform.\nAdoption Challenges:\
    \ one of the biggest challenges for the successful implementation\nof a MaaS platform\
    \ is the willingness of the various stakeholders such as users, the govern-\n\
    ment, service providers, etc., to adopt the service model. Although smart transportation\n\
    systems are slowly and steadily making their way into the daily lives of the people,\
    \ the\nmass adoption of platforms such as MaaS is still far from reality.\nScalability:\
    \ the scalability of the MaaS platforms from a locality to a city, from a city\
    \ to\na country and eventually to the entire world requires rules that can encompass\
    \ the laws\npertaining to various nations. Developing a service model that can\
    \ adapt to multiple cities\nand countries and can be reused in multiple jurisdictions\
    \ is still a challenge.\nTrust and Collaboration amongst Stakeholders: the need\
    \ for trust is one of the most\nimportant aspects of a successful collaboration.\
    \ Multiple entities in a MaaS platform require\na clear understanding of the ﬁnancial,\
    \ societal and environmental gains of the collaboration.\nThere are apprehensions\
    \ related to the neutrality and fairness of the system from different\nviewpoints.\
    \ From the user’s viewpoint there may be questions related to the quality of\n\
    the service and value for money, and the service providers may have fears related\
    \ to the\nmanner in which the algorithms work and the services are presented to\
    \ the users [67].\nSensors 2021, 21, 2143\n20 of 41\n4.1.2. Analysis of Security\
    \ Threats\nAutonomous vehicles use technologies such as Internet of Things, Wireless\
    \ Sensor\nNetworks, Artiﬁcial Intelligence, and Machine Learning, among others,\
    \ to collect, analyze\nand share data and eventually make informed decisions.\
    \ These autonomous vehicles form\na part of a larger network comprising thousands\
    \ of interconnected entities. These types\nof connected environments consisting\
    \ of heterogeneous devices are highly dependent on\nthe individual device’s security\
    \ protocols. This makes autonomous vehicles vulnerable to\nseveral types of security\
    \ threats and attacks. These attacks can take place at various levels\nsuch as\
    \ the network level, device level and software level [68]. Table 4 shows the various\n\
    types of vulnerabilities in autonomous vehicles at different levels.\nTable 4.\
    \ Vulnerabilities in Autonomous Vehicles [68].\nLevels\nTarget Systems\nDisrupted\
    \ Services\nSensors\nCamera, GPS, LiDAR, Radar,\nproximity sensors, ultrasonic\n\

    Anti-theft system, keyless entry systems,\nsignal jamming, replay attack\nSoftware\n\
    In Vehicle protocols: LIN,\nCAN, FlexRay\nCommunication system\nThe vulnerabilities\
    \ at different levels pose serious security and privacy concerns\nrelated to the\
    \ use of autonomous vehicles. Some of the major security concerns include\ndata\
    \ security, network security, vehicle security and ﬁnancial security [69].\nThe\
    \ main types of security threats include:\n1.\nData Theft: Autonomous vehicles\
    \ and self-driving cars form a part of a larger network\nof connected entities\
    \ which continuously share data to provide a seamless user\nexperience. Some of\
    \ the data generated through different entities consist of personal\nuser information\
    \ such as ﬁnancial details, contact details, travel habits and history.\nWith\
    \ this type of personal data at disposal, there are vulnerabilities related to\
    \ data\ntheft that can be used by attackers.\n2.\nIdentity Theft: The concept\
    \ of autonomous vehicles focuses on the transfer of control\nfrom the human drivers\
    \ to the vehicles. In such scenarios, the connected vehicles\nbecome easy targets\
    \ of cyber criminals and hackers. These vehicles are prone to\nidentity theft\
    \ where the hackers can obtain the vehicle identiﬁcation information and\nmisuse\
    \ it.\n3.\nDevice Hijacking: Vehicle hijacking is one of the biggest threats to\
    \ autonomous\nvehicles. The attackers can gain control of the vehicle system and\
    \ software and\nmodify the algorithms to remotely control the vehicle. Once hijacked,\
    \ the hackers can\nmodify the important functioning units such as the navigation\
    \ control unit, engine,\nbrakes, heating systems, communication systems, vehicle\
    \ camera and vision systems.\n4.\nDenial of Service: Attackers can take advantage\
    \ of the vulnerabilities of the least\nsecured devices on the network to gain\
    \ control of the entire network and overwhelm\nthe connected entities. These types\
    \ of attacks can be launched on an individual\nnode or vehicle-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-infrastructure,\
    \ resulting in a communication\nsystem disruption.\n5.\nPrivacy Infringement:\
    \ Autonomous vehicles continuously generate data such as the\nvehicle location.\
    \ These data provide personal information related to the user’s travel\nhistory\
    \ and navigation, which can be misused to track the user’s current location and\n\
    other whereabouts.\n6.\nFinancial Fraud: In countries such as India where toll\
    \ taxes are automatically de-\nducted using RFID tags on the vehicles, there are\
    \ serious concerns related to the\nSensors 2021, 21, 2143\n21 of 41\nﬁnancial\
    \ security of the linked bank accounts. Any insecure network or device may\nresult\
    \ in banking frauds and other related attacks such as ransomware.\n4.2. Trafﬁc\
    \ Flow Optimization\nThe continuous growth of trafﬁc is a problem that many cities\
    \ face today, as a result\nof planning that in many cases was carried out many\
    \ decades ago, when the congestion\nexperienced today was not expected. Population\
    \ growth, which is taking place worldwide,\nhas had a direct impact on the number\
    \ of vehicles on the roads without proper monitoring\nof infrastructures as they\
    \ cannot adapt as quickly as what would be necessary to avoid\nthe problem of\
    \ trafﬁc congestion [70]. This high number of vehicles that resulted in major\n\
    trafﬁc congestion has also resulted in excessive fuel consumption and gas emissions\
    \ and\nan increase in the number of accidents. All these aspects have a direct\
    \ impact on several\ndimensions such as economic, environmental and living [71,72].\
    \ The US Department of\nTransportation (DoT) [73] points out three main sources\
    \ for trafﬁc congestion: (1) events\nthat somehow inﬂuence trafﬁc, such as accidents,\
    \ working areas or bad weather conditions;\n(2) ﬂuctuations in the trafﬁc demand,\
    \ which are the cause of not having a similar and\nconstant pattern, and (3) existing\
    \ infrastructure, which includes trafﬁc control devices and\nalso physical bottlenecks.\
    \ Trafﬁc Management Systems (TMSs) are the systems responsible\nfor preventing\
    \ trafﬁc congestion and improving trafﬁc efﬁciency. To this end, one of their\n\
    components is the collection of information from various heterogeneous sources\
    \ such as\nvehicles, trafﬁc lights and sensors placed in different locations of\
    \ the road infrastructure.\nThe processing of these data is another vital component\
    \ of a TMS with the purpose of\npredicting potential problems in a predictive\
    \ or even real-time manner and acting in\na timely manner to reduce trafﬁc congestion\
    \ and all related problems [70]. From the\nvarious proposals in the literature\
    \ regarding TMSs, the following contributions can be\nenumerated: speed adjustment\
    \ of the vehicle so that it spends the shortest possible time\nstopped at a trafﬁc\
    \ light [74,75], the detection and prevention of trafﬁc congestion [76,77]\nor\
    \ recommendation for alternative routes [71,77,78].\nSome of the challenges being\
    \ faced regarding trafﬁc ﬂow optimization include [48]:\n•\nOptimization of the\
    \ use of road infrastructure\n•\nIntegration of different domains (air, land and\
    \ sea)\n•\nConducting predictive trafﬁc analysis, with emphasis on moments when\
    \ a greater\nﬂow of vehicles is expected\n•\nPerforming data analysis that allows\
    \ trafﬁc planning and control in real time\n•\nOptimizing the location of electric\
    \ car charging stations to the places where they are\nmost in demand\n•\nDeveloping\
    \ predictive models that understand the needs of citizens in terms of new\nmobility\
    \ models (including e-scooters, e-bikes, carsharing, carpooling).\nAccording to\
    \ [2], Trafﬁc Control and Optimization will be achieved in the coming\nyears through\
    \ a network of intelligent sensors, location-based applications and an intelli-\n\
    gent infrastructure that, acting in an integrated manner, can contribute to making\
    \ trafﬁc\nmanagement, driving and even parking more efﬁcient. ICT solutions will\
    \ be the funda-\nmental basis for controlling and optimizing trafﬁc, allowing,\
    \ for example, collision alarm\nand lane-keeping-systems and also integrating\
    \ private vehicles with smart streets, trafﬁc\nlights and TMSs. This type of solution\
    \ and integration will contribute to the safety and\nconvenience of all stakeholders.\
    \ From the moment that cars, streets, trafﬁc lights and\ncontrol systems are interconnected,\
    \ real-time data analysis will be possible and will allow\ntrafﬁc conditions to\
    \ be analyzed and preventive action to be taken. Important information\nwill then\
    \ be possible to be provided to users to optimize their routes in terms of time\
    \ and\nin order to avoid congestion or accidents on the road, adjustments to be\
    \ made to the speed\nof their driving or information on nearby parks or parking\
    \ spaces. This integration and\nthe possibility of real-time access to information\
    \ and instant communication with drivers\nwill be reﬂected in terms of safety,\
    \ less accidents, greater efﬁciency in driving and planning\nroutes and reducing\
    \ congestion, as well as the emission of gases.\nSensors 2021, 21, 2143\n22 of\
    \ 41\n4.3. Optimization of Logistics\nUrban mobility and the current challenges\
    \ we face are not just about the mobility\nof people and private vehicles. We\
    \ must also take into account the mobility of goods,\ncommercial transport and\
    \ urban logistics. These aspects are also important to achieve\nsustainable and\
    \ environmentally friendly mobility. If we previously referred to trafﬁc\ncongestion\
    \ with a greater focus on private vehicles, we must also consider the impact that\n\
    commercial ﬂeets have on trafﬁc congestion. E-commerce is nowadays a global reality\
    \ with\nan increasing tendency of use even for the ease it brings to the consumer.\
    \ However, this\nbrings the need for deliveries, which has a major impact on urban\
    \ logistics and also trafﬁc\ncongestion. Another aspect is restaurants and home\
    \ deliveries, which started to increase in\nsize with Uber-Eats and other similar\
    \ services [79]. The mobility aspect associated with\nbusinesses is thus something\
    \ that deserves as much concern as private mobility. At the\npresent time, logistics\
    \ operations are very defragmented, with little integration between\nthe various\
    \ players, making inefﬁcient use throughout the supply chain. These problems\n\
    will tend to worsen as the need for the delivery of goods increases, which is\
    \ expected to be\nalmost certain given the increase in e-commerce businesses,\
    \ home meal deliveries, among\nothers. As with the increase in the number of private\
    \ vehicles, the increase in the number\nof deliveries and logistics processes\
    \ will also have signiﬁcant consequences for the increase\nin fuel, energy and\
    \ material costs, making the need to optimize these processes obvious [2].\nSome\
    \ of the challenges being faced regarding trafﬁc ﬂow optimization include [63]:\n\
    •\nVehicles that deliver not being fully ﬁlled in terms of their transport capacity\n\
    •\nInefﬁcient route optimization to make deliveries\n•\nLack of coordination between\
    \ transport providers in order to achieve an integrated\nway that includes several\
    \ ﬂeets\n•\nLittle awareness by consumers and suppliers of the carbon footprint\
    \ implications of\nthe large number of deliveries\n•\nCollision of the delivery\
    \ times with the hours of greatest trafﬁc congestion in the cities\n•\nDeliveries\
    \ made using vehicles that use fossil fuels\n•\nInefﬁcient coordination of the\
    \ different means of transport (sea, air and land)\n•\nUse of private transport\
    \ by citizens when shopping, instead of using public transport.\nAccording to\
    \ [2], smart logistics is related to the integration of vehicles, products and\n\
    load units that allow route and load optimization, thus reducing waste in the\
    \ system as\na whole. The current data and sensor processing technology will allow\
    \ the creation of\nsolutions that aim to increase the ﬂexibility and efﬁciency\
    \ of road, air, train and marine\nfreight through the integration of the various\
    \ players in the logistic process that includes\nindividual vehicles, roads and\
    \ load units. It is expected that platforms for ﬂeet management\nand optimized\
    \ route calculation will allow increased efﬁciency in the operationalization of\n\
    logistics systems as well as the planning involved in the process, reducing costs,\
    \ transport\nwith loads that do not make use of the full capacity of the vehicle,\
    \ accidents or even\ndamage to the products. Sensor technology can contribute\
    \ to the monitoring and tracking\nof the location of products and ﬂeets, which\
    \ allows real-time changes to routes whenever\nnecessary to avoid congestion and\
    \ reduce time.\n4.4. Autonomous Vehicles\nThe automation and robotization of tasks,\
    \ with the increasing availability of new\nsensors and software, is something\
    \ we currently assist in several domains, from industry to\ncall centers, applicational\
    \ support to clients, among many others. One of the applications\nof automation\
    \ that we can call the most ambitious is the Autonomous Vehicle (AV). If we\n\
    classify AVs as ambitious it is because they involve people and because, in some\
    \ cases,\nwe may be talking about situations in which their physical integrity\
    \ is at stake and even\nlife or death situations. The availability of AVs is undeniably\
    \ a growing trend, and today\nwe are witnessing an exponential evolution until\
    \ a few years from now we can reach the\ncomplete automation of vehicles. The\
    \ technologies that are present in cities today allow\nus to anticipate that in\
    \ the coming years we will have frank developments regarding the\nSensors 2021,\
    \ 21, 2143\n23 of 41\nautomation of vehicles for the daily commuting that all\
    \ citizens need to undertake for their\ndaily tasks [80]. This will undoubtedly\
    \ revolutionize urban mobility as we know it in a\nvery drastic way. The infrastructures\
    \ of cities will have to undergo signiﬁcant changes in\norder to adapt to this\
    \ new reality. The advent of 5G will be a fundamental piece of this\npuzzle, with\
    \ a speed 100 times faster than 4G [81]. The Automotive Vehicle Readiness\nIndex\
    \ refers to the Netherlands as the country most prepared, in terms of infrastructure,\
    \ to\naccommodate future AVs, followed by Singapore and the United Kingdom. Three\
    \ main\ncharacteristics can be referred to as fundamental when it comes to changing\
    \ infrastructure\nin cities [81]:\n•\nLane marking: these markings are not the\
    \ best for today’s vehicles. It is an aspect\nthat will necessarily have to be\
    \ improved to the point that they can be read efﬁciently\nby machines.\n•\nRoadside\
    \ sensors: this type of sensor should be included in sidewalks, curbs and lanes.\n\
    In this way, it will be possible for AVs to be aware of the environment that surrounds\n\
    them and thus act in a preventive way to possible situations of danger.\n•\nSmart\
    \ signage: image recognition is currently used to read trafﬁc signs. In the future,\n\
    it is expected that the signals will be able to send a signal that can be read\
    \ by machines\nand thus facilitate the reading of the signals by the autonomous\
    \ vehicles.\nThe introduction of AVs is considered to have the following consequences\
    \ in cities [82]:\n•\nProviding a safer and more reliable means of transport,\n\
    •\nReducing the number of accidents,\n•\nReducing the need for human intervention\
    \ during driving,\n•\nReducing trafﬁc congestion\n•\nAllowing elderly people or\
    \ people with disabilities to make their lives easier\n•\nElimination of traffic\
    \ lights as autonomous vehicles will be able to efficiently set priorities\n•\n\
    Reducing/eliminating the time spent searching for parking spaces.\nOn another\
    \ hand, some of the challenges facing the widespread adoption of AVs\ninclude\
    \ [43,82–84]:\n•\nPerception, planning, control and ethics\n•\nData privacy\n\
    •\nTransmission security\n•\nProcessing latency\n•\nEnergy efﬁciency.\n4.4.1.\
    \ Levels of Autonomous Driving\nThe Society of Automotive Engineers [85] deﬁned\
    \ six levels of vehicle automation\nwhich were adopted by the U.S. Department\
    \ of Transportation. The levels range from\n0 (fully manual) to 5 (fully automated),\
    \ as described in Figure 7.\nLevel 0 (Fully Manual—No Driving Automation): most\
    \ vehicles today are at this level\nwhere they are fully controlled by the driver.\
    \ There may be some driver support systems,\nsuch as an emergency braking system\
    \ and some type of warning to the driver, but that is\nnot considered automation.\n\
    Level 1 (Driver Assistance): this level is characterized by the existence of some\
    \ type\nof autonomous action on the part of the vehicle, such as accelerating\
    \ or braking (cruise\ncontrol), but driver intervention is still required in most\
    \ situations.\nLevel 2 (Partial Driver Automation): this level is essentially\
    \ characterized by the exis-\ntence of Autonomous Advanced Driving Assistants\
    \ (ADAS) that control the acceleration\nand braking performed by the vehicle,\
    \ in limited scenarios. The level of automation is still\nlow as the driver must\
    \ maintain full attention as they may have to take care of driving at\nany time.\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 2143\n24 of 41\n \nLevel 4 (High Driving Automation): the main\
    \ feature introduced at level 4 is the abil\nity of the vehicle to be able to\
    \ take over almost all driving independently and to intervene \nin case something\
    \ goes wrong or there is a failure. In most cases, driver intervention is not\
    \ \nnecessary, but the driver can still take care of the car, if they wish. \n\
    Level 5 (Full Driving Automation): level 5 represents full vehicle automation\
    \ where \nthere is no need to have a steering wheel or pedals in the car. The\
    \ vehicle will be able to \ngo anywhere and make all the necessary decisions.\
    \ \n \nFigure 7. Level of automation of autonomous vehicles.\nLevel 3 (Conditional\
    \ Driving Automation): level 3 represents a substantial technologi-\ncal advance\
    \ since the vehicle must be able to control the environment around it, such as\
    \ its\nspeed based on the movement of the car in front. Even so, the driver must\
    \ remain alert in\ncase the vehicle is unable to perform some tasks.\nLevel 4\
    \ (High Driving Automation): the main feature introduced at level 4 is the ability\n\
    of the vehicle to be able to take over almost all driving independently and to\
    \ intervene in\ncase something goes wrong or there is a failure. In most cases,\
    \ driver intervention is not\nnecessary, but the driver can still take care of\
    \ the car, if they wish.\nLevel 5 (Full Driving Automation): level 5 represents\
    \ full vehicle automation where\nthere is no need to have a steering wheel or\
    \ pedals in the car. The vehicle will be able to go\nanywhere and make all the\
    \ necessary decisions.\n4.4.2. Vehicle Sensors\nSensors will play a key role in\
    \ asserting AVs and in the conﬁdence that citizens will\nhave in these vehicles\
    \ and the safety they can offer. The sensors will be an essential part of\nvehicle-to-vehicle\
    \ (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication and will feed\nAdvanced\
    \ Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) in the recommendations given to drivers.\n\
    Examples of these recommendations include warnings for the driver to stay in the\
    \ central\npart of the road, avoiding drowsiness or distraction when managing\
    \ cruise control, or in\nmore complex situations that cross information from the\
    \ outside weather with the driver’s\ncondition (calmer, more aggressive), or with\
    \ their heartbeat, which are among many other\naspects that can be monitored in\
    \ order to collect as much information as possible to create\na safe driving environment\
    \ that drastically reduces the number of accidents.\nIn order to collect the information\
    \ mentioned above, it is necessary to have several\nsensors in the vehicles, namely\
    \ environment sensors which are responsible for collecting\ninformation from the\
    \ environment surrounding the vehicle [86]. Within the environmental\nsensors,\
    \ there are cameras and remote radars placed in front of the vehicle, long-range\n\
    radars that allow the detection of objects in front of the vehicle when it is\
    \ at high speed\nand Lidar Laser Scanners that allow the detection of objects\
    \ at medium distances. It is\nnormal for each of these sensors to be placed in\
    \ different locations on the vehicle because\nof the effects of time, the detection\
    \ angle and the maximum distance at which an object is\nidentiﬁed. Table 5 summarizes\
    \ the vehicle’s main sensors, location and their purpose.\nSensors 2021, 21, 2143\n\

    Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) play a key role in intelligent transport sys-\n\
    tems (ITS). In VANETs, the development of a routing protocol for effective vehicular\n\
    communications presents several challenges, which can be highlighted [87]:\n•\n\
    Safe routing: the security of messages is, in all systems, delicate and of enormous\n\
    importance. In this speciﬁc case, illegal message tampering can have very serious\n\
    consequences and even have an impact on life-or-death situations;\n•\nReliable\
    \ communication: link ruptures can suddenly happen due to some VANETs’\ncharacteristics\
    \ such as high mobility, intermittent connectivity or obstacles in cities,\nand\
    \ what to do in case of packet losses is a challenge;\n•\nDetermining the optimal\
    \ path from a source to a destination, taking into account the\ndensity of trafﬁc\
    \ and the shortest distance;\n•\nDetermining a routing strategy that adapts to\
    \ the two distinct environments of\nVANETs: city environment and motorways.\n\
    The position-based routing protocol is considered one of the best approaches in\n\
    VANETs [87] and can be adopted in an urban environment (where the biggest challenge\n\
    is the obstacles) as well as on highways. In the literature and taking into account\
    \ the\nchallenges of routing in an urban environment, there are many proposals\
    \ for the adoption of\nthis type of protocol for communications V2V and V2I [88–92],\
    \ with the various categories\nof protocols listed in Figure 8.\n4.4.4. Ethical\
    \ Issues\nThe recent popularity of autonomous vehicles has drawn the attention\
    \ of automobile\nmanufacturers from all over the world. Autonomous vehicles represent\
    \ any means of\ntransportation that are capable of navigating the roads with no\
    \ or minimum human\ninterventions and provide potential solutions to the road\
    \ safety issues caused by human\nerrors [93]. The transition from a purely human\
    \ operated vehicle to a fully automated\nvehicle is still far from reality. However,\
    \ many automobile companies are already offering\npartial automation in terms\
    \ of services such as emergency brakes application, assisted\nparking, etc. Despite\
    \ the several beneﬁts and the rising popularity, the deployment of these\nvehicles\
    \ on the road poses several critical challenges related to the operations, technology,\n\
    legal aspects and, most of all, ethical issues [94].\nSensors 2021, 21, 2143\n\

    \ \nThe recent popularity of autonomous vehicles has drawn the attention of automobile\
    \ \nmanufacturers from all over the world. Autonomous vehicles represent any means\
    \ of \ntransportation that are capable of navigating the roads with no or minimum\
    \ human inter-\nventions and provide potential solutions to the road safety issues\
    \ caused by human errors \n[93]. The transition from a purely human operated vehicle\
    \ to a fully automated vehicle is \nstill far from reality. However, many automobile\
    \ companies are already offering partial \nautomation in terms of services such\
    \ as emergency brakes application, assisted parking, \netc. Despite the several\
    \ benefits and the rising popularity, the deployment of these vehi-\ncles on the\
    \ road poses several critical challenges related to the operations, technology,\
    \ \nlegal aspects and, most of all, ethical issues [94]. \nFigure 8. Categories\
    \ of protocols on vehicular communications.\nThe main concerns regard how AVs\
    \ should behave in extreme trafﬁc situations. In the\nliterature, this is known\
    \ as the trolley problem, ﬁrst proposed in 1967, where a moral choice\nmust be\
    \ taken, and the AV should decide whether to kill ﬁve people by allowing the trolley\n\
    to proceed, or kill “just” one person while stopping the trolley [95]. This issue\
    \ has been\ndeeply debated as the Moral Machine Experiment (MME), but there is\
    \ still no solution.\nFrom this research, it emerged that customers are willing\
    \ to buy AVs that prioritize the\nsafety of their passengers, whilst they agree\
    \ on others buying AVs that sacriﬁce passengers’\nlife for a greater good [96].\
    \ This is no more a technological problem, but Philosophy, Law\nand Ethics are\
    \ involved and the individual good is opposed to a greater one [97]. The trolley\n\
    problem was the ﬁrst example of extreme trafﬁc situations that lead to a moral\
    \ choice.\nSeveral situations have been discussed in the literature. Just to mention\
    \ a few, one regards\nwhether to kill a child or an elderly person to avoid an\
    \ obstacle, or whether to invade the\nSensors 2021, 21, 2143\n27 of 41\nopposite\
    \ carriageway, thus involving more cars in an accident, to avoid collision with\
    \ a\nheavy goods vehicle that surely would strongly injure the AV [98]. From a\
    \ technical point\nof view, these choices can be addressed by rules that embed\
    \ the human driver experience\nand return risk and gain probabilities. However,\
    \ ﬁrst of all, the problem is so complex\nthat it is not possible to foresee all\
    \ possible situations; moreover, other ethical and moral\nissues arise: there\
    \ is the need to judge if the rules are acceptable, then the same rules\nshould\
    \ be adopted by all the companies, and ﬁnally the main issue regards the damage\n\
    responsibility [98]. It is worth noting that whilst in the scientiﬁc literature\
    \ this moral\ndilemma has been largely debated, and yet no answers have been found,\
    \ industry reports\non the same topic assume a pragmatic approach. Indeed, these\
    \ extreme trafﬁc situations\nare considered to be rare cases that cannot be avoided,\
    \ and damages to objects and people\nmust be minimized [95]. However, with the\
    \ spread of the ﬁrst autonomous vehicles, some\naccidents have already happened.\
    \ This is the case of a pedestrian who was killed in Arizona\nby an Uber self-driving\
    \ car (https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54175359 accessed\non 3 February 2021).\n\
    Since this topic is very critical and it limits the development of AVs, recently,\
    \ ethical\nguidelines for the automotive sectors have been released by detailing\
    \ the fundamental\nrequirements and practical recommendations for both industries\
    \ and policymakers [99].\nParticularly, in 2019 seven fundamental requirements\
    \ were proposed by the High-level\nExpert Group on Artiﬁcial Intelligence, which\
    \ included “human agency and oversight”,\n“technical robustness and safety”, “privacy\
    \ and data governance, transparency”, “diversity,\nnon-discrimination and fairness”,\
    \ “societal and environmental wellbeing” and “account-\nability”. Then, the guidelines\
    \ have pointed out that ﬁve rights underlie these requirements,\nnamely: the right\
    \ to “self-determination and liberty”, “life and security”, “protection of\npersonal\
    \ data”, “equality and nondiscrimination” and to “explanation”. Table 6 summa-\n\
    rizes the seven requirements by highlighting their key concerns and brief descriptions.\n\
    Interested readers can refer to [99] for more details.\nTable 6. Requirements\
    \ for autonomous vehicles based on fundamental rights.\nRequirements\nKey Concerns\n\
    Description\nHuman agency and\noversight\n•\nWhich level of autonomy should be\n\
    allowed?\n•\nIs the state of the driver suitable for\nobtaining control?\n•\n\
    How can pedestrians and people outside\nthe AV exercise their autonomy?\nAVs must\
    \ allow a level of autonomy to the human drivers. They\nshould be allowed to override\
    \ the decision of the\nmachine intelligence.\nAutonomy requires drivers to be\
    \ informed. On the other hand, AVs\nshould monitor the driver’s state and block\
    \ the autonomy if their\nstate could cause risks (e.g., they are drunk, sleepy,\
    \ etc.). Finally,\nhumans outside the vehicle should also be able to preserve\n\
    their autonomy.\nTechnical robustness and\nsafety\n•\nHow to protect AV by cyber-attacks\
    \ that\naffect vehicle security?\n•\nHow to automatically manage\nemergency situations?\n\
    AVs must be robust to external cybersecurity attacks (e.g.,\nHijacking, Abuse,\
    \ Passive behavioral attacks). Data\ncommunications between vehicles and servers\
    \ must not reveal\nprivate data that could affect the behavior of the vehicle.\n\
    Moreover, AVs must provide an “automatic safe condition state” for\nmanaging emergency\
    \ situations and minimizing the risks.\nPrivacy and data\ngovernance\n•\nWhich\
    \ kind of data are stored? What is\ntheir aim?\n•\nIs the driver correctly informed\
    \ about\ndata storage?\n•\nDid they explicitly express their consent?\n•\nAre\
    \ data laws respected?\nAutonomous vehicles continuously capture information to\
    \ enhance\ntheir artiﬁcial intelligence systems. These data contain information\n\
    related to user behavior and travel history. Sharing the personal\nuser data must\
    \ comply with the GDPR. These personal data are\nfurther vulnerable to thefts\
    \ and misuse.\nMoreover, the type of the information collected from the AVs\n\
    inﬂuences their capabilities. Thus, the kind of data and their scope\nmust be\
    \ speciﬁed (e.g., geolocalisation data for navigation,\nbiometric data for user\
    \ recognition and driver’s state evaluation,\ndriver behavioral data for analysis).\
    \ Data storage leads to the\nfollowing legal issues: transparency (privacy policies\
    \ must clearly\ndescribe which data are collected and why), explicit consent,\n\
    sharing with third parties, compliance with data protection\nstandards and regulations.\n\

    \ governance. The\nmanufacturers must provide information about data collection\
    \ and\ntheir use.\nMoreover drivers must be aware of the AV’s mechanisms for\n\
    accountability.\nTransparency also regards the right to explanation. Drivers need\
    \ to\ntrust AVs, thus transparency and communication of the underlying\nfunctionality\
    \ must be clearly explained in a way humans can\nunderstand. Explainable Artiﬁcial\
    \ Intelligence studies these aspects\nthat are crucial in smart cities where humans\
    \ and machines\ncontinuously interact [100]\nDiversity,\nnon-discrimination and\n\

    •\nNo distinction between individuals must\nbe assured\nNo distinction between\
    \ individuals must be applied. This could\nseem obvious, since it is clearly stated\
    \ in the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, but it is also well known that\
    \ systems\nbased on artiﬁcial intelligence can be biased by the data used to\n\
    train their models. It has already happened, in different domains,\nthat “intelligent\
    \ systems” have discriminated against some\nethnic groups.\nSocietal and\nenvironmental\
    \ wellbeing\n•\nWhat will be the consequences of a net\nimpact of introducing\
    \ AVs?\nThe use of AVs must ensure an increase in public health and\nmobility,\
    \ reduce the trafﬁc ﬂow, and decrease carbon emissions.\nHowever, there is uncertainty\
    \ regarding the spreading in using AVs.\nThis could cause an increase in total\
    \ pollution and congestion. The\nintroduction of AVs must be combined with infrastructure\
    \ changes\naimed to facilitate and optimize the AV experience.\nAccountability\n\
    •\nWho will be responsible for any\nmis-happenings on or off road?\n•\nWho will\
    \ be punished and held guilty\nfor accidents and breaking laws?\n•\nHow will the\
    \ insurance company handle\nissues related to autonomous vehicle\nclaims?\nAs\
    \ previously discussed, the attribution of liability and\nresponsibility is an\
    \ open issue.\nWho will be responsible for the actions of the autonomous vehicle\n\
    in situations where the entire control is in hands of the vehicle\nitself? Is\
    \ it the responsibility of the human operator, the car\ncompany or the algorithms\n\
    ?In case of accidents, AVs cannot be responsible, since they are not\nmoral agents.\
    \ The full deployment of autonomous vehicles on the\nroad needs well established\
    \ laws and regulations governing the\nliability and responsibilities.\nMoreover,\
    \ once the vehicle’s control is in the hands of an algorithm\nor software, what\
    \ will be the criteria to deﬁne risky and safe\ndriving? How will the insurance\
    \ companies handle the claims\nrelated to accidents and road safety issues? [101]\n\
    4.5. Outdoor Navigation Technologies\nOutdoor navigation represents an important\
    \ component of one of the services that\ncan be delivered to citizens under smart\
    \ mobility. In this section, we mention some of the\ntechniques that are being\
    \ used to achieve that and serve as the basis to deliver applications\nand services\
    \ to citizens in order to ease one of the most common tasks nowadays, namely\n\
    when we are in unknown places or also when we are talking about people with permanent\n\
    or temporary disabilities such as visually impaired people, autistic people or\
    \ people\nin wheelchairs for whom navigation represents a major issue. One of\
    \ the main and\nﬁrst technologies for outdoor navigation is the Global Positioning\
    \ System. It is at the\nbase of the guidance systems that emerged in cars, and\
    \ its main limitation is its limited\naccuracy. GPS technology was ﬁrst made available\
    \ with a deliberate error—called Selected\nAvailability (SA)—that could cause\
    \ an error of 100 m for civilian usage, which highly limited\napplications that\
    \ need to have an accurate positioning [102]. A GPS receiver is based on\nsignals\
    \ received from several non-geo-stationary satellites. The fact that the number\
    \ of\nsatellites, as well as their position, is variable directly affects the\
    \ accuracy [103–106]. Even\nafter the SA limitation was over in 2000, the accuracy\
    \ achieved with only the use of GPS is\nlimited for solutions such as high-precision\
    \ agriculture or pedestrian navigation in locations\nwith tall buildings [107].\
    \ To solve these limitations, alternatives have emerged, such as those\nbased\
    \ on differential corrections and which support methods such as RTK or DGPS, which\n\
    still have the signal degraded or have interruptions depending on the range and\
    \ quality of\nSensors 2021, 21, 2143\n29 of 41\ntransmission [108]. DGPS can be\
    \ deﬁned as a real-time positioning method that makes use\nof at least two GPS\
    \ receivers, one installed at a point with known coordinates (called a base\n\
    or reference station) and the other moving along a given path whose coordinates\
    \ need to be\ndiscovered. The base station calculates the differential corrections\
    \ and transmits them to the\nmobile receiver so that the accuracy of its location\
    \ can be improved. Another approach is\nthe use of active beacons that can use\
    \ radio, sonar or laser and determine the location of the\nperson or object based\
    \ on the triangulation of the signal. The delay in receiving the signal\ncauses\
    \ inaccuracy in the location obtained and there are also high costs in the associated\n\
    infrastructure, which requires the existence of many beacons [109]. Dead reckoning\
    \ is\nan ancient maritime term to describe navigation based on the starting position\
    \ and a\nvelocity vector composed of speed and direction and how long the velocity\
    \ is maintained\nto determine the new position [110]. This technique, applied\
    \ to pedestrian navigation,\nmeasures and analyzes a person’s way of walking in\
    \ order to understand and measure\ndisplacement in relation to an initial position\
    \ based on a set of sensors that allow the\nextraction of speed and altitude information.\
    \ The calculated positioning is based entirely\non the information collected through\
    \ sensors [111], the error being accumulated because the\ncurrent position is\
    \ calculated based on the previous one, and so on. This method has been\nused\
    \ in conjunction with GPS to improve the determination of a user’s position outdoors.\n\
    Dead reckoning is also being used in terms of navigation and vehicle location\
    \ [9], where\nit is possible to install odometer and optical sensors for wheel\
    \ direction detection and\nachieve a low-cost solution, however, keeping the problem\
    \ of error accumulation. Visual\npositioning is a technique that aims to overcome\
    \ the imprecision of outdoor positioning\nobtained with previous mentioned technologies\
    \ using visual elements such as markers,\nlandmarks combined with camera images\
    \ captured by a smartphone. Google is currently\ndeveloping its Visual Positioning\
    \ System (VPS) which is integrated with Google Maps so\nthat, based on augmented\
    \ reality, navigation takes on another dimension while using the\ncamera to inspect\
    \ the surroundings, infer position and adjust positioning and navigation\nrecommendations\
    \ [112]. This is achieved through considerable computational power\ncombined with\
    \ a large set of data on the backend that allows the recognition of the position\n\
    based on the image captured by the camera of the mobile phone, mostly through\
    \ buildings\nand tourist spots. This approach is focused on the use of known landmarks\
    \ (monuments,\netc.) that can therefore quickly and unambiguously, or at least\
    \ with great precision, identify\nthe user’s current position. Some of the advantages\
    \ of this approach include [112,113]:\nhigher accuracy than GPS, and therefore\
    \ an alternative for locations with tall buildings,\nadded value for blind people,\
    \ whether on the streets, at a school or in an establishment,\nuseful for situations\
    \ where a person is lost without knowing their location, added value for\ncompanies,\
    \ who can use this system to provide navigation information to their customers\n\
    to travel to their establishment, either on foot or using public transport, the\
    \ availability\nof application in indoor and outdoor environments, high scalability\
    \ and low cost. Like\nall technologies, this one too has its limitations and challenges,\
    \ which include difﬁculty,\nin some locations, to have landmarks that can be used\
    \ to accurately identify a particular\nlocation, difﬁculty in mapping the interior\
    \ of all buildings, vulnerability to luminosity,\ncausing shadows with impact\
    \ on the identiﬁcation of places, and the possibility of people\nor objects being\
    \ able to block the captured image and thus prevent the recognition of the\nlocation.\
    \ Passive markers are being used to provide an optimized route that goes through\n\
    several points of interest. The current location can be obtained through passive\
    \ markers\nthat are strategically placed near points of interests which have been\
    \ previously mapped\nto a Spatial Map Graph, using machine learning [114]. Passive\
    \ markers, in an outdoor\nenvironment, might be represented through QR codes that\

    \ of large volumes of data, collected from various sources\nand, therefore, heterogeneous.\
    \ The relevance of Big Data only arises when information\nprocessing techniques\
    \ are applied to these data so that predictive information and pattern\nanalysis\
    \ can help them in making decisions. The sources that now feed data into the\n\
    datasets that make up Big Data are immense and include smartphones, data from\
    \ social\nnetworks, vehicle sensors, GPS and location applications, trafﬁc light\
    \ sensors and other\nroad locations, public agencies, connected cars, and camera\
    \ feeds.\nThe General Data Protection Regulation may constitute an obstacle to\
    \ the use and\nadoption of Big Data in smart mobility services. Some examples\
    \ include:\n•\nReal-time information about the location collected from smartphones\
    \ that can be used\nfor various services on people’s mobility can be a major barrier\
    \ in terms of privacy;\nSensors 2021, 21, 2143\n32 of 41\n•\nThe collection of\
    \ images of people obtained from services for mapping and recogni-\ntion purposes;\n\
    •\nThe on-board units of the vehicles might be associated with plate numbers which\
    \ are\nconsidered indirect identiﬁers;\n•\nThe lack of veriﬁcation of the accuracy\
    \ and relevance of the information collected.\nBig Data, combined with AI techniques,\
    \ can allow signiﬁcant improvements in several\naspects and dimensions of smart\
    \ mobility [124]:\n•\nPort scales can be optimized if data are shared in advance\
    \ in order to improve planning\nand resource allocation. In Hamburg, for example,\
    \ electric vehicles and real-time\nnavigation are used to ensure the smooth ﬂow\
    \ of trafﬁc and thus reduce congestion;\n•\nTrafﬁc lights can be controlled based\
    \ on trafﬁc ﬂow if the necessary data are collected.\nIn this way, trafﬁc in cities\
    \ can be optimized and congestion can be reduced. This is an\nexample currently\
    \ in practice in the city of Hong Kong;\n•\nIoT sensors and CCTV cameras can also\
    \ be used for trafﬁc management, thus reduc-\ning congestion;\n•\nOpen data about\
    \ mobility can be of added value to citizens that can be aware of real\ntime trafﬁc\
    \ data and plan their day with more information so it can be more efﬁcient;\n\
    •\nParking spaces can be monitored, and drivers can reduce parking time and also\n\
    CO2 emissions;\n•\nOn-demand and more adaptive modes of capacity planning and\
    \ operations can\nbe achieved using data from sensors, cameras and vehicles so\
    \ that information to\ncommuters can be given so they can plan their routes more\
    \ efﬁciently;\n•\nFleet efficiency can be obtained by combining real-time traffic\
    \ data to produce route opti-\nmization using AI techniques, reducing wait times\
    \ and optimizing energy consumption;\n•\nIncrease citizens’ security by preventing\
    \ anomaly detection and anticipating incidents.\n5.2. Role of Enabling Technologies\
    \ in Smart Mobility Services and Applications\nIn this section, an analysis is\
    \ made of the current use of enabling technologies in the\nmain services and applications\
    \ in the area of smart mobility as previously discussed in\nSection 4.\n5.2.1.\
    \ Role in Mobility-as-a-Service\nIn MaaS systems, a central operator made available\
    \ through an intermediate layer of\nthe system becomes essential to manage all\
    \ communication between transport companies,\npassengers and other stakeholders\
    \ of the system. In [125], the authors propose a blockchain-\nbased solution that\
    \ eliminates this intermediate layer, promoting trust and transparency\namong\
    \ all stakeholders and eliminating the need for commercial agreements between\
    \ the\nvarious MaaS agents. In [126], easy, quick and trusted transactions are\
    \ covered, using AI\nand blockchain-enabled smart contracts.\nThe use of geospatial\
    \ technologies has big applicability in MaaS solutions, bringing\nadded value\
    \ to the entire system and associated services. One example is the monitoring\
    \ of\ncommuters. In [127], the authors exploit Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC)\
    \ to propose a\nMaaS solution that collects and processes data related to the\
    \ mobility of commuters in order\nto be able to recommend optimized routes taking\
    \ into account the needs and preferences\nof each commuter. Another study [128]\
    \ also uses MEC, IoT messaging protocols and\nvirtualization (i.e., digital twins)\
    \ in the proposal of a framework that collects data about\ncommuters in order\
    \ to feed the monitoring of mobility by the transport planning solutions.\nThe\
    \ use of Big Data in MaaS systems is present in the aforementioned solutions that\n\
    collect and process data from commuters [127,128]. A speciﬁc big data architecture\
    \ is\npresented in [129], motivated by the speciﬁc requirements of mobility analytics.\n\
    With regard to clean energy, the entire concept of MaaS recommends the progressive\n\
    transition from private to public and shared transport, including car-pooling\
    \ and car-\nsharing. This paradigm shift will bring with it a consequent reduction\
    \ in vehicles and the\nemission of CO2 into the atmosphere. In [130], the authors\
    \ present a study of when the\nSensors 2021, 21, 2143\n33 of 41\ntransition to\
    \ MaaS could happen on a larger scale and what impact it will have on the\nchoice\
    \ of forms of mobility.\n5.2.2. Role in Trafﬁc Flow Optimization and Optimization\
    \ of Logistics\nTrafﬁc optimization is one of the primary needs in terms of mobility.\
    \ In [131], the\nauthors propose a blockchain-based approach focused on air trafﬁc\
    \ optimization, where\nblockchain technology is used to ensure a secure, transparent\
    \ and decentralized platform.\nThe transport sector’s contribution to CO2 emissions\
    \ is 23%, with trafﬁc congestion\naccounting for 3\n4 of this value [132], hence\
    \ the optimization of the trafﬁc ﬂow (private and\nalso from the point of view\
    \ of logistics) is essential if CO2 emissions are to be reduced.\nReal-time analysis\
    \ of trafﬁc information is essential to efﬁciently manage urban trafﬁc.\nIn [133],\
    \ the authors propose the monitoring and analysis of trafﬁc through unmanned\n\
    aerial vehicles (UAV) for real-time video collection, and artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ techniques\nfor the processing and identiﬁcation of moving objects. In [134],\
    \ the authors propose a\nmodel for collecting and analyzing trafﬁc patterns, using\
    \ cameras at intersections in order\nto help reduce trafﬁc congestion. In order\
    \ to reduce network congestion, the authors\npropose processing at the edge, without\
    \ sending the Big Data set to the cloud. Processing\nis performed using deep learning\
    \ techniques and algorithms. Is it important to highlight\nthat these types of\
    \ approaches can also help to solve problems related to transportation\nmore related\
    \ to the logistics sector.\nThe use of sensors and an IoT network for trafﬁc monitoring\
    \ and optimization is the\nresult of numerous contributions in the literature\
    \ [135]. In [136], a solution is proposed\nto optimize the trafﬁc ﬂow at intersections\
    \ based on ultrasonic sensors integrated with a\nRaspberry Pi that operate on\
    \ the road lines, taking into account the density of the trafﬁc.\nThe authors\
    \ stress the importance of using IoT to drive for smarter safety and safer devices\n\
    on the road.\nThe performance of the various stakeholders of the supply chains,\
    \ including transport\nlogistics, needs transparency so that it can be a connected,\
    \ intelligent and efﬁcient system.\nIn [137], the authors propose a new approach\
    \ to the use of blockchain to ensure the integrity\nof the performance monitoring\
    \ of the logistics sector. On the other hand, in [138], and given\nthe lack of\
    \ a traceability mechanism in the logistical transaction, as well as the integrity\n\
    and security of the information, the authors propose a traceability algorithm\
    \ in logistical\ntransactions based on blockchain.\n5.2.3. Role in Autonomous\
    \ Vehicles\nThe adoption of blockchain in autonomous vehicles already has several\
    \ proposals\nin the literature. One of its applications is to support a system\
    \ that stores events that\nhappened in the autonomous vehicle and that can be\
    \ useful when there is an accident\nbetween vehicles or involving a human being\
    \ [139]. In these situations, responsibility must\nbe decided on the basis of\
    \ a system that makes it possible to understand the various events\nthat have\
    \ taken place in the autonomous vehicle. Another application of the blockchain\
    \ in\nAVs is related to car-sharing or car-pooling and the guarantee of trust\
    \ that is intended to\nexist among everyone involved in this type of system, which\
    \ is also directly linked to the\nconcept of MaaS [140]. Blockchain and smart\
    \ contracts are also being used to ensure the\nauthenticity and integrity of the\
    \ ﬁrmware update process by manufacturers of the systems\nthat support AVs, which\
    \ are increasingly subject to attacks [141].\nGeospatial technologies aim at tracking\
    \ and tracing vehicles and pedestrians, thus\nproviding a range of mobility services.\
    \ In [142], a system is presented that tracks and\nmonitors the autonomous vehicle\
    \ in real time using a Frequency Modulated Continuous\nWave (FMCW) radar. In [143],\
    \ the authors propose a model to address the accuracy of\ntracking and vehicle\
    \ stability. The model aims to perform the predictive control that\nintends to\
    \ monitor any deviations in the trajectory in order to keep the vehicle stable,\
    \ even\nat high speed.\nSensors 2021, 21, 2143\n34 of 41\nOne of the relevant\
    \ aspects with regard to AVs is the choice of optimal trajectory.\nThis choice,\
    \ in [144], is made by the authors using Big Data mining and the analysis of\n\
    real accident data as well as real-time data from connected vehicles. In [145],\
    \ the authors\npropose an autonomous accident detection system in real time based\
    \ on computational\nintelligence techniques. The study uses Big Data processing\
    \ methodologies to analyze 2015\ntrafﬁc ﬂow data from Istanbul collected from\
    \ different sensors, which are also intrinsically\nrelated to how autonomous vehicles\
    \ are connected to the Internet of Things.\nAutonomous vehicles represent the\
    \ future, in which vehicles are expected to be\nconnected and electric. This evolution\
    \ is directly linked to climate and environmental\nsustainability, taking into\
    \ account an EU directive that requires a 40% reduction in CO2 by\n2030 compared\
    \ to 1990. The reduction in CO2 emissions from vehicles goes largely through\n\
    the transition for electric vehicles [146].\nVision-based artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ in autonomous vehicles allows a set of features\nincluding the detection of\
    \ obstacles as well as mechanisms to avoid them [147]. In [148], the\nauthors\
    \ propose a way to increase the processing power to estimate the distance to obstacles\n\
    using Compute Uniﬁed Device Architecture (CUDA) along with Believe Propagation\n\
    Algorithm (BPA). The use of AI for in-vehicle vision systems to power Advanced\
    \ Driving\nAssistant Systems (ADAS) is explored in [149].\nTable 7 summarizes,\
    \ for an easier understanding, the studies that apply each one of\nthe technologies\
    \ to the smart mobility service or application.\nTable 7. Summary of studies that\

    \ solutions are catalyzing a paradigm shift in the area of mobility\nmanagement\
    \ in smart cities. Several innovative approaches are being devised to improve\n\
    the state-of-the-art of smart mobility. A few important factors to be considered\
    \ include:\n•\nMobility in degraded vision\n•\nElectric vehicles\n•\nAlternate\
    \ fuels\n•\nMobility solutions in natural calamities and disasters\n•\nMobility\
    \ for differently abled citizens\n•\nInclusive, environment friendly, sustainable\
    \ and efﬁcient transportation\n•\nIoT based dynamic trafﬁc management\n•\nTransparent\
    \ and distributed trafﬁc management\n•\nSecurity of citizens, devices and vehicles.\n\
    Artiﬁcial Intelligence is one of the pioneering technologies being exploited in\
    \ recent\nyears to provide state-of-the-art mobility solutions. Deep learning-based\
    \ object detection\nand identiﬁcation can be used to provide improved visibility\
    \ in conditions of degraded\nvision (such as low light areas, foggy, windy or\
    \ rainy environments) [150–152]. IoT-based\nroad condition monitoring, environment\
    \ monitoring, and surrounding monitoring can\nprovide unprecedented information\
    \ which can be used to predict future conditions to\naid in the desired course\
    \ of actions. Blockchain technology can provide a distributed,\nSensors 2021,\
    \ 21, 2143\n35 of 41\ntransparent, and immutable Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) network\
    \ for effective, secured\nand privacy preserved management of the smart mobility\
    \ ecosystem [153–156]. Technology\nfor low carbon emissions, alternative fuels,\
    \ electric vehicles and improved batteries can\nalso aid in the protection of\
    \ the environment and attaining sustainable development\ngoals for better environment\
    \ for a better quality of life (QoL). Extensive research was\nconducted in the\
    \ ﬁeld of communications to provide connectivity in times of natural\ncalamity\
    \ and disasters [157,158]. Affordable satellite-based communication technologies\n\
    are being explored to provide connectivity in extreme and unavoidable conditions.\n\
    7. Conclusions\nThe last few years have already made some advances and the ﬁrst\
    \ steps towards\nthe construction of future smart cities known, namely in terms\
    \ of mobility. The increase\nin the world population inevitably has considerable\
    \ consequences on the way urban\nmobility operates, not least because cities were\
    \ planned decades or even hundreds of\nyears ago, taking into account a much smaller\
    \ population and where infrastructure needs\nwere very different. A challenge\
    \ now arises in adapting cities to current needs. However,\nthe evolution towards\
    \ cities and smart mobility will not involve making more space for\nvehicles or\
    \ more roads; rather, it will undergo a cultural paradigm shift in which people\n\
    will have to stop using their private cars to switch to shared transport, which\
    \ may thus\nreduce not only the number of vehicles in circulation, but also contribute\
    \ to reducing the\necological footprint. In addition to the technological issue\
    \ associated with this change, we\nalso have, and in a very marked way, an underlying\
    \ cultural change because there is a\ncertain comfort and facilitation in the\
    \ use of our own cars that will not be easy to change\nfrom one moment to the\
    \ next. Citizens must realize the negative consequences for the\nenvironment of\
    \ maintaining the current state and the impossibility of managing so many\ncars\
    \ within the cities with the highest population density, and while there must\
    \ be an effort\nto raise awareness of the beneﬁts, we will all gain from this\
    \ cultural and paradigm shift.\nTechnology and its exponential evolution, which\
    \ is expected to continue in the coming\nyears, will support the transition from\
    \ Smart Mobility to a Mobility-as-a-Service paradigm,\nwhere vehicle sharing,\
    \ carsharing, and carpooling will bring the emergence of a new\ndimension. The\
    \ IoT and the connectivity that will be able to be established between\nvehicles,\
    \ trafﬁc lights, and pedestrians, among others, will allow the evolution to intelligent\n\
    trafﬁc management systems with reduced congestion and even the number of accidents,\n\
    which is the main premise that Level 5 Autonomous Vehicles intend to achieve.\
    \ To this end,\nwe will have the big contribution of Big Data and AI that, together,\
    \ will process gigantic\nvolumes of information collected from the IoT and will\
    \ allow services to be made available\nto citizens that will make their daily\
    \ lives much easier and will allow preventive action in\ndecision-making with\
    \ regard to the management of vehicle, ﬂeet and pedestrian trafﬁc.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    rights and content Under a Creative Commons license open access Highlights • A
    broad range of nanomaterial data repositories and tools are being developed. •
    Integration across resources would leverage data to support multiple objectives.
    • Differences in purpose, terminology, and data structure make integration challenging.
    • Results from a community-wide survey on nanomaterial data challenges and goals
    are described. • Proposals for specific efforts within the nanoinformatics community
    are presented. Abstract Many groups within the broad field of nanoinformatics
    are already developing data repositories and analytical tools driven by their
    individual organizational goals. Integrating these data resources across disciplines
    and with non-nanotechnology resources can support multiple objectives by enabling
    the reuse of the same information. Integration can also serve as the impetus for
    novel scientific discoveries by providing the framework to support deeper data
    analyses. This article discusses current data integration practices in nanoinformatics
    and in comparable mature fields, and nanotechnology-specific challenges impacting
    data integration. Based on results from a nanoinformatics-community-wide survey,
    recommendations for achieving integration of existing operational nanotechnology
    resources are presented. Nanotechnology-specific data integration challenges,
    if effectively resolved, can foster the application and validation of nanotechnology
    within and across disciplines. This paper is one of a series of articles by the
    Nanomaterial Data Curation Initiative that address data issues such as data curation
    workflows, data completeness and quality, curator responsibilities, and metadata.

    integrationDatabasesWeb services 1. Introduction Understanding and addressing
    complexities involved in integrating nanomaterial and non-nanomaterial data resources
    to enable and advance scientific research is a key focus of nanoinformatics (Thomas
    et al., 2011a). This article discusses the integration of data resources across
    nanotechnology, including non-nanotechnology resources. It is one in a series
    of papers focusing on important aspects of nanoinformatics produced by the Nanomaterials
    Data Curation Initiative (NDCI), which is part of the National Cancer Institute
    (NCI) Nanotechnology Working Group (Hendren et al., 2015). Other articles in this
    series discuss data curation workflows (Powers et al., 2015) and data completeness
    and quality (Marchese-Robinson et al., 2016). 1.1. Background The NDCI is currently
    working to advance nanoinformatics and is exploring the role of data integration
    as an essential component within the field. The following definition of nanoinformatics
    (expanded from the Nanoinformatics 2020 Roadmap (de la Iglesia et al., 2011))
    has been proposed (Hoover et al., 2015). “Nanoinformatics is the science and practice
    of determining which information is relevant to meeting the objectives of the
    nanoscale science and engineering community, and then: developing and implementing
    effective mechanisms for collecting, validating, storing, sharing, analyzing,
    modeling, and applying the information; confirming that appropriate decisions
    were made and that desired mission outcomes were achieved; and finally, conveying
    experience to the broader community, contributing to generalized knowledge, and
    updating standards and training.” Data integration within nanoinformatics and
    with outside data resources supports productive nanotechnology, fostering the
    application and validation of nanotechnology within and across disciplines. Integration
    of data means combining different data sets such that they are compatible with
    one another in format and meaning to enable comparison and co-analysis. The nanoinformatics
    vision is that, beyond achieving individual project goals, the potential exists
    for broadly-integrated data sets to yield new and unexpected insights from deeper
    data mining, to generate new hypotheses and knowledge not anticipated by the originating
    data resources, and to benefit multiple stakeholders. To realize these secondary
    benefits of integration, individual projects and disciplines participating in
    integration efforts must see improvement in their ability to meet their own objectives.
    The overlap of interests among biomedicine, materials science, precision agriculture,
    and environmental, health, and safety (EHS) research is illustrated in Fig. 1.
    The figure shows that each field pursues research relating to its discipline-specific
    questions, yet at the intersection of these fields is a common kernel of questions
    and answers that would advance each individual research field as well as open
    new vistas on a multi-disciplinary basis. By looking across all four disciplines,
    data integration potentially positively affects the entire data life-cycle, from
    experimental design through data sharing. Download : Download high-res image (480KB)

    addressed and might mutually benefit from data integration. Integrating data from
    different data resources supports multiple goals specific to diverse organizations
    or projects (Oksel et al., 2015) and is a necessary precursor to deeper data mining
    to enable interdisciplinary scientific discovery, facilitate regulatory decision
    making, and provide insight into improving the properties and performance of nanomaterials.
    1.2. Importance of data integration to nanotechnology Nanomaterials (Boholm and
    Arvidsson, 2016, Rauscher et al., 2012) are becoming ubiquitous in science and
    technology (Vance et al., 2015, Xia, 2014). Biomedical researchers are making
    multifunctional nanomaterials to diagnose, target, and treat many diseases looking
    for ways to increase nanomaterial stability and optimize nanomaterial performance
    while minimizing potential negative effects (Xia, 2014). Other researchers are
    harnessing similar useful properties of nanoscale materials for a host of other
    applications ranging from energy storage to water treatment to improved mechanical
    strength and flexibility of advanced materials (Roco et al., 2011). To design
    optimal nanomaterials and predict their behaviors, researchers must use data from
    disparate, non-standardized resources across biomedical, environmental, health
    and safety, and materials science disciplines. Problems abound. Even when the
    composition of a nanomaterial is provided, the nomenclature used to describe its
    components - the base nanomaterial formulation and the material constituents (such
    as core, coat, shell, and any surface modifiers) - and the relationships among
    them is not standardized, and in many cases, are incomplete. For example, the
    surface density of “decorator” molecules on carbon nanotubes is rarely provided,
    resulting in the need for “guessing” the actual structure when preparing representative
    structure files for computational modeling (Shao et al., 2013). A variety of physical-chemical
    characterization information (such as the size, shape, purity, and surface properties)
    are included in different resources, but the methods and techniques used to perform
    the characterization are not always included in sufficient detail or standardized
    in a way that supports cross-study comparison of reported values (Stefaniak et
    al., 2013, Marchese-Robinson et al., 2016). Repositories collect and store information
    in support of their organization''s needs and goals, for which the role of nanomaterials
    data can differ considerably as indicated using the following examples. • Biomedical
    repositories focusing on the reactivity and efficacy of nanomaterials in living
    systems. • Environmental repositories with geospatial information of the fate
    of nanomaterials in the environment. • Physico-chemical repositories containing
    physical and chemical properties of nanomaterials. • Genomic and biological pathways
    repositories with information on biological structures and reactivity. These disparate
    data repositories, when integrated together, can provide greater insights into
    understanding common endpoints such as nanomaterial toxicity or stability (Izak-Nau
    et al., 2015). Because of the current lack of standardization and integration
    of resources, data users must review documentation describing the protocols for
    storing information in each repository, and sometimes retrieve and review original
    publications to determine what is and what is not relevant to their research.
    1.3. Influence of organizational purpose and goals on data integration The approaches
    taken by an organization or project to gather and organize data are governed by
    the driving scientific questions that need to be answered to further its mission.
    Some examples of use case scenarios that could benefit from multidisciplinary
    data integration are shown in Fig. 1. Data that are measured, the information
    derived from those data, and the level of detail targeted for inclusion in a resource
    are all informed by the purpose for which data are being collected (Marchese-Robinson
    et al., 2016). Examples are provided below. • Building an authoritative repository
    of nanomaterial characterizations. • Parameterizing models to predict nanomaterial
    behavior in different systems (biomedical, environmental, or other). • Enabling
    environmental and health risk assessments. • Improving performance of materials,
    medicines, or pesticides. The individual resource goals also shape the type of
    data integration of interest with each project incentivized to link with other
    data sets to increase the critical mass of data in support of its mission. Integrating
    data from different data resources supports multiple goals specific to diverse
    organizations or projects (Oksel et al., 2015). Using the example provided in
    Fig. 1, understanding which parameters control stability of a nanomedicine in
    the human bloodstream could provide insight relevant to predicting nanomaterial
    dissolution or aggregation in a body of freshwater, transport within a crop field,
    or efficacy in a material fabrication process. 1.4. Purpose and structure of this
    article The goal of this article is to capture the current state of data integration
    in nanoinformatics and provide recommendations for advancing integration within
    and outside of the nanoinformatics field. As discussed above, the integration
    of nanomaterial data with other nanomaterial data sets as well as with data from
    other fields will lead to new and exciting scientific opportunities. This article
    not only informs the nanoinformatics and nanomaterials testing communities of
    the challenges involved in data integration, but also identifies concrete actions
    that will accelerate the integration process. In addition, because much of the
    material presented herein is based on the results of a survey of most present-day
    nanomaterials data resources, the authors are confident that many of the current
    challenges are shared across the emerging communities; further, the characterization
    of the issues and the recommendations that follow position nano-communities to
    move forward towards integration, and offer insight to other still-maturing fields
    characterized by uncertainty. Following the introduction and a discussion of the
    importance of integration and the influence of organization purpose and goals
    on the current state of data integration, the article presents the results of
    a nanoinformatics community-wide stakeholder survey designed to assess the current
    practices in integrating data in nanotechnology. Stakeholder demographics are
    presented (Section 2), followed by stakeholder-identified challenges to integration
    (Section 3) and stakeholder-identified needed integration functionality (Section
    4). Section 5 describes technological and semantic approaches to achieving integration.
    Section 6 presents stakeholder recommendations for achieving integration, followed
    by an author-proposed path for moving forward (Section 7). Some closing remarks
    are provided in Section 8. 2. Stakeholder demographics To understand the current
    practices in data integration and to identify challenges and offer recommendations,
    several organizations that maintain nanomaterial data resources were surveyed.
    The goal was to identify, define, and provide a stimulus for initiating integration
    and exchange of data resources across nanomaterial data repositories and with
    other related, non-nanotechnology data resources. Survey questions included current
    and recommended functionality and web services enabling data integration as well
    as perceived challenges associated with integrating primary experimental data
    sets, or data sets curated from the literature, with other data resources. Appendix
    A contains a detailed summary of the stakeholder responses to the survey. Stakeholders
    who participated in the survey ranged from nanomaterial resources that have extensive
    experience in integrating data resources to those with limited data integration
    experience whose focus was primarily on repository development (see Table A-1).
    The diverse levels of integration capabilities provide insight into the challenges
    that need to be addressed to integrate across nanomaterial repositories and with
    other non-nanotechnology resources. A brief summary of the organizations that
    participated in the survey, which represent some of the most active participants
    in the field of nanoinformatics, follows. caNanoLab, a data sharing portal supported
    by the National Cancer Institute of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, is
    designed to facilitate information sharing across the international biomedical
    nanotechnology research community to expedite and validate the use of nanotechnology
    in biomedicine. caNanoLab provides support for the annotation of nanomaterials
    with characterizations resulting from physico-chemical, in vitro and in vivo assays
    and the sharing of these characterizations and associated nanotechnology protocols
    in a secure fashion. The Center for Environmental Implications for Nanotechnology
    (CEINT), located at Duke University (U.S.), focuses on exploring the potential
    impact of exposure to nanomaterials on ecological and biological systems. The
    Center is funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation and brings together researchers
    from several universities, the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST), the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Consumer Product Safety
    Commission (CPSC), the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), as well as other key
    domestic and international partners. CEINT supports fundamental research regarding
    the behavior of nanomaterials in laboratory studies and also in complex ecosystems.
    One of the goals of the center is to develop a web-based risk assessment tool
    that can be used to elucidate the potential risk associated with the release of
    nanomaterials into the environment. The CSSP/NIPHE, Netherlands (The Center for
    Safety of Substances and Products), National Institute for Public Health and the
    Environment (CSSP at NIHE, or RIVM) provides a data resource on eco-toxicity data
    focusing on nanoparticles in consumer products, used for modeling purposes (QSAR).
    Also of significance to integrating a broad array of nanomaterial data, RIVM hosts
    the protocols and other text documents from across the European Union (EU) Seventh
    Framework Programme 2007–2013 (FP7) NANoREG project; they collaborated with the
    FP7 eNanoMapper project (see below) that hosts the data as collected using ISA-TAB-Nano
    inspired (Thomas et al., 2013) MS Excel templates. The templates produced by the
    NANoREG project are also available (Totaro et al., 2017). (http://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC103178).
    DECHEMA is a network of experts in chemical engineering and biotechnology and
    supports several projects applicable to nanotechnology such as the DaNa project
    and the NANORA project (Kühnel et al., 2014). DaNa is a knowledgebase of applied
    nanomaterials on health and environment. The NANORA project provides web facilities
    supporting the Nano Region Alliance, an alliance that facilitates market entrance
    for nanotechnology subject matter experts. eNanoMapper was an EU-funded FP7 project
    comprising eight research and industry institutes, whose aim is to improve data
    integration and to support safe-by-design development by building up a nanosafety
    ontology and database and provide web modeling tools for use of these data. Currently
    the eNanoMapper database at (https://search.data.enanomapper.net) hosts data generated
    by several EU projects including publicly accessible NANoREG data. Tools for converting
    Excel templates into ISA-TAB/ISA-Nano JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and semantic
    formats are provided. The application programming interface facilitates data usage
    by the modeling community. The Nanomaterial Registry is a publicly-available database
    of nanomaterial characterization and biological/environmental interaction data.
    Data in the Registry are curated from niche databases, literature, catalogs, and
    reports by trained scientists. Curation is based on a set of minimal information
    about nanomaterials (Mills et al., 2014). The data of the Registry are also available
    on the Portal at nanoHUB (https://nanohub.org/) where predictive modelers can
    find the data in a format that is easy for them to use. The Nanoparticle Information
    Library (NIL) (http://nanoparticlelibrary.net/nil.html) is a prototype searchable
    data resource of nanoparticle properties and associated health and safety information
    designed to help occupational health professionals, industrial users, worker groups,
    and researchers organize and share information on nanomaterials, including their
    health and safety associated properties. It is operated by the National Institute
    for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. 3. Stakeholder-identified
    data integration challenges In the survey described above, responding nanoinformatics
    stakeholders identified several technical and operational challenges impacting
    current data integration efforts, as shown in Fig. 2. These challenges, if not
    addressed, will continue to hinder the exploitation of the scientific possibilities
    opened by linking nanomaterials data resources to one another and to data resources
    in related scientific areas such as biology, medicine, and environmental studies.
    Each challenge is presented in greater detail below. It should be noted that,
    in preparing each section that incorporates survey responses, the authors organized
    and summarized the stakeholders input to consolidate and clarify across the breadth
    of responses while attempting to maintain the intent and keep as much of the verbiage
    provided as possible. Download : Download high-res image (439KB) Download : Download

    3.1. Data are in different formats and use different (or no) common vocabularies
    or ontologies The primary challenge in achieving data integration in nanotechnology
    is the diversity of ways in which nanomaterial information is represented across
    data resources and the lack of standardization to a common model that represents
    nanomaterial entities, their attributes, and relationships. These issues include
    multiple meanings for the same word (or abbreviation) and different words (or
    abbreviations) having the same meaning. For example, cytotoxicity can have different
    specific meanings when different bioassays were used to measure it. Similarly,
    examples of synonyms with the same meaning are also abundant. For example, ZnO
    and zinc oxide are common ways of referring to the same chemical. Developing appropriate
    ontologies, including resolution of terminology conflicts, to address the nuances
    of nanotechnology research is a critical and important key to achieving integration
    (Thomas et al., 2011a, Thomas et al., 2011b, Hastings et al., 2011). 3.2. Lack
    of unique identifiers for the entities in the domain Certain aspects of data integration
    pertaining to semantics, or judgments of meaning, remain challenging regardless
    of the specific domain, and regardless of the thoroughness of the supporting ontology.
    For example, interpretation can become ambiguous in deciding when entities (e.g.
    nanomaterials, cells, samples, people, etc.) in different data contexts should
    be mapped as “the same” or “different” (e.g. if their names have narrower or broader
    meanings). Clear guidance for utilizing ontologies and tools must accompany their
    development to stave off differences introduced by end-user judgment; consider,
    for example, the difference between the Nano Particle Ontology terms for titanium
    dioxide (NPO_1485) and titanium oxide nanoparticle (NPO_1486). The NPO terms are
    intentionally distinct to distinguish between a compound and a nanoparticle and
    enable semantic integration of data sets. However, without consistent guidance
    or built-in tools, a user might potentially select either one. The inherent freedom
    of interpretation in an ontology without associated guidance tools can diminish
    the confidence in combined data and impact the ability to perform cross-material
    comparisons. Other scientific fields have introduced naming conventions for generating
    unique identifiers based on metadata. The prevalence of informal terminology and
    the lack of a strong business case to create more formal conventions, however,
    make this challenging in the nanoscience area. Fields such as genomics are moving
    forward with generating a Universal Unique Identifier (UUID) for entities not
    based on metadata. In the context of nanomaterial data resource integration, needed
    metadata might include the results of physico-chemical characterization required
    to establish whether the nanomaterials are “the same” or “sufficiently similar”
    to be matched during data integration. However, the question of which physico-chemical
    properties need to match (Stefaniak et al., 2013), not to mention complexities
    associated with different measurement techniques and experimental protocols, make
    uniquely identifying and matching nanomaterials a significant scientific challenge.
    Further discussion of metadata (including batch identifiers) that could support
    unique identification and matching of nanomaterial database records is provided
    in an earlier article in the NDCI series (Marchese-Robinson et al., 2016). 3.3.
    Data are conceptualized in different ways In conceptualizing data models, both
    definitions of individual data elements and the relationships between them can
    be created. As a result, data models created for different purposes or different
    database owners may have the same data elements but with different relationships
    between them. There has been a trend away from establishing a fixed relationship,
    such as a hierarchy, between database elements, a trend that, in some regards,
    adds to the data mining challenge. Sometimes knowledge of the relationships between
    attributes is built into the establishment of a hierarchy and that knowledge can
    be extracted when mining a database to ensure that data are appropriately aggregated
    when performing statistical analyses. Often times, databases are designed to support
    searching, but not specifically to support mining. In these types of databases,
    measurements are sometimes stored in replicate so that they can be found in different
    types of searches. If the seemingly replicated measurements are not handled correctly
    during analysis, they can lead to bias in statistical computations. 3.4. Information
    that should be maintained as multiple individual fields is maintained in one field
    Integration of data can be hampered by differences in data granularity. A common
    issue is that information in one repository may be stored in one “field”, but
    be split into multiple “fields” in another repository. Additionally, in some repositories,
    numerical data are stored without a separate unit “field”. For example, some repositories
    use a field name such as “Concentration” and expect the user to know that the
    result is always in a specific unit, such as “mg/L”. In other cases, a measured
    result is combined with a unit and stored together in the same field (e.g. 5 mg/L),
    or included as a range of values in one field (e.g. 7–10 mg/L). 3.5. Lack of publicly
    available web services for data retrieval Integration is often hindered by the
    lack of publicly available web services supporting data retrieval. Without publicly
    available web services, each user must individually create data retrieval tools
    every time a data resource is to be integrated. Additionally, even when data services
    are provided, open frameworks such as the Representational State Transfer framework
    (REST) (Fielding and Taylor, 2000) are not leveraged to ease development of integration
    touchpoints. 3.6. Data across organizations has varying levels of quality and
    completeness A key challenge for nanoinformatics is finding data that are sufficiently
    complete and of acceptable quality. At times, data from external resources are
    not integrated with local systems due to concerns regarding the quality and completeness
    of those data. For example, a local knowledgebase can implement a screening procedure
    that carefully selects high quality data from the scientific literature; data
    from publications not meeting the specific quality criteria are deemed unsuitable
    and are not curated into the knowledgebase. When evaluating external data for
    inclusion in the knowledgebase, if they do not come with an indicator or ranking
    of the reliability of those data, and if the ranking is not in line with the screening
    procedure used by the curators, it is difficult to determine if and how those
    data should be incorporated. Lack of data completeness also poses a challenge
    to data integration because it is often difficult to obtain the necessary metadata
    to support comparison (a prerequisite for matching and data integration) between
    material records in different databases. For example, when obtaining information
    on physico-chemical characterization, it is valuable to have information on the
    chemical composition of the nanomaterials, such as the presence/absence of coatings,
    and if the nanomaterial has been transformed. Lack of complete metadata for associated
    biological tests may affect the clarity, and hence quality, of results (Klimisch
    et al., 1997) and could preclude an assessment of whether two sets of results
    were generated under sufficiently similar conditions to allow them to be meaningfully
    integrated. The lack of proper particle characterization is a key problem (Krug,
    2014), and the consequence is that often a database contains more blank fields
    (no information) than actual data. This lack of high quality and complete data
    sets discourages integration. Though no system of characterizing quality or completeness
    has been broadly adopted, relative evaluation approaches have been proposed, including
    the NNI Data Readiness Level framework, as modeled from technology readiness assessment
    methods https://www.nano.gov//NKIPortal/DRLs. A thorough discussion of the challenges
    associated with assessing the completeness and quality of nanomaterial data was
    presented in an earlier paper in the NDCI series (Marchese-Robinson et al., 2016).
    3.7. Limitations in the experimental research There are limitations in the experimental
    research process, such as biological variance, uniform characterization, and technological
    and methodological constraints. One major challenge related to data quality and
    completeness is defining the minimum data requirements for integration (which
    often depends on the research question to be addressed by the resulting integrated
    data set). The continuing evolution of knowledge of the important independent
    variables that must be controlled to make a measurement or assay accurate and
    reproducible can change these data requirements. As is customary in science, it
    takes time for new scientific insights to reach every lab, and as with any novel
    field, nanotechnology is evolving and maturing. This maturing process is evident
    in the nanosafety field as well as in bioinformatics; the first generation of
    results may not be optimal, but they must be used as a basis for improvement or
    the field will not progress. Another major challenge in nanoinformatics is that
    researchers are continuing to refine measurement techniques, which could change
    the comparability of measure results over time. These kinds of issues are related
    to the concepts of data quality and completeness, which were discussed, along
    with recommendations for progress, in the NDCI series (Marchese-Robinson et al.,
    2016). 3.8. Lack of usable documentation The available documentation for external
    resources often just introduces the resource and provides instructions for its
    use, but does not convey adequate information to understand the conceptualization
    behind the database design nor cover the data selection process. A commonly accepted
    minimum documentation standard is needed. 3.9. Protection of intellectual property
    hinders data sharing Although data sharing encourages the public to use and exploit
    knowledge contained in a database, restrictions may be in place to protect intellectual
    property rights and investments in generating and updating database content. Often,
    these restrictions have unclear statements regarding ownership, copyright, and
    licensing. Researchers are sometimes reluctant to share data until they are completely
    done analyzing and reporting their results out of fear that others will take their
    data and use it in a way that limits or reduces the novelty of their work (Reichman
    et al., 2011). Some have even suggested that those performing analysis on data
    they had no role in generating are “research parasites” (Longo and Drazen, 2016).
    The need to maintain “unique selling points” of a data resource can impede data
    sharing. One solution to overcome this challenge is to provide a web service with
    restricted access in support of data retrieval while maintaining a customized
    interface to maintain unique characteristics of the resource. 3.10. Lack of project
    funding Individual projects to build data resources and repositories usually do
    not have funding allocated to data integration. Furthermore, it is not clear which
    people in the management and funding chain are the correct contacts for expanding
    a project scope to include integration. This is also a primary constraint for
    driving standardization towards a common model. The funding issues extend beyond
    the necessity to win monetary support that is shared by all research endeavors
    because these projects can often be seen as investments in infrastructure or tools
    and are thus perceived to fall outside the purview of basic science funding. Data
    projects, however, are significant exploratory investigations into scientific
    questions and not just IT projects. Data resources are a major future source of
    scientific knowledge, and integration across numerous sources expands research
    opportunities. 4. Stakeholder-identified functionality needed to enable data integration
    To make progress on data integration, the key challenges noted above must be addressed
    through individual and collective activities. Stakeholders identified a number
    of critical functionalities and web services that are needed to enable data integration
    across nanomaterial repositories. Stakeholders also identified use-case-driven
    integration needs with non-nanotechnology resources. 4.1. Use of shared controlled
    vocabularies To integrate across resources, each resource needs to either adopt
    shared controlled vocabularies or be able to map to agreed-upon standards; see
    for example (ASTM ASTM Standard E2456, 2006, ISO, T, 2007). When mapping between
    controlled vocabularies, it is important to fully document the mappings and develop
    tools to assist in the mapping and transformation of data. Although tool development
    to automate mapping of terms and schemas requires significant work, time is saved
    in the long run as standards evolve. Adoption of a common language is important,
    as well as using open standards for data exchange. 4.2. Data search and retrieval
    by ontological terms Most nanomaterial resources support basic search and retrieval
    by nanomaterial, characterization, protocol, and publication. To facilitate search
    and retrieval across resources, it is necessary for resources to support searching
    by ontological terms (Gruber, 1995). A more detailed discussion of ontologies
    and how they contain more than just a controlled vocabulary is provided by Thomas
    and others (Thomas et al., 2011a, Thomas et al., 2011b, Hastings et al., 2011).
    Additionally, search capability should support retrieval of data (e.g. primary
    nanomaterial characteristics) across each nanomaterial resource and retrieval
    of detailed information, e.g. study endpoints applicable to the resource, from
    the same source on. For example, in the case of toxicity data, it is necessary
    to support retrieval of particle fate characteristics during testing as well as
    information on the test medium. eNanoMapper''s search system allows searching
    using ontologies, taking into account synonyms. The demonstration server at https://search.data.enanomapper.net/
    allows simultaneous searching over data collected by eNanoMapper and by caNanoLab,
    as well as NANoREG data. The site also offers integrated searching over data from
    several past FP7 projects for H2020 NanoReg2 project partners. 4.3. User friendly
    web-based data submission forms Nanomaterial resources should provide user friendly
    tools supporting the submission of data on nanomaterials, characterizations, protocols,
    and publications via web-based forms. These forms should constrain data entry
    by requiring use of a controlled vocabulary. 4.4. Data import and export tools
    Resources should provide support for the validation, import, and export of data
    in standard data file formats such as ISA-TAB-Nano (Thomas et al., 2013, Marchese-Robinson
    et al., 2015; ASTM Standard E2909, 2013), which allows data to be exported from
    one data resource directly into another. It is understood that the development
    of such tools would require a significant amount of work for resources not currently
    supporting standards like ISA-TAB-Nano. 4.5. Tools to analyze and visualize data
    Data analysis and visualization tools within and across nanomaterial resources
    will facilitate cross-material comparisons. Visualizing nanomaterials in 3D and
    displaying scatter plots and distribution plots across data would assist in optimizing
    nanomaterial design. Analytic tools need to support the work of many disciplines,
    including chemistry, biology, toxicology, medicine, and physics. 4.6. Data modeling
    tools Data modeling tools assist in predicting nanomaterial behavior in different
    biological and environment systems. The integration of nanomaterial resources
    with data modeling tools requires that each resource provide access to sufficiently
    high quality and complete data sets in a format supported by modeling tools. 4.7.
    Facilities for rating data sets for data quality and completeness Prior to integrating
    with an existing nanomaterial resource, it is important to understand the data
    quality and completeness of the resource. Facilities that rate data for completeness
    or quality, or both, can assist in providing this assessment. Approaches could
    include rating against minimum information as well as feedback from users who
    try to reproduce those data. However, assessing data completeness and quality
    is decidedly non-trivial. A thorough examination of this issue is presented in
    another article in the NDCI series (Marchese-Robinson et al., 2016). 4.8. Data
    annotations It is important that data are clearly annotated with statements such
    as possible provenance, including ownership and licensing or rights waiving where
    applicable. Understandably, data can be proprietary and, if so, should be clearly
    marked as proprietary. The use of resources, such as ZENODO (https://zenodo.org/)
    and FigShare (https://figshare.com/), which allow users to assign a specific license
    to their research data, is arguably indicative of a growing awareness of the importance
    of clarity regarding rights to data usage within the scientific community. These
    resources, however, do not support the application of automated data integration
    techniques (Wilkinson et al., 2016). In addition to annotations on data provenance,
    data annotations can also be provided to further clarify the quality of the data.
    4.9. Web services needed to enable data integration across nanomaterial data repositories
    Stakeholders supporting the use of nanotechnology in the biomedicine and the nanosafety
    communities indicated that the biomedical community needs common web services
    supporting the exchange of nanomaterials, characterizations, protocols, and publications
    in support of cross-material comparison. By integrating with other nanomaterial
    repositories supporting biomedicine and with other data resources from environmental
    and health fields, the biomedical community hopes to better predict the bio-distribution
    and toxicity of nanomaterials in model organisms, including humans. Additionally,
    the biomedical community would like to obtain detailed information on the investigation,
    studies, and assays based on the metadata identified as part of the ISA-TAB standard.
    To support such data integration, ISA-TAB and ISA-TAB-Nano Application Programming
    Interfaces (APIs) that retrieve entities based on the ISA-TAB and ISA-TAB-Nano
    JSON schemas (https://github.com/ISA-tools) have been developed. (N.B.: previously
    ISA-TAB and ISA-TAB-Nano data sets have been represented using tab-delimited text
    fields (Sansone et al., 2008, Marchese-Robinson et al., 2015). The nanosafety
    community has many interests and covers many different scientific domains. Of
    special interest at this time are web services that meet two essential needs:
    determination of the similarity between two nanomaterials and locating all data
    and information associated with one published paper or with a specific experimental
    protocol. Common web services envisaged by these stakeholders as being needed
    to support integration of nanomaterial data in the biomedical nanotechnology and
    nanosafety domains are presented in Table 1. Table 1. Common web services envisaged
    by nanoinformatics stakeholders, as reported in the survey, as being needed to
    support integration of nanomaterial data in the biomedical nanotechnology and
    nanosafety domains. Web service method Description Creation of an identifier Creates

    “Find the most similar structure in database X” 4.10. Needs for integrating nanotechnology
    data repositories with non-nanotechnology resources Stakeholders also identified
    a variety of non-nanotechnology resources that must be accessed to support use
    case driven data integration needs; these are summarized in Table 2. Table 2.
    Non-nanotechnology resources needed to support use case driving data integration.

    Databases Life science and chemistry databases in general, containing information
    about human biology (both experimental data, as well as knowledgebases) and chemistry

    or other image modalities of subjects in which nanomaterials are used for diagnostic
    and/or therapeutic purposes; a “public domain” image archive illustrating images
    used in articles (e.g. SEM pictures), would assist in visualizing particle characterizations

    Sigma Aldrich to obtain information on chemicals used in nanomaterial compositions;
    integrate with small molecule repositories like DrugBank (Knox et al., 2011) to
    compare a small molecule (e.g. magnevist) with a nanomaterial formulation that
    associates with the small molecule (e.g. dendrimer magnevist complex) Modeling

    with modeling and simulation tools will assist in modeling the effects of nanomaterial

    such as R (https://www.r-project.org/, an environment for statistical computing),
    and Bioconductor (Gentleman et al., 2004), Data-Driven Documents https://d3js.org/
    and other tools to analyze and visualize nanomaterial data in support of nanomaterial
    comparisons Ontology/Taxonomy Resources To obtain an up-to-date database of ontologies
    in a table-type format so that one can easily review them. This includes resources
    such as the NCI Thesaurus http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/NCI_Thesaurus (Sioutos et
    al., 2007), BioPortal http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ (Noy et al., 2009), and
    Ontobee http://www.ontobee.org/. This will allow databases to link to term references
    and accession numbers. (N.B.: as discussed above, ontology annotations support
    data integration. Hence integration of two resources with ontology terms supports
    wider integration. 5. Data integration approaches A variety of approaches to data
    integration exist, with new ones continuing to be developed, supported by technologies
    ranging from manual integration (e.g. via an Excel spreadsheet) to a federated
    search architecture based on semantic web technologies (http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/)
    (Cheung et al., 2009, Eyres, 2013). It is beyond the scope of this paper to provide
    a comprehensive review of these approaches. Instead, approaches that best facilitate
    the retrieval of integrated data via automated queries (e.g. through data query
    languages such as SQL or SPARQL (Hartig and Langegger, 2010)) are discussed. Nonetheless,
    it is important to note that given the preference of many scientists to work in
    Excel, tools that allow for automated integration of manually prepared Excel data
    sets into queryable databases are of considerable value (e.g. https://github.com/enanomapper/nmdataparser).
    5.1. Data integration technology The extremes of the spectrum with regard to selecting
    an architecture that supports data integration through automatic querying are
    provided below (Doan et al., 2012). • Data warehousing – an approach that loads
    the content of different data resources into the same physical database. Subsequently
    the “warehouse” database can be queried, which involves querying all loaded data
    resources concurrently, with results presented to the user. • Federated querying
    – an approach that sends the same query to different data resources at their original
    locations and presents the results to the user in a unified view after they are
    received. The data warehouse paradigm accomplishes the integration by transforming
    all the data resources into a physical schema (i.e. tables and relationships for
    relational databases, or XML schema, etc.). The federated query approach relies
    on a “mediated schema” (i.e., a virtual schema, embedded in the application),
    which does not store any data, but presents to the user a unified view of the
    domain across resources. The integration itself relies on how the different attributes
    of the mediated schema match the attributes of the resources, and if the grouping
    of the attributes corresponds to similar groupings of attributes in the data resources.
    This is known as “semantic mapping” and is the hardest task within the integration.
    The technology for accessing the data resources can be the same for both approaches.
    The data warehouse approach may use extract-transform-load (ETL) procedures, connecting
    to external data resources via web services and loading the results into the warehouse,
    while federated querying can use wrappers for accessing several distinct databases
    residing on the same machine and combine results only when presenting them to
    the user. Hence, a web service is a method for accessing the data, but its use
    does not imply anything about the data integration paradigm after data retrieval.
    The emergence of new technologies has repeatedly changed technical approaches
    to data integration. While paradigms based on central data platforms still predominate
    (Williams et al., 2012, Maglott et al., 2005), the wider data integration community
    often use a more distributed, more-easily scalable cloud platform (Samwald et
    al., 2011, Jupp et al., 2014) and other methods, based upon federated search approaches
    (Cheung et al., 2009, Eyres, 2013). Additionally, between the two extremes of
    data warehousing and federated query, hybrid architectures exist that combine
    elements of both pure data warehousing and federated querying. 5.2. Semantic issues
    in data integration The choice of integration architecture depends not only on
    technological approaches, but also on the best approach for addressing semantic
    issues. In selecting an approach, the following two questions must be considered.
    • How can/will entities be matched across data resources? • How will query results
    be integrated into coherent answers? Regardless of the integration approach, all
    methods require entity matching (linking associated information based on database
    content), or schema mapping (virtually altering the schema of one database so
    that its content can be queried with data from a database with a different schema),
    or both mapping techniques. Mapping is typically performed using transformation
    procedures, and there may not exist a simple one-to-one mapping between the final
    schema and the original data resources. This is especially true in scientific
    and technological disciplines in which very complex concepts (entities) have been
    modeled differently by different groups at different times, a situation exacerbated
    by the evolution of new knowledge constantly being developed. A key requirement
    for an integration effort is having a network of schema mapping algorithms, based
    on individual data and metadata identifiers, that crosslink content from different
    data resources. In disciplines close to nanotechnology, efforts such as http://identifiers.org/
    (Juty et al., 2012) unify how these identifiers are represented, and other resources
    provide solutions for mapping identifiers from different databases (van Iersel
    et al., 2010, Chambers et al., 2014, Wohlgemuth et al., 2010). Identifiers, however,
    typically focus on entities studied, such as chemicals, materials, genes, and
    proteins. Identifiers for cell lines, assays, and other key entities involved
    in nanosafety data are less common, though ontologies commonly provide identifiers
    for them (Hastings et al., 2011, Thomas et al., 2011b, Hastings et al., 2015a).
    Developing mapping algorithms has traditionally been done manually; however, active
    research is producing tools for automatic schema mapping and record linkage by
    deterministic, probabilistic, and machine learning methods (Christen, 2012). In
    the case of unstructured data resources (e.g. text), the workflow first performs
    data extraction and entity recognition and then proceeds with the mapping. The
    challenge, of course, is that mapping entities for complex scientific subjects
    can be very difficult, even for experts. For example, the concept “percentage
    cumulative mortality,” which may be reported in different ways depending on the
    experimental time course and time of observation, can require post-processing
    of retrieved data (Kovrižnych et al., 2013, Truong et al., 2011). 5.3. Data integration
    in scientific fields closely related to nanotechnology Solutions to data integration
    problems in nanotechnology can be informed by practices developed for use in other
    scientific disciplines. Specifically, semantic issues encountered in other fields
    are similar to those experienced in the nanoinformatics community, and the types
    of organizations and individuals interested in data integration are also similar.
    Integration efforts in three closely related fields are described below. 5.3.1.
    Integrating small molecule chemical databases As in nanoinformatics, the major
    challenge in integrating small molecule chemical data resources is the determination
    of the equivalency of the composition and structure of two small molecule entities.
    In the case of small molecule chemicals, the entities are the chemical structures,
    and the IUPAC International Chemical Identifier, InChI, (http://www.inchi-trust.org)
    (Heller et al., 2015) can be used as a uniform identifier across databases. When
    performing integration, the rule for entity matching is, “if the search results
    returned include one and the same Standard InChI, then the results are for the
    same compound”. Several complexities must be considered when matching based on
    an InChI. For example, small molecule chemicals may be considered the same, yet
    still have different InChIs due to their rapidly interconverting structures. While
    InChIs are designed to be invariant to different ways of representing chemicals
    based on small molecular structures, including taking into account tautomeric
    forms which are expected to rapidly equilibrate, they cannot account for all differences
    in chemical structure that may readily interconvert in practice - such as differences
    in protonation state or between open-and-closed ring forms that can equilibrate
    for sugars in solution. If non-standard InChIs are used, the situation is further
    complicated; indeed, if the so-called “perception options” are employed, different
    “standard” InChIs may be generated for the same input structure (Heller et al.,
    2015). Regardless, integration of small molecule chemical data resources based
    on matching their standard InChIs is currently viewed as best practice and may
    be combined with other software tools to enforce further standardization of chemical
    structures that may facilitate desired matching (Hersey et al., 2015). The development
    of a single, comprehensive identifier for nanomaterials, similar to InChI, is
    an attractive prospect, though the size, complexity, and requisite three-dimensional
    nature of nanomaterials indicate many challenges for this approach. 5.3.2. Integrating
    biomolecular databases The integration of biomolecular databases has faced a number
    of complex problems, such as mapping things that are related but not identical
    and mapping things that are similar but not identical. Extending the single identifier
    approach to more complicated structures (e.g. proteins and genes), requires expanding
    queries to handle all possible synonyms used within different databases. This
    is difficult because the nomenclature for biomolecules is still not totally standardized.
    However, some success has been achieved in establishing a common API for a given
    type of resource, facilitating integration by alleviating the need for schema
    matching. Essentially, the API defines a common schema and if all resources of
    the same kind are compliant with the API, the main burden of semantic mapping
    is met. An example of implementation of this approach in the genomics field is
    the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Data Working Group (http://ga4gh.org/#/),
    which is establishing common web services in support of genomic data integration
    and exchange. Web services using the REST framework (Fielding and Taylor, 2000)
    are provided with query requests and responses formatted using the JSON. The common
    web services allow the genomics community to exchange reads, variants, and reference
    information, provided all data resources follow the API specification. The need
    for such protocols is essential as modeling data integration approaches to capture
    cytotoxicity effects are now emerging (Kohonen et al., 2017). The implementation
    of a central data warehouse that aggregates data from several resources requires
    ETL processes to assist in aggregating and transforming data based on matching
    rules. Data are typically transformed into a common data model (e.g. relational
    database or a triple store); examples of this approach are PubChem (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
    and ChEMBL (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) databases. The Open PHACTS project
    (https://www.openphacts.org/) provides a common API to a variety of pharmacological
    data sets. It does not, however, normalize to a single data model, but addresses
    non-uniformity at the API level (Williams et al., 2012). The European Bioinformatics
    Institute Resource Description Framework (EBI-RDF) platform uses another approach,
    maintaining multiple RDF repositories for different resources and allowing federated
    searching across all of them (Jupp et al., 2014). Entities in the EBI-RDF platform
    are assigned equivalent identifiers, with identifiers.org service providing mappable
    URIs, which is essentially implementing the mapping between the distributed resources.
    5.3.3. Integrating public life sciences databases Life sciences data resources
    provide further insight into the handling of integration of complex data inherent
    in living biological systems. In these systems, additional complexity is added
    by the large number of variables needed to fully characterize a living system.
    The Syngenta federated search system (Eyres, 2013) is an example of addressing
    the challenge of integrating internal company data with public life science databases.
    The system has moved from data warehousing (even if that offers faster reporting)
    towards federated search technologies. The architecture includes several internal
    relational database repositories, translated into RDF dynamically via D2RQ (http://d2rq.org/),
    and provides adapters in order to combine all internal and external data resources
    into a distributed SPARQL endpoint. The implementation of this federated architecture
    for data integration was found to offer clear benefits to Syngenta''s multidisciplinary
    researchers, even when the questions driving their research were different. Other
    similar resources include Ontoforce (http://www.ontoforce.com/) and Euretos (http://www.euretos.com/).
    5.4. Data integration lessons for nanoinformatics Hopefully, the power of integration
    demonstrated in closely-related fields will stimulate interest in the nanoinformatics
    community to start significant integration projects. Steps towards integration
    could begin with developing an understanding of the minimum set of data needed
    to support integration. The minimum data set will likely vary from resource to
    resource based on the driving purpose of the resource. It has been suggested that
    a method for capturing minimum data requirements by resource (e.g. MIAME for microarray
    data (Brazma et al., 2001)) provides a greater understanding of data requirements.
    It must be noted that often more information is needed for full data integration
    than the amount contained in the minimum data requirements. One possible candidate
    for such a metadata resource is the FAIRsharing platform (https://fairsharing.org/)
    (Field et al., 2009). Further discussion of data and metadata requirements and
    their explicit documentation via minimum information checklists is presented in
    an earlier NDCI article (Marchese-Robinson et al., 2016). Linking data enables
    data integration; by integrating data sets, data comparisons are enabled. Linking
    does not, of course, provide the definitions needed for data to be compared, or
    even which data can be connected. Decoupling data integration into two steps,
    linkage and comparison, allows formalization of a hypothesis into a query. For
    example, consider the linkage of two nanomaterial data resources, one containing
    clinical data and the other embryonic zebrafish toxicity data. Identifying records
    across both resources as being related to the “same” nanomaterial allows for a
    hypothesis (e.g. “toxicity towards embryonic zebrafish is of clinical relevance”)
    (Harper et al., 2008) to be converted into a query (e.g. “report all nanomaterials
    where high toxicity with respect to embryonic zebrafish corresponds to a high
    toxicity in a clinical setting, as a fraction of all nanomaterials with both kinds
    of data”), which compares data retrieved for two endpoints for the same nanomaterial.
    This approach becomes increasingly powerful if links are made between entities
    (e.g. nanomaterials), even if they are not identical, but show the same chemical
    or biological characterization for endpoints of interest, i.e. are functionally
    equivalent (basically the difference between “the same” and “a close match”) (see
    Table 3). Table 3. Levels of equivalence. The equivalence strengths are meant
    to indicate how data are intended to be combined and do not specify why they should
    be linked in that manner. Equivalence strength Semantic equivalence Description
    Example Strong Web Ontology Language (OWL) “same as” Two nanomaterials that share
    the same properties: all properties for one are valid for the other; moreover,
    if one nanomaterial is the “same as” other nanomaterials, the others are equally
    strong (transitivity). A nanomaterial reported in a journal article for which
    information is compiled in two databases Moderate Simple Knowledge Organization
    System (SKOS) “close match” Two nanomaterials are said to be the “same” only for
    a certain specified application; this match is never transitive Two nanomaterials
    from the same production batch, in which the application ignores intra-batch variation
    Weak SKOS “related match” Two nanomaterials are merely linked together, with an
    undefined similarity Two nanomaterials from the Joint Research Centre – Health,
    Consumers & Reference Materials Directorate – with the same vendor identifiers.
    While having the same identifier, they might not be functionally equivalent, depending
    upon the extent to which the endpoints of interest were affected by aging, etc.
    (Izak-Nau et al., 2015) A formalization of this approach in terms of Semantic
    Web technologies has been recently proposed through the introduction of lenses
    that allow users to turn on and off such equivalents based on which links they
    deem suited for their research question (Batchelor et al., 2014, Brenninkmeijer
    et al., 2012). This approach merges the worlds of ontologies and data by using
    Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs), such as those found in the set
    of Semantic Web technologies (Berners-Lee et al., 2001, Marshall et al., 2012).
    The Open PHACTS project has taken this approach and developed an Identifier Mapping
    Service (IMS) that links databases using IRI-based identifiers (Batchelor et al.,
    2014). Services such as identifiers.org and the IMS itself provide routes to convert
    between alphanumeric identifiers (e.g. CHEBI:33128) and IRI-based identifiers
    (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:33128) as defined in the
    ChEBI ontology (Hastings et al., 2015b). Once these links are operational, allowing
    comparison of data for a set of similar or identical materials, the cross-comparison
    can be used for automated data curation. During curation, automated comparisons
    could be enabled to automatically generate warnings that point the user towards
    other studies reported in other data sources that contradict those being curated.
    Assuming the linking and subsequent steps leading to the generation of such a
    warning are correct, the linking could allow researchers of an earlier study to
    be automatically notified that new related data have been added to the database.
    These advances in data integration are directly applicable for nanoinformatics
    and also enable a variety of research goals to be achieved that are specific to
    a particular organization. 6. Stakeholder recommendations for advancement in nanoinformatics
    To assist in providing guidance to the nanotechnology community, stakeholders
    (in the survey discussed in Section 2) provided recommendations for furthering
    the integration and exchange of data sets across nanomaterial resources. Recommendations
    centered on the development of pilot projects supporting data integration and
    the establishment of a global alliance in nanotechnology for standardizing data
    formats and web services. 6.1. Obtain commitment to integration from funding bodies
    and from active project leadership Stakeholders expressed the opinion that the
    only way to achieve integration effectively is to take the steps listed below.
    1. Be committed to integration. 2. Have the funding in place to complete the effort.
    3. Get the right people (i.e. hands-on developers and nanomaterial experimental
    experts) together to work through details of conceptual design and controlled
    vocabulary. 4. Continue fostering a commitment to maximum possible transparency
    and community-wide sharing of approaches, intentions, and techniques. Despite
    the current competitive funding situation, the nanoinformatics community must
    work together to maximize what funding resources are available. This good faith
    collaboration is the necessary key to making enough progress to achieve the momentum
    needed for long-term success. 6.2. Initiate pilot integration projects Initiating
    pilot projects in data source integration efforts is critical. As it stands, individual
    data resources are funded for individual purposes and finding resources to devote
    to collaboration and interoperability can be difficult. Based on the U.S. National
    Nanotechnology Initiative''s signature initiative for a knowledge infrastructure
    (Roco, 2011), there is already a documented need for collaborative resources.
    Stakeholders clearly believe now is the time to fund pilot collaborative projects
    focused on data integration. To foster a better understanding of the data life
    cycle and to be successful in developing meaningful plans for moving forward with
    existing and new knowledge management resources, these projects must be multidisciplinary
    and include ontology designers, experimental researchers, and predictive modelers.
    6.3. Establish a Global Alliance in Nanotechnology (GAIN) to develop integration
    standards Similar to the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) established
    by the genomics community, the nanotechnology community should form an organization
    to develop integration standards. A Global Alliance in Nanotechnology (GAIN) would
    provide the critical mass of interest and commitment necessary to support such
    development. The first steps of the GAIN would include: developing a common model
    for representing data and data relationships, creating a standard data dictionary,
    and establishing web service specifications needed to enable integration. 6.4.
    Focus on providing high quality and complete data sets in data repositories to
    encourage integration Individual resources should recognize the importance of
    providing high quality and sufficiently complete data, rather than simply focusing
    on providing large amounts of data, especially if the data quality is suspect.
    Assessing data quality, however, is a complex issue as is the related topic of
    data completeness. It should also be recognized that the requirements for data
    to be considered complete and the degree of quality required may be contingent
    upon the intended purpose of the data. The extent to which different data resources
    may have legitimately different definitions of data completeness, based upon their
    different objectives, underscores the importance of nanoinformatics data resource
    developers collectively recognizing the value of data integration and the need
    to ensure the necessary data and metadata required to support integration are
    documented (Marchese-Robinson et al., 2016). 6.5. Implement data stewardship Data
    stewardship, the management and ownership of data assets in an organization, such
    that the data are easily available and of necessary quality and consistency, should
    be central to any nanomaterial project. Good stewardship requires that all researchers
    involved in the project actively participate throughout the process, from beginning
    to conclusion. This effort involves experimental design, data management planning
    (including planning for data sharing and adoption of scientific methods in handling
    data), data citation, and more. Stewardship implies setting aside resources for
    these tasks. Some will be monetary resources (e.g. for cloud storage, data hosting,
    possibly commercial support in making data available in community formats), but
    other actions should be a core part of the daily research of all the people involved
    in the project. Postponing planning for data handling, retrievability, and storage
    inevitably jeopardizes good stewardship and increases costs substantially (Wilkinson
    et al., 2016). 7. Authors'' recommendations: a path forward for achieving data
    integration across nanomaterial resources and with non-nanotechnology repositories
    Taking into consideration the needs and recommendations of the nanoinformatics
    stakeholders, a multi-step path forward to achieving meaningful progress in integrating
    nanomaterial data resources is proposed. The phases identified in Fig. 3 provide
    a roadmap towards integration. Each phase is discussed in greater detail below.

    authors'' experience with multi-partner projects in Europe and the United States,
    the authors recommend the nanoinformatics community establish a multi-stakeholder,
    multi-disciplinary, international group focused on nanotechnology data integration.
    As described above, this envisioned group, referred to here as the Global Alliance
    in Nanotechnology (GAIN) would provide the visibility and energy needed to start
    the process towards meaningful data integration in nanoinformatics. The GAIN could
    be an independent group or part of an existing working group such as the U.S.
    Nano WG https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/icr/nanotechnology+working+group or the
    NSC (Savolainen et al., 2013) focused on achieving data integration goals. The
    advantage of having a group such as the GAIN is that the synergy and diversity
    of data resources necessary to test integration approaches would be present. For
    example, the breadth of nanomaterials entities (see Phase 1 below) would be rich
    enough so models developed would encompass relevant domains. In the stakeholder
    survey, all stakeholders agreed to participate in a Global Alliance pending availability
    of funding and time. Active groups include the stakeholders previously identified
    plus the NanoSafety Cluster (NSC, http://nanosafetycluster.eu/) Databases Working
    Group (along with participation in other NSC working groups), the US-EU Communities
    of Research working group on Databases and Computational Modeling for NanoEHS
    (https://us-eu.org/communities-of-research/overview/), and the US Nano WG, the
    CODATA/VAMAS Working Group developing the Uniform Description System for Nanomaterials
    (http://www.codata.org/nanomaterials) (Rumble et al., 2014). Alliances among these
    organizations can be strengthened to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort across
    the broader community with the primary objective of supporting and enabling concrete
    open source projects around ontologies, nanoinformatics tools, and data integration.
    7.2. Phase 1: design of a common model that identifies nanomaterial entities and
    their relationships within existing resources One of the first tasks for an organization
    such as the GAIN would be the development of a common model that identifies nanomaterial
    entities and their relationships. It is recommended that the common model provide
    a flexible structure that can more readily be changed as the model evolves. The
    design of the common model would prioritize identifying components that cross
    multiple fields, such as nanomaterial composition and physico-chemical characterizations
    (Stefaniak et al., 2013). Concepts from ISA-TAB-Nano and other ontologies and
    description systems can be leveraged to represent entities associated with investigations,
    studies, assays, and materials. It is important to note that this common model
    is not envisaged as a single, authoritative, federated cyberinfrastructure to
    facilitate integration in an automated manner. Instead, this model is intended
    to provide a centralized community-wide understanding of the nanoinformatics space,
    capturing an overview of the data types implicated, and providing insight into
    where it makes sense to dedicate resources towards detailed integration projects
    and tools. 7.3. Phase 2: design specifications for web services that implement
    the common model Once the common model is established, specifications for common
    web services can be developed, including defining service endpoints based on entities
    in the common model. Web service specification should be prioritized to focus
    on basic queries to retrieve nanomaterial data sorted by nanomaterial characteristics
    and other properties. Web services can be further expanded to accommodate use-case-dependent
    data exchange with non-nanotechnology resources. In support of data exchanges
    with these resources, established interfaces could be published and organizations
    could collaborate with resource providers to develop a common interface that facilitates
    re-use. 7.4. Phase 3: implementation of web services through pilot projects Once
    an initial web service is designed, pilot projects should be started quickly to
    validate the common model and design specifications for web services. To reach
    the ultimate goal of integrated querying across nanomaterial resources will require
    an evolutionary approach. Pilot projects provide the mechanism for testing and
    making adjustments. 7.5. Phase 4: publication and demonstration to the broader
    science community Once pilot projects have been successfully completed, the GAIN
    would publish information about the system and demonstrate the system functionality
    to the wider science community. 8. Closing remarks The challenges identified by
    the nanoinformatics community must be recognized and overcome before integration
    across nanomaterial and other non-nanotechnology resources in a practical and
    usable manner can be accomplished. The technical and operational challenges summarized
    in Fig. 2 are significant barriers to scientific progress in designing new and
    higher impact nanomaterials and in understanding how nanomaterials interact with
    biological, environmental, and other systems. Some of the tools needed to take
    advantage of high quality nanotechnology data exist, but full exploitation of
    true data sharing and integration to develop new scientific knowledge lies in
    the future. This paper has analyzed these challenges and outlines a path forward
    to real progress. The authors encourage readers to share feedback or join the

    in the nanotechnology field: perspectives of key stakeholders To understand the
    current practices in data integration and to identify challenges and offer recommendations,
    several organizations that maintain nanomaterial repositories were asked to respond
    to a questionnaire on data integration. The goal was to assist in defining and
    initiating integration and exchange of data resources across nanomaterial data
    repositories and with other non-nanotechnology data resources. Questions included
    current and recommended functionality and web services enabling data integration
    and exchange as well as perceived challenges associated with integrating primary
    experimental data sets, or data sets curated from the literature, with existing
    nanomaterial and non-nanomaterial data repositories. Many of the answers were
    summarized in 3 Stakeholder-identified data integration challenges, 4 Stakeholder-identified
    functionality needed to enable data integration, leading to the recommendations
    found in 6 Stakeholder recommendations for advancement in nanoinformatics, 7 Authors''
    recommendations: a path forward for achieving data integration across nanomaterial
    resources and with non-nanotechnology repositories. In this Appendix, additional
    details about the stakeholder responses are provided. A.1. Stakeholder experience
    in nanomaterial data integration Stakeholders who participated in the survey ranged
    from nanomaterial resources that have extensive experience in integrating databases
    and data sets to those with limited data integration experience whose focus was
    primarily on repository development. The diverse levels of integration capabilities
    provide insight into the challenges that need to be addressed in order to integrate
    across nanomaterial repositories and with other non-nanotechnology resources.
    Reponses to questions relating to experience in data integration, including integrating
    primary data sets and web services supporting data integration are provided in
    Table A-1. Table A-1. Integration capabilities of responding nanoinformatics resources.

    Provides REST-based Web Services supporting general sample search and retrieval
    of sample composition and characterizations by sample ID. Supports retrieval of
    samples associated with a publication. Integrates with Science Direct publications
    through an Elsevier bi-directional link and uses the PubMed and PubChem interfaces.
    CEINT NIKC (NanoInformatics Knowledge Commons) http://www.ceint.duke.edu/ Integration
    within the CEINT NIKC resource is achieved by cross-training lead curators within
    key collaborator teams in the consistent manual curation process utilizing shared
    templates and consistent valid values. The reviewed combined data set is then
    ported to the NIKC via custom API for these targeted data sets. Center for Safety
    of Substances and Products, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment
    (CSSP/NIHE) http://www.rivm.nl/en/About_RIVM/Organisation/Centres/ Does not provide
    any Web Services. In case of gathering/uploading toxicity data, the OCHEM database
    is commonly used. The database also allows for modeling and selection of descriptors.
    DECHEMA http://nanopartikel.info/en/projects/current-projects/dana-2-0 The DaNa
    project has been providing the Web Service for the NANORA project to implement
    the DaNaVis Database on the NANORA website based on JSON as data exchange format.
    eNanoMapper Database https://data.enanomapper.net/ Search integration of several
    databases: https://search.data,enanomapper.net There is a REST-based API and nanomaterials
    have URIs allowing a linked data approach. External databases can be indexed by
    uploading, for example, nanomaterial characterization or via search integration.
    Nanomaterial Registry Websites http://www.nanomaterialregistry.org Integration
    with the Registry is achieved on a case by case basis. Future development will
    include a JSON interface for analysis tools and data submission templates. Nanoparticle
    Information Library http://nanoparticlelibrary.net/ Integration with the NIL is
    achieved on a case-by case-basis. A.2. Uploading/downloading data sets When using
    a data warehousing architecture, the ability to upload and download data sets
    is an initial step towards integration, as support for this feature requires the
    identification of data formats and representation of common data elements. Stakeholders
    were asked for information on existing resource functionality supporting data
    integration including data standards, controlled vocabulary, and common identifiers.
    Federated approaches may not require the actual movement of the data, but require
    identification of data formats and common data elements. Stakeholders responded
    to questions relating to integration of primary data sets, including services
    available in-house or services that are publicly available (Table A-2). These
    stakeholder experiences provide insights into the level of readiness the nanotechnology
    community has achieved with regards to integrating databases and data sets. Table
    A-2. Summary of stakeholder responses to upload, download, and mapping questions:
    Does the nanomaterial data resource provide the following? Nanomaterial data resource
    Uploading, downloading, or mapping Definitions of the database fields Controlled
    vocabularies, taxonomies and/or ontologies Nanomaterial identifier uniqueness
    Integration with any non-nanotechnology resources caNanoLab Web-based forms for
    uploading and downloading nanomaterial composition, characterizations, publications
    and protocols Extensive documentation is availablea Uses NPO and the NCI Thesaurus
    https://ncit.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser/ Uses a pattern containing source information
    and a numeric identifier resulting in a unique identifier. The pattern for the
    sample name is: abbreviation(s) of institution names, name of the first author
    (with- out middle name), custom abbreviation of journal title, year of publication,
    and sample sequential number, e.g. SNL_UNM- CAshleyACSNano2012-01. caNanoLab integrates
    loosely with six non-nano resourcesb. CEINT Mapping directly from NBI data set;

    NIL integrates directly with data resources on hazardous materials (Miller et
    al., 2007)g. a The caNanoLab Design document (https://github.com/NCIP/cananolab/tree/master/docs/design)
    includes the object model which represents class names and attributes associated
    with the data model. All class names and attributes are maintained in the NCI
    caDSR (https://cdebrowser.nci.nih.gov/CDEBrowser/). Concepts are defined in the
    NCI Thesaurus (http://ncit.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser/pages/home.jsf?version=15.05d).
    caNanoLab also provides a user-friendly glossary (https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/caNanoLab/caNanoLab+Glossary).
    b caNanoLab integrates with PubMed and ScienceDirect for access to publications,
    Elsevier for linking caNanoLab data to publications, PubChem for chemical information,
    The Collaboratory for Structural Nanobiology - CSN (https://ncifrederick.cancer.gov/dsitp/abcc/abcc-groups/simulation-and-modeling/collaboratory-for-structural-nanobiology/)

    Laboratory (NCL, http://ncl.cancer.gov/) assay cascade and JoVE (https://www.jove.com/)
    for nanotechnology protocols. c DECHEMA has a very diverse target group ranging
    from interested laymen, stakeholders to other scientists; wording is adjusted
    in order to tell a comprehensive story without confusing the laymen and not losing
    the scientific correctness. d eNanoMapper is based on semantic web technologies
    including referenceable Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) and the
    Resource Description Framework (RDF). The substance UUID does not reflect the
    uniqueness of the material structure, but is an identifier of the material in
    the database. The substances materials) are described with their composition (e.g.
    core, shell, and functionalization) and are linked to the chemical structures
    of their components. These can be used to decide if the nanomaterials are the
    same or similar. e The NPO has been mapped to the Nanomaterial Registry and it
    was determined that approximately 8–10 terms used by the Registry are not yet
    part of the breadth of the NPO. f It is the intent of the Nanomaterial Registry
    not to judge equivalence between any two nanomaterials from different data resources,
    as the characterization results can be wildly different based on sample medium
    and characterization protocol. g The NIL integrates with the NIOSH Pocket Guide
    to Chemical Hazards (https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/default.html) and with the
    Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances (RTECS, http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/rtecs),
    The current hosting, administration, and maintenance of the NIL web resource outside
    of the CDC/NIOSH website is being conducted by Oregon State University in conjunction
    with its program to characterize nanomaterials. A.3. Web services supporting data
    exchange The missions of the stakeholder groups are highly diverse, with web services
    being of high priority for some and not for others. The data exchange capabilities
    of each resource, as provided by each stakeholder, are summarized below along
    with capabilities relating specifically to web services. A.3.1. caNanoLab Web
    Services caNanoLab implements an internal and external API leveraging REST (see
    Table A-3). The internal API retrieves web forms in JSON format, while the external
    API retrieves web forms in HTML format. caNanoLab exposes web services that retrieve
    publicly available information. All other web services are used internally and
    are not exposed. caNanoLab does not publish documentation on web services other
    than the caNanoLab Design document which documents the system architecture and
    object model. Internal web services are based on method calls on object model
    attributes. Other NCI projects supporting genomics use Apiary for documenting
    web services. caNanoLab uses the PubMed API to retrieve publications and interfaces
    with PubChem to retrieve information on chemicals associated with nanomaterial
    composing elements. Table A-3. Web Services provided by caNanoLab (https://cananolab.nci.nih.gov/caNanoLab/#/).
    Search type Possible search criteria Protocol Protocol name Sample Specific sample,
    composition, and/or characterization Publication Sample name. Nanomaterial characteristics
    A.3.2. CEINT web services CEINT is developing beta web services for collaborator
    data set curation and sharing; this functionality is under development and intended
    for active collaborators to use during research, not for the broader public. CEINT
    does provide a web-enabled service for use by CEINT members that allows them to
    connect with other researchers who identify as working on the same research questions,
    with the same materials, and with the same methods. This service facilitates Center-wide
    data integration through direct up-stream collaboration, even in the absence of
    prescribed data templates that would support more automated integration. CEINT
    uses web services provided by others, including eNanoMapper, the Nanomaterial
    Registry, the Integrated Taxonomic Information System, Ontobee, caNanoLab, USDA
    Geospatial Data Gateway, and the Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies. A.3.3.
    CSSP/NIPHE, Netherlands (The Center for Safety of Substances and Products), National
    Institute for Public Health and the Environment, Web Services CSSP/NIPHE, Netherlands
    does not offer web services; however, the OCHEM database (https://www.ochem.eu/)
    is publicly available. A.3.4. DECHEMA web services DECHEMA does not provide any
    web services per se for the DaNa project. In the case of the NANORA project (http://www.nanora.eu/),
    a web service was specifically created, together with an interface to implement
    the DaNaVis database on the NANORA website using JSON as the data exchange format.
    The backend web services and customized interface for the NANORA website are not
    publicly available but the frontend user interface is freely accessible. There
    is no publicly available documentation for the web service for the NANORA project.
    DECHEMA uses a content-management system for the DaNa website (Joomla + several
    plug-ins, bootstrap framework). The DaNa website (http://www.nanoobjects.info/en/)
    is accessible for everyone without any usage restrictions. The DaNaVis database
    and tools use a Django-framework (Python as the programming language), REST API-
    and JSON-based data interchange between client and application server, client-side
    JavaScript widget. More details on the database and tool design have been published
    (Atli et al., 2011, Kimmig et al., 2014). DECHEMA does not use any web services
    provided by other organizations. A.3.5. eNanoMapper web services eNanoMapper provides
    web services based on the OpenTox API. eNanoMapper inherits and, where needed,
    extends the machine readable API. The supported return formats include JSON, JSON-LD
    and RDF/XML, CSV, XLSX. Methods exist for a number of entity types, including
    substances, which is how eNanoMapper models a nanomaterial. The API is REST-like.
    eNanoMapper separates the API design from the server implementation; AMBIT is
    one of the reference implementations of OpenTox services (Jeliazkova and Jeliazkova,
    2011) and more recently eNanoMapper database (Jeliazkova et al., 2015), and on
    the server-side uses Apache''s Tomcat. The API implements user authentication
    and authorization. This means that an eNanoMapper instance (it is a platform rather
    than a single system), allows for both public data and confidential data that
    can be shared with only a selected group of researchers. The example https://data.enanomapper.net/
    instance currently hosts several public data sets, available under an Open Data
    license or waiver. Several more instances are currently available, hosting data
    from past EU FP7 funded project, and integrated view of these is provided at https://search.data.enanomapper.net/.
    The eNanoMapper server currently does not use other web services, besides being
    able to retrieve chemical structures from public databases (e.g. PubChem). The
    full details of the eNanoMapper API, including a description of the computational
    services implementation (which uses and integrates a variety of technologies and
    also reads and writes from/to data services) are published (Jeliazkova et al.,
    2015)(Chomenidis et al., 2017). A.3.6. Nanomaterial registry The Nanomaterial
    Registry does not currently have data exchange web services other than the export
    tools described in Table A-1. However, a JSON interface is in development for
    the connection with data analysis tools. The Registry website does provide a web
    service search tool that allows for keyword and specific measurement values to
    be searched, as well as allowing the user to browse nanomaterials by a variety
    of characteristics. Nanomaterial Registry data are also batch exported to a portal
    at nanoHUB, where users can interact with and download the data in different ways.
    A.3.7. Nanoparticle information library The Nanoparticle Information Library website
    is publicly accessible to everyone with the request that any use of the data be
    attributed to the primary source associated with the data entry. Online search
    capabilities within the NIL are based on attributes of nanomaterial structure,
    elemental composition, method of synthesis, and nanomaterial size-related features
    including primary particle diameter, agglomerate diameter, and specific surface
    area. Web links to the primary data and to the principle investigators who have
    provided data to the NIL are included. References ASTM Standard E2456, 2006 ASTM

    : And yet, the critical questions on nanotechnology – e.g. what governs nanomaterial
    behavior and its impact in the environment, the human body, or an innovative product
    – require integrated investigation across multiple disciplines and researchers
    using a range of measurement and reporting methods. Partners in academia, government,
    and industry have been applying advanced data storage and analytical techniques
    to enable integration of nanomaterial data in formats suitable for interrogating
    transformations and impacts of these materials within a variety of biotic and
    abiotic environments (Karcher et al., 2018; Miller et al., 2007). Nanotechnology
    is a rapidly growing field presenting a wave of opportunity for innovative applications
    in industrial, medical (Pelaz et al., 2017), and consumer products (Vance et al.,
    2015; Thomas et al., 2006; Kessler, 2011). Show abstract FEAST of biosensors:

    : However, the experimental data produced were stored in non-standardized forms
    limiting the accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of the generated
    data for further applications. To meet this need, the development of a centralized
    mesocosm database management system for environmental nanosafety that will allow
    to collect, standardize, and store all the exposure and hazard experimental data

    \a\nAbstract: Soil Security is an emerging sustainability science concept with\
    \ global application for guiding\nintegrated approaches to land management, while\
    \ balancing ecosystem services, environmental,\nsocial, cultural, and economic\
    \ imperatives. This discussion paper sets the scene for an Australian\nSoil Security\
    \ framework as an example of how it might be developed for any country, deﬁning\
    \ the\nkey issues and justiﬁcation for Soil Security, as well as detailing implementation\
    \ requirements and\nbeneﬁts; two examples of beneﬁcial outcomes are provided in\
    \ terms of facilitating decommoditization\nof agricultural products and the impact\
    \ of urban encroachment on productive land. We highlight\nresearch gaps, where\
    \ new knowledge will contribute to well-rounded approaches that reﬂect diﬀering\n\
    stakeholder perspectives. We also provide key nomenclature associated with a potential\
    \ Soil Security\nframework so that future discussions may use a common language.\
    \ Through this work we invite\nscientiﬁc and policy discourse with the aim of\
    \ developing more informed responses to the myriad of\ncompeting demands placed\
    \ on our soil systems.\nKeywords: ecosystem services; land management; food security;\
    \ ﬁbre security; land use; land\nplanning; natural capital; social capital; farming\
    \ systems\n1. Introduction\nThe Soil Security concept [1] provides the opportunity\
    \ to develop national frameworks, with the\npotential for a uniﬁed global approach\
    \ to sustainable and regenerative land-use and management.\nThe Sustainable Development\
    \ Goals (SDGs) contain mandatory key performance indicators in the form\nof targets\
    \ for each of the 193 signature countries, of which Australia is one [2]. Keesstra\
    \ et al. [3] explains\nthat this presents both a great challenge and opportunity\
    \ to the science community, including the soil\nscience community, as the SDGs\
    \ require truly multidisciplinary solutions and soil science directly aﬀects\n\
    ﬁve of the 17 SDGs. Fortunately, the Soil Security concept supersedes traditional\
    \ single-dimension\nland capability assessment and provides a framework for multi-dimensional\
    \ assessment taking into\naccount the balance of social, economic, and natural\
    \ capital.\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3416; doi:10.3390/su11123416\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\n\
    Sustainability 2019, 11, 3416\n2 of 15\nThis soil security concept is motivated\
    \ by sustainable development and is driven by the need to:\nsecure food and ﬁber\
    \ production that is not only productive, but proﬁtable; preserve our biodiversity;\n\
    and contribute to our water and climate sustainability. All of these drivers are\
    \ critical to human health\nand the health of our nation and planet. It is, therefore,\
    \ an integrated framework identifying the\neconomic value of our soils for multiple\
    \ uses and provides a systematic way of guiding land-use\nand management decisions\
    \ well beyond our current compartmentalized systems. This discussion\npaper aims\
    \ to demonstrate how the Soil Security concept can aid Australia, or any other\
    \ country,\nto simultaneously manage its natural assets for the betterment of\
    \ our domestic society, while also\nstriving to meet global SDG requirements.\n\
    The Soil Security concept is perhaps uniquely attractive due to its holistic,\
    \ multi-dimensional\nview and the fact it can be driven by users (e.g., land managers).\
    \ By contrast, single viewpoint and\ntop-down regulatory-only approaches seem\
    \ incapable of tackling contemporary challenges at the\nnexus of land-use conﬂict,\
    \ and balancing socio-economic drivers with soil and landscape health [4–7].\n\
    Importantly, the Soil Security concept provides a market-based approach to land\
    \ assessment and\nmanagement that has the capacity to identify niche markets though\
    \ decommoditization, whereby\nagricultural commodities are inextricably linked\
    \ to healthy land, ecosystem function, and responsible\nproduction practices,\
    \ which deliver enhanced value at the point of origin. In such an approach, the\n\
    driver for the adoption of good land management is the ability to state the quality\
    \ of land management,\nprove this, and attach it to the product provenance, or\
    \ ecosystem service assessments. This drives a\ncommodity towards becoming a “decommodity”,\
    \ attracting a premium, and simultaneously providing a\ndriver and mechanism for\
    \ maintenance and improvement of land management and ecosystem health.\nIn essence,\
    \ the Soil Security concept allows simultaneous management of production and\n\
    environmental systems, with the potential to better inform public investment in\
    \ ecosystem services,\nas the private investment will be market-driven. This has\
    \ important advantages for governance\nbodies and regulators, as Soil Security\
    \ has capacity to motivate a range of actors from individual\nland managers to\
    \ political organizations, which is a truly unique modis operandi for any land\n\
    management system. A fact of environmental governance is that the issues requiring\
    \ attention always\noutweigh the budget provided to address them. Therefore, the\
    \ ﬁrst question when implementing new\nenvironmental policy—asked overtly or not—will\
    \ always relate to the cost of policy development and\nimplementation in relation\
    \ to the perceived beneﬁt. We will demonstrate how a Soil Security approach\n\
    can provide greater transparency to government decision making around the investment\
    \ of public\nmoney into environmental land management, while oﬀsetting the burden\
    \ on governments through\nprivate industry investment.\nThis discussion paper\
    \ contains a number of key terms with speciﬁc meanings, which have been\nidentiﬁed\
    \ in italics and deﬁned within Section 2. The main objective of this paper is\
    \ to outline a\nframework for implementing Soil Security in the Australian context,\
    \ although our approach should\nbe universally applicable. Such a framework provides\
    \ a template from which other nations could\ncommence their own planning—starting\
    \ from a vacuum is often a barrier to sensible policy creation.\nHowever, we hope\
    \ that this preliminary framework could form the basis of a uniﬁed global approach.\n\
    2. Deﬁning a Common Language\nIn moving towards a Soil Security framework for\
    \ Australia, and more broadly at the global scale,\nit will be important that\
    \ terms are used with precise meaning. The purpose of this section is to deﬁne\n\
    the precise deﬁnition of the terms used within this paper to ensure that the core\
    \ message is clearly\ninterpreted. While the majority of these terms are in current\
    \ use, we have needed to deﬁne speciﬁc\nterms for this work.\nAustralia’s Natural\
    \ Capital—Refers to an overarching account of the function and value of our\n\
    nation’s ecosystems services, including from soils (e.g., the capacity of the\
    \ soil to store carbon, provide\nriparian ﬁltration, and support biodiversity).\
    \ Natural capital [8] places a value on natural resources\nsuch that they can\
    \ inform decision-making processes; value is in terms of the ecosystem function,\
    \ and\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3416\n3 of 15\nservice this delivers, as well\
    \ as economic value. In some cases, the ecosystem services value will be of\n\
    more importance than the economic value. For speciﬁc deﬁnition of capital within\
    \ the Soil Security\nconcept, see “Soil Security Dimensions: Capital” below.\n\
    Best-Management Practices; Best Land-Management Practices—Methods or techniques\
    \ found to be\neﬀective and practical in achieving a production objective within\
    \ the context of sustainable natural\nresource management (i.e., avoiding soil\
    \ loss or degradation, preventing or minimizing pollution),\nwhile making optimum\
    \ use of the economic, social, and natural resources. A singular, national-scale\n\
    best-management practice scheme cannot exist, due to the soil variation, highly\
    \ complex and diﬀering\nenvironments, and climate, as well as diﬀerent land uses.\
    \ Therefore, best-management practices need\nto be regionally tailored and industry\
    \ speciﬁc. Additionally, best-management practices do not seek\nto optimize factors,\
    \ or objectives, as individual aspects, but rather balance whole production system\n\
    and wider ecosystem objectives. In this context, suboptimal performance may result\
    \ in some system\naspects to allow performance optimization of the holistic sustainable\
    \ system in perpetuity.\nDecommodity; Decommoditization—in agriculture refers\
    \ to the identiﬁcation and segregation of\nproducts (crops and animals) at the\
    \ source and through transport and supply chains to consumers.\nThis facilitates\
    \ greater traceability of product provenance that is clearly linked to quality\
    \ control, as\nwell as the story and metrics of production. Decommoditization\
    \ will inevitably be linked to the social\nlicense for agricultural organizations\
    \ to operate, increasingly demand by consumers. The principal\nreasons to transfer\
    \ commodities to decommodities are to gain consumer conﬁdence (around product\n\
    quality, integrity, and method of production) and thereby achieve a premium in\
    \ a discerning market.\nHigh-value wine is the classical example; see [9] for\
    \ further discussion on decommoditization and\nagricultural markets.\nEcosystem\
    \ Services (reproduced from [10])—are the beneﬁts provided to humans through the\n\
    transformations of resources (or natural assets, including land, water, vegetation,\
    \ and atmosphere) into\na ﬂow of essential goods and services, e.g., clean air,\
    \ water, and food. Some ecosystem services, such\nas the regulation and stabilization\
    \ of climate, water ﬂow, and the movement of nutrients have been\neven less visible\
    \ until recent times, when disturbance to these systems has exacerbated climate\
    \ change,\nsoil erosion or eutrophication. Like all complex systems, ecosystems\
    \ can appear to be working well until\nthey suddenly collapse, as the supporting\
    \ base may have eroded without obvious warning symptoms.\nNational Account; National\
    \ Account for Soil—encompasses the concept of soil having capital value\nwithin\
    \ production systems, and the broader ecological systems these exist within. The\
    \ national account\nis, in essence, a bank balance providing the current balance\
    \ of soil capital. Most importantly, the National\nAccount for Soils would provide\
    \ the trajectories against that balance in a regionally speciﬁc manner,\nmeaning\
    \ that Australia can account for its soils at any point in time and forecast future\
    \ projections.\nThe Soil Security concept provides the means for accounting, while\
    \ the National Soil Capability Statement\nprovides a measure of this account against\
    \ the current vulnerabilities, providing the soil management\nplans that would\
    \ help the nation achieve enhanced Soil Security, and the associated production\
    \ beneﬁts\nthis brings (See Soil Capability Statement).\nNational Soil Capability\
    \ Statement—Soils, like any asset, have vulnerabilities to their value. In the\n\
    case of soils, the condition (see Soil Security Dimensions: Condition) and capability\
    \ (see Soil Security\nDimensions: Capability) determine the production capacity\
    \ (economic, natural, and social), which in turn\naﬀects the capital value. Soils\
    \ will have current and potential capabilities, which need to be accounted\nfor\
    \ (see National Account for Soil), as well as vulnerabilities to these capabilities,\
    \ which further infers that\nresilience to these is an important factor that requires\
    \ addressing. The national capability statement\ndetails soil capability on a\
    \ regionally speciﬁc basis, nationally, and details the resilience of these soils\n\
    to the identiﬁed vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities might include erosion,\
    \ salinity, climate change,\nurban encroachment, etc.\nSoil Security—Rather than\
    \ a single-dimensional land assessment approach, such as land capability\nmapping\
    \ (largely considering only soil and landscape biophysical features) [11], the\
    \ Soil Security\nconcept incudes consideration of other allied soil facets, including\
    \ societal connections, education,\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3416\n4 of 15\npolicy,\
    \ legislation, current land use, the requirement for conservation, condition,\
    \ and the economic and\nnatural value of our soils. Soil Security does not simply\
    \ identify discrete soils, rather it aims to quantify\nadditional pressures which\
    \ could result in soil becoming unsustainable or insecure. Quantiﬁcation\nprovides\
    \ a framework for realizing the potential for improved productivity, function,\
    \ and ecosystem\nservices. In this way, Soil Security is much more than soil health,\
    \ or soil quality, which are encapsulated\nwithin “Soil Security dimensions: Condition.”\
    \ See [1,12,13] for detailed reading on Soil Security as a\nglobally important\
    \ framework.\nSoil Security Dimensions (Reproduced from [14]):\nCapability—What\
    \ can this soil do? i.e., Focusing on what the soil can be used for. The dimension\
    \ aligns\nwith the biophysical capacity of the soil to perform a task and is interrelated\
    \ with the soil’s condition.\nThis, as well as more speciﬁc land suitability,\
    \ has been one of the major forms of soil assessment in\nthe past, generally applied\
    \ globally according to the FAO [11]. This has historically been applied\nin Tasmania,\
    \ for example, as a seven-class land capability assessment [15], assessing soil\
    \ attributes,\nlandscape position, parent material, and climate.\nCondition—Can\
    \ the soil do this? i.e., “Is the soil being improved, maintained or degraded\
    \ by a particular\nland use”? In this case, the soil’s condition can be considered\
    \ as the deviation of key soil attributes from\nknown or perceived soil condition\
    \ target or threshold values for diﬀerent soil–land-use combinations.\nThis is\
    \ often measured by long-term monitoring of the soil attributes, for example,\
    \ soil carbon or pH,\nfor diﬀerent soil type and land-use combinations and is\
    \ often considered as a measure of soil health\nor quality.\nCapital—Placing a\
    \ value on “things” ensures contribution of said things to decision making processes\n\
    and asks, “What economic or ecosystem value does the soil provide?” Soil capital\
    \ can be diﬃcult to\nquantify, also containing several diﬀerent elements; economic,\
    \ social and natural. Economic capital is\nconsidered as the potential earnings\
    \ a soil landscape could deliver for a particular land use or enterprise.\nCodiﬁcation—\"\
    What regulations guide or control appropriate soil use?” Soil codiﬁcation is considered\n\
    as the public policy, regulation, guidelines, and legislation pertaining to soil\
    \ use, management, and\nconservation. In Australia, similar to many parts of the\
    \ world, soil regulation and policy is limited.\nHowever, in determining Soil\
    \ Security, appropriate policies and incentives can have a large bearing\non the\
    \ other four dimensions in guiding, encouraging or enforcing appropriate uses,\
    \ management,\nidentiﬁcation of degradation, and education.\nConnectivity—Epitomized\
    \ by “Those who know care, and those who care lobby”, and is focused on,\n“How\
    \ much is known about the soil and its appropriate use?” This dimension encapsulates\
    \ the social\naspects of the soil; how it is treated, valued, understood and/or\
    \ respected, by all stakeholders, not\njust by the land manager. Although diﬃcult\
    \ to quantify for many land uses, in this case it is focused\non the knowledge\
    \ of the land manager in regard to appropriate and sustainable soil management,\n\
    identiﬁcation of soil vulnerabilities, and risk minimization strategies. This\
    \ could also concern whether\nthe land manager has access to the appropriate tools\
    \ to eﬀectively manage their soil, for example, soil\nmapping, education, and\
    \ training.\n3. Background Leading to the Need for Soil Security\nIn reading this\
    \ paper, it is important to note that Soil Security is not intended to be a framework\n\
    for locking up soil (i.e., protection through legislation), but instead a framework\
    \ designed to empower\nand reward good soil stewardship through a variety of approaches,\
    \ the most important of which may\nbe soil-product decommoditization. The concept\
    \ of decommoditization, and how this can be realistically\nachieved, is explained\
    \ below in Section 6.1. In brief, the Soil Security framework utilizes the heightened,\n\
    and inevitable, global demand for traceability (“provenance”) of food and ﬁber\
    \ produce. Traceability\nis clearly linked to quality control, but it will inevitably\
    \ be linked to the social license for agricultural\norganizations to operate that\
    \ consumers increasingly demand [16], as well as the provision of ecosystem\n\
    services, which are becoming a component of the Australian agricultural social\
    \ license to operate.\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3416\n5 of 15\nTherefore, rather\
    \ than a protection-through-legislation regulatory approach, the Soil Security\
    \ concept\nprovides an empowerment framework where the end-user (e.g., landholder),\
    \ society in general, and\nGovernment beneﬁt from prudent implementation. Given\
    \ the complexities of land management,\nand the breadth of actors inﬂuenced by\
    \ land management decisions—all people, current and future\ngenerations—an empowerment\
    \ approach is direly needed to shift the management culture towards a\nshared\
    \ societal responsibility reﬂecting the actors involved.\nAustralia’s greatest\
    \ natural asset is its soil. Soil accounts for 80% of Australia’s natural assets\n\
    with an estimated value of $3860 billion [17]. Some 45% of the nation’s soil is\
    \ used for agricultural\nproduction, with 84% of this used for grazing, 8% for\
    \ cropping and the remaining for forestry and\nother practices [18], resulting\
    \ in an annual output of $37 billion [19]. This is a share of 2.7% of all\nnational\
    \ industry, employing over 320,000 people. Major banks now recognize the need\
    \ to integrate\nnatural capital, including soils, into their risk assessments\
    \ [20].\nThere is increasing demand being put on the soil resource, such as being\
    \ able to produce more\nfood with less and at the same time to sequester carbon\
    \ to mitigate climate change. This is driven by\nthe need to ensure reliable,\
    \ clean, and nutritious food for national markets, along with the longer-term\n\
    vision of Australia providing for the 70% rise in food demand internationally,\
    \ and food diversiﬁcation\nglobally [11]. Adding to this is the need to restore\
    \ the productive capacity of degraded soil. While\nthere is continuing improvement,\
    \ the loss of soil capability through acidiﬁcation, salinity, structural\ndecline,\
    \ and erosion remains a threat, especially related to arable and grazing land\
    \ management.\nThis equates to a global requirement to produce twice the output\
    \ of the so-called “green revolution”,\nin half the time (i.e., by 2050). To achieve\
    \ this, Australia requires new and empowering market-based\napproaches to soil\
    \ resource management. This is what a Soil Security framework oﬀers.\nAn emerging\
    \ issue is the loss of agriculturally useful soil due to the fact of urbanization,\
    \ with urban\nand peri-urban usage encroaching into agricultural green-ﬁelds and\
    \ ﬂood plains around our regional\ncities, and resulting in the loss of high-production\
    \ horticultural soil around our capital cities [21].\nThere is a growing need\
    \ to consider the optimal use of soil (in association with other key resources\n\
    such as water) in and around cities to ensure its security and maximize its potential,\
    \ as the current\nsoil resource will already struggle to meet the global production\
    \ demand without minimizing the\navailable land.\nGlobally soil contains ≈25%\
    \ of terrestrial biodiversity [22]. Soil has a significant role in supporting\n\
    and protecting our biodiversity through its contribution to the National Reserve\
    \ System and providing a\nsanctuary for soil biodiversity. The Commonwealth Scientific\
    \ and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)\nestimate that more than 25% of\
    \ Australia’s aboveground biological carbon stock (i.e., 20 million hectares)\n\
    exists in protected areas [23]. More recently, the “soil carbon 4 per mille” initiative\
    \ of the Paris Climate\nAccord led from France has focused the attention on developing\
    \ soil carbon stocks. For Australia, it is\nestimated that 25 GT is stored in\
    \ the top 30 cm of soil [24], supported by a healthy soil biome.\nAustralia is\
    \ the ﬁfth largest country by size, covering some 5% of the world’s land area.\
    \ The capital\nvalue of the world’s soil stock is equal to $325 trillion, suggesting\
    \ that Australia’s contribution is\n$16 trillion. The annual value of ecosystem\
    \ services contributed by soil is estimated at $11.4 trillion,\nsuggesting that\
    \ soil provides $570 billion to Australia’s ecosystem services annually [25].\n\
    Australia is regarded as having a highly educated and advanced land-holder population,\
    \ which\nwould help facilitate best soil management practices. Nevertheless, there\
    \ is always a need around\nthe ongoing soil and land literacy of these land-holders\
    \ [26,27] who are, in a sense, the proxies for the\nwhole population in the care\
    \ of much of our productive soil resource. Perhaps more importantly, there\nis\
    \ a clear disconnect with the clear majority of the population and the land-holders,\
    \ and in turn the soil.\nFood is produced anonymously to the consumer. However,\
    \ there is a small, but growing, demand by\nconsumers for information on how and\
    \ where their food is produced. This growing connection has the\npotential to\
    \ link consumers back to the soil through the concept of “provenance”. Such connection\
    \ will\nbe vital in driving Chinese import of provenance identiﬁed agricultural\
    \ products; in recent history,\nsmall-scale decommoditization has resulted from\
    \ Chinese markets seeking premium Australian products.\nSustainability 2019, 11,\
    \ 3416\n6 of 15\nTechnologically, this is becoming more feasible through digital\
    \ agriculture. Younger generations\nof Australians are developing a strong social\
    \ conscience, identifying that domestic social license to\noperate will be a key\
    \ economic driver of provenance-based markets. In the future, we imagine the\n\
    general population will be concerned about best-management practice and the ecosystems\
    \ services\nthis management promotes, for soil via the production of food and\
    \ its associate social license.\nThe continued development of remote and proximal\
    \ sensing technologies has increased the\nopportunity to routinely assess the\
    \ soil’s capability and condition at both regional and local scales.\nThe use\
    \ of these technologies is also increasing in Australia’s agriculture sector,\
    \ through precision\nagriculture and robotic innovations. This is coupled with\
    \ the increasing innovations and adoption\nin digital soil mapping (DSM), united\
    \ with digital soil assessment (DSA) [28], that is increasing the\nopportunity\
    \ for recognizing and enabling best management practices.\nIn order to address\
    \ the issues discussed above, there is need for sustainable development that\n\
    secures food and ﬁber production, preserves biodiversity, and contributes to water\
    \ and climate\nsustainability, all of which contribute to human health and the\
    \ health of the nation.\nThe Soil\nSecurity concept provides the foundation from\
    \ which to construct such a framework. Soil Security,\nas a multidimensional concept,\
    \ is underpinned by the need to assess and manage our soil determined\nby its\
    \ capability and asks the question, “what can this soil do?”. Soils diﬀer in their\
    \ resilience and react\nto pressures diﬀerently, meaning that spatial variability\
    \ in the capability to address a given issue/s\nmust be expected, mapped, and\
    \ understood. This can be reported as a National Capability statement.\nSimilarly,\
    \ the condition of the soil against its capability must also be spatially understood\
    \ to map\nproduction capacity, where production can be deﬁned as economic, environmental\
    \ (natural assets),\nand social.\nBoth at local and regional scales, the continued\
    \ monitoring of the soil’s condition\nwill provide the information needed to ensure\
    \ sustainable use of the soil in line with adoption of\nbest-management practices.\n\
    The concept also incorporates the need to value soil’s contribution to other ecosystem\
    \ services\nin addition to production, i.e., its capital, contributing to a statement\
    \ of Australia’s Natural Capital.\nThis is all aﬀected by people’s connectivity\
    \ to soil or knowing and valuing soil as one of Australia’s\ngreatest assets.\
    \ The need to develop governance, i.e., codiﬁcation, both in the public and private\
    \ sectors\nto ensure appropriate use and management of soil is also recognized\
    \ in the Soil Security concept.\nThe ﬁve dimensions of capability, condition,\
    \ capital, connectivity, and codiﬁcation ensure a holistic\napproach to securing\
    \ soil by encompassing the biophysical, social, and economic dimensions. A proof\n\
    of concept has been implemented in the state of Tasmania as a ﬁrst approximation\
    \ of Soil Security\ndemonstrating the feasibility of the approach [14].\n4. Role\
    \ of Scientiﬁc Professions in Achieving Soil Security\nThe implementation of a\
    \ national land management framework based upon the Soil Security\nconcept will\
    \ require concerted eﬀort from scientiﬁc organizations, working in tandem with\
    \ State and\nFederal Government, and their counterparts, as well as all stakeholders\
    \ of soils. Within Australia,\nand globally, professional scientiﬁc societies\
    \ and peak bodies have been given less credence in\npolitical decision making\
    \ than is likely prudent. There appears to be a global shift away from science\n\
    informing (i.e., evidence-driven) policy development, and in shaping society [29,30].\
    \ It will, therefore,\nbe important that professional societies and peak bodies\
    \ are integrated in the development of a Soil\nSecurity framework. We consider\
    \ this here from the perspective of the Australian professional society\nfor soil\
    \ science: Soil Science Australia (https://www.soilscienceaustralia.org.au/).\
    \ It would be prudent\nfor other countries to consider this from their own professional\
    \ body perspective.\nThe role of Soil Science Australia is to act as the scientiﬁc\
    \ advocate for Australia’s soil resource;\nto recognize its capability and condition\
    \ and to advise government on concepts and methods that can\nfacilitate good public\
    \ policy for the security of our soil. We note here that professional societies\
    \ are\nmuch more than introspective groups for the discussion of their technical\
    \ detail; they are the wealth of\nknowledge available for consult, usually operate\
    \ as not-for-proﬁt, as well as being independent and\nSustainability 2019, 11,\
    \ 3416\n7 of 15\nimpartial to the political process. It is for these reasons that\
    \ the onus is on professional societies to also\nremain proactive in their lobbying\
    \ and advocacy roles. We believe that these attributes also contribute\nsigniﬁcantly\
    \ to brokering trust between society, industry, and Government [30], which is\
    \ integral to the\nsuccess of a new management framework.\nIn the implementation\
    \ of any framework that requires natural asset audit and assessment of\ncondition,\
    \ there must be suitably qualiﬁed auditors/assessors, whereby there is also transparency\
    \ in the\ncertiﬁcation of this. Within the Australian context, Soil Science Australia\
    \ has developed, and continues\nto support, the professional standards of practice\
    \ in soil science. The Certiﬁed Professional Soil\nScientist (CPSS) accreditation\
    \ is the hallmark of professional conﬁdence in expertise and is importantly\n\
    independent from and impartial to Government and industry. Technical organizations,\
    \ societies, and\npeak bodies will, and must, play an important role in the social\
    \ credibility of certiﬁcation.\nSoil Science Australia works closely with the\
    \ National Committee on Soil and Terrain (NCST,\nhttp://www.clw.csiro.au/aclep/contacts.htm),\
    \ which is the Government peak body for soil and land\nevaluation, consisting\
    \ of Commonwealth, State, and Territory Government representation. The NCST\n\
    oversees the development of consistent national soil scientiﬁc, survey, and data\
    \ standards and fosters\ncollaborative capacity-building and information sharing\
    \ among member organizations. However,\nresponsibility for soil information inventories,\
    \ land-use policy, and regulation resides with State\nand Territory governments.\
    \ The fact that Australia does not have an existing dedicated body for\nreporting\
    \ on the soil resource, but has such bodies for major water systems, vegetation,\
    \ meteorology,\nand geological/mining resources (e.g., Murray Darling Basin Authority,\
    \ Parks Australia, Bureau of\nMeteorology, Geoscience Australia), is a clear indicator\
    \ of the requirement for concerted soil resource\nmanagement. An impartial and\
    \ independent body is required, and while SSA and NCST must be key\nstakeholders\
    \ in the development of this, professional bodies spanning the full spectrum of\
    \ industry\nand ecological function that soils underpin will need to be stakeholders\
    \ also. Soil Science Australia,\nor any other peak body and/or technical organization/society,\
    \ will need the support of all levels of\ngovernment together with soil and land\
    \ management professionals to help achieve the policy goal of\nSoil Security.\n\
    5. Soil Health and Soil Quality in Relation to Soil Security\nThere is a current\
    \ focus on “soil health” and “soil quality” in Australian agricultural and\nenvironmental\
    \ industry. These terms are similar, and often used synonymously, but do have\
    \ some\nnuances. In general, both terms describe that soil exists on a continuum\
    \ in terms of being somewhere\nbetween good and bad. Soil health and quality approaches\
    \ seek indicators that are measurable to\nsubsequently report in a quantitative\
    \ manner as to how good/bad a soil is in relation to the numerous\nindicators,\
    \ providing a means to understand production capability and what might be done\
    \ to improve\nit. Soil Security is more encompassing than soil health or quality,\
    \ whereby soil health/quality are\nessentially equivalent to the soil condition\
    \ criteria of the Soil Security concept (1/5 criteria).\nIt is noted that soil\
    \ health and soil quality both have various levels of merit. Soil health creates\
    \ the\ncorrect perception that soil has a living component, and can become “sick”\
    \ just like ourselves as humans,\nproviding a very intuitive understanding of\
    \ soil health [26,27]. However, soil health can often also lead\nto excessive\
    \ focus on the biological aspects of soils, creating ignorance in the chemical\
    \ and physical\nattributes. Soil quality is normally used to overcome this issue,\
    \ but the term quality is a subjective\none, in that quality to one individual\
    \ is not quality to another. Sojka and Upchurch [31] state that\nthe deﬁnition\
    \ of soil quality remains elusive and value laden, with the usage often having\
    \ developed\narbitrary policy overtones. This perhaps explains why Bünemann et\
    \ al. [32] ﬁnd that evaluation of soil\nquality with explicit relation to soil\
    \ threats, functions and ecosystem services are rarely implemented,\nand where\
    \ implemented have unclear interpretation schemes, limiting the adoption of soil\
    \ quality\nschemes by landholders and policy alike.\nSustainability 2019, 11,\
    \ 3416\n8 of 15\nFurthermore, there is an important point that must be made when\
    \ considering a given soil and\nwhether it may be healthy or of good quality;\
    \ i.e., a soil might be healthy, but not a good quality soil in\nterms of relativity\
    \ to other soil qualities. This indicates that the capability dimension is missing\
    \ from the\nsoil health discussion and appears to confound the use of soil quality\
    \ in the same discussion. While\nour intent is not to commence a debate around\
    \ terminology, we contend a new term is required to\nwalk away from the split\
    \ paradigm of soil health and soil quality. Furthermore, that soil needs to be\n\
    considered in terms of its productivity as a function of soil condition on a continuum\
    \ of soil capability,\nwhere capability refers to its ability to meet a given\
    \ global issue.\n6. Beneﬁts and Case Studies\nIn this section we provide three\
    \ examples of how Soil Security could be used to better manage the\nland resource\
    \ in terms of agricultural proﬁtability, society conﬁdence in land management,\
    \ as well as\ndetermination of land-use suitability at the urban and agricultural\
    \ fringe. While there are, of course,\nmany other beneﬁts of a Soil Security framework,\
    \ these case studies serve to demonstrate the possible\nbreadth and ability to\
    \ enhance the experience of all actors.\n6.1. Soil Security and Agricultural Decommoditization:\
    \ Incentivising Agriculture\nDecommoditization in agriculture refers to the segregation\
    \ of products (crops and animals) at\nthe source and their transport through supply\
    \ chains to consumers. The principal reason is to gain\nconsumer conﬁdence (around\
    \ product quality, integrity, and method of production) and thereby\nachieve a\
    \ premium in a discerning market. High-value wine is the classical example. The\
    \ proposition\nis that with sensor and digital technologies this can be achieved\
    \ at scale for all products. It requires\nnew systems and the education of consumers.\n\
    So, where does soil come in? With a “decommodity” one, can think of a consignment\
    \ moving\nthrough a supply chain from producer to consumer. The consignment consists\
    \ of the “product” along\nwith information about the product. When the consumer\
    \ searches with the intent to purchase, “product\n+ information” is found, whereby\
    \ the information provides consumer conﬁdence in the product quality,\nbut also\
    \ the sustainability of its production (i.e., ecosystem service value, such as\
    \ for carbon credit/oﬀset\nschemes). The information contributes to the consignment\
    \ value, and is attached to the consignment,\nby say blockchain technology, consisting\
    \ of:\n(1)\nCompositional information on the product itself; minimal quality criteria\
    \ (protein content,\ncontaminants); and more generally, compositional characteristics\
    \ that could indicate place\nof production (provenance, terroir) (e.g., stable\
    \ isotope composition, DNA/metagenomics\ninformation—such information will largely\
    \ reﬂect the soil environment).\n(2)\nInformation on the method of production\
    \ (a compilation of digital information from digital farms\nrecords on how the\
    \ crop or animal was grown, e.g., for a crop—sowing dates, fertilisers, herbicides\n\
    applications, harvest date, irrigation, etc.). Part of the decommoditization dividend\
    \ comes from\n“Certiﬁed” or best practice approaches. For soil, best practice\
    \ would suggest growing crops or\nanimals on soil that is highly suitable for\
    \ that purpose and in a manner that is sustainable—the\ncapability dimension of\
    \ Soil Security. This allows the creation of metrics for emerging ecosystem\n\
    services markets such as biodiversity oﬀsets and carbon trading.\n(3)\nInformation\
    \ on the state of the environment where the crop or animal was grown (this is\
    \ a\ntime-stamped or longitudinal record of the state of the environment at the\
    \ place of production—this\nwould include a number of environmental entities,\
    \ but vegetation and soil would the key ones.\nA key part of the decommoditization\
    \ dividend comes from evidence of sustainability—a stable or\nnon-declining environment.\
    \ For soil this is the condition dimension, and would be measured by\nproperties\
    \ such as soil carbon, pH, microbial diversity, bulk density, salinity, etc. Additionally,\n\
    this information could provide localized information on the ancillary ecosystem\
    \ services provided\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3416\n9 of 15\nby the environment\
    \ in which the crop or animal is grown—the ecosystem services—this is the\ncapital\
    \ dimension of Soil Security.\nSo, we see immediately that decommoditization,\
    \ which is a way of assuring quality and sustainability\nof agricultural products\
    \ and thereby attracting a ﬁnancial premium, connects growers and consumers\n\
    and utilizes a number of the dimensions of Soil Security. Through this approach\
    \ consumers can\nevaluate soil condition, capability, and capital and the linking\
    \ of consumers to producers. All of\nthis is encapsulated in a digitally enabled\
    \ market-based mechanism which can increase conﬁdence\nfor consumers, producers,\
    \ business, and governments. Soil Security is a key part of agricultural\ndecommoditization\
    \ and also is likely to be achieved via this mechanism. There is a market-based\n\
    mechanism for achieving Soil Security.\nAs an example, Australia is currently\
    \ highly reliant on a live export market in terms of meat\nas a commodity. However,\
    \ live export to Europe is not feasible due to distances and restrictions\non\
    \ live export. The Soil Security framework, with concerted industry, government\
    \ and peak-body\neﬀort, could realize a signiﬁcant European market for Australian\
    \ meat that is provenance driven.\nIt is entirely possible through a market-based\
    \ Soil Security approach that the meat industry could\ndevelop a sustainable and\
    \ gourmet niche market to Europe, where ecosystem service contribution\n(soil\
    \ capital) and sustainable practices are the value-add that realizes decommoditization.\
    \ This would\nbolster the Australian industry through the creation of new markets,\
    \ while augmenting existing\nmarkets simultaneously (e.g., Chinese demand for\
    \ quality assurance and genuine product).\n6.2. Soil Security and Social License\
    \ to Operate: Educating the Consumer\nAcross the board, Australian society’s trust\
    \ in key institutions—media, business, government, and\nNGOs—has fallen to levels\
    \ only four points above the least trusting country in the world [30], which\n\
    has led to the perception that a social license to operate within agriculture\
    \ is considered as a negative\nconcept [16]. When social license to operate is\
    \ driven by mistrust, a divisive culture emerges and license\nbecomes subject\
    \ to “guilty until proven innocent”, which only serves to further disconnect society\n\
    from agriculture. We argue that this disconnect between the general population\
    \ and the agricultural\nindustry can be overcome through the Soil Security concept.\
    \ Building on decommoditization as an\nincentive to adopt best-management practices,\
    \ a social license to operate can be utilized to educate\nthe general populace\
    \ over time as to what best management actually entails. The same blockchain\n\
    technology that brings provenance information to consumers is also an educational\
    \ tool for the true\nvalue of ecosystem services.\nSoil Security as a framework\
    \ can be used to increase the connectivity between urban and country\nregions\
    \ through demonstration that agriculture is a part of society, and that social\
    \ license to operate is\na positive concern for both the consumer and the agricultural\
    \ practitioner. Indeed, Lush [33] argues\nthat society is already determining\
    \ the right to farm and that new approaches are required to diminish\nthe growing\
    \ gap between the general population and the agricultural industry; further stating\
    \ that\nthis approach must focus on upskilling producers to lead with shared values,\
    \ in order to build trust\nwithin society. Unfortunately, Lush [33], a strategic\
    \ communication specialist, subsequently argues\nthat this is a communication\
    \ issue and that more information and science will fail to overcome the gap.\n\
    We would argue that through a framework where connectivity is a core consideration,\
    \ communication,\nalong with further information and accessible science, is required\
    \ to transition social license to operate\nfrom a negative to positive perception\
    \ with shared values. Soil Security provides a new approach that\nserves to upskill\
    \ and educate through participation in day-to-day business for both the consumer\
    \ and\nthe producer.\nConnectivity is perhaps one of the most important dimensions\
    \ of Soil Security in terms of the\nsuccess of a Soil Security framework. The\
    \ disconnection between consumption and production requires\nfurther attention\
    \ within society, but also within deﬁning a land management framework. Social\n\
    capital is not something that is quantiﬁed as a currency, meaning its inclusion\
    \ is not straight forward.\nThe richness of social networks between consumers\
    \ and producers might be a useful proxy, where\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3416\n\
    10 of 15\nchanges in this could be driven by ad hoc networked learning approaches\
    \ [34]. Irrespective of how\nthis is measured, it is apparent that future work\
    \ should focus more strongly on this dimension for Soil\nSecurity to be truly\
    \ harnessed as a consumer education framework.\n6.3. Soil Security as a Superior\
    \ Land Planning Framework\nOne of the biggest threats to food and ﬁber security\
    \ within Australia, and globally, is removal of\nproductive land from contribution,\
    \ due to the fact of infrastructure and urban development, colloquially\nreferred\
    \ to as “urban creep”. The analogy of “urban creep” into productive land, in relation\
    \ to the\nconcepts of soil health/quality, allows better understanding of the\
    \ interrelation of soil health and soil\nquality terms, and how soil condition\
    \ provides a metric with more clarity. Focusing on just soil health\nor soil quality\
    \ and their indicators does not directly address urban creep into primary production\n\
    land. If a soil is healthy/high quality, or the reverse, this ranking does not\
    \ formally aﬀect the ability to\nmake decisions about urban development; building\
    \ an urban precinct on it, for example. Within the\nAustralian political structure,\
    \ the framework for considering the development is removed from both\nthe environmental\
    \ and agricultural frameworks. This disrupts sound and transparent planning.\n\
    Considering the instance where such an urban precinct is built, it will have some\
    \ eﬀect on the\nquantum of land used for primary production. The question then\
    \ is: “If the urban precinct was built\non poorer health/lower quality land would\
    \ this have less of an eﬀect for Australia as a whole, than\nif it were built\
    \ on healthy/high-quality land?” The short answer is yes. Covering productive\
    \ land\nwith urban development places pressure on the remaining productive land\
    \ to either produce more or\nexpand into less productive regions. To quantify\
    \ this somewhat, 1.0 m2 of high-productivity coastal\nland (e.g., Hunter Valley,\
    \ New South Wales) is roughly equivalent to 260 m2 worth of land in less\nproductive\
    \ regions (e.g., Dubbo, NSW)—these calculations were made using dry sheep equivalent\n\
    without consideration to cropping/horticulture (high-value production) capabilities,\
    \ so the real ﬁgure\nfor lost land and increased pressure would likely be greater;\
    \ this is a conservative measure). This means\nfor every 1.0 ha of productive\
    \ land lost, up to 260 ha of land would need to be introduced to replace this\n\
    lost land. With a rapidly diminishing capability to farm new land, this actually\
    \ equates to increasingly\nimmense pressure on current production systems.\nIn\
    \ this analogy, knowing whether the soil is healthy or of high quality does not\
    \ allow us to make\nland-use decisions in a systematic fashion. It might inform\
    \ such decisions, but not within a single\nframework. The Soil Security concept\
    \ provides the framework with which to make these decisions well\ninformed, not\
    \ just on the productive land in the region, but on a larger scale and across\
    \ more aspects\n(e.g., ecosystem services and socio-economic imperatives). The\
    \ soil health and quality intentions are\ncaptured within “soil condition” and\
    \ then expanded on through the framework to directly inform such\nissues as urban\
    \ creep via quantifying the natural capital of the land within a single framework.\n\
    A Soil Security framework allows Australia’s food- and ﬁber-producing land to\
    \ be protected\nfrom undue minimization through urban encroachment, but it is\
    \ not done at the expense of urban\ndevelopment. It allows the most strategic\
    \ land for urban development to be simultaneously identiﬁed\nin the same assessment\
    \ that strategic agricultural land is identiﬁed. That is, Soil Security provides\n\
    governments with a framework that simultaneously rewards land stewardship via\
    \ decommoditization,\nimproving ecosystem services through this incentivized improved\
    \ land management, strategically\nidentifying urban development locations, and\
    \ better deﬁning where public money needs to be spent\non managing natural resource\
    \ services.\n7. Research Gaps\nIn presenting Soil Security as a framework for\
    \ Australian adoption, a number of areas requiring\nfurther research have been\
    \ identiﬁed. It is extremely important to note that a research continuum can\n\
    coexist on a parallel timeline to the implementation of a Soil Security framework.\
    \ That is, the fact\nthat there are research gaps need not hold up the investigation\
    \ and development of a Soil Security\nframework for Australia, nor any other country.\n\
    Sustainability 2019, 11, 3416\n11 of 15\nThere is a need to build, consolidate,\
    \ and disseminate knowledge in the areas of:\n•\nConnectivity. The connectivity\
    \ dimension is potentially the most important dimension for the\nSoil security\
    \ framework to be successfully implemented, as it provides the education, market\n\
    motivation, and social license to operate. There needs to be an authentic and\
    \ valued discourse in\norder for Soil Security to succeed. How to instigate this\
    \ in a measured manner, as well as be able\nto account for it in at least a semi-quantitative\
    \ manner, will be required to map Soil Security.\n•\nThe ability to capture social\
    \ capital within the framework presents some immediate challenges, as\nit is not\
    \ appropriate to quantify it in terms of units of social capital. Within the concept\
    \ of the\nsocial license to operate, it may be that this is suﬃcient as a measure\
    \ of the social capital from\na codiﬁcation point of view, but it will fail to\
    \ capture the true value of a well implemented Soil\nSecurity framework.\n•\n\
    Digital soil mapping and assessment of soil condition at a resolution that is\
    \ eﬀective for a national\naccount requires further thought and speciﬁed design.\
    \ This resolution must also be eﬀective across\nscales (farm, regional, national).\
    \ There are major national and global initiative in digital soil\nmapping [35],\
    \ but the availability of data to achieve the national account resolution will\
    \ remain as\na limitation irrespective of these initiatives. Kidd et al. [14]\
    \ and Yang et al. [36] have demonstrated\nthe implementation of the dimensions\
    \ of the Soil Security framework within Tasmania (Australia)\nand China, respectively.\
    \ These works highlight that the framework is implementable, but also\nthat further\
    \ case studies are a requirement in reﬁning the process and creating the data\
    \ sharing\nculture it requires to achieve the resolution across scales (farm,\
    \ regional, national). This is both a\nsimultaneous implementation and research\
    \ requirement.\n•\nValuing ecosystem services and natural capital on a multi-land-use\
    \ basis will remain a challenge.\nIn addition, while the Soil Security framework\
    \ provides a means by which to better rationalize\nthis, the question of how we\
    \ can design production landscapes to deliver multiple beneﬁts and\nsustain natural\
    \ capital remains. Therefore, there is a simultaneous requirement to commence\n\
    initiation of the Soil Security framework to aid in valuing ecosystem services\
    \ and natural capital,\nwhile considering the research question of how to design\
    \ such production landscapes.\n•\nThe regenerative agriculture movement is gaining\
    \ momentum within Australian agricultural\ncommunities, but is often criticized\
    \ for lacking a scientiﬁc framework as its basis (e.g., [37,38]).\nIn many ways,\
    \ the perceived tenets of regenerative agriculture could be captured within the\n\
    Soil Security framework, as they loosely describe aspects that would be captured\
    \ within the\nﬁve dimensions of Soil Security.\nTherefore, the research gap here\
    \ is one of reframing the\ndiscourse surrounding regenerative agricultural communities,\
    \ as well as seeking to develop\nregenerative agriculture approaches that could\
    \ be measured in terms of a Soil Security framework.\nThis might provide a signiﬁcant\
    \ step in shrinking the chasm between regenerative and conventional\nagriculture\
    \ industries.\nSoil Security, and the issues it encompasses, is a transdisciplinary\
    \ approach that acknowledges\nit is simultaneously between, across, and beyond\
    \ each individual discipline that might be required\nto research and implement\
    \ it. On this basis, no one research discipline, nor institution, is capable\n\
    of doing Soil Security the justice it would require; a concerted eﬀort is required.\
    \ Vitally, social\nsciences would be required in the consideration of all dimensions\
    \ within the Soil Security framework.\nEnsuring that quantitative, qualitative,\
    \ fundamental, and applied research, and their disciplines\nare involved, will\
    \ build stronger schemes, expediting awareness raising and potentially realizing\n\
    previously untapped ﬁnancial resources.\n8. Recommendations\nToutilizetheSoilSecurityconceptasanationalmanagementframework,\

    \ on the Policy Approach\nAs the intention of this paper is not just to describe\
    \ Soil Security, but to present the justiﬁcation\nfor it as a national framework\
    \ within Australia, and informing global adoption, it is prudent to\ndocument\
    \ here the level of scrutiny that has led to writing the paper. The narrative,\
    \ justiﬁcation, and\nsuggested way forward has been developed after extensive\
    \ consultation on the Soil Security concept\nat a global level. Global Soil Security\
    \ Symposia were held in Texas (2015), Paris (2016), and Sydney\n(2018). The ﬁrst\
    \ two symposia provided rigorous discussion of the Soil Security concept, leading\
    \ to\nreﬁnement over several years with contribution from some of the world’s\
    \ best scientists and leading\nglobal stakeholder organizations. The December\
    \ symposium in Sydney provided a unique and open\nplatform for government, scientists,\
    \ and stakeholders to further develop an Australian framework\nthrough consultation.\
    \ As a result of this Sydney (2018) symposium, we have further developed the\n\
    narrative and captured it here such that it can inﬂuence policy development and\
    \ hold a demonstrated\nweight in this inﬂuence.\n10. Implementation of the Policy\n\
    There would be no immediate signiﬁcant ﬁnancial costs to implementation, which\
    \ is a clear\nmotivator for exploring the implementation of a Soil Security Framework\
    \ for Australia. The ﬁrst phase\nof developing a Soil Security framework would\
    \ involve a consultation and communication process.\nImmediate stakeholder engagement\
    \ in scoping the framework is required, while promotion to more\nremoved stakeholders\
    \ in the general public will simultaneously be required. The second phase would\n\
    require further development of a framework, subsequently leading into phase three,\
    \ which would be\nthe implementation process.\nThe lead up to implementation requires:\n\
    (1)\nA working group for an agreed assessment framework;\n(2)\nAn agreed group\
    \ of stakeholders, which must include State and Federal Government\ninstrumentalities;\
    \ and\n(3)\nCatchment—and activity (land-use)—based pilot studies of the assessment\
    \ framework in\neach state.\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3416\n13 of 15\nActual implementation\
    \ in phase three, requires:\n(1)\nA market-driven approach: A key driver for the\
    \ Soil Security concept will be to determine,\nin a manner that facilitates quantiﬁcation,\
    \ how it integrates with industry, and to demonstrate that\nadoption of it serves\
    \ to simultaneously reward good management (based on soil-speciﬁc criteria),\n\
    while promoting decommoditization and the creation of new markets. Without this,\
    \ it does not\nincentivize stakeholder engagement and empowerment at the agricultural\
    \ interface;\n(2)\nThe ability of Governments to priorities public investment\
    \ against private investment oﬀsets:\nSoil Security will allow the Australian\
    \ government to identify where public investment is needed,\nand where it can\
    \ be reduced/withdrawn, due to the private investment addressing ﬂow on eﬀects\n\
    to ecosystem services. There is an associated need to determine the ﬂow on links\
    \ and to develop\na manner of quantifying these within capital development. It\
    \ is important to remember that\nAustralia’s National Capital value is not simply\
    \ economic, indeed it is a function of ecosystem\nservices (natural and social\
    \ capital).\n(3)\nA cultural shift in the value of ecosystem services: whereby\
    \ the natural capital value can be\ndetermined and social capital is able to be\
    \ included in the value scheme. This will likely require\nsigniﬁcant investment\
    \ in education campaigns at all levels, including the general public.\n(4)\nFor\
    \ this to be a truly user-driven framework, it will be important to demonstrate\
    \ that the\nframework must be based on trust and transparency. Trust is the currency\
    \ of agriculture—a\ndecision is not made unless the landholder trusts the source\
    \ of the information or the body\nproviding the option (the alternative is implementation\
    \ by enforced regulation, which we know\ndoes not work). We suggest that there\
    \ is a need for an independent and impartial organization\nthat has ready access\
    \ to the key peak bodies. Importantly, it must be removed from funding,\nresearch,\
    \ corporate industry, and government structures.\n11. Conclusions\nThe Soil Security\
    \ concept oﬀers a framework for sustainable development of the soil resource for\n\
    the beneﬁt of all human society in the maintenance of ecosystem and planetary\
    \ function. It is required\nto be implemented over large areas—nation states seem\
    \ to meet both area and governance criteria.\nSoil security can both be a public-\
    \ and private-sector activity, not simply a regulatory framework.\nIt is more\
    \ about incentives than restrictions or penalties. Work is clearly needed to develop\
    \ the\nmulti-dimensional quantitative assessment framework, and to set-up stakeholder\
    \ groups allied to\neach of the dimensions. Australia is pursuing this idea, as\
    \ is the Republic of Korea. Other countries,\nstates, regions, local government\
    \ areas or private businesses may ﬁnd the approach of new and\ncontinuing beneﬁt.\n\

    \ as the most basic \nsource of material security for human life, has received\
    \ \ngreat attention from various countries. In recent years, \nthe pace of agricultural\
    \ modernization and technological \ndevelopment has accelerated, and people have\
    \ gradually \ncombined agriculture with various types of high-tech and \nintelligent\
    \ algorithms, and the concepts such as “smart \nagriculture”, “precision agriculture”,\
    \ “digital agriculture”, \n“decision agriculture”, and “agriculture 4.0” have\
    \ emerged. \nThese developments are inseparable from the help and \npromotion\
    \ of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Looking \nat the current agricultural\
    \ production process, artificial \nintelligence is everywhere. However, most AI\
    \ applications \nare based on large amounts of data, and the data and time \n\
    cost problems they bring have gradually become new \nchallenges for farmers. In\
    \ response to these challenges, \ndigital twins have come to the forefront of\
    \ agricultural \nresearchers’ minds. Digital twin technology aims to build \n\
    mirror models of information in the hyper-real world, using \ncomputerized virtual\
    \ reality. For example, a model of a plant \ncan be constructed in which its physical\
    \ characteristics \nare transformed into digital information, and this digital\
    \ \ninformation can be used to make it grow naturally in the \nvirtual space beyond\
    \ reality. This makes it easier to develop \nand test new agricultural technologies\
    \ in virtual reality. This \nmeans that issues such as data and time costs are\
    \ no longer \na barrier to progress. Therefore, digital twins have become \nan\
    \ important research direction in the field of agriculture in \nthe future. This\
    \ paper introduces the typical application of \nartificial intelligence in agriculture\
    \ and the development of \ndigital twin technology in agriculture. \nThis paper\
    \ will outline and answer the following \nresearch question:\n· What is the current\
    \ state of development of artificial \nintelligence technologies in agriculture?\
    \ In the whole \nprocess of agricultural production, what are the main \ntechnologies\
    \ and applications of artificial intelligence \ntechnology for different agricultural\
    \ tasks in the \npreproduction, \nmidproduction, \nand \npostproduction \nstages?\n\
    · What is the “digital twins”? What are the basic \ncharacteristics and attributes\
    \ of the architecture based \non digital twins? What are the main technologies\
    \ and \napplication directions of the digital twins?\n· How to integrate digital\
    \ twin technology with \nagriculture? What is the impact of the introduction of\
    \ \nthe digital twins on the agricultural sector? What are the \nscenarios in\
    \ which digital twin technology can be applied \nin the agricultural sector and\
    \ truly benefit from it?\nAbstract: Affected by global economic pressure and epidemics,\
    \ sustainable agriculture has received widespread attention from farmers \nand\
    \ agricultural engineers. Throughout history, agricultural technology has closely\
    \ followed the pace of scientific and technological \ndevelopment and has followed\
    \ the footsteps of mechanization, automation, and intelligence to progress continuously.\
    \ At this stage, \nartificial intelligence (AI) is dominating the field of agriculture\
    \ and advancing the progress of sustainable agriculture. However, the \nlarge\
    \ amount of data required by AI technology and the high cost of data have ensued,\
    \ while the rapid development of virtualization \ntechnology has made people gradually\
    \ begin to consider the application of digital twins (DT) in agriculture. This\
    \ paper examines \nthe application of artificial intelligence technology and digital\
    \ twin technology in smart agriculture in recent years and discusses and \nanalyzes\
    \ the challenges they face and the future directions of development. We find that\
    \ digital twins have great potential for success in \nsustainable agriculture,\
    \ which is of great significance to advancing smart agricultural solutions that\
    \ achieve low cost and high precision \nto meet the growing demand for high-yield\
    \ production from farmers around the world. \nKey words: Smart agriculture, artificial\

    \ opportunities and challenges in the \napplication of artificial intelligence\
    \ technology and digital \ntwin technology in agriculture at this stage? What\
    \ are the \npossible future evolution and development trends?\nThe remainder of\
    \ the paper is organized as follows. \nIn Section 2, starting from the three links\
    \ of the \npreproduction, midproduction, and postproduction stages \nof the agricultural\
    \ production process, the research and \napplication status of artificial intelligence\
    \ in the agricultural \nfield are introduced. An overview of the digital twins\
    \ is \ngiven in Section 3, followed by a description and analysis \nof its current\
    \ state of the art in agriculture. The challenges \nand possible future directions\
    \ of AI and DT in agriculture \nare discussed in Section 4. Finally, a brief conclusion\
    \ is \ngiven in Section 5.\n2. Artificial intelligence in agriculture\nAt present,\
    \ artificial intelligence agriculture dominates \nthe development direction of\
    \ modern agriculture, \nand researchers are committed to applying artificial \n\
    intelligence technology to the whole process of agricultural \nproduction. The\
    \ agricultural production process can be \ndivided into three stages: preproduction,\
    \ midproduction, \nand postproduction. Figure 1 shows the agricultural \nproduction\
    \ process after division. The application of \nartificial intelligence technology\
    \ in the preproduction, \nmidproduction, and postproduction stages of agricultural\
    \ \nproduction is briefly introduced to provide a reference for \nthe rapid and\
    \ effective transformation and improvement \nof intelligent agricultural technology\
    \ and the promotion of \nagricultural industrialization and modernization.\n2.1.\
    \ Preproduction stage of agricultural production\nIn the preproduction stage of\
    \ agriculture, “what are we \ngoing to grow?” is the question that people need\
    \ to consider. \nThe application of artificial intelligence technology to \nthe\
    \ preproduction stage is aimed at helping agricultural \nworkers to grasp the\
    \ prerequisites in the agricultural \nscene. At this stage, we focus on soil fertilizer\
    \ quality \ntesting, irrigation scheme design, seed quality testing, and \ncrop\
    \ yield and quality forecast to briefly introduce the \napplication of AI in agriculture\
    \ in the past five years.\n2.1.1. Soil fertilizer quality testing\nAt the preproduction\
    \ stage of the agricultural process, the \nquality of soil fertilizer plays a\
    \ decisive role in the growth \nof crops. The determination of the content of\
    \ minerals, \nnutrients, and other elements in the soil is an important \nindicator\
    \ to judge whether the soil is polluted (Jia et al., \n2021), and whether it is\
    \ suitable for planting a particular \nplant (Chen et al., 2019; Wilhelm et al.,\
    \ 2022), and whether \nit meets the nutrients required by crops (Kulkarni et al.,\
    \ \n2019). Therefore, it is vital to systematically test and \nevaluate soils\
    \ and fertilizers before planting. There are many \nsubstances in the soil that\
    \ affect crop growth. This paper \nsimply divides them into “human-eye distinguishable”\
    \ \nand “human-eye indistinguishable”, which are introduced \nin the following\
    \ contents respectively. Among them, the \n“human-eye distinguishable” substances\
    \ in the soil are \nmainly the residues from the previous cropping cycle while\
    \ \nthe “human-eye indistinguishable” substances in the soil \nrefer to the physical,\
    \ chemical, and biological indicators \nthat are hardly observable by human beings\
    \ alone and \nrequire the help of some professional detection tools, such \nas\
    \ the content of some trace elements, minerals, and the \nactivity of some microorganisms.\n\
    Firstly, the detection of “human-eye distinguishable” \nsubstances in the soil\
    \ is focused on plant residues that \nhave a major protective effect on the soil.\
    \ Not only do they \nreduce soil erosion and consolidate soil quality, but also\
    \ \nbring nutrients and improve soil structure for recultivation. \nHowever, the\
    \ workload of manually determining the types \nof residues and the coverage rate\
    \ of residues on large \nareas of land is undoubtedly huge and extremely time-\n\
    consuming, and it is subjective and uneven, and the error \nof the results is\
    \ uncertain with the experience of different \nobservers. In this regard, with\
    \ the help of machine vision, \nimage processing and other technologies, people\
    \ have \nproposed a series of reliable, consistent, and automated \nmethods. For\
    \ example, Tao et al. (2021) developed a \ndeep learning method MSCU-net + C,\
    \ which was used to \ndraw the residual coverage area of maize on high spatial\
    \ \nresolution satellite remote sensing images, and classify \ndifferent coverage\
    \ rates and measure the classification \naccuracy index. The results showed that\
    \ the average value \nof IoU increased from 0.8604 to 0.908, and the average \n\
    value of Kappa increased from 0.8864 to 0.9258. Another \nexample is the crop\
    \ residue level estimation using machine \nlearning methods for RGB images of\
    \ three different ground \nimage resolutions (GSD) by Upadhyay’s team (2022).\
    \ The \nRFE-SVM feature selection method was used to obtain \ncross-validation\
    \ scores up to 10 times better than other \nmethods, as well as residual cover\
    \ estimation by location \nfor classified images using a Bayesian-based classification\
    \ \nmodel.\nSecondly, the most familiar part of the “human-eye \nindistinguishable”\
    \ substances in the soil is the detection \nof soil salinity, followed by the\
    \ detection of nitrogen (N), \nphosphorus (P), potassium (K), and carbon (C),\
    \ which are \nthe main nutrients provided by the soil for crop growth. \nSoil\
    \ salinization is closely related to the sustainable \ndevelopment of agriculture\
    \ and is a phenomenon of \nsoil degradation. Therefore, it is of great significance\
    \ to \naccurately monitor soil salinization. Recently, the popular \nway of predicting\
    \ soil salinity is “Internet of things + \nmachine learning”, such as Wang et\
    \ al. (2021) and Wei et \nal. (2020) both used the way combination of “multispectral\
    \ \nNIE et al. / Turk J Agric For\n644\nimage acquisition + machine learning prediction\
    \ model” \nto predict soil salinity. Analyzing the nutrient levels of \nelements\
    \ in the soil and adjusting fertilizer planning to \ncrop needs can not only mitigate\
    \ the general environmental \ndegradation, climatic disasters, and economic losses\
    \ \ncaused by over-fertilization, but also increase crop yields \nand productivity.\
    \ Some typical examples of combining \nmachine learning with soil chemical element\
    \ prediction in \nthe last 5 years are presented in Table 1.\nAfter testing the\
    \ elemental content of the soil, scientific \nfertilization planning based on\
    \ soil nutrient status is the \nbasis for high-quality and high-yielding crops\
    \ (Chen et \nal., 2018; Nie et al., 2021). Uneven distribution and low \nutilization\
    \ of fertilizer will be caused by blind, mechanical \napplication of fertilizer,\
    \ which can even cause adverse \nconsequences such as soil pollution and excess\
    \ crop \nnutrients. Researchers have conducted research on this \nproblem. Chaganti\
    \ et al. (2019) used technologies such \nas machine learning, image processing,\
    \ and the Internet \nof things to optimize fertilizer use decisions on farms.\
    \ \nEscalante et al. (2019) used machine learning to determine \nthe optimal fertilizer\
    \ dose for specific barley varieties. In \nan application program developed by\
    \ Goyal et al. (2021), \nthe fertilizer calculator function provides the user\
    \ with the \nnumber of DAPs, MOPs, and kilograms of urea needed \nfor the crop\
    \ after entering the “crop type” and “number \nof hectares”. These efforts have\
    \ promoted the progress of \nfertilization methods in a more reasonable and accurate\
    \ \ndirection, all of which are of great significance to the \nsustainable development\
    \ of agriculture and the successful \nimplementation of precision agriculture.\n\
    2.1.2. Irrigation scheme design\nBesides soil, water is another decisive factor\
    \ restricting \nagricultural production. In the preproduction stage of \nagriculture,\
    \ proper irrigation planning is the basis for \nsustainable agricultural production\
    \ (García-Tejero et al., \n2011). The introduction of several artificial intelligence\
    \ \ntechnologies has made intelligent and automatic irrigation \npossible, while\
    \ irrigation management and decision \nmaking are continuously optimized, thus\
    \ advancing the \ndevelopment of fine agriculture and sustainable agriculture.\
    \ \nA typical AI-based intelligent irrigation system is shown in \nFigure 2.\n\
    The typical intelligent irrigation system shown in \nFigure 2 is mainly composed\
    \ of terminal monitoring part, \ngateway module, cloud service module, expert\
    \ decision \nsystem, and user terminal. The expert decision system is \na key\
    \ part whose main function is to process, calculate, \npredict, and analyze the\
    \ historical or real-time data in \nthe cloud system through a series of artificial\
    \ intelligence \nalgorithms to obtain the best irrigation decision. As can \n\
    be seen from the figure, the data affecting the decision-\nmaking are mainly irrigation\
    \ water quality, soil condition, \nreference evapotranspiration (ETo), precipitation,\
    \ crop \nfactor and other.\nAgriculture is inseparable from water, and the primary\
    \ \nconcern in the irrigation process is the quality of irrigation \nwater. Traditional\
    \ methods of irrigation water quality \nassessment are cumbersome and costly,\
    \ which increases \nthe burden of farmers. Therefore, the use of artificial \n\
    intelligence technology to predict and manage the quality \nof groundwater is\
    \ a valuable research direction at present. \nZhao et al. (2020) compared the\
    \ CAR-RR model and the \nadvanced CAR-SVR model they developed for depth \nmodeling\
    \ of the groundwater table with the support vector \nregression (SVR) model and\
    \ multiple linear regression \n(MLR) model, and they validated them in the Hetao\

    developed and evaluated Adaboost, random forests (RF), \nartificial neural networks\
    \ (ANNs), and support vector \nregression (SVR) models that predict the Berrechid\
    \ \naquifer in Morocco, promising in low-cost and real-time \nprediction of groundwater\
    \ quality.\nSoil conditions are mainly the determination and \nprediction of soil\
    \ temperature, salt content, and water \ncontent. The daily soil temperature (DST)\
    \ model proposed \nby Zeynoddin et al. (2019), the method for determining \nsoil\
    \ salinity levels and environmental conditions based on \nmachine learning proposed\
    \ by Bashir et al. (2020), and the \nResBiLSTM model for detecting soil water\
    \ content (SWC) \nproposed by Yu et al. (2020a), all provide important \ninformation\
    \ for irrigation demand forecasting. Soil salinity \nprediction has been briefly\
    \ outlined in Section 2.1.1 and \nwill not be repeated here. For soil moisture\
    \ content, the \nmode of “Internet of things + machine learning” is also \nthe\
    \ most widely used mode at present. Thus, Tseng et al. \n(2018) used drones to\
    \ collect images and compared seven \ndifferent prediction methods based on deep\
    \ learning; \nSingh et al. (2019) assembled data collected from sensors \ndeployed\
    \ in the field and weather forecast data from the \nInternet, to analyze and compare\
    \ multiple ML techniques \nto predict future soil moisture.\nReference evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETo) reflects the impact \nof weather on crop water requirements. Using machine\
    \ \nlearning model, people can not only estimate the past and \ncurrent ETo more\
    \ accurately, but also predict the future \nETo value. With the continuous development\
    \ and progress \nof technology, people compare a variety of models to find \n\
    the best method to predict ETo. For example, Huang et \nal. (2019) evaluated CatBoost,\
    \ RF, and SVM models, of \nwhich CatBoost is a machine learning method based on\
    \ \ngradient-boosted decision trees; Ferreira and da Cunha \n(2020) evaluated\
    \ long-term short-term memory (LSTM), \none-dimensional convolutional neural networks\
    \ (1D \nCNN), CNN-LSTM in deep learning models, as well \nas artificial neural\
    \ network (ANN) and random forest \n(RF) in traditional machine learning models;\
    \ Ponraj and \nVigneswaran (2020) trained, validated, and tested datasets \nusing\
    \ multiple linear regression, random forest (RF), \nand gradient augmented regression\
    \ (GBR) algorithms; \nMohammadi and Mehdizadeh (2020) compared PL-SVR, \nRF-SVR,\
    \ PCA-SVR, and COR-SVR models and coupled \nthe whale optimization algorithm (WOA)\
    \ with the best-\nperforming RF-SVR to form a new hybrid called RF-SVR-\nWOA model.\
    \ In addition, researchers have also worked \nto find ways to use less information\
    \ while obtaining more \naccurate results. Nagappan et al. (2020) reduced the\
    \ input \nvariable dimensions from six to three when modeling \nbased on deep\
    \ learning neural networks (DLNN).\n2.1.3. Seed quality testing\nSeed quality\
    \ testing mainly includes purity analysis, variety \ndetermination, germination\
    \ test, viability determination, \nand health determination. Inspection and determination\
    \ \nof seeds by scientific and reliable methods, and thus \nevaluation of seeds,\
    \ are important tools for ensuring seed \nquality, calculating appropriate sowing\
    \ amounts, selecting \nsuitable seed batches, and making rational tillage decisions.\

    reserve of testers have restricted the results of seed quality \ntesting, and\
    \ have made the results lack accuracy and less \nscientific. At present, the seed\
    \ quality testing methods are \nalso mostly combined with “IoT + ML” and generally\
    \ use \nthe Internet of things technology to collect image and other \nsource\
    \ information, mainly spectroscopy, hyperspectral \nimaging (Zhang et al., 2021),\
    \ electronic nose, thermal \nimaging technology, and X-ray imaging technology;\
    \ then \nthe algorithms of machine learning, especially of deep \nlearning, are\
    \ introduced to assist model construction. \nFor example, Larios and his colleagues\
    \ (2020) used \ninfrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and machine learning \nalgorithms\
    \ to distinguish soybean seed vigor, and in \ntheir cross-validation tests, high\
    \ and low vigor soybean \nseeds were discriminated with 100% accuracy. Another\
    \ \nexample, Tigabu et al. (2020) studied the potential of near-\ninfrared spectroscopy\
    \ in the rapid and nondestructive \ndetermination of Chinese fir seed viability,\
    \ and the average \nclassification accuracy of the test was 99% and above. In\
    \ \naddition, Zeng’s team (2019) worked on identifying and \nclassifying the maturity\
    \ stages of cucumber seeds in a \nnondestructive, accurate, fast, and inexpensive\
    \ manner. \nThe single-core near-infrared spectroscopy (SK-NIRS) \ntechnique they\
    \ proposed, successfully distinguished five \ncategories of cucumber seeds with\
    \ different maturity levels \nin a nondestructive state, and obtained an accuracy\
    \ of \n99.69%. These research results show the high adaptability \nand mutual\
    \ achievement of artificial intelligence and seed \nquality detection.\n2.1.4.\
    \ Crop yield and quality forecast\nCrop yield and quality forecasting is one of\
    \ the challenging \nissues in precision agriculture and an important task \nfor\
    \ agricultural decision makers. Accurate crop yield \nforecasting models can help\
    \ farmers decide what to plant \nand when to plant it, as well as help governments\
    \ develop \ntimely food policies, market prices, import/export policies \nand\
    \ proper storage. Crop yield forecasting is not an easy \ntask as crop yields\
    \ depend on many different factors such \nas climate, weather, soil, fertilizer\
    \ use and seed variety (Xu \net al., 2019). The mainstream method in recent years\
    \ is \nto apply artificial intelligence technologies (Paudel et al., \n2021) such\
    \ as machine learning and machine vision to \nforecast crop yield. \nPrior to\
    \ this, researchers have conducted extensive \nsystematic literature review (SLR)\
    \ work: Vaidya et al. \n(2022) focused on precision agriculture and examined \n\
    related work using hyperspectral remote sensing for \ncrop yield prediction and\
    \ estimation; Klompenburg et al. \n(2020) conducted an extensive study of the\
    \ literature on \nyield forecasting and summarized and analyzed it from \nthree\
    \ perspectives: prediction feature selection, machine \nlearning algorithm selection,\
    \ and evaluation parameter \nselection. The results show that the most commonly\
    \ used \nmethods are CNN, LSTM, and DNN; Koirala et al. (2019) \nreviewed methods\
    \ for fruit detection and yield estimation \nusing deep learning, and also recommended\
    \ methods such \nas CNN, LSTM, and deep regression.\n2.2. Midproduction stage\
    \ of agricultural production\nIn the midproduction stage of agricultural production,\
    \ \n“How are we going to grow?” is the core issue that \npeople need to consider.\
    \ At this stage, farmers expect \nhigh yields and high-quality returns through\
    \ newer and \nbetter farming techniques. Around this core goal, various \nagricultural\
    \ intelligent systems have been developed, and \nvarious disease detection and\
    \ control methods have been \nproposed to better answer the question of “how to\
    \ grow”.\n2.2.1. Various agricultural intelligent systems\nAgricultural expert\
    \ system is an intelligent computer \nprogram system, which integrates the knowledge\
    \ and \nexperience of agricultural experts and can deal with the \nproblems in\
    \ the process of agricultural production from \nthe perspective of experts (McKinion\
    \ and Lemmon, \n1985). It is well known that when solving agricultural \nproblems,\
    \ agricultural experts are usually required to have \nconsiderable experience\
    \ accumulation and research basis, \nand have high requirements for talents. However,\
    \ the \nhelp of agricultural experts is not always available when \nfarmers need\
    \ it. In order to solve the above problems, \nagricultural expert system uses\
    \ big data technology to \nintegrate relevant data into database, and establishes\
    \ \nmathematical model through machine learning, so as to \ncarry out heuristic\
    \ reasoning, which can effectively solve \nthe problems encountered by farmers\
    \ and scientifically \nguide planting. For example, Khalil’s apple tree knowledge\
    \ \nsystem designed by CLIPS with Delphi can help farmers \nget the correct diagnosis\
    \ and treatment of more than a \ndozen apple diseases (Khalil et al., 2019).\n\
    In addition, some systems support users to access \nthem through the Internet\
    \ and enter questions to obtain \nexpert-level answers. For example, Galala developed\
    \ a \nsystem for early date coconut disease diagnosis consulting \n(Galala, 2019);\
    \ Adi and Isnanto (2020) developed a rice \nmanagement expert system based on\
    \ positive chain and \ndeterministic factor method, including seed selection \n\
    consultation and pest detection consultation. Such Expert \nQuestion Answering\
    \ System can answer users’ questions \nin natural language with accurate and concise\
    \ natural \nlanguage, which is a research direction that has attracted \nmuch\
    \ attention and has broad development prospects \nin the field of artificial intelligence\
    \ and natural language \nprocessing (Hu, 2006). The emergence of Expert Question\
    \ \nAnswering System combines knowledge map with \nquestion-and-answer system,\
    \ simulates experts to answer \nfarmers ‘ questions one to one, and provides farmers\
    \ \nwith fast, convenient, and accurate query services and \nknowledge decision-making.\n\
    NIE et al. / Turk J Agric For\n648\nRecording, monitoring, and controlling environmental\
    \ \nconditions in agricultural production is particularly \nimportant. Internet\
    \ of things equipment, wireless sensor \nnetworks, suitable sensors, and cloud\
    \ services embedded \nwith the capabilities of artificial intelligence and machine\
    \ \nlearning are the pillars of smart environmental monitoring \n(SEM). Intelligent\
    \ environment detection system plays \nan important role in intelligent or green\
    \ agriculture \n(Nayyar and Puri, 2016; Shahzadi et al., 2016; Sushanth \nand\
    \ Sujatha, 2018; Pathak et al., 2019). It can help people \nobtain soil health,\
    \ water analysis, water pollution level, \nwater level and other factors data,\
    \ and intelligent analysis \nis very important to obtain the sustainable productivity\
    \ of \nthe agricultural sector. In addition, agricultural intelligent \nsystem\
    \ includes weed identification system (Sabzi et \nal., 2018; Espejo-Garcia et\
    \ al., 2020; Yang et al., 2022b), \nagricultural decision support system (Hafezalkotob\
    \ et al., \n2018; Asher and Brosh, 2022), geographic information \nsystem (Manuel\
    \ et al., 2020), portable agricultural \ninformation system (Keerthana et al.,\
    \ 2018; Akhter et al., \n2021), etc.\n2.2.2. Crop disease detection and control\n\
    Plant diseases cause great losses to the production, \neconomy, quality and quantity\
    \ of agricultural products. \nTherefore, it is necessary to monitor the disease\
    \ of crops \nfrom the first stage of crop life cycle to before harvest. The \n\
    traditional method is a visual observation, which is not \nonly time-consuming\
    \ and labor-intensive, but also requires \nsupervisors to have a lot of professional\
    \ knowledge. To \nsolve these problems, researchers have proposed a series \n\
    of automated and intelligent disease detection methods. \nTable 2 lists some typical\
    \ cases of crop pest detection using \nartificial intelligence technology in recent\
    \ years.\nIt is not difficult to see from Table 2 that the main \nimplementation\
    \ methods of disease recognition are \ngradually moving from traditional deep\
    \ learning to few-\nshot learning. This is primarily because the algorithms \n\
    based on Deep Learning typically rely heavily on large \namounts of data. Deep\
    \ Learning driven by big data \nfaces the challenges of the high cost of data\
    \ acquisition, \nhigh cost of high-end hardware and high consumption \nof power\
    \ resources (Li and Chao, 2021b), which is not \nconducive to the sustainable\
    \ development of agriculture. \nIn order to conform to the sustainable development\
    \ of \nagriculture, researchers should focus on the trade-off \nbetween data quality\
    \ and quantity. For the data quality in \nthe agricultural field, Li et al. (Li\
    \ and Chao, 2021a; Li et \nal., 2021; Li et al., 2022b) believed that limited\
    \ good data \ncan defeat a large number of bad data. For the problem of \ndata\
    \ quantity, Yang et al. (2022a) examines the application \nof few-shot learning\
    \ in smart agriculture, and Nie et al. \n(2022) investigated sustainable computing\
    \ in intelligent \nagriculture. The results show that using small sample \nin\
    \ some agricultural tasks can achieve a better model \nalgorithm with less sample\
    \ data.\n2.3. Postproduction stages of agricultural production\nIn the postproduction\
    \ stage of agricultural production, \nit is necessary to consider the harvesting\
    \ of agricultural \nproducts, that is, to achieve the transformation of \nagricultural\
    \ product output to efficiency. The review \nof the postproduction stage of agriculture\
    \ mainly \nfocuses on the harvesting, inspection, and marketing of \nagricultural\
    \ products. Among them, the general trend of \nagricultural product harvesting\
    \ work lies in automation \nand robotization, while the current state of harvesting\
    \ \ntechnology for different types of crops has a different focus; \nagricultural\
    \ product inspection work mainly includes \nmaturity grading, quality inspection\
    \ and appearance \nclassification, and its mainstream technology lies in \ncomputer\
    \ vision technology; every part of agricultural \nproduct marketing work relies\
    \ heavily on the application \nof information technology.\n2.3.1. Harvest of agricultural\
    \ products\nCrop harvesting activities include harvesting, stacking, \nhandling,\
    \ threshing, cleaning, and hauling. These jobs \nare usually tedious and require\
    \ large labor and high \nrepeatability. Under the influence of increasing demand\
    \ \nfor agricultural products and labor shortage, the harvest \nof agricultural\
    \ products needs to improve the level of \nagricultural automation and roboticization.\
    \ \nFor cereal crops, such as wheat and corn, which mature \nevenly in the field,\
    \ large machines can be used to harvest \nthe crop efficiently and on a large\
    \ scale. For melon and fruit \ncrops, different fruits have different growth environment,\
    \ \nspatial location, geometry shape, size, color, hardness, \nand maturity, so\
    \ it is not suitable for uniform harvesting. \nAt the same time, factors such\
    \ as rugged orchard terrain \nand obstacle interference also increase the difficulty\
    \ of \nharvesting melon and fruit crops. The smaller harvesting \nrobots capable\
    \ of sensing and adapting to different crop \ntypes or environmental changes are\
    \ therefore required \nfor harvesting (Zhao et al., 2016; Silwal et al., 2017).\
    \ At \npresent, fruit harvesting robots can already use visual \nperception to\
    \ perceive and learn crop information, which \ncan complete camera calibration\
    \ (Wang et al., 2019), \ntarget recognition and localization (Yu et al., 2020b),\
    \ \ntarget background recognition (Feng et al., 2019), 3D \nreconstruction (Kusumam\
    \ et al., 2017; Blok et al., 2019; \nOnishi et al., 2019), robot behavior planning\
    \ based on \nvisual positioning (Gongal et al., 2015; Wibowo et al., \n2016),\
    \ and avoid complex factors interference localization \n(Xiong et al., 2018) and\
    \ other tasks. The object recognition \nmethods for these harvesting robots are\
    \ mainly single-\nfeature vision methods, multifeature fusion methods, and \n\
    deep learning algorithms. In addition, the study found \nthat for sweet potato,\
    \ potato, yam, taro, and other root \nNIE et al. / Turk J Agric For\n649\nTable\

    \ J Agric For\n650\ncrops (also known as potato crops) growing in the soil, the\
    \ \nharvesting technology mostly stays in the way of manual \nmining, or semiman\
    \ and semimechanical harvesting at \npresent. There are few intelligent automatic\
    \ harvesting \ntechnologies for this kind of crop, and most of them remain \n\
    in the development of mechanical institutions (Bahadirov \net al., 2020; Matmurodov\
    \ et al., 2020) and the optimization \nstage of the automatic control system,\
    \ which need to be \nbroken through and improved.\n2.3.2. Inspection of agricultural\
    \ products\nWith the support of various intelligent algorithms, \nmicroelectronic\
    \ systems, nanotechnology, sensors, on-site \nrapid detection technology, and\
    \ remote data transmission \nand processing technology, the agricultural product\
    \ \ninspection, and detection system tend to be miniaturized \nand intelligent.\
    \ This paper mainly introduces the inspection \nof agricultural products under\
    \ the influence of artificial \nintelligence from three aspects of maturity classification,\
    \ \nquality inspection, and appearance classification. \n2.3.2.a. Maturity classification\n\
    Firstly, judging the maturity of agricultural products \nand choosing appropriate\
    \ preservation methods are the \nprerequisites for consumers to obtain fresh agricultural\
    \ \nproducts. The ripening process of fruit is usually \naccompanied by changes\
    \ in color, aroma, texture, and \npattern. These changes are usually gradual,\
    \ subtle, and \ninappropriate for human judgment. Using artificial \nintelligence\
    \ can quickly and accurately grasp these changes \nthat are not obvious in the\
    \ eyes of people, so as to judge the \nimmaturity, maturity, and decay of agricultural\
    \ products. \nUsing artificial intelligence, researchers have proposed \nvarious\
    \ detection methods of fruit ripeness based on \nsound, light, color, and taste,\
    \ and combined them with \nintelligent algorithms (Balbin et al., 2018; Gutierrez\
    \ et al., \n2019; Zhang et al., 2020). The method of fruit ripeness \ndetection\
    \ using acoustic vibration (Fadchar et al., 2020) \nis a typical example of the\
    \ abovementioned sound-based \nmethods; the light-based detection methods mainly\
    \ \ninclude spectral technology and hyperspectral imaging \ntechnology (Pu et\
    \ al., 2019; Garillos-Manliguez et al., \n2021); the color-based fruit ripening\
    \ detection methods \nuse color feature extraction technology (Alfatni et al.,\
    \ 2020; \nZhong et al., 2021); and there is no doubt that methods \nusing the\
    \ electronic nose (Jia et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2021) \nexemplify taste-based\
    \ approach. At this stage, spectral \ntechnology and hyperspectral imaging technology\
    \ are \nstill the mainstream. However, the expensive equipment \nlimits their\
    \ large-scale application and development, and \nlow-cost photodiode-based fruit\
    \ maturity estimation \n(Giovenzana et al., 2015; Bhatnagar et al., 2019) may\
    \ \nbecome a more popular direction in the future.\n2.3.2.b. Quality inspection\n\
    The quality and safety of agricultural products is directly \nrelated to people’s\
    \ health, and its quality testing is mainly \ndivided into two aspects: component\
    \ content testing and \ndamage testing. Firstly, for ingredient content detection,\
    \ \nthe easiest way is of course to cut it open and conduct \nchemical inspection.\
    \ However, due to the consideration \nof food protection and sustainable agriculture,\
    \ in \nrecent years, people have been striving for physical \nnondestructive testing.\
    \ Taking fruit sweetness analysis as \nan example, Tran et al. (2021) used a simple\
    \ spectroscopic \nsystem with a classifier based on machine learning they \ndeveloped\
    \ and trained to detect apple sweetness, with \na maximum accuracy of 91.5%; Nguyen\
    \ et al. realized \nthe precise sweetness classification of mango by using \n\
    low cost visible near infrared ( VIS-NIR ) multispectral \nsensors and random\
    \ forest ( RF ) classifier. Secondly, \nthe nondestructive damage detection of\
    \ fruits is of great \nsignificance for screening bad fruits and fruit grading.\
    \ The \ndamage of agricultural products is divided into internal \ndamage and\
    \ surface damage. Here, the surface damage can \nbe classified as appearance classification\
    \ of agricultural \nproducts, so internal damage is mainly introduced here. \n\
    Traditional physical methods include magnetic resonance \nimaging (Thybo et al.,\
    \ 2004), acoustic localization (Yoshida \net al., 2018), computer tomography (Meberg\
    \ et al., 2001) \nand so on. However, these methods are either complicated \n\
    to operate, expensive, or not compatible with different \nfruits, so they are\
    \ not suitable for large-scale production \npractice. Therefore, researchers have\
    \ proposed to apply the \ndeep learning algorithm. Only by determining the internal\
    \ \ndamage of a small number of samples to train the classifier \nmodel, the machine\
    \ can quickly and reliably predict the \nsituation of a large number of fruits.\
    \ In the nondestructive \ndetection of withered kernels in shelled walnuts, Zhai\
    \ et \nal. (2020) used walnut images and weight information \nto fuse the training\
    \ of the machine learning algorithm, \nand achieved 97% classification accuracy\
    \ with only 0.001 \naverage cost calculation time.\n2.3.2.c. Appearance classification\n\
    The classification of agricultural products according to \ntheir appearance characteristics,\
    \ such as size, shape, color \nand so on, is also an important step before their\
    \ sales work. \nHowever, the efficiency of manual operation is low and \nthe influence\
    \ of subjectivity is large, and the accuracy rate \nof pure mechanical operation\
    \ is low. That is why people \nwant to apply artificial intelligence to the classification\
    \ \nof agricultural products. After the introduction of a very \nreliable inspection\
    \ tool-machine vision technology, the \nfruit can be accurately and efficiently\
    \ identified and \nclassified according to the color, texture, shape, disease\
    \ \ndefects, and other characteristics, which is helpful to \nincrease yield,\
    \ reduce production time and improve quality \nNIE et al. / Turk J Agric For\n\
    651\ncontrol (Ayyub and Manjramkar, 2019). Such methods \nhave been relatively\
    \ mature at this stage, so the problems \nto be considered have gradually shifted\
    \ from the method \nitself to how to put them into practical application.\n2.3.3.\
    \ Sales of agricultural products\nThe final work of the postproduction stages\
    \ of agricultural \nis the sale of agricultural products, which needs to \nbe\
    \ processed, packaged, transported, and sold. In the \ntransportation process,\
    \ most agricultural products are \nperishable, which inevitably leads to certain\
    \ losses. People \nwill be based on the Internet of things radio frequency \n\
    identification technology is applied to this, through the \ndynamic way to obtain\
    \ product information, so that \nmanagers can monitor the whole circulation process,\
    \ \nreal-time tracking. In this way, it can effectively plan the \nquantity of\
    \ product storage and transportation, reduce \noperating costs and prevent transportation\
    \ losses. In \nthe sales process, artificial intelligence technology can \nbe\
    \ applied to collect data on production, consumption, \nstorage, and circulation,\
    \ and in-depth analysis of the whole \nmarket. It can effectively understand the\
    \ current level of \nagricultural development, prevent sharp rise or fall, and\
    \ \npromote more stable product transactions. In addition, \nthe online marketing\
    \ of mobile or PC-side e-commerce \nplatforms built by artificial intelligence\
    \ and Internet \ntechnology can maximize the use of online integration \nadvantages\
    \ to effectively integrate information resources, \nreduce production costs, and\
    \ improve the relationship \nbetween suppliers and consumers. At the same time,\
    \ based \non the Internet of things and mobile network technology \n(Zhou and\
    \ Zhou, 2012), the information management \nof agricultural production and circulation\
    \ process, the \ntraceability management of agricultural product quality \n(Yang\
    \ et al., 2018), the management of agricultural product \nproduction archives\
    \ (origin environment, production \nprocess, and quality detection), and the establishment\
    \ \nof agricultural product quality and safety traceability \nsystem based on\
    \ website and mobile phone short message \nplatform (Tian, 2017; Zheng et al.,\
    \ 2021) can realize the \ntraceability of the whole quality and service of agricultural\
    \ \nproduct quality and safety, improve the brand effect of \ntraceability agricultural\
    \ products, and ensure the quality \nand safety of agricultural products.\n3.\
    \ Digital twins in agriculture\n3.1. Overview of digital twins\n3.1.1. General\
    \ definition of digital twins\nReview history, the prototype of digital twins,\
    \ “mirror \nspace model”, was first conceived by Michael Grieves in \n2003 (Githens,\
    \ 2007). In 2010, the National Aeronautics \nand Space Administration (NASA) adopted\
    \ two identical \naircrafts, one was the native and the other one was \nthe twin,\
    \ to realize the comprehensive diagnosis and \nprediction function of the flight\
    \ system, which led to the \nconcept of “digital twins” (Piascik et al., 2010).\
    \ In 2014, \nMichael Grieves provided another detailed definition \nof digital\
    \ twins. He proposed that the basic framework \nof the digital twins system should\
    \ include the physical \nspace, the virtual space, and the flow of information\
    \ and \ndata connecting the two spaces (Grieves, 2014). With the \ndevelopment\
    \ of related technologies, the definition of the \nterm “digital twins” has been\
    \ more widely discussed by \ndifferent researchers and institutions. For example,\
    \ Mayani \net al. (2018) saw the digital twins as a bridge between the \nphysical\
    \ and digital worlds; Wanasinghe (2020) regarded it \nas an immersive data analysis\
    \ technique; Poddar (2018) and \nSharma et al. (2018) regarded it as a virtual\
    \ and simulated \nmodel or a realistic replica of a physical asset. Although \n\
    these definitions differ somewhat from each other, none of \nthem has ever departed\
    \ from the basic framework of the \ndigital twins.\nA general definition of digital\
    \ twins is that it refers \nto the establishment and simulation of a physical\
    \ entity, \nprocess, or system in the information platform. By \nintegrating physical\
    \ feedback data, assisted by artificial \nintelligence, machine learning and software\
    \ analysis, \na digital simulation is established in the information \nplatform,\
    \ and this simulation will automatically make \ncorresponding changes with the\
    \ change of physical entities \naccording to feedback. Ideally, digital twins\
    \ can self-learn \naccording to multiple feedback source data, and present \n\
    the real situation of physical entities in the digital world \nalmost in real\
    \ time. In other words, with the help of digital \ntwins, the state of physical\
    \ entities can be understood on \nthe information platform, and the predefined\
    \ interface \ncomponents in physical entities can be controlled (Schleich \net\
    \ al., 2017; Vatn, 2018; Liu et al., 2019).\n3.1.2. Basic architecture of digital\
    \ twins\nThe most typical and widely accepted DT framework \nstill consists of\
    \ three main components: “physical space”, \n“virtual space”, and “connections\
    \ between these spaces” \n(Grieves, 2014). Among them, the physical space contains\
    \ \nphysical assets, sensors, and actuators; the virtual space \nincludes multiphysics,\
    \ multiscale, probabilistic simulation \nmodels; and the connection between the\
    \ physical space \nand the virtual space ensures seamless data and drive \ncommand\
    \ exchange between these two spaces. With \nthe continuous expansion and upgrading\
    \ of application \ndemands, DT faces more service demands from different \nfields,\
    \ different levels of users, and different services (Qi \net al., 2021). At the\
    \ same time, the interconnection of all \nthings provides conditions for realizing\
    \ the information \nphysical interaction and data integration of DT. To facilitate\
    \ \nfurther applications of DT in more domains, researchers \nhave extended the\
    \ three-component DT framework. Tao \nNIE et al. / Turk J Agric For\n652\nand\
    \ Zhang added “DT data fusion” and “service system” \nmodules to the original\
    \ framework which have only \n“physical space” and “virtual space”, and the connection\
    \ \nbetween them was also expanded accordingly. The six-\ncomponent framework\
    \ proposed by Parrott and Warshaw \nconsists of five enabling components and a\
    \ six-step \nprocess. Their work embodies “physical space” and “virtual \nspace”:\
    \ “sensors” and “actuators” in enabling components, \nand “act”, “create”, and\
    \ “communicate” in processes belong \nto physical space; while the enabling components\
    \ “data” \nand “analytics”, as well as the “aggregate”, “analyze”, and \n“insight”\
    \ processes belong to the virtual space; in addition, \nthe role of “integration”\
    \ is to connect the physical and \nvirtual worlds.\n3.1.3. Key technologies and\
    \ typical applications of digital \ntwins\nThe digital twins exists in virtual\
    \ form, which can not \nonly reflect the characteristics, behavior process and\
    \ \nperformance of physical objects in a highly realistic way, \nbut also realize\
    \ real-time monitoring, evaluation, and \nmanagement in a surreal form. Its ability\
    \ to present a \nsurreal mirror image of the target physical entity object \n\
    relies on the support of the following technologies: high-\nperformance computing,\
    \ advanced sensing acquisition, \ndigital simulation, high-fidelity modeling,\
    \ intelligent data \nanalysis, VR presentation, etc. By constructing digital \n\
    twins, not only the health state of the target entity can be \ndescribed perfectly\
    \ and meticulously, but also the deep, \nmultiscale, and probabilistic dynamic\
    \ state assessment, \nlife prediction, and task completion rate analysis can be\
    \ \nrealized through the integration of data and physics.\nThrough the integration\
    \ with artificial intelligence, \nmobile Internet, cloud computing, big data analysis,\
    \ \nand other technologies, DT has potential application \nvalue in many fields\
    \ involving physical and virtual space \nmapping, fusion, and collaborative evolution.\
    \ DT can be \napplied in different fields such as smart city, construction, \n\
    medical treatment, agriculture, freight, drilling platform, \nautomobile, aerospace,\
    \ manufacturing, electric power, and \nother fields.\n3.2. The applications of\
    \ digital twins in agriculture\nWith the current global expectations for the agricultural\
    \ \nfield, scientific and technological achievements such as \nagricultural artificial\
    \ intelligence technology, agricultural \nInternet of things technology, agricultural\
    \ data model \nanalysis system, and agricultural intelligent equipment \ncontinue\
    \ to emerge. Agriculture has basically realized \ndigitalization and networking,\
    \ is moving towards the \nstage of intelligence and virtualization. The emergence\
    \ \nof the agricultural digital twins system will realize the \norganic integration\
    \ of the physical entity of agricultural \nproduction and the digital cyberspace,\
    \ so as to realize the \nintegration of “connection-perception-decision-control”.\
    \ \nThis will support the better realization of accurate, efficient, \nand sustainable\
    \ smart agriculture, and provide new \nmomentum for the digital transformation\
    \ and upgrading \nof agriculture.\nAgricultural digital twins are mainly based\
    \ on the \nelements of the agricultural production process (physical \nentities)\
    \ as the object, focus on the digital solidification \nof agricultural knowledge\
    \ based on various types of \nproduction models, system rules, and data collections.\
    \ \nAgricultural digital twins are dedicated to constructing \nmultidimensional,\
    \ multiscale, multidisciplinary, and \nmultiphysical quantity dynamic virtual\
    \ models to portray \nthe attributes, behaviors, and laws of each element in the\
    \ \nagricultural production process to replace some complex \nexperiments in real\
    \ environments. Figure 3 shows a typical \nschematic diagram of an agricultural\
    \ digital twins system. \nIn the figure, the virtual model is constructed based\
    \ on \nagricultural entities and iteratively interacts and optimizes \nwith them\
    \ in the agricultural production process. Through \nthe data and information interaction\
    \ between the twin \ndata fed back to the 3D model and the physical world, the\
    \ \nintegrity of the digital world is continuously improved, \nand then precise\
    \ control over agricultural entities can \nbe achieved. The agricultural digital\
    \ twin system realizes \nthe simulation, monitoring, diagnosis, prediction and\
    \ \ncontrol of agricultural objects by constructing real-\ntime and accurate digital\
    \ mapping of physical objects—\nanimals, plants, and motion trajectories—in virtual\
    \ \nspace. According to the state of agricultural entities in the \nphysical world\
    \ and application requirements, quantitative \nprediction, and decision feedback\
    \ are carried out.\nDigital twins have been used less in agriculture in \nrecent\
    \ years. Our examination of it reveals its main \napplications as follows.\nAgricultural\
    \ product model was established to monitor \ncrop growth or determine crop quality\
    \ parameters. Li et al. \n(2022a) proposed a single-view leaf reconstruction method\
    \ \nof plant growth digital twins system based on deep learning \nResNet, which\
    \ provided important ideas and methods for \nsingle-view leaf reconstruction in\
    \ plant growth digital twins \nsystem. Evers et al. (2020) are committed to developing\
    \ \ndigital twins of greenhouse tomato crops, updating the \n3D simulation model\
    \ through real-time input of sensor \ninformation from real greenhouses, so as\
    \ to simulate the \ninteraction between crop quality, environmental factors, \n\
    and crop management. Pattanaik and Jenamani (2020) \ncreated digital twins of\
    \ three different mango varieties, \nAlphonso, Totapuri, and Kesar, and accurately\
    \ simulated \nthe cooling behavior of real mangoes according to the \nairflow\
    \ rate and temperature, so as to analyze and grasp \nthe cooling heterogeneity\
    \ and quality attenuation in \nthe process of mango export. Kampker et al. (2019)\
    \ \nestablished a plastic “potato digital twin” as a substitute for \nNIE et al.\
    \ / Turk J Agric For\n653\nreal potatoes to detect the impact and rotation of\
    \ potatoes \nduring harvest.\nThe environment model is established to obtain \n\
    decision support. The farm management simulation tool \nAgROS developed by Tsolakis\
    \ et al. (2019) allows the \nintroduction of static object layout characteristics\
    \ such \nas actual fields and trees, so as to carry out field tests of \nagricultural\
    \ robots or autonomous unmanned ground \nvehicles (UGV) in quasireal environment.\
    \ Jo et al. (2018) \nproposed an intelligent pig farm based on digital twins \n\
    to improve animal welfare, and conducted a feasibility \nstudy on it. Alves et\
    \ al. (2019) established a digital twins \nintelligent farm using sensing data\
    \ from soil detectors, \nweather stations, irrigation systems, and equipment to\
    \ \nobtain visual return and decision-making suggestions. \nMoghadam et al. (2020)\
    \ developed an automatic dynamic \ncrown monitoring system, AgScan3D +, which\
    \ is now \nused in mango, macadamia, avocado, and vine orchards \nand generates\
    \ digital twins of 15,000 trees. It uses a \nrotating 3D camera to create a digital\
    \ twin model for each \ntree in the orchard, and monitors the health, structure,\
    \ \npressure, fruit quality, and other indicators of each tree to \npredict pressure,\
    \ disease, and crop loss, and provide real-\ntime farm decision support for farmers.\

    \ \nof the European IoF2020 project.\n4. Discussion\nThis chapter focuses on “AI\
    \ in agriculture” and “DT in \nagriculture”, and discusses and analyzes the challenges\
    \ \nand future development trends of these two technologies \nin agriculture at\
    \ this stage. In Subsections 4.1 and 4.2, the \nchallenges and development trends\
    \ of AI in agriculture are \ndiscussed respectively, while the corresponding contents\
    \ \nof digital twin are discussed in Subsections 4.3 and 4.4.\n4.1. Challenges\
    \ of artificial intelligence\nThe survey shows that the abovementioned AI \ntechnologies\
    \ \nare \ncutting-edge \nagricultural \nscience \nresearch hotspots, and their\
    \ applications run through the \npreproduction, midproduction, and postproduction\
    \ stages \nof the agricultural production process. They have helped \nto achieve\
    \ intelligent management and precise control, \nimprove production efficiency\
    \ and product quality, and \nreduce environmental pollution and energy waste.\
    \ They \nhave shown excellent performance and great application \npotential and\
    \ have undoubtedly played a role in promoting \nwork related to agricultural sustainability.\
    \ At the same \ntime, we find that AI in agriculture, especially in the field\
    \ \nof agricultural sustainability, still faces many challenges:\n· Various artificial\
    \ intelligence technologies have \nnot been integrated and implemented with intelligent\
    \ \nequipment widely and on a large scale, and the intelligent \nagricultural\
    \ system still needs to be improved. On the \none hand, different types and growth\
    \ cycles of crops have \ndifferent growth states, which makes the agricultural\
    \ \nanalysis model not have a universal; on the other hand, the \nhigh cost or\
    \ lack of key technologies and equipment makes \nit impossible for various intelligent\
    \ algorithms to be put \ninto agricultural production on a large scale. Therefore,\
    \ \nmost of the research on it is still in the process of algorithm \ndevelopment,\
    \ which fails to enable farmers to truly enjoy \nthe convenience of artificial\
    \ intelligence algorithms.\n· The application of AI in various fields of agriculture\
    \ \nlacks in-depth analysis with relevance. The factors involved \nin agricultural\
    \ production are complex. Regions, seasons, \ntypes of crops, production environments,\
    \ and operating \nmethods all affect the application effect of various \nintelligent\
    \ technologies. At the present stage, most of the \nstudies only stay on the acquisition\
    \ and surface analysis \nof agricultural data. They fail to start from the excavation\
    \ \nof agricultural production laws and lack the deep analysis \nof error laws\
    \ with the correlation between theory and \npractice.\n· The global level of agricultural\
    \ automation and \nintensification is uneven, and there is a technological \n\
    gap between developing and developed countries. The \nmain manifestation is that\
    \ developing countries are prone \nto form shortcomings in basic theory, core\
    \ algorithms, \nkey equipment, high-end chips, and major systems and \nsoftware\
    \ of agricultural artificial intelligence.\n· Artificial intelligence technology\
    \ in agriculture is \ninseparable from the support of a large amount of data,\
    \ \nand how to obtain high-quality data information is one of \nthe challenges\
    \ in the future. Big data mining in agriculture \nis the process of extracting\
    \ potentially useful agricultural \ninformation and crop growth laws from a large\
    \ number of \nincomplete, noisy, fuzzy, and random agricultural data. At \npresent,\
    \ the segmentation and data mining of agricultural \nInternet of Things data resources\
    \ are still in the initial \nstage, and the intelligent algorithm models and practical\
    \ \ndatabases in various agricultural fields are in urgent need \nof expansion.\
    \ With the continuous updating and expansion \nof intelligent algorithms, at this\
    \ stage, the amount of data \nrequired and data costs are both increasing. At\
    \ the same \ntime, agricultural data obtained in the real world is limited \n\
    by the crop growth cycle, and the problems of complex \nacquisition methods and\
    \ long acquisition periods are also \na big challenge for researchers.\n· Restricted\
    \ by factors such as the shrinking global \neconomy, limited scientific and cultural\
    \ exchanges, sluggish \nhigh-tech development, lack of talents, and inadequate\
    \ \ninfrastructure, the infrastructure, policies and regulations, \ninvestment\
    \ in agricultural scientific research, and talent \npools in related fields adapted\
    \ to the development of smart \nagriculture gradually fail to meet the growing\
    \ demand for \nagricultural pressure. It is also a great challenge to balance\
    \ \nthe impact of unfavorable factors on the highly intelligent \ndevelopment\
    \ of sustainable agriculture.\n4.2. Future directions of artificial intelligence\n\
    Artificial intelligence technology, which has a broad \napplication space in agriculture,\
    \ is a pillar to promote \nsmart agriculture. Faced with the above challenges,\
    \ the \nfollowing suggestions for the possible development of \nartificial intelligence\
    \ technology in agriculture are put \nforward as follows:\n· Attention should\
    \ be paid to the improvement of \nthe computing force and technology implementation\
    \ of \nagricultural AI. The computing force is one of the important \nefficiency\
    \ indicators of agricultural AI. Conventional AI \nalgorithms are too computationally\
    \ intensive to be directly \nintegrated and applied to traditional IoT systems.\
    \ The \nlightweight and efficient algorithm models, such as Few-\nshot Learning\
    \ and so on, are easy to embed in IoT devices \nand compute at the edge of the\
    \ devices, thereby realizing \nAI applications on the IoT devices.\nNIE et al.\
    \ / Turk J Agric For\n655\n· Research and development of more universal \nagricultural\
    \ artificial intelligence equipment, strengthening \nstandardization and standardized\
    \ management, and \nimproving the level of agricultural intelligence on \na large\
    \ scale and without threshold are necessary. \nArtificial intelligence equipment\
    \ is an important part \nof artificial intelligence technology, among which the\
    \ \ncore technologies such as artificial intelligence chips and \nintelligent\
    \ sensors need to be developed and optimized. In \norder to meet the different\
    \ performance requirements of \nagricultural application scenarios, it is necessary\
    \ to carry \nout continuous and in-depth research, formulate relevant \nstandards\
    \ around the integration of AI technology and \nagricultural IoT, agricultural\
    \ machinery equipment and \nagricultural big data, and develop agricultural artificial\
    \ \nintelligence terminal equipment with lower cost and \nhigher robustness.\n\
    · People should focus on the fact that technology \ndevelopment and information\
    \ security go hand in hand, \nfocus on agricultural data security, and build a\
    \ green \ndata-sharing model. The development of agricultural \nAI technology\
    \ relies on data. Agricultural data have \nthe characteristics of large volume,\
    \ various types, and \nwide sources. It is necessary to ensure the security of\
    \ \nagricultural data and information systems to ensure the \nsafe production,\
    \ accurate management, and intelligent \ndecision-making of agriculture. At the\
    \ same time, \nestablishing a safe, efficient, and mature agricultural \ndata\
    \ open sharing mode can promote not only the rapid \ndevelopment of intelligent\
    \ agriculture, but also the \ninevitable trend of the environment.\n· The cross-integration\
    \ of different fields should be \npromoted to lead to the transformation of the\
    \ modern \nagricultural development mode. In order to meet the \nincreasingly\
    \ diversified agricultural production tasks, it \nis necessary to promote the\
    \ integrated development of \nagricultural AI in different fields. For example,\
    \ integrating \nthe real-world agricultural process with the virtual-world \n\
    agricultural model can reduce the cost and time cycle of \nagricultural data acquisition\
    \ and accelerate AI technology \niteration in the real world.\n4.3. Challenges\
    \ of digital twins\nAs a cutting-edge technology, the digital twin technology\
    \ \nhas received widespread attention from industries that it \nwill revolutionize.\
    \ Driven by technological updates and \nhistorical experience, the digital twins\
    \ can almost reflect \nall aspects of products, processes, or services. However,\
    \ the \nstudy found that the current potential of the digital twins \nin agriculture\
    \ is far from being realized, and there are still \nmany challenges in the development\
    \ of agricultural digital \ntwin technology: \n· It is easy to see that digital\
    \ twin technology is still in \nits infancy and rising stage in the agricultural\
    \ field, and the \ntechnology and tools need to be developed. Researchers \nhave\
    \ to collect and merge various types of data to model \nall the different parts\
    \ of an agricultural object or system \nfrom scratch, which will be a complex\
    \ and lengthy process.\n· How to form and design cognitive digital twins? At \n\
    this stage, although some low-level operations can be \nimplemented autonomously\
    \ without human intervention, \nmany decision-making activities still need to\
    \ be maintained \nby manual operations based on human interaction. How \nto enable\
    \ spontaneous and intervention-free simulation \nfree from human control and seamless\
    \ interaction among \nmultiple models is also a major challenge in the research\
    \ \nprocess.\n· DT offers real-time simulation possibilities for the \nproduct\
    \ lifecycle and can even help integrate the entire \nsupply chain through all\
    \ stages of its lifecycle. However, \nconnecting data information collected, aggregated,\
    \ and \nexchanged between different suppliers, manufacturers, and \ncustomers\
    \ in a virtual space, or fusing digital twin models \ndeveloped using different\
    \ DT architectures, technologies, \ninterfaces, communication protocols, models,\
    \ and \ndata, can pose interoperability issues. Therefore, the \ndevelopment of\
    \ standard-based interoperability for digital \ntwin applications is undoubtedly\
    \ another major challenge \nfor digital twin technology.\n4.4. Future directions\
    \ of digital twins\nSince its inception, the digital twin has shown great \npromise\
    \ in many aspects. With the further development of \nits technology and the increasing\
    \ maturity of agricultural \nvirtualization technology, everything in the physical\
    \ \nworld may be replicated in digital space by digital twin \ntechnology in the\
    \ future. The following are some outlooks \non future applications of the digital\
    \ twin in agriculture: \n· Digital twin technology will become the best \npractice\
    \ in various agricultural sectors. DT supports \nmanufacturing and controlling\
    \ the entire life cycle of \na product or process and therefore can model complex\
    \ \nlinks in agricultural production processes from physical \nto virtual in order\
    \ to obtain agricultural information. \nFor example, by constructing the plant\
    \ model, the crop \nlife cycle and environmental changes can be accelerated \n\
    in the virtual space, so that the data of each stage can be \neasily obtained.\
    \ By constructing virtual workshops and \npreviewing robot motion planning schemes\
    \ to simulate \nthe real-world agricultural product processing, and then \nmapping\
    \ the virtual data information to the real robot, the \nfully automated processing\
    \ and production can be realized \nto reduce the production cost of agricultural\
    \ products. By \nconstructing the virtual farm breeding environment, the \naccurate\
    \ simulation of animals from organs, tissues, and \nsystems to the whole can be\
    \ realized, so as to obtain the \nknowledge database of animal living environment,\
    \ animal \nnutrition needs, and variety breeding.\nNIE et al. / Turk J Agric For\n\
    656\n· Industry standardization will allow different models, \ndifferent systems,\
    \ and even different domains to interact \nand respond to each other. While different\
    \ physical objects \ncan interact with each other naturally and without barriers,\
    \ \nthe problem of interaction in virtual spaces requires the \ncreation of application-specific\
    \ interfaces and functions. \nIndustry specifications and interface standardization\
    \ of \ndigital twin technology will enable the models to have \nprogrammability,\
    \ interoperability, etc. so that they can \nbe interoperated between different\
    \ production systems \nand application areas in the virtual space. For example,\
    \ \nan apple tree model constructed by one person using DT \ncan be planted accessibly\
    \ in a pear tree population model \nconstructed by another person, and a series\
    \ of feedback \ninformation on growth conditions can be obtained.\n5. Conclusion\n\
    In this paper, we focus on artificial intelligence and \ndigital twin technology\
    \ in sustainable agriculture, review \nand summarize the application of artificial\
    \ intelligence \ntechnology in each stage of the agricultural production \nprocess\
    \ in the past few years, briefly outline what digital twin \nis, and review the\
    \ current status of digital twin technology \nin agriculture. The results of the\
    \ inquiry are as follows:\n(1) Application: A range of AI technologies run \n\
    through the whole process of agricultural production \nand are applied to all\
    \ aspects of the production process. \nIn contrast, compared with the application\
    \ of AI in \nagriculture, the application of DT in agriculture appears \nto be\
    \ stretched.\n(2) Challenges: There is still a lot of work that can \nbe done\
    \ to improve the field of agricultural artificial \nintelligence, especially in\
    \ terms of computing power \nimprovement, large-scale implementation, and multifield\
    \ \nintegration. Due to the specificity and complexity of \nagricultural production,\
    \ the challenges faced by digital \ntwin technology in this application are greater\
    \ than those \nin any other industry, and it will take time to achieve a real\
    \ \nbreakthrough in all aspects.\n(3) Future development: The research on digital\
    \ twin \ntechnology in agriculture is still in its infancy, and there \nare still\
    \ many problems that need to be solved urgently. In \nthe era of big data, the\
    \ origins and development of artificial \nintelligence and digital twin cannot\
    \ be separated from the \ndatabase, so their development should be complementary\
    \ \nto each other.\nAcknowledgment\nThis work was supported by the National Natural\

    \ practices are more complex than other industries as\nthe production depends\
    \ on many pre- and post-harvesting factors which are difﬁcult to predict and\n\
    control. Previous studies have shown that technologies such as blockchain along\
    \ with sustainable\npractices can achieve smart and sustainable agriculture. These\
    \ studies state that there is a need for\na reliable and trustworthy environment\
    \ among the intermediaries throughout the agrifood supply\nchain to achieve sustainability.\
    \ However, there are limited studies on blockchain technology adoption\nfor smart\
    \ and sustainable agriculture. Therefore, this systematic review uses the PRISMA\
    \ technique\nto explore the barriers and enablers of blockchain adoption for smart\
    \ and sustainable agriculture.\nData was collected using exhaustive selection\
    \ criteria and ﬁlters to evaluate the barriers and enablers\nof blockchain technology\
    \ for smart and sustainable agriculture. The results provide on the one hand\n\
    adoption enablers such as stakeholder collaboration, enhance customer trust, and\
    \ democratization,\nand, on the other hand, barriers such as lack of global standards,\
    \ industry level best practices and\npolicies for blockchain adoption in the agrifood\
    \ sector. The outcome of this review highlights the\nadoption barriers over enablers\
    \ of blockchain technology for smart and sustainable agriculture.\nFurthermore,\
    \ several recommendations and implications are presented for addressing knowledge\n\
    gaps for successful implementation.\nKeywords: blockchain technology; smart and\
    \ sustainable agriculture; agribusiness; decentralized\napplications; barriers;\
    \ enablers\n1. Introduction\nA blockchain is an immutable record of transactional\
    \ data, stored in encrypted form\non a distributed network of mutually anonymous\
    \ nodes [1]. Over the last few years,\nblockchain technology has received much\
    \ attention due to its numerous beneﬁts for the\nagriculture sector. This is due\
    \ to its characteristics of immutable, decentralized, unanimous,\nand enhanced\
    \ security [2,3].\nSmart and sustainable agriculture relies on the availability\
    \ of reliable data for informed\ndecision making by using expert systems and Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) devices. The existing\ne-agriculture systems provide information\
    \ to farmers, producers, farming communities,\nand suppliers to make appropriately\
    \ informed decisions [3]. These systems signiﬁcantly\nimprove productivity by\
    \ accessing reliable data from food producers and farmers [4].\nHowever, these\
    \ systems have limitations such as a lack of ﬂexibility, collect insufﬁcient\n\
    information, and provide biased information [5]. These systems are not appropriate\
    \ since\nthe agriculture industry worldwide is distributed, and multi-actor based,\
    \ with different\nstakeholders, such as farmers, wholesalers and retailers, suppliers,\
    \ distributors, ﬁnancial\ninstitutions, distributors, and consumers. Many research\
    \ studies suggest that blockchain\ntechnology is an ideal solution for solving\
    \ the problems of these e-agriculture systems [6].\nBig Data Cogn. Comput. 2023,\
    \ 7, 86. https://doi.org/10.3390/bdcc7020086\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/bdcc\n\
    Big Data Cogn. Comput. 2023, 7, 86\n2 of 22\nThis is due to the key characteristics\
    \ of blockchain such as reliability, traceability, proof-of-\nownership, proof-of-work,\
    \ and encrypted and immutable data which provide trustworthy\nenvironments with\
    \ minimum or no intermediaries [7].\nSmart and sustainable agriculture refers\
    \ to a set of solutions that increases agricultural\nefﬁciency and reduces the\
    \ ecological footprints of farming [8]. It involves a variety of\nsystems and\
    \ technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and information commu-\nnication\
    \ technology (ICT). There are many processes involved from production on the\n\
    farm, to transformation, distribution, and trading to reach the consumers [2].\
    \ The food\nsupply chain is a complex long process having multiple intermediaries\
    \ with an enormous\nnumber of transactions from farm to fork. Products and services\
    \ ﬂow in one direction and\nﬁnancial exchanges happen in the opposite direction.\
    \ Information is considered a great\nasset these days and ﬂows in both directions\
    \ in agrifood supply chains [9]. However, the\nasymmetric nature of information\
    \ and misinformation in a supply chain transaction is a\nconstant challenge. Moreover,\
    \ customers seek information about the origin of the food\nthey consume. They\
    \ need to verify their products for sustainability and require a system\nto know\
    \ the product information [7]. Thus, there is huge pressure on food suppliers\
    \ to\nmaintain a sustainable system that manages the friction between the demand\
    \ and supply\nof agrifood products, and food provenance as well as eliminating\
    \ centralized authority.\nPrior studies [10–16] have been conducted on understanding\
    \ the effect of blockchain\non smart and sustainable agriculture. These studies\
    \ showed that blockchain technology\ncan provide a solution to the issues relating\
    \ to double spending, information asymmetry,\ntraceability, and data security\
    \ in the agriculture sector. However, there is a limited study\non the successful\
    \ adoption and implementation of blockchain technology for achieving\nsmart and\
    \ sustainable agriculture practices. Furthermore, it does not discuss the full-stack\n\
    development of blockchain applications for all agricultural processes. Therefore,\
    \ it is\nimportant to investigate the main issues concerning blockchain adoption\
    \ for achieving\nsmart and sustainable agriculture. This study aims to present\
    \ the blockchain adoption\nenablers and barriers and necessary actions to manage\
    \ them for smart agriculture and\nsustainable agricultural practices. Thus, the\
    \ following research question is formulated\nas follows: What are the barriers\
    \ and enablers in blockchain technology adoption for smart and\nsustainable agriculture?\n\
    To answer this research question, we rely on current literature to constitute\
    \ a back-\nground of enablers and barriers to blockchain technology adoption in\
    \ agriculture. To\nachieve this objective the current research adopts a qualitative\
    \ systematic literature review\napproach using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items\
    \ for Systematic Reviews and Meta-\nAnalysis) technique to focus on investigating\
    \ the adoption status so that we can present\nthe barriers and enablers of blockchain\
    \ technology adoption for smart and sustainable\nagriculture. This study performs\
    \ an intensive search to collect data for an in-depth thematic\nanalysis of enablers\
    \ and barriers of blockchain adoption.\nThe main contribution of this study is\
    \ to examine the barriers and enablers of blockchain\ntechnology adoption for\
    \ smart and sustainable agriculture. Based on the review, the results\nshow that\
    \ there are several barriers that need to be considered for blockchain technology\n\
    adoption in smart and sustainable agriculture such as: (a) lack of government\
    \ regulations,\n(b) resource capital requirements, (c) security and privacy concerns,\
    \ (d) lack of standards,\n(e) trust, (f) scalability issues, (g) awareness and\
    \ (h) ease of use. In addition, various enablers\ncan contribute to the successful\
    \ adoption of blockchain technology in smart and sustainable\nagriculture including\
    \ (a) stakeholder collaboration, (b) enhancing shared responsibilities\nof partners,\
    \ (c) increasing customer trust, quality of service, sustainable value chains\
    \ and\ninfrastructure, (d) data security and useability, (e) improving efﬁciency\
    \ in supply chains\nand (f) enhancing agricultural democratization. This study\
    \ offers meaningful insights to\nresearchers and practitioners for a better understanding\
    \ of the issues relating to blockchain\ntechnology adoption and provides guidance\
    \ in implementing this technology for smart\nand sustainable agriculture.\nBig\
    \ Data Cogn. Comput. 2023, 7, 86\n3 of 22\nThis paper is divided into the following\
    \ sections. Section 2 discusses blockchain for\nagriculture. Section 3 discusses\
    \ the research method conducted for this study. Section 4\ndiscusses the results\
    \ of the review process. Section 5 provides a discussion and ﬁnally,\nSection\
    \ 6 presents the conclusion of the study.\n2. Literature Review\n2.1. Blockchain\
    \ Technology\nBlockchain is a distributed ledger of transactions that stores encrypted\
    \ information\ninto a chain of blocks [17–19]. It is not possible to tamper with\
    \ information as the blockchain\nintends to timestamp the information. The purpose\
    \ of blockchain is to mitigate third parties\nlike banks and brokers in a transaction.\
    \ Since blockchain uses distributed ledger technology,\nit is resilient, secure,\
    \ reliable, decentralized, and fraud-proof. From a computing paradigm,\nblockchain\
    \ is a decentralized shared database system. From a technical point of view, it\
    \ is a\npublic distributed ledger system; and from a business perspective, it\
    \ is a huge network of\ntransactions of data and assets without any intermediaries\
    \ [18].\nAgriculture supply chains are challenging because there is a lack of\
    \ transparency,\ntraceability, and trust. Moreover, food provenance, quality,\
    \ and safety have become major\nconcerns for consumers in recent years due to\
    \ food epidemic incidents. Even though various\nweb-based e-agriculture systems\
    \ are available and in use, these systems are not transparent\nand reliable as\
    \ they are centralized, asymmetric, and incompatible [9]. Moreover, the\nexisting\
    \ systems lack consumer trust due to the unavailability of easy-to-retrieve reliable\n\
    information about the provenance of food products [17]. Thus, blockchain technology\
    \ is a\nuseful tool for providing an effective solution to the above-mentioned\
    \ issues.\nBlockchain technology integrates many existing technologies for capturing\
    \ data, stor-\nage, and dissemination [18]. The fundamental characteristics of\
    \ blockchain technology\nare (a) distributed and decentralized where the nodes\
    \ in the network are completely dis-\ntributed and there is no owner to manage\
    \ the network (b) traceability and tamper-proof in\nwhich the algorithms used\
    \ in blockchain ensures that the data has consistency and integrity\n(c) autonomous\
    \ and peer-to-peer whereby the nodes in the network are homologous as\nthe blockchain\
    \ network is essentially a peer-to-peer network, i.e., the nodes are not bound\n\
    to the network and (d) automatic execution of programs where the ﬁnancial transaction,\n\
    records, and queries of data are executed based on pre-written programs called\
    \ as smart\ncontracts [20].\nBlockchain networks are usually open to all parties,\
    \ where anyone can join and see\ntransactions that will happen on the networks.\
    \ However, these blockchains could be\npermissioned or permission-less i.e., public,\
    \ or private, providing security and authen-\ntication. Blockchain allows a sharable\
    \ ledger of transactions to be read, validated, and\nstored in a chain of blocks\
    \ [21]. Systems on blockchain work in a distributed manner\nwhere independent\
    \ multiple agents, or participants (as nodes) connect to the network by\nusing\
    \ P2P communications. Thus, resulting in a decentralized ecosystem with no central\n\
    authority [14].\nE-agriculture systems have been studied for efﬁcient and effective\
    \ farm management\nas they provide access to useful information for informed decision\
    \ making which leads to\nincreased productivity [6,15,16]. However, these e-agriculture\
    \ systems have been proven\ninefﬁcient due to limitations such as human bias,\
    \ lack of trust and transparency in trans-\nactions, and asymmetric information\
    \ during supply chain activities. Smart agriculture\nsystems comprise sensor technology\
    \ such as GPS and IoT enabled, cloud computing\nand mobile technologies which\
    \ have higher efﬁciency as compared to the e-agriculture\nsystem [22]. Remote\
    \ monitoring, ﬁeld inspection, soil conditions, water and waste manage-\nment,\
    \ and livestock monitoring can be managed by intelligent systems. Data collection,\n\
    data integrity and security have been the major concerns for these e-agriculture\
    \ systems.\nMoreover, hackers can easily intercept the IoT-enabled farm management\
    \ systems and tam-\nper with the data. The salient features of blockchain technology\
    \ could solve the operational\nproblems of e-agriculture systems for smart agriculture\
    \ [10].\nBig Data Cogn. Comput. 2023, 7, 86\n4 of 22\n2.2. Application of Blockchain\
    \ Technology for Smart and Sustainable Agriculture\nBlockchain is an immutable\
    \ distributed ledger implemented without a central author-\nity [23]. The transactions\
    \ stored on a blockchain cannot be altered or removed as every\nnode (user) connected\
    \ with the blockchain network has a copy of all transactions. Thus, the\ntransaction\
    \ and authenticity can be publicly veriﬁed. Blockchain is a distributed knowledge\n\
    system, with key components such as consensus algorithm, smart contracts, transparency,\n\
    and proof-of-ownership, which can be a reliable infrastructure for the sustainable\
    \ develop-\nment of smart agriculture applications [24].\nFarmers use smart agriculture\
    \ systems to increase production, optimize input use,\nlabor savings, improve\
    \ market access, and timely decision-making [25]. They use smart\nagriculture\
    \ systems for record-keeping, information gathering, managing production, and\n\
    operating equipment. Over 80% of farms use these systems on grain farms, and GPS\
    \ equip-\nment, and 26% for training and education [25]. Some farmers rely on\
    \ online free software\ntools such as the Bureau of Meteorology and other weather\
    \ applications. A few of them\nutilize the free software from private organizations\
    \ such as AgWorld, and GrainCorp [26].\nThe agriculture systems have shown signiﬁcant\
    \ improvements in agricultural productivity\nand food supply chains [4]. Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 is taken into consideration by many researchers\nand organizations, which\
    \ includes precision agriculture, blockchain, IoT and big data for\nall aspects\
    \ of sustainable agriculture. Precision agriculture is a farm management system\n\
    that focuses on quantifying the crop or livestock production by monitoring, measuring,\
    \ and\nresponding to ﬁeld metrics for low-input, highly productive sustainable\
    \ agriculture [27].\nThese systems enable farmers to visualize and analyze the\
    \ data for healthy crop growth\nand maintain sustainable agricultural practices.\n\
    Information asymmetry, security, proof of work (PoW), traceability and provenance\n\
    are major issues in existing e-agriculture systems [18,28–32]. The adoption of\
    \ blockchain\ntechnology is envisioned to be useful for smart agriculture by introducing\
    \ new dimensions.\nThis review conducts thorough research in ﬁnding the adoption\
    \ enablers and barriers of\nblockchain technology for smart and sustainable agriculture.\
    \ Kim et al. [29] suggest that\nagriculture supply chains need more studies towards\
    \ managing trust among stakeholders\nusing blockchain technology. Thejaswini et\
    \ al. [30] propose decentralized applications as\na solution for issues in agriculture.\
    \ Vangala et al. [31] also suggest that smart contracts\nand blockchain technology\
    \ can support smart agriculture. Awan et al. [28] state that IoT\nand blockchain\
    \ technology integrated applications will be available by 2030 for smart\nagriculture.\
    \ They argue that IoT as well as blockchain adoption in agriculture is still in\n\
    the early stages. Zhang [18] argues that blockchain could simplify the credit\
    \ checking and\nﬁnancing process using blockchain technology in agriculture. Zhu\
    \ et al. [32] insist that\na secure data-sharing platform is needed by using big\
    \ data and blockchain technology.\nThe literature review identiﬁes that there\
    \ is signiﬁcant research done on incorporating\nblockchain in the agriculture\
    \ industry. However, the implementation of comprehensive\nsmart agriculture systems\
    \ and sustainable agricultural practices is very limited due to\ntechnical barriers.\
    \ Furthermore, the literature reveals that the barriers are generic in nature\n\
    in adopting any new technology and not enough emphasis is given to encompass the\n\
    practical application of blockchain for smart agriculture and sustainable practices.\n\
    In the farm-to-consumer scenario, there exist complex processes, knowledge gaps\
    \ and\ninconsistent information among the parties that lead to trust and reliability\
    \ issues [18,28].\nThe current research presents evidence to address the capabilities\
    \ of blockchain technology\nfor agricultural supply chains and offer solutions\
    \ such as provenance, secure payments, and\ntraceability systems. Moreover, the\
    \ studies identify a few security issues and seek global\nstandards and industry-level\
    \ best practices. We identify that there is a lack of distinctive\nstudies in\
    \ ﬁnding the adoption level, barriers, and enablers of blockchain technology for\n\
    smart and sustainable agriculture. Therefore, this review will address the gaps\
    \ such as\nidentifying the adoption levels, enablers, and barriers so that the\
    \ viability of blockchain\ntechnology is thoroughly understood and further insights\
    \ can be made. The systematic\nBig Data Cogn. Comput. 2023, 7, 86\n5 of 22\nreview\
    \ of the literature unveils that there are signiﬁcant barriers to adoption enablers\
    \ to\nadopting blockchain technology for smart and sustainable agriculture.\n\
    3. Research Method\nQualitative research is a systematic inquiry into a phenomenon\
    \ that includes how\nindividuals and groups behave, how organizations function,\
    \ and how interactions shape\nrelationships in a natural setting [33]. In general,\
    \ qualitative research includes data in the\nform of text, unlike numbers in quantitative\
    \ research. Sometimes it is not possible to answer\nthe research question just\
    \ by using quantitative methods such as surveys. Busetto et al. [34]\npoint out\
    \ that numerical data collection is useful for measuring a pattern, for example,\n\
    a consumer’s shopping behavior. However, qualitative methods are more suited for\n\
    discovering reasons such as patterns, especially hidden ones.\nThe qualitative\
    \ research method is chosen for this study due to its ﬂexibility, openness,\n\
    and responsiveness to the context. A qualitative study can explore the topics\
    \ of research\nthat have not been studied or understood thoroughly. For a thorough\
    \ qualitative study, an\nin-depth review of existing literature helps the researcher\
    \ to identify relevant issues about\nthe research topic of inquiry [35].\n3.1.\
    \ Criteria of Selection\nThis systematic literature review includes peer-reviewed\
    \ articles published in jour-\nnals. It is important to make well-informed, strategic\
    \ decisions that are in line with the\nresearch questions in a study. For transparency\
    \ and trustworthiness, all insights, knowl-\nedge, and ﬁndings are well-documented.\
    \ This has been accomplished with the PRISMA\ntechnique [36].\nFor this systematic\
    \ review, we have an explicit deﬁnition of the inclusion and exclusion\ncriteria\
    \ of the literature. This criterion is then applied to all sources collected and\
    \ presented\nin the review. A systematic evaluation of the quality of studies\
    \ is also included in the review.\nDuring this process, the sources excluded are\
    \ identiﬁed and justiﬁed for exclusion. By using\nexplicit and systematic methods\
    \ for reviewing the articles and collected evidence, bias can\nbe minimized, thus\
    \ providing reliable ﬁndings from which decisions can be made [36]. A\nqualitative\
    \ synthesis of results and meta-analysis is performed to achieve ﬁndings suitable\n\
    for drawing conclusions [37].\nThis research study is based on the selection of\
    \ articles published in databases such as\nProQuest, IEEE, Web of Science, and\
    \ ScienceDirect. These databases are selected because\nthey include high-quality\
    \ journals and original published articles that are relevant to the\nresearch\
    \ topic. The literature search has been limited to peer-reviewed journals, as\
    \ there is\na plethora of literature on blockchain technology. The following criteria\
    \ are considered for\nselecting articles from databases:\n•\nLiterature search\
    \ for existing blockchain-based applications on smart agriculture and\nsustainable\
    \ practices.\n•\nLiterature search for speciﬁc articles on blockchain technology\
    \ adoption for smart and\nsustainable agriculture.\n•\nLiterature search for speciﬁc\
    \ articles on suggested blockchain architectures and models\nfor smart and sustainable\
    \ agriculture.\n•\nLiterature search for speciﬁc articles on the beneﬁts and barriers\
    \ of applicability of\nblockchain for smart and sustainable agriculture.\n•\n\
    Keywords search based on “blockchain”, “smart agriculture”, “enablers”, “barriers”,\n\
    “food supply chain”, “e-agriculture systems”, “traceability”, “provenance”, “trust”,\n\
    “security”, and “transparency”.\n3.2. Data Collection\nPRISMA is an evidence-based\
    \ reporting mechanism in systematic reviews. The data\ncollection for this systematic\
    \ review is conducted by using the PRISMA ﬂow diagram\nas shown in Figure 1. The\
    \ search is performed between the years January 2015 and\nBig Data Cogn. Comput.\
    \ 2023, 7, 86\n6 of 22\nAugust 2022 due to the availability of articles on blockchain\
    \ technology for agriculture.\nInitially, 223 articles were eligible for a review\
    \ from a huge collection of 2724 articles from\nvarious databases. Around 197\
    \ articles have been removed due to reasons, outcomes,\nnon-blockchain and not\
    \ smart agriculture criteria. Finally, 26 articles have been chosen for\nthis\
    \ study. After the review of the relevant articles, a thorough content analysis\
    \ has been\ndone. Figure 1 presents the process of data selection, inclusion,\
    \ and exclusion of articles\nbased on preferred eligibility criteria.\n“security”,\
    \ and “transparency”. \n3.2. Data Collection \nPRISMA is an evidence-based reporting\

    \ in this systematic review is to collect literature that has attributes\nthat\
    \ will make it possible to accomplish the purpose of the research study. A thorough\n\
    inclusion/exclusion criteria set the boundaries for our review and the base to\
    \ achieve\nour goal. Deﬁning a clear criterion increases the likelihood of producing\
    \ reliable and\nreproducible results, minimizes bias, and guards against drawing\
    \ feeble conclusions. In\norder to achieve the purpose of this research, different\
    \ factors are used for setting up\nthe criteria. Table 1 summarizes the criteria\

    \ that there is signiﬁcant adoption and implementation of blockchain\ntechnology\
    \ in several areas of agriculture, which explains the extent of the adoption of\n\
    blockchain technology in agriculture. It presents 18 adoption enablers of blockchain\
    \ tech-\nnology for smart and sustainable agricultural practices. There is adequate\
    \ evidence for the\nadoption of blockchain, such as the platform developed by\
    \ Astill et al. [38] to manage trans-\nparency in agrifood supply chains and the\
    \ food traceability system by Casino et al. [39].\nThese decentralized blockchain\
    \ systems justify the adoption in the agriculture sector\nby improving the infrastructure\
    \ and greater degree of stakeholder collaboration which\nare drawbacks of centralized\
    \ e-agriculture systems. A decentralized blockchain appli-\ncation by Cao et al.\
    \ [40] and a blockchain model of precision agriculture developed by\nTorky et\
    \ al. [41] attest to the enablers, such as enhancing customer trust and shared\
    \ respon-\nsibilities of partners.\nAn AI-based traceability system for food supply\
    \ chains developed by Qian et al. [42]\nis an exemplar of blockchain integration\
    \ with other technologies. Consortium blockchain\nsystem [43], farm management\
    \ system [44], and food traceability system [45] are a few\nmore cases that prove\
    \ blockchain adoption in the agriculture sector is plausible. Blockchain\nenhances\
    \ fast and secure payments in the agriculture sector [46,47]. The platform developed\n\
    by Rijanto [46] and the permissioned blockchain model by Pranto et al. [47] support\
    \ the\nenhancing fast payments enabler.\nThe process of issuing a sustainability\
    \ certiﬁcation is cumbersome because it involves\nmany channels and stages in\
    \ food supply chains. However, blockchain can resolve the\ninconsistencies in\
    \ the process of certiﬁcation in the wine industry [11] thus improving\nsustainable\
    \ supply chains. An architecture for agriculture sustainability [10], a supply\n\
    chain management information system [12], and a double chain structure for better\
    \ sustain-\nability [13] are more exemplars of sustainability adoption enablers.\n\
    Big Data Cogn. Comput. 2023, 7, 86\n11 of 22\nThe blockchain-based trust management\
    \ system for agriculture by Bai et al. [48] is\nanother instance that supports\
    \ enhancing trust among stakeholders. A democratization\nsystem [49] by integrating\
    \ with e-agriculture systems proves that agricultural democratiza-\ntion is possible\
    \ with blockchain technology. The permission-based blockchain ﬁsh farm\nmanagement\
    \ system by Hang et al. [50] showcases that blockchain enhances data efﬁciency\n\
    and useability. Transactional data is stored in encrypted form on a blockchain\
    \ system.\nThe blockchain-based security system developed by Wu et al. [51] showcases\
    \ the security\nenhancement of sensor device data. Another instance of a data\
    \ security enabler is the\nblockchain-based framework in precision agriculture\
    \ [52]. Therefore, in summary, we can\nconsider these enablers as an attestation\
    \ of blockchain adoption for smart and sustainable\nagriculture despite some technical,\
    \ industrial, and organizational issues.\nTable 5 provides key ﬁndings of the\
    \ review of the barriers to blockchain adoption.\nThere are several barriers in\
    \ relation to the application of blockchain technology which are\nbroadly classiﬁed\
    \ into eight types. Yadav et al. [53] and Kochupillai et al. [54] ﬁnd that lack\n\
    of government regulations, security, privacy concerns and trust among stakeholders\
    \ are\nbarriers in agricultural supply chains. Chen et al. [55] claim that blockchain\
    \ technology\nhas integration issues and needs a common and open data standard.\
    \ Etemadi et al. [56]\ndiscuss the importance of technology maturity, clear regulatory\
    \ provisions, scalability and\nbandwidth issues, and smart contract issues as\
    \ the main barriers to agricultural supply\nchains. Nurgazina et al. [57] point\
    \ out the challenges associated with scalability, security,\nand privacy in the\
    \ slow adoption of blockchain technology. Dede et al. [58] highlight the\nbarriers\
    \ to blockchain adoption including the uncertain regulatory environment, scalability,\n\

    \ Blockchain Technology Adoption in Smart and Sustainable Agriculture\nIt can\
    \ be seen that there is a signiﬁcant development and application of blockchain\n\
    technology for smart and sustainable agriculture. Even though there is an increase\
    \ in\nscientiﬁc research contributions to the application of blockchain technology\
    \ to agriculture\nin different contexts, the technology lacks full-pledged implementation.\n\
    There are various enablers that can contribute to the successful adoption of blockchain\n\
    technology in smart and sustainable agriculture such as (a) stakeholder collaboration,\
    \ (b) en-\nhancing shared responsibilities of partners, (c) enhancing customer\
    \ trust, quality of service,\nsustainable value chains, and infrastructure, (d)\
    \ data security and useability, (e) improving\nefﬁciency in supply chains, and\
    \ (f) enhancing agricultural democratization. The Ethereum\nblockchain network\
    \ system brings all the stakeholders involved in agribusiness together\nto carry\
    \ out robust transactions. Farmers can publish the agricultural assets as bids\
    \ using\nsmart contracts and customers can purchase them. According to Astill\
    \ et al. [38], blockchain\nsystems can enhance trust among stakeholders and improve\
    \ transparency in agricultural\nsupply chains. Blockchain technology makes it\
    \ possible to improve trust and transparency\namong the participants in agricultural\
    \ supply chains. Our ﬁndings also present an instance\nof shared responsibilities\
    \ of partners as a consortium blockchain-based trustworthy system\nfor agricultural\
    \ supply chains. This system addresses the trading aspects where farmers\nand\
    \ buyers can join a blockchain for trading. The consortium blockchain establishes\
    \ trust\nand quality of goods and services on a reliable, transparent, trustworthy\
    \ platform. It uses\na permissioned consortium blockchain where the anonymity\
    \ of buyers and farmers is\nmaintained, and trading is managed via smart contracts.\
    \ Blockchain technology has the\npotential to promote more sustainable agriculture\
    \ supply chains. Smart contracts are used\nfor interactions among the stakeholders.\
    \ Another instance of a functional blockchain-based\ntraceability system developed\
    \ by Casino et al. [39] manages the dairy supply chains on\na blockchain network.\
    \ Blockchain can be integrated with other technologies such as IoT\nand AI. The\
    \ BeefLedger system on a commercial blockchain-enabled provenance platform\nindicates\
    \ the importance of integrating both blockchain and IoT for developing smart\n\
    applications in precision agriculture. This system showcases blockchain technology\
    \ capa-\nbilities which proves that it enhances the security, trust, traceability,\
    \ and trustworthiness of\ndata on a network. Blockchain technology indeed is a\
    \ solution for most of the traceability,\nprovenance, and performance challenges\
    \ when integrated with IoT. Blockchain can be used\nto implement an intelligent\
    \ decision-making system by integrating with AI. Such a system\nallows all the\
    \ stakeholders of the blockchain to evaluate the quality of service, delivery\
    \ of\nassets, punctuality, and data accuracy.\nOne of the traits of blockchain\
    \ technology is the transparency of transactions on a\nnetwork. An attempt to\
    \ modify the data will be stored as a transaction on the network\nand all participants\
    \ will know about the transaction. This will reduce tampering with\ndata and fraud.\

    \ architecture, protocol stack and IoT is another instance that collects data\n\
    about animals, employees’ health, and packaging conditions and stores it in encrypted\n\
    form on the blockchain network. The data is secured, and all participants can\
    \ access\nthe same data. HARA, a blockchain-based platform assists the agricultural\
    \ industry and\nﬁnancial institutions to store, and processing secured transactions.\
    \ In this instance, the\napplication is accessible to farmers via a mobile phone.\
    \ It facilitates the integration of\nvarious datasets in the agricultural industry\
    \ such as land ownership and crop information\nand offers more affordable data\
    \ management to participants. This platform connects\nfarmers, suppliers, and\
    \ ﬁnancial institutions and thus, reduces the intermediaries and\nencourages a\
    \ trustworthy environment.\nWe ﬁnd that there are applications developed on smart\
    \ and sustainable agriculture\nto manage consumer issues which explains the scope\
    \ of adoption. We observe that the\nblockchain applications are divergent according\
    \ to agricultural process lines, underlying\nplatforms, and models. We identify\
    \ that blockchain systems are tested for the applicability\nBig Data Cogn. Comput.\
    \ 2023, 7, 86\n15 of 22\nof the technology in various areas of the agriculture\
    \ domain. However, these systems\ndo not address full-stack development for smart\
    \ agriculture and sustainable agricultural\npractices. These systems are developed\
    \ and tested for speciﬁc issues in agribusinesses to\ncheck the viability of blockchain\
    \ technology adoption successfully.\nIt is evident from the review that blockchain\
    \ technology is suitable for transparency,\ntraceability, quick ﬁnancial transactions,\
    \ and data security in smart agriculture and food\nsupply chains. There are real-time\
    \ applications of blockchain technology for managing\nsupply chains such as Pagonis\
    \ Dairy, FarMarket and BeefLedger. These applications ad-\ndress the challenges\
    \ and drawbacks of centralized systems and emphasize developing\npermissioned\
    \ or private blockchains, or consortium blockchain ecosystems. These exam-\nples\
    \ strongly recommend the adoption of blockchain technology for smart and sustainable\n\
    agricultural practices. Blockchain has a major role in smart and sustainable agriculture\n\
    where it can manage data acquisition, secure transaction processing, and better\
    \ visibility\nof information. Blockchain and IoT-based technologies when integrated\
    \ into smart agri-\nculture will promote a great degree of transparency. The integrated\
    \ system developed by\nusing IoT and blockchain is a reliable solution for transparent\
    \ food supply chains where\nIoT sensor devices, and RFID are used for data acquisition\
    \ and blockchain for managing\nthe IoT-generated data. Since blockchains are immutable,\
    \ and cannot be tampered with,\nindustry associations can rely on this information\
    \ for sustainability certiﬁcation. A system\nis developed to manage the certiﬁcation\
    \ process using blockchain technology to prove\nits corroboration as an adoption\
    \ enabler. A blockchain-based Grape Wine Supply Chains\nManagement Information\
    \ System (GWSMIS) using smart contracts, machine learning, and\ncloud computing,\
    \ which fosters disintermediation, democratic governance, and trust is de-\nveloped\
    \ by Luzzani et al. [11]. This is another classic example of blockchain application\
    \ for\nsustainability in agriculture. Agricultural democratization can be achieved\
    \ by combining\nexisting agricultural systems with blockchain technology. Decentralization,\
    \ transaction-\nsharing, and security make blockchain a general-purpose technology\
    \ that has pervasiveness.\nWhen integrated with e-agriculture systems, blockchain\
    \ can achieve digital agricultural de-\nmocratization. FAIR data (Findability,\
    \ Accessibility, Interoperability, Reusability) principles\ncan be used for data\
    \ integrity, and provenance, resulting in e-agriculture sustainability [60].\n\
    In this instance, the RAFT consensus algorithm by Dey et al. [10] for a permission-based\n\
    blockchain system proves that blockchain makes the e-agriculture system efﬁcient,\
    \ decen-\ntralized, scalable, fault-tolerant, and interoperable. The smart agriculture\
    \ model developed\nby Pranto et al. [47] is a permissioned blockchain system where\
    \ the collected data resides\non the MQTT server. In this model, smart contracts\
    \ manage the role of each actor on the net-\nwork from the pre-harvest period\
    \ to the post-harvest period. This system stores data related\nto soil and water\
    \ conditions, treatment with fertilizers, pesticides, waste reduction, labor,\n\
    and human rights. All transactions are recorded on the blockchain for data transparency\n\
    and traceability. This is another example of an adoption enabler that proves that\
    \ blockchain\nconnects all stakeholders to create a transparent environment for\
    \ smart agriculture.\nAnother instance of an adoption enabler is the development\
    \ of a permission-based\nblockchain application for ﬁsh farm management using\
    \ Hyperledger Fabric [50]. Farmers\ncan act as peers (nodes) to the blockchain\
    \ and access information in a secure manner. Trust,\ndata security, integrity,\
    \ and data analysis are the major concerns for e-agriculture systems.\nData collected\
    \ from IoT sensors are always prone to security threats. A green supply chain\n\
    framework by Bai et al. [48] to manage data security and integrity is a trust\
    \ management\nsystem that records trust values on a blockchain. Here blockchain\
    \ technology is employed\nto protect the access rights of a user, secure encrypted\
    \ data, and avoid DDOS attacks from\nhackers. A network security system developed\
    \ by Wu et al. [51] for protecting the data\ncollected from IoT sensor devices\
    \ and storing the data securely in a private blockchain is\nan example of another\
    \ adoption enabler i.e., enhancing data security and useability.\nWe ﬁnd that\
    \ several authors address the drawbacks of an e-agricultural system for\nsustainability\
    \ and suggest novel frameworks such as the double chain framework [13]\nalong\
    \ with a consensus method for better sustainability in agriculture. The RAFT consensus\n\
    Big Data Cogn. Comput. 2023, 7, 86\n16 of 22\nalgorithm [10] and the supply chains\
    \ management information system [12] will beneﬁt\nthe agriculture industry by\
    \ reducing the intermediaries, double spending and improving\ntrust and democratic\
    \ governance. In another case, blockchain has been used for precision\nagriculture\
    \ to enhance the security of agricultural data. It is proven that the technology\n\
    can be integrated with other technologies such as IoT for improved security of\
    \ data and\nperformance. One of the biggest challenges for smart and sustainable\
    \ agriculture is the\nsafety and security of agricultural data. Since the data\
    \ is stored in encryption format on a\nblockchain and only accessed by authorized\
    \ users, it is considered highly secure.\nA few studies have developed blockchain-based\
    \ applications and proven that the\nadoption of blockchain technology is possible\
    \ in real-time [39–43,59]. These are the applica-\ntions that make blockchain\
    \ adoption possible and can be considered the early adopters of\nblockchain technology\
    \ in agriculture. However, the adoption is limited to a few product\nlines to\
    \ check the viability of blockchain technology. It can be observed that the adoption\n\
    of blockchain technology is not integrated as a whole system for smart and sustainable\n\
    agricultural practices. A blockchain-based system can only solve a few problems\
    \ of smart\nagriculture management but not all. There are other processes where\
    \ the technology needs\nto be studied further for adoption such as during the\
    \ pre-harvesting and post-harvesting\nstages. The results suggest that although\
    \ several companies have implemented blockchain\nsolutions, further improvement\
    \ of adoption processes and issues that cause delays in\nadoption are required\
    \ to optimize smart and sustainable agriculture management. A\nhomogenous characteristic\
    \ is noticed among all blockchain applications testing this tech-\nnology’s viability.\
    \ The ﬁnal takeaways to address the research gap from the results are:\n(a) blockchain\
    \ can be integrated with other emerging technologies, (b) it is compatible with\n\
    the expansion and integration of existing systems, (c) requires technical knowledge\
    \ and\nsupport for systems management, (d) requires organizational support and\
    \ collaboration\nof stakeholders, and (e) requires upgradation of IT infrastructure.\
    \ Therefore, a thorough\nstudy of the technological enablers and solutions to\
    \ technical issues can help in building\napplications to advance sustainable agricultural\
    \ practices.\n5.2. Barriers for Blockchain Technology Adoption in Smart and Sustainable\
    \ Agriculture\nThere are several barriers that need to be considered for blockchain\
    \ technology adop-\ntion in smart and sustainable agriculture. These barriers\
    \ are (a) the lack of government\nregulations, (b) resource capital requirements,\
    \ (c) security and privacy concerns, (d) lack of\nstandards, (e) trust, (f) scalability\
    \ issues, (g) awareness, and (h) ease of use.\nThe lack of government regulations\
    \ and regulatory uncertainty, resource capital re-\nquirements, security and privacy\
    \ concerns, lack of standards, trust, scalability issues,\nawareness, and ease\
    \ of use are barriers to blockchain technology adoption. In order to meet\nthe\
    \ increased food concerns of consumers, agrifood industries are forced to incorporate\n\
    various technologies in their supply chains. In such circumstances, blockchain-enabled\n\
    systems are playing a pivotal role. However, the adoption rate of blockchain in\
    \ agriculture\nsupply chains is slow due to the lack of appropriate government\
    \ regulations and trust\namong agribusiness stakeholders. Blockchain adoption\
    \ to smart and sustainable agricul-\nture has both beneﬁts and implementation\
    \ barriers as the transparency of information on\na blockchain-based system may\
    \ lead to a lack of privacy for the stakeholders. Another\nthreat is that there\
    \ is a possibility of all stakeholders facing great challenges to deﬁne\nan open\
    \ and standard data format in food supply chains. In addition to these barriers,\n\
    the high resource capital requirements for implementing a blockchain system is\
    \ another.\nHowever, organizations can have truly wide adoption of blockchain\
    \ technology through\ncollaboration and strong value proposition which requires\
    \ government intervention and\nindustry-level participation.\nNo doubt that blockchain\
    \ technology offers a spectrum of beneﬁts to the agriculture\nsector when integrated\
    \ with other technologies such as IoT and AI. However, the adoption\nhas not expanded\
    \ to all aspects of smart and sustainable agriculture. Reasons for low\nexpansion\
    \ and slow adoption are the issues such as technical barriers to smart agriculture\n\
    Big Data Cogn. Comput. 2023, 7, 86\n17 of 22\nand regulations and standards for\
    \ sustainable agricultural practices. The selected articles\nwere perceived as\
    \ sufﬁcient to provide interesting remarks. An in-depth study on the pos-\nsibilities\
    \ of blockchain adoption in agrobiodiversity is conducted to review the regulatory\n\
    challenges and how this disruptive technology provides a solution to those barriers.\
    \ The\nsystematic review identiﬁes a lack of trust among the stakeholders in the\
    \ agrifood industry,\na lack of traceability options, and expensive transactional\
    \ costs. Blockchain technology\nprovides a solution to address the issues of fraud,\
    \ regulatory standards, and trust. However,\nthere are certain barriers to adopting\
    \ the technology because it will create new legal and\nethical issues due to a\
    \ lack of standards and protocols. New policies must be developed and\nimplemented\
    \ to use a blockchain-based solution to design a concrete incentive mechanism\n\
    for transactions. Ethical issues are linked to the trustworthiness and integrity\
    \ of codes\nand privacy concerns must be addressed at the early stage of development.\
    \ The major\nconcern would be the design and use of smart contracts towards fair\
    \ coding and taking\nall stakeholders’ interests equitably into consideration\
    \ and free from bias. In this scenario,\nimplementing and administering global-level\
    \ standards are impractical. Barriers such as\nlack of conﬁdentiality, lack of\
    \ technological maturity, and users’ credential loss are a few of\nthe highly\
    \ ranked challenges. Privacy and security, the suitability of blockchain, and\
    \ high\nenergy consumption are also considered potential barriers to adoption.\n\
    The adoption barriers can be sub-classiﬁed as scalability, security, and privacy\
    \ chal-\nlenges. There are enumerable disadvantages of the current blockchain\
    \ applications in\nterms of scalability and security. However, some technical\
    \ and policy-based resolutions\nto these challenges also exist. Technological\
    \ immaturity, national and international regu-\nlations and standards, high costs\
    \ of infrastructure and implementation, and substantial\nenergy and power consumption\
    \ are some of the major barriers to adoption. Moreover,\nthe barriers to blockchain\
    \ adoption are uncertain due to divergent laws and regulations,\nscalability and\
    \ data veriﬁcation process times, knowledge of technology, cyber-attacks,\nand\
    \ the unrealistic thinking of blockchain as a ‘one-size-ﬁts-all’. Though the identiﬁed\n\
    list of challenges is very short, the barriers are very signiﬁcant and realistic.\
    \ There are\nrecommendations for developing novel consensus algorithms for data\
    \ security, reliability,\nand trustworthiness at the data entry level and for\
    \ updating or creating new policies for\nprivacy by the regulatory authorities.\n\
    Table 5 summarizes the barriers to the adoption of blockchain technology. It is\
    \ evi-\ndent that there are signiﬁcant barriers to adopting blockchain technology\
    \ for smart and\nsustainable agriculture. However, these barriers will not make\
    \ this technology obso-\nlete. Researchers make several recommendations to manage\
    \ the barriers to adoption.\nChen et al. [55] state that the adoption of blockchain\
    \ for any organization is like a double-\nedged sword. There are beneﬁts as well\
    \ as barriers to implementing a blockchain solution.\nThe implementation is not\
    \ just one technology but a suite of technologies that organizations\nmust understand\
    \ before making a decision on implementation. The technology is not a\nﬁt-for-all\
    \ type but has tremendous characteristics and features that could solve business\n\
    and operational problems. Blockchain is a continuously evolving technology and\
    \ can be\nintegrated successfully with other technologies such as IoT and AI if\
    \ planned carefully. At\na macro level, there are no barriers to adopting blockchain\
    \ technology in the agriculture\nindustry. However, a few technical and legal\
    \ barriers and a lack of standards emerge due\nto the number of organizations\
    \ and parties involved in the supply chain process and poor\ngovernment regulations.\
    \ A thorough implementation plan is needed for adopting this\ntechnology for smart\
    \ and sustainable agriculture.\n5.3. Recommendations for Blockchain Technology\
    \ Adoption in the Agriculture Sector\nBlockchain technology could be used to supplement\
    \ agrifood traceability, quick and\nreliable payments, transparency, security,\
    \ and integrity of agricultural supply chains [17].\nThere are sufﬁcient cases\
    \ that prove that blockchain systems can reduce the intermediaries\nand improve\
    \ trustworthiness among the stakeholders in agriculture supply chains. Many\n\
    blockchain applications are available that address the issues of the agriculture\
    \ sector such\nBig Data Cogn. Comput. 2023, 7, 86\n18 of 22\nas transparency,\
    \ data security and useability, traceability, information asymmetry, and\nprovenance.\
    \ In this study, we ﬁnd that blockchain technology can address the issues of\n\
    smart agriculture and sustainable agricultural practices. However, blockchain\
    \ technology\nneeds to be integrated with the existing IoT-based systems and legacy\
    \ systems to achieve\nits complete potential. The technical barriers such as availability\
    \ and management of\ninfrastructure, scalability, interoperability, and high-power\
    \ consumption limit its adop-\ntion. However, blockchain has the capacity to be\
    \ used for secured machine-to-machine\ncommunication among IoT devices, ﬁnancial\
    \ transactions, Government-to-Business and\nBusiness-to-Business transactions\
    \ for smart and sustainable agriculture even at a large scale.\nAs with more BaaS\
    \ (Blockchain as a Service) providers and distributed ledgers emerging,\nthere\
    \ will be more reliable blockchain networks, and applications developed that will\
    \ make\na vast majority of agribusinesses adopt this technology. It is necessary\
    \ to upgrade policies\nand industry-wide process standardization, government regulations,\
    \ global standards, and\nbest practices before a successful technology adoption.\n\
    5.3.1. Interoperability\nThis study reveals that blockchain technology needs to\
    \ be integrated with IoT and\nAI for smart and sustainable agriculture. The integration\
    \ of various techniques, such as\nmachine learning, into blockchain is suggested\
    \ for sustainable practices. For Agriculture 4.0\nand green technologies, smart\
    \ contract-enabled payment systems (digital currencies), IoT\nsensors, GPS, GIS,\
    \ mapping tools, and wireless equipment are very critical in order to make\nappropriate\
    \ decisions and mitigate information asymmetry issues and adverse selection of\n\
    value chain intermediaries. Further research is needed towards the interoperability\
    \ of these\nemerging technologies. Research on innovative systems reveals that\
    \ cooperation between\norganizations and universities can boost innovation and\
    \ sustainable development [6].\nIntegration of blockchain and other technologies,\
    \ such as IoT and machine learning, needs\nto be developed beyond food supply\
    \ chains and payment mechanisms in agriculture.\n5.3.2. Best Practices and Regulations\n\
    The absence of global uniform standards and best practices with which all the\
    \ partici-\npants can comply is one of the biggest barriers to blockchain technology\
    \ adoption in the\nagriculture industry. These standards will improve market stability,\
    \ bring ethical behavior\nto participants, and regulate fraudulent transactions,\
    \ increasing public trust and technology\nadoption. Disintermediation, one of\
    \ the barriers, will allow direct ﬁnancial transactions\nthat lead to money laundering\
    \ and fraud. There is a need for governance and centralized\nauthority for surveillance.\
    \ The involvement of industry chains and government regulatory\nauthorities is\
    \ very important towards the development of best practices, policies, and\nregulations.\
    \ Further research is needed to consider the role of governments and industrial\n\
    experts in enforcing the regulations at different levels of agricultural supply\
    \ chains.\n5.3.3. Security and Privacy\nThe lack of data security and privacy\
    \ has an adverse effect on the accuracy of agri-\ncultural transactions. Farmers\
    \ and other intermediaries on a blockchain-based system are\napprehensive about\
    \ the transactions and their credentials. Moreover, the members of the\nfood supply\
    \ chain may not be willing to share their data with the competitors as they may\n\
    think that the blockchain system is too transparent. Therefore, more research\
    \ needs to be\ndone to decide on the role and function of governments on this\
    \ technology to implement\npolicies and procedures for data protection and control\
    \ users’ behavior as well as reducing\nownership and reservation of data exchange.\n\
    5.3.4. BaaS and DLT Providers\nFor data management, a secured and trusted blockchain\
    \ distributed ledger is critical\nto smart and sustainable agriculture that can\
    \ improvise real-time decision making and\nintegrate local agrifood networks into\
    \ global value chains. A typical blockchain-based smart\nBig Data Cogn. Comput.\
    \ 2023, 7, 86\n19 of 22\nagriculture system costs very high in terms of development,\
    \ consumption of electricity\nand maintenance [10]. There are blockchain service\
    \ providers and several distributed\nledgers available that provide technical\
    \ support to manage the transactions on blockchain\nsuch as Oracle and Microsoft.\
    \ However, more research and development are needed for a\ncomprehensive suite\
    \ of blockchain applications or a smart agriculture system that supports\npre-harvest\
    \ and post-harvest conditions. Farmers and food suppliers can reduce the costs\n\
    of operation and avoid technical barriers by using BaaS services.\nIn summary,\
    \ we can see that there are potential beneﬁts of blockchain technology\nadoption\
    \ for the agriculture sector. To ensure that blockchain technology is successfully\n\
    adopted, it is critical to understand the main barriers and enablers inﬂuencing\
    \ its adoption.\nTable 6 summarizes the barriers, enablers and recommendations\
    \ for blockchain technology\nadoption in smart and sustainable agriculture.\n\

    Several studies have shown that blockchain technology together with sustainable\n\
    practices can help achieve smart and sustainable agriculture. Thus, this systematic\
    \ review\nexplores the barriers and enablers of blockchain adoption for smart\
    \ and sustainable agri-\nculture. The PRISMA technique is adopted for data collection,\
    \ out of which 26 articles\nare relevant toward the application of blockchain\
    \ technology in the agriculture sector. We\nhave identiﬁed 18 blockchain adoption\
    \ enablers and 8 major barriers from the review pro-\ncess. The blockchain adoption\
    \ enablers include enhancement in stakeholder collaboration,\nshared responsibilities,\
    \ customer value, quality of service, trust, sustainable supply chains\nand value\
    \ chains, democratization, and data useability. There are, however, several barriers\n\
    to a slow blockchain adoption rate due to unclear government regulations, technology\n\
    immaturity, scalability and bandwidth issues, policies on privacy, information\
    \ sharing,\npower consumption, high establishment costs, and security. It is also\
    \ observed that the\ntechnical barriers to blockchain adoption can be easily resolved\
    \ with blockchain service\nproviders’ collaboration and support. However, deﬁning\
    \ global standards, government\nregulations and centralized authorities’ involvement\
    \ may take more time to resolve, and\nthis causes more delays in blockchain adoption.\n\
    Our study has some limitations that could lead to future research opportunities\
    \ in\naddition to the ones identiﬁed in the Discussion section. The ﬁrst limitation\
    \ is related\nto the keywords chosen and the topic selected. Future research needs\
    \ to consider the\ninclusion of more databases, other technologies associated\
    \ with blockchain, and various\nblockchain-based applications. Nonetheless, this\
    \ will open the door to new exploratory\nBig Data Cogn. Comput. 2023, 7, 86\n\

    v1\n \nAbstract \nBackground: Ensuring healthy, safe and nutritious food for everyone\
    \ \nis a global concern. Accessing the information to make the correct \ndecisions\
    \ regarding food security can be challenging. Open data has \nbeen shown to help\
    \ solve practical problems related to agriculture \nand nutrition, enabling effective\
    \ decision-making. In order to create a \nglobal data ecosystem that benefits\
    \ everyone, a wide range of \nstakeholders must be included in the conversations.\
    \ The GODAN \ninitiative involves a network of over 500 partner organizations\
    \ \ncommitted to open data in agriculture and nutrition. \nMethods: We analysed\
    \ data from a survey of the partner \norganizations, with 225 respondents, to\
    \ determine open data \nactivities, including challenges, use of open data, stakeholder\
    \ \ninvolvement and future directions. Respondents were asked a variety \nof free\
    \ text and multiple choice questions. \nResults: 160 partners had at least one\
    \ open data activity, 65 did not, \nor did not know. Of the 160, 36 had a second\
    \ activity. Overall, GODAN \npartners are developing 200 open data activities.\
    \ Agriculture is the \nmost common focus for an open data activity. Nutrition-only\
    \ activities \nare strongly underrepresented. The most frequently mentioned \n\
    challenge was cost, which is linked to data governance, management, \nand human\
    \ capacity; many do not have the funding to begin or \nmaintain open data activities.\
    \ \nConclusions: The most common challenges were the ones related to \nthe data\
    \ itself, including how to access it, manage it, and how to keep \nthe sensitive\
    \ data secure. GODAN is already focusing on these issues \nthrough the Responsible\
    \ Data and Data Ownership pieces. Capacity \nbuilding, and empowering partners\
    \ with the tools they need to act, is \none of the most effective actions available\
    \ for GODAN. Funding for \nopen data, as well as research to create more sustainable\
    \ business \nmodels, should be the focus of the open data agenda.\nOpen Peer Review\n\

    Introduction\nThe challenge of global food security is expected to intensify over\
    \ \nthe coming decades due to an increase of 2 billion people on the \nplanet\
    \ by 2050 and 1 billion people at risk of hunger and malnu-\ntrition in the same\
    \ time frame1,2. Food security can hopefully be \nachieved through sustainable\
    \ agriculture, innovative business  \nmodels, and political will, however, access\
    \ to information will \nbe crucial to achieve this goal. Open data, which is data\
    \ anyone  \ncan access, use, or share3 is key for access to information, and \n\
    research has shown that open data can help enable effective  \ndecision-making\
    \ and practical problem solving. Open data and \ntransparent processes can trigger\
    \ organization and sector change \nto provide innovations to benefit all3. The\
    \ Global Open Data for  \nAgriculture and Nutrition (GODAN) initiative uses the\
    \ FAIR  \nprinciples (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) to \n\
    conceptualize the full meaning of open data4. Open data does not \nexist in isolation,\
    \ it must develop in the context of a global data  \necosystem, which considers\
    \ all stakeholders and their data needs5.\nA vast amount of data and information\
    \ has been gathered about \nagriculture, food security, and nutrition, which vary\
    \ by language, \nunits, size, subject matter, and management structure and process.\
    \  \nAgriculture alone has an especially large number of stakeholders  \ninvolved,\
    \ all of which are in multiple locations within the  \nagricultural supply chain\
    \ (provider to consumer of crops) and the \ndata supply chain (provider to consumer\
    \ of data). Partnership,  \ncollaboration, and data sharing are important for\
    \ two stages:\n1)    To create a global data ecosystem that is useful for all\
    \  \nstakeholders, while releasing data responsibly, and with \nconsideration\
    \ of data ownership and security; and\n2)    To use the global data ecosystem\
    \ to achieve global food \nsecurity5.\nOpen data in agriculture and nutrition\
    \ is an emerging topic, and \noften a delicate one. Individuals and organizations\
    \ are not sure \nof best practices, challenges, and consequences of releasing\
    \ data \nopenly. Cooperation, collaboration, and partnerships are necessary \n\
    to building trust in creating a shared data ecosystem. The GODAN \nPartner Network\
    \ (currently in November 2017) has 600 partners \nfrom national governments, non-governmental,\
    \ international \nand private sector organisations that have committed to a joint\
    \  \nStatement of Purpose6, provides a collaborative space to convene  \nlike-minded\
    \ people who seek to advance open data in the  \nagriculture and nutrition agenda.\n\
    When an organisation commits to join GODAN partner network, \nthey agree to:\n\
    •     advocate for open data initiatives for agriculture and  \nnutrition\n• \
    \    release agriculture and nutrition data\n•     increase awareness of agriculture\
    \ and nutrition open data \ninitiatives\n•    advocate for collaboration amongst\
    \ the partnership  \nnetwork\n•    advocate for good practices and lessons learned\
    \ for open \ndata in agriculture and nutrition\nThis research article paper analyses\
    \ their activities and challenges, \nto learn how GODAN can equip partners with\
    \ tools they need, \nempower them to achieve their goals and overcome challenges,\
    \  \nand convene partners together both in workshops and online to \nbuild trust\
    \ and collaborative power. Additionally, this information \ncan help others learn\
    \ from the GODAN partner network and to \nbuild on the research.\nAbout GODAN\n\
    The Global Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition (GODAN) \ninitiative was the\
    \ result of the 2012 G-8 Summit and the 2013 \nG8 International Conference on\
    \ Open Data for Agriculture. The  \ninitiative and Secretariat was formally announced\
    \ at the Open  \nGovernment Partnership Conference in October 2013.\nG-8 leaders\
    \ created GODAN to “share relevant agricultural data \navailable from G-8 countries\
    \ with African partners” and to ‘obtain \ncommitment and action from nations and\
    \ relevant stakeholders to \npromote policies and invest in projects that open\
    \ access to publicly \nfunded global agriculturally relevant data streams, making\
    \ such  \ndata readily accessible to users in Africa and world-wide, and  \nultimately\
    \ supporting a sustainable increase in food security in \ndeveloped and developing\
    \ countries.’\nMethods\nIn order to become a GODAN partner, organizations register\
    \  \non the GODAN website (www.godan.info/partners), which is \nlinked to a Customer\
    \ Relationship Management (CRM) sys-\ntem (CiviCRM). When registering, potential\
    \ partners must give  \norganization name, freetext info, location, website, logo,\
    \ organi-\nzation type, and point of contact information. This is the only  \n\
    information GODAN has on all partners. Partners must then \nagree to a commitment\
    \ to open data in agriculture and nutrition, \nor recognize the importance of\
    \ open data to achieve food security  \ngoals. There is no fee or membership cost.\
    \ The reason for this is \nto allow the partner network to be as inclusive as\
    \ possible. Once  \na partner has registered, a point of contact from the organization\
    \  \nis sent a link to the survey. Partners can choose to take the survey  \n\
    or not. GODAN partners that have responded to the survey are  \nhereafter referred\
    \ to as “respondents”.\nThe purpose of GODAN is two-fold: to help raise awareness\
    \  \nabout the different open data activities that are happening in the  \nnetwork,\
    \ and to help organizations who are seeking data to find \npotential partners\
    \ and overcome open data challenges. At its incep-\ntion, the GODAN Secretariat\
    \ believed that in order to facilitate \npartnerships and effectively advocate\
    \ for open data, the Secretariat \nmust survey partners and their open data activities.\
    \ The survey  \nwas created in Survey Monkey collaboratively by eight members\
    \ of \nthe GODAN Secretariat. The complete survey “BQ sample”, as it \nPage 3\
    \ of 14\nF1000Research 2018, 7:47 Last updated: 27 OCT 2022\nwas presented to\
    \ GODAN partners, is included as a PDF document \nin this research article (Supplementary\
    \ File 1). The survey aims  \nto profile the organizations and their open data\
    \ activities, as well as \nthe challenges that accompany these challenges.\nRespondents\
    \ are asked a variety of both free text and multiple \nchoice questions to clearly\
    \ state their opinions, challenges, and \nneeds in open data, and the various\
    \ open data activities they are \ninvolved with. This information helps both partners\
    \ and the wider  \ncommunity to see how open data in agriculture and nutrition\
    \ is \ndeveloping, and exactly who is doing what. Respondents do not \nhave to\
    \ complete the entire questionnaire. The first GODAN  \npartner survey was sent\
    \ to partners on April 10, 2015 and was sent \nto partners as they joined. On\
    \ February 10, 2017, the GODAN  \nSecretariat revised the survey. This paper analyzes\
    \ the results of  \nthe first survey.\nBoth authors of this article analysed the\
    \ results of the survey \nusing Microsoft Excel 2013 downloaded as a CSV file\
    \ from  \nSurvey Monkey. An anonymised version of this downloaded \nCSV file is\
    \ included as a dataset in this article (Dataset 1), which \ndoes not include\
    \ name of organization or contact info). To ensure  \nprivacy, we removed the\
    \ information about challenges, and included \nit as a separate spreadsheet (Dataset\
    \ 2). Quantitative results used \nformula analysis in Excel, and qualitative results\
    \ involved Excel \nsearch functions and human confirmation of results.\nEthical\

    \ we state, \n“After analysing the questionnaire data, we will use the aggregated\
    \  \ninformation to show how the open data community in agriculture \nand nutrition\
    \ is developing and who is doing what”, thus resulting \nin this research article.\n\
    Results\nBetween April 10, 2015 and February 6, 2017, 225 of 432  \nGODAN partners\
    \ had filled out the partner survey. Nine were \nfrom different representatives\
    \ of the same organization. This \nrepresents 53% of the GODAN Partner base at\
    \ that time.  \nGeographical and sector data is collected from partners at regis-\n\
    tration (Table 1, Table 2). Generally, the survey is a balanced rep-\nresentation\
    \ of our partnership network as a whole. However, our  \npartnership network is\
    \ heavily skewed towards Africa, Europe  \nand North America. The survey is also\
    \ skewed towards universi-\nties and research institutions, and private sector\
    \ completing the  \nsurvey compared to its distribution in the Partner Network.\n\

    \ 2018, 7:47 Last updated: 27 OCT 2022\nThe focus of open data is primarily on\
    \ economic gain, with the \nsocial aspects less of a focus, especially gender\
    \ balance.\nWhen the survey began, the GODAN Secretariat believed that  \nthose\
    \ who joined GODAN would already be working with and pro-\nducing open data and\
    \ have open data activities to share (Table 4).\n160 partners have at least one\
    \ open data activity, 65 do not, or \ndo not know. Of the 160, 36 have a second\
    \ activity, and 4 have a  \nthird. Overall, GODAN partners are developing 200\
    \ open data \nactivities. Agriculture is the most common focus for an open data\
    \ \nactivity, with a joint agriculture and nutrition activity close second. \n\
    Nutrition-only activities are strongly underrepresented (Table 5).  \nA general\
    \ observation is that most of the “neither” responses \nfocus generally on open\
    \ data, open access and open government  \n(see Anonymized Partner Survey Spreadsheet).\n\
    Most GODAN partner respondents are involved with data collec-\ntion and publishing\
    \ (Table 6). However, about half of respondents \nwere involved with four or more\
    \ aspects of open data listed in  \nTable 6. Sixteen respondents were involved\
    \ with all seven aspects, \n26 with six, 38 with five, and 37 with four.\nData\
    \ collection means sourcing any data directly through  \nresearch, instrumentation,\
    \ surveys or other methods. Publishing \nincludes producing static products drawing\
    \ upon your own open \ndata, and/or open data from others. A data intermediary\
    \ makes \nopen data more accessible for others, through creating applications,\
    \ \ninterfaces or derived datasets. A service provider uses open data \nto support\
    \ services such as farm extension, weather information,  \nmarket information,\
    \ etc. A data provider makes open data available  \nto others, and an end user\
    \ uses open data directly, or through \nan intermediary, to affect their practice\
    \ (e.g. farmer/farmers’  \norganisation, \nadvocacy \norganisation, \npractitioners).\
    \ \nThese \ndetails were given along with the question (see BQ sample;  \nSupplementary\
    \ File 1).\nTable 7 analyses activities the respondents described. All partners\
    \ \nwere asked an open-ended question to describe their open data \nactivity with\
    \ no text limit. To analyse the activities, the GODAN \nresearch team created\
    \ a word frequency table (Table 7) based \non text mining in the free text sections\
    \ and categorized them. \nWhen text mining, the authors used the search method\
    \ in Excel.  \nActivities marked with an asterisk (*) show the search term \n\
    used, which accounts for variability in the ending of the word  \n(ex: app* includes\
    \ app, apps, application, applications). The  \nauthors personally viewed the\
    \ results to ensure that the word \nwas used in the correct context. (ex: “approach”\
    \ is not included  \nunder app*). The words were checked by one of the authors\
    \ \nto ensure that they were taken in the correct context. All infor-\nmation\
    \ to determine these results are in Anonymized Partner  \nSurvey Spreadsheet.\n\
    Under methods of working, collaboration, sharing, and open  \naccess are on the\
    \ top of the list. In terms of outputs, research and \npublications were the highest\
    \ (but we are not sure if it is research \ndata and published data and otherwise),\
    \ and platforms, portals,  \nand tools feature highly as well. Some initiatives,\
    \ centers, and  \npolicies are created as well.\nGovernments are the most common\
    \ stakeholder to engage with \nwhen it comes to open data, which makes sense since\
    \ they are  \nTable 4. Number of open data activities \nthat survey respondents\

    \ read and analysed by \na member of the GODAN Secretariat Research team. Through\
    \ \nthis process, the answers were aggregated into a format we could \nanalyse\

    The most frequently mentioned challenge was cost; many do not \nhave the funding\

    \ 7:47 Last updated: 27 OCT 2022\nConclusions\nThe partner survey has become a\
    \ strategic resource for the  \nSecretariat to develop the GODAN initiative towards;\
    \ 1- geo-\ngraphic, topical focus and stakeholder group representation  \nand\
    \ 2 - stakeholder needs in terms of support (capacity building, \nproviding resources,\
    \ building advocacy). The GODAN initia-\ntive and its partners provide inspiration,\
    \ show best practices and  \nconnect with partners beyond the current network.\
    \ The pur-\npose of the GODAN Secretariat is to facilitate partnerships and  \n\
    provide our partnership network with resources to advance the  \nopen data agenda\
    \ and this publication is one of those resources.\nThe survey has a balanced representation\
    \ by region of those who \nhave answered the survey and our partnership network\
    \ as a whole. \nHowever, our partnership network is heavily skewed towards \n\
    Africa, Europe and North America. GODAN hopes to improve  \nour partnership network\
    \ representation globally to have equal  \nrepresentation and holistic understanding\
    \ of the state of open \ndata activities in agriculture and nutrition. In order\
    \ to do this, \nthe GODAN Secretariat could adjust our advocacy messaging to \
    \ \nmore specific regional audiences.\nThe survey is skewed towards universities\
    \ and research  \ninstitutions completing the survey compared to its distribution\
    \ in \nthe Partner Network. This also makes sense as to why research \nis a primary\
    \ activity output (as listed in Table 7). Increased  \ngovernment input to the\
    \ survey would be tremendously useful, \nespecially since lack of policy and lack\
    \ of government buy-in is \na significantly mentioned challenge and a number of\
    \ our partners  \nexpress the need for assistance in convincing governments why\
    \  \nopen data is important. Together with Open Data Charter,  \nGODAN is in the\
    \ process of developing an Agriculture Open  \nData Package for governments7 to\
    \ help with this goal.\nThe use of data in gender equality is very much underrepresented\
    \ \nin the GODAN partner network. While 42 respondents stated  \nthey are working\
    \ on gender balance, it wasn’t clear if any  \nrespondents open data activities\
    \ focused on gender, neither as gen-\nder data used or provided, nor empowerment\
    \ of women and girls.  \nSince researchers have concluded that an equal gender\
    \ balance \nis essential for positive sustainable agricultural and nutrition \
    \ \noutcomes8, the absence of any gender-focused activities is  \nunfortunate.\
    \ We must focus on not only improving our gender \ndata representation within\
    \ GODAN, but also emphasizing the  \nmessage that partners must integrate gender\
    \ considerations into \ntheir work.\nAlthough GODAN aims to focus on agriculture\
    \ and nutrition,  \nthe number of nutrition specific focused initiatives is low.\
    \  \nHowever, a large number of activities focus on both agriculture  \nand nutrition\
    \ which is a link that spans the supply chain and con-\nnects various sectors.\
    \ When we consider the data supply chain,  \nand the movement of a certain data\
    \ point as it provides informa-\ntion from one stakeholder to the next, we have\
    \ a large number of  \nactivities that can help facilitate this work.\nBased on\
    \ the results of Table 7, a large number of partners focus  \non applications\
    \ of data instead of data infrastructure, and lack \nof data infrastructure is\
    \ a challenge. The need for data to cre-\nate applications may drive the development\
    \ of data infrastruc-\nture, however, data infrastructure must develop alongside\
    \ the \napplications as well so they can constantly inform each other.  \nInteroperability\
    \ is crucial especially when working at a global \nscale. Currently, existing\
    \ data infrastructures seem to be in their \ninfancy, as many pre-requisites such\
    \ as common vocabularies, \nontologies and exchange standards require a collaborative\
    \ effort \nfrom the user community. While some sectors are developing fast \n\
    (eg. genomics9,10, precision agriculture11) others are developing  \nmuch slower\
    \ or have not even started to think about the  \nprerequisites for data infrastructures.\n\
    The most common challenges, collectively, are the ones actu-\nally related to\
    \ data. How to find it, access it, manage it, store it,  \norganize it, keep the\
    \ sensitive data secure, and ensure that the  \nrightful owners are ensured the\
    \ benefits. GODAN is already  \nfocusing on these issues through our Responsible\
    \ Data and \nData Ownership pieces12,13, and various working groups14 on the \
    \ \nsubject. However, we realize that these challenges are not sim-\nple and will\
    \ have many solutions according to the context. No  \nrespondents’ activity is\
    \ focusing on data ownership, or FAIR data, \nhowever, through personal communication\
    \ with partners who  \ndid not answer the survey, GODAN does know other partners,\
    \  \nsuch as DTL and the Engine Room, are working with FAIR data.\nA common challenge\
    \ was the culture of opening data and the  \nshifting of mindset to integrate\
    \ data stewardship into the  \nworkflow of each sector and prioritizing effective\
    \ data governance.  \nMany people are not aware of open data or and even if they\
    \  \ndo, they do not have a specific and trusted path to follow to imple-\nment\
    \ good (open) data stewardship into their work. Funding \nschemes are changing\
    \ and may even evolve further to take these \ncomponents into account. And the\
    \ way research is performed \nmuch of the outcomes need to realign to the needs\
    \ of a global data  \necosystem. The GODAN partner base could be leveraged to\
    \  \ndetermine some solutions to these issues and find support for good \ndata\
    \ stewardship.\nCapacity building, and empowering partners with the tools they\
    \ \nneed to act, is one of the most effective actions that GODAN \ncan do. The\
    \ GODAN Capacity Building Working Group15 is  \nfocusing on training for open\
    \ data advocacy, publishing of  \nopen data, and developing business models for\
    \ open data.\nCost is the most listed challenge and is linked to data governance,\
    \ \nmanagement, and human capacity. Funding for open data work \nas well as research\
    \ and practical solutions on sustainable busi-\nness models for open data should\
    \ be an essential component of the  \nopen data agenda.\nAt GODAN, we would like\
    \ to utilize our partner base to engage \nwith them as much as possible. Now that,\
    \ through the survey, we \nunderstand our partner’s needs and challenges better,\
    \ we can work, \nalongside other initiatives, to equip partners with tools they\
    \ need, \nempower them to achieve their goals and overcome challenges, \nand convene\
    \ partners together both in workshops and online. Our  \ncommon results and output\
    \ can help others to learn from the \nGODAN partner network, to build on our research,\
    \ and help  \nPage 8 of 14\nF1000Research 2018, 7:47 Last updated: 27 OCT 2022\n\

    \ \nCenter for Open Data Enterprise, Washington, DC, USA \nThe study of open data\
    \ and its application has relied largely on case studies with relatively little\
    \ \nquantitative survey work and  analysis. From that perspective, this GODAN\
    \ survey is a step \nforward and a useful contribution to the literature. However,\
    \ the authors' report seems to miss \nsome important opportunities to analyze\
    \ data that they appear to have gathered through their \nquestionnaire. \n \n\
    The study design is methodologically sound. The survey instrument is straightforward\
    \ and clear, \nand the response rate (over 50%) is good for this kind of survey\
    \ in this field. While the authors \nspend some time discussing the differences\
    \ between the distribution of respondents and the \ndistribution of all GODAN\
    \ partners - both regionally and by sector (government, private sector, \netc.)\
    \ - those differences in fact appear to be fairly minor (with the caveat that\
    \ I am not a \nstatistician). So the survey was well designed and got a good overall\
    \ response that represented \nGODAN's constituent groups fairly. \n \nThat said,\
    \ the analysis and conclusions are disappointing. The data presented are largely\
    \ \ndescriptive of GODAN partners' activities, without shedding much light on\
    \ how GODAN can better \nhelp these partners achieve their goals, which is the\
    \ stated purpose of the study. There are some \ninteresting findings, which the\
    \ authors note: An apparent lack of attention to gender and nutrition \nper se,\
    \ which may show a need for better strategic communication on these issues, and\
    \ the clear \nindication that cost is a barrier to instituting open data programs.\
    \ (This last may seem obvious, but \nthe cost of open data programs has been a\
    \ subject of some debate in the community working to \napply open data for development.)\
    \ However, most of the analyses presented are unsurprising and \nnot as illuminating\
    \ as they could be. \n \nSome further work could remedy these shortcomings. It\
    \ appears that the authors could mine \nsome of their own data more deeply. \n\
    \ \nA critical question for open data in every area, including agriculture/nutrition,\
    \ is to identify exactly \nwhat kinds of datasets are most valuable and measure\
    \ the impact of applying that data. In fact, \n \nPage 10 of 14\nF1000Research\
    \ 2018, 7:47 Last updated: 27 OCT 2022\nGODAN has recognized the need to help\
    \ its partners focus on key datasets, and the open data \npackage in beta (reference\
    \ 7) is designed to do this. The questionnaire used in this study \n(presented\
    \ in a supplementary file) had  two useful questions at the end about the perceived\
    \ \nimpact and potential impact of data from different sources.  The authors should\
    \ present findings \nfrom those questions, both by supplying the underlying data\
    \ (which appears to be missing) and \ntheir analysis of its meaning. \n \nIn addition,\
    \ the authors could make an important contribution to the literature by mining\
    \ their \npartners' responses for concrete examples of agriculture and nutrition\
    \ open data applications. \nPrograms such as the Open Data 500 and the Open Data\
    \ Impact Map have created databases with \nhundreds examples of open data projects\
    \ in all sectors. The authors must have collected a \nnumber of valuable examples\
    \ through their survey, but don't seem to have made that information \naccessible\
    \ in an easily usable form. If they could do so, these other programs would be\
    \ able to \nintegrate their findings and improve the knowledge base for this information.\
    \ \n \nFinally, the literature review is not adequate: Almost all the sources\
    \ cited are GODAN's sources. \nThe authors should provide a richer context by\
    \ citing and discussing key sources on open data \nimpact, cost analyses, studies\
    \ of open data for development, and analyses of trends in applying \nopen data\
    \ for agriculture and nutrition. \n \nIn sum, this is a useful study that seems\
    \ to have collected more data than the authors have \nanalyzed and reported on.\
    \ Additional work to mine the data and present it in context would make \nthis\
    \ a stronger and more valuable contribution.\n \nIs the work clearly and accurately\

    \ \nScientific paper \"Global Open Data in Agriculture and Nutrition (GODAN) Initiative\
    \ partner network \nanalysis” addresses important aspect of Open Data in Agriculture\
    \ and Nutrient. It describes and \nanalyses survey, which was provided by GODAN\
    \ among its members. It give overview about \ncollection and utilisation of Open\
    \ Data by GODAN member. It give basic statistic of different types \nof GODAN\
    \ members and also their role in Open Data Chain. From this point of view review\
    \ is well \nprovided. \n \nWhat is missing is to put this paper into broader content.\
    \ In some parts it has more form of \nreports, then scientific paper. Analysis\
    \ of literature is relatively poor and it is mainly focused on \nprevious GODAN\
    \ analysis without clear reference. There are also mistake in links from text\
    \ to \nreferences (more in end of paper). \n \nThere exist number of research\
    \ activities focused on Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrient, but \nthe results\
    \ of review are not compared with this research. Due near focus only on interpretation\
    \ of \nsurvey, there are missed information about some global initiatives like\
    \ for example GEOSS (which \ncooperate closely with GODAN) and which is partly\
    \ focused on Open Data for Agriculture. What is \nalso missing in survey is focus\
    \ on type of data. This is important due the fact, that for example \nsatellite\
    \ data (Landsat, Sentinel) are now currently biggest source of Open Data for Agriculture,\
    \ \nwhich are broadly used. \n \nStatistic are well elaborate, but in some cases\
    \ samples are relatively poor and it could be also \ninfluenced, that samples\
    \ are taken only from GODAN members. But on other side is clear, that it is \n\
    not easy to collect such information. \n \nProbably will be also good to mentioned\
    \ in article question of data privacy. It is partly addressed in \nConclusion,\
    \ but without clear explanation. It is clear that not all data could be open due\
    \ privacy, \nbut it is not mentioned clearly. In relation to this I would like\
    \ also recommend to compare open \ndata and shared data. This play important role\
    \ for example in Precision Agriculture, where \nnumber of applications is based\
    \ on combination of Open Data (for example satellite, and data, \nwhich are shared\
    \ like private farming data). \n \nConclusion is analysing results of survey and\
    \ presenting importance of analysis, for other GODAN \nactivities. However is\
    \ a little generic, it will be good to stress some important activities and source,\
    \ \n \nPage 12 of 14\nF1000Research 2018, 7:47 Last updated: 27 OCT 2022\nwhich\
    \ could be used for future for GODAN activities, and also how better target activities\
    \ in certain \nregions. \n \nIn conclusion about data infrastructure (page 8)\
    \ is not clear if discussion is about infrastructure for \nOpen Data or generic\
    \ Data Infrastructure. From the text seems, that more about generic data \ninfrastructure. \
    \ \n \nThere are in conclusion also wrong links to references. For example reference\
    \ 11, which is in text \nrelated to Precision Agriculture is focused on previous\
    \ Genomic. Then Reference 12 related to \nPrecision Agriculture is mentioned in\
    \ text in relation with Data Ownership (please check this). It is \nalso not clear,\
    \ if the reference 12 \"Precision agriculture and the future of farming in Europe\
    \ \nScientific Foresight Study\" is really relevant to the topic of Data Infrastructure,\
    \ resp. Open Data \nInfrastructure. \n \nI would like recommend to modified this\
    \ article and put it into broader content of Open Data for \nAgriculture and Nutrient\
    \ and also clarify some not clear statement in Conclusions.\n \nIs the work clearly\
    \ and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?\nPartly\n\
    Is the study design appropriate and is the work technically sound?\nPartly\nAre\

    a third of food produced is lost or wasted every year, amounting to a $940 billion
    economic hit, at the same time when 50% more and better food will be needed over
    the next 20–30 years [1]. Inefficiencies in planting, harvesting, water use, reduced
    animal contributions, as well as uncertainty about weather, pests, consumer demand
    and other intangibles contribute to the loss. Precision Agriculture (PA) and Precision
    Livestock Farming (PLF) come to assist in optimizing agricultural and livestock
    production and minimizing the wastes and costs aforementioned. PA is a technology-enabled,
    data-driven approach to farming management that observes, measures, and analyzes
    the needs of individual fields and crops. Sensors on fields and crops are starting
    to provide literally granular data points on soil conditions, as well as detailed
    info on wind, fertilizer requirements, water availability and pest infestations,
    which in addition to aerial images captured by unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones,
    which can patrol fields, can alert farmers to crop ripeness or potential problems
    and provide early warnings of deviations from expected growth rates or quality.
    Satellites can be at the service of PA, too, facilitating detection of relevant
    changes in field by using satellite imagery, identification of crop threats as
    nutrients deficiency or insect damage etc. PLF is also a technology-enabled, data-driven
    approach to livestock production management, which exploits technology to quantitatively
    measure the behavior, health and performance of animals. PLF deals with the management
    of livestock by continuous, automated, real-time monitoring of (re)production,
    health and welfare of livestock and the corresponding environmental impact. The
    data sources utilized in it include amongst others on-line sound, video observations,
    feeding intake, drinking behavior data, data from sensors on the animals, and
    data from milking robots. Big data delivered by all the aforementioned sources
    has a multitude of payoffs in the domains of PA and PLF, that include precision
    monitoring of fertilizer and fungicide levels to optimize crop yields as well
    as risk mitigation that results from monitoring when temperature and humidity
    levels reach dangerous levels for crops, increasing livestock production while
    minimizing the environmental footprint of livestock farming and ensuring high
    levels of welfare and health for animals, providing new efficient decision-making
    tools for helping agricultural development and livestock farming optimization
    [2]. By adding analytics (e.g. parallel matrix multiplication, deep convolutional
    neural networks) to these sensor and image data, opportunities also exist to further
    optimize these domains by having continuous data on how a field or the livestock
    is responding to a protocol. By allowing farmers to apply tailored care and manage
    resources more effectively, production is boosted, economic efficiency is improved,
    and waste and environmental impact is minimized. In the domains of PA and PLF,
    two main challenges are identified: 1) to exploit this multitude of data in order
    to evaluate and benchmark the developed algorithms, thus facilitating dedicated
    improvements in performance, and thus advancements for new applications [3], and
    2) to make available advanced infrastructure so as to harness the power of this
    information in order to benefit from the new insights, practices and products,
    and to not only facilitate the execution of these algorithms, but to do so efficiently
    time-wise. Thus, PA and PLF are currently being shaped by two major technological
    trends: big-data and advanced-analytics capabilities on the one hand, and robotics—aerial
    imagery, feeding and milking robots, intelligent sensors, sophisticated local
    weather forecasts—on the other. Towards this end, PA and PLF are driven by the
    need of 1) fusing a vast plethora of data sources which through various technological
    breakthroughs are currently available, 2) algorithms optimized for parallel execution
    that can exploit this multitude of data and harness their power, and 3) advanced
    infrastructural capabilities to handle the execution of these big data enabled
    algorithms efficiently time-wise, lowering responsiveness down to seconds so as
    to cater for time-critical decisions. The current paper aims to introduce CYBELE,
    a platform aspiring to safeguard that the stakeholders involved in the agri-food
    value chain (research community, SMEs, entrepreneurs, etc.) have integrated, unmediated
    access to a vast amount of very large scale datasets of diverse types and coming
    from a variety of sources, and that they are capable of actually generating value
    and extracting insights out of these data, by providing secure and unmediated
    access to large-scale High Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructures supporting
    advanced data discovery, processing, combination and visualization services, solving
    computationally-intensive challenges modelled as mathematical algorithms requiring
    very high computing power and capability. The structure of the paper is as follows:
    Section 1 introduced the scope of the paper and highlighted the rationale behind
    the proposed research. Section 2 analyzes the methodology followed, graphically
    illustrating and explaining the proposed architectural approach for detaching
    the design, development and execution of HPC empowered big data analysis processes.
    Section 3 outlines the anticipated results, to be achieved, evaluated and technically
    validated through a series of 9 demonstrators, 5 from the domain of PA, and 4
    from the domain of PLF, which are also presented in the same section. Section
    4 concludes the current paper. 2. Materials and methods Few approaches have started
    being developed during the last few years mainly in the field of PA, but also
    targeting the domain of PLF. With regards to PLF, scientific approaches since
    2010 focused mainly on the theoretical aspects of the challenge, explaining mainly
    how to implement PLF into practice [4], how IoT or even how audio-visual monitoring
    and analysis could also be exploited towards recognizing group behavioral patterns,
    identifying individual animals, detecting the occurrence of fertility, disease
    and discomfort, as well as to measure changes between individuals and groups of
    animals over time, including for example the approaches presented by Romeo S.
    [5], Terrasson G., Llaria A. et al. [6], Terrasson G., Villeneuve E. et al. [7],
    Andonovic I. et al. [8], while the first platforms claiming to support PLF have
    already been developed, including for example the Precision Livestock Farming
    system by Bosch [9]. PA on the other hand is a more mature domain, and various
    commercial solutions currently exist, offering advanced services including real
    time insights, yield monitoring, built-in accounting, field management and more,
    including amongst others Trimble [10], AgDNA [11], Sentera [12], AgroSense [13],
    Fasal [14], Agricolus [15], OneSoil [16], ProAgrica [17] and more. These have
    been developed over the years building upon the technological advancements mainly
    in the technological domains of IoT, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and Satellite and
    Image Processing and analysis, and upon the scientific literature made available
    during the last decade, including (yet not limited) for example the approaches
    by Lin J-S. and Liu C-Z [18], van Henten E. J. et al. [19], Ge Y. et al. [20],
    Primicerio J. et al. [21], Zhang C. and Kovacs J. M. [22], Ye J. et al. [23],
    Srbinovska M. et al. [24], Ferrandez-Pastor F. J. et al. [25], Popovic T. et al.
    [26], and Sawant S.et. al. [27]. Nevertheless, CYBELE aspires to reach far beyond
    the currently offered services, and offer a holistic platform targeting both domains
    of PA and PLF, and offering services not only to farmers, but also to a plethora
    of stakeholders involved in the agri-food value chain (research community, SMEs,
    entrepreneurs, etc.). CYBELE also innovates in providing to these stakeholders
    integrated access to a vast amount of very large scale open and proprietary datasets
    of diverse types and coming from a variety of sources (including sensor data,
    environmental and climate historical data, satellite and aerial images). Last
    but not least CYBELE offers the technological tools to the aforementioned stakeholders
    for experimentation with these data assets, and for the composition of novel services
    through the corresponding modelling environments, while abstracting the infrastructure
    required to support the development and the delivery of these resource demanding
    services. CYBELE will capitalize on: 1) The computing capacity and efficiency
    potential delivered by HPC e-infrastructure and HPC-empowered services, enabling
    the processing of large amounts of heterogeneous data, and boosting modern scientific
    discovery, solving computationally-intensive challenges modelled as mathematical
    algorithms requiring real HPC architectures to achieve the required efficiency.
    2) Technological advancements in big data technologies and related services, a)
    facilitating the aggregation of very large scale datasets (and/or their metadata)
    of diverse types (sensor data, satellite and aerial image data, etc.) from a multitude
    of distributed data sources; b) allowing the (semantic) alignment of the aggregated
    data and metadata to a common schema and data model; c) empowering the execution
    of advanced data analytics extracting hidden knowledge and insights and d) empowering
    the delivery of intuitive and adaptive data visualization services, providing
    to the CYBELE stakeholders with a more understandable and more easily evaluated
    interface to the results of the complex simulations. 3) The potential of cloud
    services for delivering simple and secure service provisioning, thus providing
    a bouquet of domain specific and generic services on top of the CYBELE virtual,
    industrial experimentation environment to both research organizations but mainly
    to industrial communities with focus on SMEs lacking access to HPC infrastructures
    and the competences necessary to fully exploit them, facilitating the elicitation
    of knowledge from big agri-food related data, addressing the issue of increasing
    responsiveness and empowering semi-automated / automation-assisted decision making
    when the prediction window is narrow. The proposed architectural approach for
    detaching the design, development and execution of HPC empowered big data analysis
    processes is depicted in Fig. 1. This layered approach aims at ensuring interoperability
    among all involved components, putting emphasis on the way that pipelining of
    information (from data query, to simulation formulation, to analysis and to visualization)
    is supported, safeguarding smooth interoperation of the aspired services. In order
    to achieve this, CYBELE consortium aims at designing and delivering 1) on the
    one hand standardized interfaces putting emphasis on exposing reusable functional
    primitives for the HPC and Big Data frameworks integrated within CYBELE, so that
    pipeline reusability is supported, minimizing the need of reprograming core integration
    engines, and 2) on the other hand normative schemes and common data models featuring
    common semantics, annotating the information to be exchanged between components,
    thus ensuring information harmonization and enabling seamless communication amongst
    the various heterogeneous components. Download : Download high-res image (2MB)

    heterogeneous data (to be also made available to the CYBELE industrial test beds)
    are made available through HPC powered repositories. Prior to the check-in and
    storage, as demonstrated on the middle left part of the architecture, the data
    pass through a data quality check pipeline in order to address the data veracity
    and timeliness challenges that are typically associated with big data. From the
    moment that data are collected in CYBELE, quality checks are performed to discover
    inconsistencies and other anomalies in the data and eventually ensure their integrity
    and completeness, to be followed by a number of steps associated with data cleansing
    procedure (ranging from data filtering and cleaning to normalization). Finally,
    the CYBELE Data Provenance Service puts in place the necessary mechanisms to record
    all relevant information that influence the “incoming” data of interest. In CYBELE,
    the Data Provenance Service is intrinsically linked to the Data Policy and Assets
    Brokerage Engine that facilitates the data sharing and trading features that will
    be offered by the platform to link data providers and data consumers. Checked-In
    data will also be semantically annotated and harmonized so as to promote data
    interoperability and reuse. Since the data will come from a multitude of physically
    distributed data sources, a common semantic data model will be created which will
    be used to semantically describe and annotate the data. The model will be used
    as a common language to annotate data and the messages exchanged between the components,
    so as to facilitate the pipelining and enable the seamless communication of the
    various heterogeneous components. The clean and semantically uplifted (open and
    proprietary data) will be then made available for querying, analysis and visualization.
    In order to enable simulation execution, a dedicated Experiment Composition Environment
    will be designed and delivered, as demonstrated on the upper right part of the
    architecture. The Experiment Composition Environment aims to facilitate the detaching
    of the design, development and execution of the big data analysis processes, supporting
    embedded scientific computing and reproducible research. The analysis process
    will be based on the selection of an analysis template, where each analysis template
    will represent a specific algorithm with the associated software and execution
    endpoint, and will provide to the user the flexibility to adjust the relevant
    configuration parameters, including input parameters for the algorithm, execution
    parameters, parameters associated with networking and computing resources constraints,
    as well as output parameters. The Experiment Composition Environment will support
    the design and implementation of data analysis workflows, consisted of a series
    of data analysis processes, interconnected among each other in terms of input/output
    data streams/objects. Upon the execution of an analysis template, the outcome
    could constitute the input for another analysis template. The output of the analysis
    template execution will be a session object that contains on memory all output
    values. In order for the Experiment Composition Environment to run, it requires
    input datasets (training and/or evaluation datasets). For this reason, an Advanced
    Query Builder will be designed and developed which will provide users an intuitive
    environment to define and execute queries on data available in the CYBELE platform.
    After input datasets have been selected and the workflows have been designed,
    the advanced analytics on top of big data need to be executed. In the case of
    CYBELE, advanced analytics algorithms will be provided to the stakeholders with
    the ability to visually explore the different kinds of data, while discovering
    and addressing new patterns. Machine learning and predictive modelling techniques
    will be updated in order to be able to manage the predictive life cycle of data
    preparation, exploration and analysis, for achieving better deployment and monitoring.
    However, the execution of advanced analytics on top of big, diverse data, raises
    the need for strong computational power and increased computing memory so as to
    be able to not only extract insights, but to do this within a reasonable time
    frame. The execution of the demonstration cases selected raises the need for several
    HPC attributes including Storage Intensity, Computing Intensity, Memory Intensity,
    Throughput Intensity and Short Turnaround Time. Towards this end, analytics workflows
    designed, will be sent for execution on well-known HPC and Big Data frameworks,
    which will run on HPC resources abstracted to the user, as demonstrated on the
    lower part of the architecture. CYBELE relies heavily on HPC infrastructure, to
    provide the compute power required to advance models and methods and will take
    a two-fold approach; a) focus on tuning the HPC software stack to allow for efficient
    execution of Big Data processing frameworks on top of HPC resources, b) target
    the HPC resource management layer and its interface with Big Data processing frameworks
    and orchestration engines, thus bridging the gap between the HPC and Big Data
    worlds. In addition to that, the efficient execution of analytics workflows and
    the management of resources comes with multiple challenges. In the context of
    CYBELE, optimization of workflows on different frameworks will be examined for
    performance, along with tasks scheduling on resources to meet resource constraints/performance
    constraints/ time constraints. Depending on the workflow and the frameworks in
    use, CYBELE consortium will explore the abilities of the framework''s scheduler
    to optimize the workflow and guarantee performance, as well as the deployment
    through an orchestrator such as Kubernetes, which can optimize the performance
    of a workflow over multiple frameworks with its highly modular architecture and
    ability to run multiple and customized schedulers. The analysis results will then
    need to be visualized and presented to the end users in a precise, coherent, and
    user-friendly way. Towards this end, as demonstrated on the upper left part of
    the architecture, adaptive visualization / user interfaces will be delivered,
    improving the way in which information is presented, for example by converting
    the raw data into interactive visualizations and dosing the information available
    at any given time. Synchronized views can be included within a customizable dashboard
    that allows adaption of the visualization and the analysis of dynamic data to
    an appropriate level according to the profile and knowledge of the end user. The
    following sub-sections go into more depth for some of the aforementioned core
    components of the CYBELE conceptual architecture, to better familiarize the user
    with the technical approach to be followed in order to yield the aspired results.
    2.1. (HPC & Big Data storage & computing) resource abstraction CYBELE relies on
    HPC infrastructure, to provide the compute power required to advance models and
    methods for PA. In this direction, CYBELE will take a two-fold approach; first,
    we will focus on tuning the HPC software stack to allow for efficient execution
    of Big Data processing frameworks on top of HPC resources. Second, we will target
    the HPC resource management layer and its interface with Big Data processing frameworks
    and orchestration engines. This approach is necessary to bridge the gap between
    the worlds of HPC and Big Data, which reflects to the system architecture, the
    software stacks and the resource abstraction, and stems from having their roots
    in different classes of problems. We should note that HPC infrastructure used
    in CYBELE includes both typical HPC resources, as well as partitions of resources
    built for data analytics and other data-intensive applications. However, within
    CYBELE, we envision to explore the full scaling and computing capabilities of
    all available HPC resources. A core issue to be addressed within CYBELE is efficient
    I/O and data movement, to handle the volume and velocity of data. On HPC infrastructure,
    storage resources and compute resources are decoupled, and compute resources use
    a parallel file system, such as LUSTRE [28] or General Parallel File System (GPFS)
    [29], and Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) [30] semantics to perform
    I/O operations, or a network file system (NFS) and name-space sharing. As a result,
    storage is optimized for infrequent I/O of large batches of data, typically to
    instantiate simulations or store results or checkpoints. On the other hand, traditional
    Big Data infrastructure relies on low-latency and reliable local storage, with
    a distributed file system, such as the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) [31],
    handling the batches of data and guaranteeing fault-tolerance. The mismatch between
    the two architectures can cause severe performance degradation when executing
    big data frameworks over HPC resources, as big data frameworks are designed with
    the principle of data being close to the processing unit. We will work to alleviate
    this mismatch using local file systems mapped by the shared file system and will
    explore software layers that eliminate overheads related to POSIX-like semantics
    [32]. We will additionally enable efficient mechanisms for Big Data frameworks
    to use near storage, such as Solid State Drives (SSDs), to enable scaling up to
    multiple nodes avoiding the latencies involved from frequently accessing the shared
    file system [33]. Besides techniques for efficient “vertical” data movement, within
    CYBELE, we will procure Remote Direct Memory Access [34] (RDMA)-enabled data analytics
    frameworks [35], to enable efficient “horizontal” data movement, i.e. efficient
    communication between nodes, since modern HPC infrastructure that allows for such
    deployments. Container technologies (e.g. Docker) will allow for seamless adaptation
    of the software stack to the needs of the application, without affecting the HPC
    applications executing on the HPC systems. CYBELE will also work on efficiently
    coupling the resource management for Big Data frameworks over HPC resources. HPC
    resource managers (SLURM [36], Torque [37], etc.) interact with the user, who
    submits a “job”, only once, to grant the requested resource allocation that remains
    unmodified until completion of the application. In contrast, Big Data resources
    managers (MESOS [38], YARN [39], Kubernetes [40], etc.) embrace the concept of
    elastic resource allocation: they either allocate resources to meet application
    demands, or negotiate with applications for resources. Also, Big Data frameworks
    implement their own, standalone schedulers to manage their tasks on a set of resources.
    To enable the execution of Big Data frameworks over HPC resources, within CYBELE,
    we will enable the execution of Big Data resource managers over resource allocations
    provided by the traditional resource managers of HPC systems. To achieve this,
    we will deploy advanced orchestration engines, like Kubernetes, alongside traditional
    HPC resource managers. We will extend the HPC resource managers with the ability
    to interface with orchestration engines, to allow for the creation and deployment
    of YARN, Hadoop, Spark, and other clusters on resource allocations granted by
    HPC resource managers. This approach has manifold benefits: i) the operation of
    HPC systems is not disrupted, ii) any Big Data framework can run over HPC resources,
    iii) any Big Data scheduler can be deployed, iv) the HPC resource manager dedicated
    a set of isolated resources (CPUs, memory, GPUs, FPGAs, etc.) to the executing
    frameworks, v) the HPC resource manager can implement topology-aware and I/O aware
    policies, vi) the Big Data resource manager/orchestrator (as a second level of
    scheduling) can implement resource elasticity within the given resources and locality-aware
    policies. 2.2. Parallel execution management Within CYBELE, the data preparation
    and modeling tasks, which fall under the category of Big Data processing and analytics,
    need to run efficiently in its ecosystem, for a variety of data and model sources.
    The CYBELE architecture will support a variety of frameworks, for batch processing,
    e.g. Hadoop, for streaming processing, e.g. Apache Storm and Apache Kafka, for
    iterative processing, e.g. Apache Mahout and Apache Spark. Several of these frameworks
    come with components that will serve the needs of CYBELE demonstrators for machine
    learning (e.g. MLBase), deep learning (e.g. DeepLearning4j), predictive analytics
    (e.g. Oxdata H2O), graph analytics (e.g. GraphX). In addition, many frameworks
    offer support for transparent execution of workloads on accelerators, namely GPUs.
    The efficient execution of analytics workflows and the management of resources
    comes with multiple challenges. In the context of CYBELE, we will work on the
    following aspects: i) how to optimize workflows on different frameworks for performance,
    ii) how to schedule tasks on resources to meet resource constraints/performance
    constraints/ time constraints. For workflows with time constraints, e.g. stream
    processing, CYBELE will rely on dedicated data analytics platforms. Depending
    on the workflow and the frameworks in use, we will explore the abilities of the
    framework''s scheduler to optimize the workflow and guarantee performance, as
    well as deployment through an orchestrator such as Kubernetes, which can optimize
    the performance of a workflow over multiple frameworks with its highly modular
    architecture and ability to run multiple and customized schedulers. The challenges
    are different for compute-intensive workflows, as are deep learning tasks on high-dimensional
    data: such workloads require high computational power and large scale. To this
    direction, CYBELE will work with best practices and optimized software, coming
    from the world of HPC, to enhance performance through scaling and efficient utilization
    of all available compute resources (CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, etc.). For non-critical
    data processing tasks with low demands on resources, we will explore the potential
    of using YARN or we will directly use the built-in schedulers of frameworks. An
    important issue CYBELE will need to address is workflow scheduling across different
    system partitions and/or resource allocations, as provided by the HPC resource
    manager. For example, a workflow may include some data streaming tasks and some
    data analytics tasks, which, for reasons of performance, should run on different
    partitions of a system and be composed of different frameworks. Within CYBELE,
    we will develop those necessary components, interfaces and tools for HPC resource
    managers and the orchestrator, that will allow communication of events and data
    between frameworks through the resource manager, for the execution of a workload.
    Efficient workflow execution heavily relies on selecting the right framework and
    the best set of resources for the various tasks. A compute or data operator within
    a workflow can be expressed on top of various engines, and some may be more efficient
    than others. Also, for the efficient execution of the workflow, each task needs
    to be assigned the right amount of resources. To optimize workflow execution on
    HPC systems, we will explore the usage of IReS, an open-source, multi-criteria
    meta-scheduler of tasks onto analytics engines and resources, developed for the
    EU-funded project ASAP. In CYBELE, we will focus on integrating IReS with the
    orchestrators and resource management tools used within the project. 2.3. Workflow
    & experiment composition & instantiation The Experiment Composition Environment
    aims to facilitate the detaching of the design, development and execution of the
    big data analysis processes (including descriptive, predictive, classification,
    clustering, and prescriptive analytics) aspired and expected by the demonstrators
    for the execution of their scenarios, supporting embedded scientific computing
    and reproducible research. The basic requirement driving the implementation of
    the Experiment Composition Environment regards the need to provide simple and
    homogeneous access to a variety of algorithm packages, without the necessity of
    having deep knowledge of the execution requirements of each algorithm. This requirement
    will be supported through the provision of access to set of registered algorithms
    along with the provision of user-friendly interfaces for the specification of
    the main execution parameters. In order to support the flexibility on realizing
    part or an overall analysis workflow, the design and implementation of the Experiment
    Composition Environment will be based on a microservices-based architecture enabling
    in a modular way both registering new algorithms at the analysis engine, as well
    as invoking the execution of the analytic processes. The Experiment Composition
    Environment will expose a set of a set of open APIs facilitating the access to
    the analytics mechanisms and the design, development and execution of analytics,
    empowering software developers to develop analysis scripts without restrictions
    in the programming language (e.g. R, Python, Java) and data scientists to design
    analytic workflows, consisting of sets of processes and related input and output
    parameters in a user friendly and intuitive way. The environment will also support
    the application of different execution modes, e.g. sequential or parallel execution
    of R algorithms for smaller data streams or in clustering mode by the HPC and
    big data frameworks (e.g. Spark, Hadoop, Kafka etc.) provided through the parallel
    execution management layer over the managed HPC clusters abstracted through the
    Resource Abstraction Layer. The analysis process will be based on the selection
    of an analysis template after the input datasets (training and/or evaluation datasets)
    have been queried and provided to the Experiment Composition Environment by the
    Advanced Query Builder. Each analysis template will represent a specific algorithm
    with the associated software and execution endpoint, and will provide to the user
    the flexibility to adjust the relevant configuration parameters, including input
    parameters for the algorithm along with their description and their default value,
    execution parameters that denote whether an analysis should be realized in a manual
    or automated way, as well as the periodicity factor for the latter case, parameters
    associated with networking and computing resources constraints, as well as output
    parameters along with their type (text, image, data, html). The proposed approach
    also supports the design and implementation of data analysis workflows, consisted
    of a series of data analysis processes, interconnected among each other in terms
    of input/output data streams/objects. Upon the execution of an analysis template,
    the outcome could constitute the input for another analysis template. In this
    way, complex analysis processes can be broken down in smaller processes interlinked
    in the form of a workflow. The output of the analysis template execution will
    be a session object that contains on memory all output values (e.g. set of URLs
    providing access to the set of results). Session object values returned by a template
    call can feed as arguments a subsequent template call, without ever retrieving
    the object. Thus, analysis templates chaining will become even more powerful and
    pave the way for greater experimentation flexibility, considering a code snippet
    as an input value parameter, enabling injecting raw code into the function call.
    The implementation of the Experiment Composition Environment will be based on
    open source tools such as Apache Airflow enabling authoring workflows as Directed
    Acyclic Graphs of tasks. 2.4. Advanced analytics In order to perform advanced
    analytics to the provided data through either its autonomous or semi-autonomous
    examination, several sophisticated techniques or tools will be used in order to
    discover deeper insights, make predictions, or generate recommendations. The main
    object is to focus on forecasting future events and behaviors, enabling businesses
    to conduct what-if analyses to predict the effects of potential changes in business
    strategies. For that reason, classical statistical methods, as well as newer,
    more machine-driven techniques will be used, such as deep learning, for identifying
    patterns, correlations and groupings in data sets. In more details, in the case
    of CYBELE, advanced analytics algorithms will be provided to the stakeholders
    with the ability to visually explore the different kinds of data, while discovering
    and addressing new patterns. What is more, machine learning and predictive modelling
    techniques will be updated in order to be able to manage the predictive life cycle
    of data preparation, exploration and analysis, for achieving better deployment
    and monitoring. Through CYBELE, the provided advanced analytics algorithms will
    semi-automate, or even automate the already developed processes that exist to
    improve data performance, thus gaining quicker and more efficient results. Moreover,
    the data mining process will be streamlined, creating both high-performance and
    accurate models, while predictive models will be possible to be built using traditional
    statistical, data mining or text mining algorithms. As a result, the latter will
    lead to cost and latency reduction, since CYBELE will automate in-database scoring
    to improve model performance and get faster results. To this end, another innovation
    of CYBELE will be to design machine learning and prototyping algorithms for production
    that will be able to automatically update themselves by constantly retaining data
    sets, performing cross-validation, refining and discovering new rules. The work
    that will be done will be to first build incremental algorithms that will be then
    parallelized. In this case, there will be a strong need for building accurate
    local knowledge in order to optimize the work of aggregating nodes. Our goal will
    be to consider the most suitable existing algorithm in the incremental case, and
    make it distributed. For instance, the FP-Growth principle may be used, in order
    to evaluate the performance when the computing nodes divide their input streams
    into batches and send regular updates to the intermediate nodes. A major issue
    will be to deal with the trade-off between computation time and results accuracy,
    thus approximate algorithms will be considered since they are able to perform
    in real time. 3. Results The CYBELE project officially started on January 2019,
    thus no scientific results have yet been made available. Nevertheless, the CYBELE
    concept, approach and technical solution will be evaluated and technically validated
    through a series of 9 demonstrators, 5 from the domain of PA, and 4 from the domain
    of PLF, which are briefly described in the forthcoming sections. 3.1. Organic
    Soya yield and protein-content prediction The EU is strongly dependent on other
    continents for plant-based proteins. Plant proteins are mainly used for animal
    husbandry and by far the majority of the need is covered by soybean. Currently,
    the EU imports the equivalent of about 32 M tons of soya, mainly as processed
    soya-meal, from Brazil, Argentina and the US. Unlike the US and the rest of the
    world, GMO products are banned in the EU, meaning that we must rely on our own
    production and increase its efficiency. The constrains are only partially due
    to market trends while there is a large room for technical improvement in cultivation
    and processing phases. Those improvements should be aiming at increasing the efficiency
    of production and, at the same time, decreasing the environmental impact. An innovative
    concept that well summarises the need for improvement is to optimise the protein
    production instead of optimising the production of soybean in general, meaning
    that the inputs brought into the system should aim at producing as much protein
    as possible. Using the dataset acquired through crowdsourcing, we will derive
    methods for predicting yield and protein-content maps based on satellite imagery
    and additional information (if available) concerning electromagnetic soil scans,
    drone images and sensory data. Time-series of satellite images are very indicative
    of the relative yield and protein content on the field, i.e. they can pinpoint
    the areas in which soybean grows better and in which it grows worse. By knowing
    the absolute value of the yield and protein content on the whole farm, we can
    “reverse-engineer” these traits in these specific areas of the field and derive
    the corresponding maps. We will train state-of-the-art satellite image processing
    techniques for delineation of different zones inside the fields and advanced machine
    learning algorithms for prediction of yield and protein content based on the crowdsourced
    data. 3.2. Climate smart predictive models for viticulture Climate change has
    a profound impact on the growth rate and growth patterns of plants and crops.
    More specifically, different crop growth and development processes are affected
    by climatic variability via linear or nonlinear relationships resulting in complex
    and unexpected responses. It has been argued that such responses can best be captured
    by process-based crop simulation models that quantitatively represent the interaction
    and feedback responses of crops to their environments. The purpose of this Use
    Case is to demonstrate the capacity of the HPC solutions proposed in the project
    for supporting complex highly-nonlinear models for vine and grape growth with
    respect to the extreme number of variables (data types) that have been shown to
    affect the quality and quantity of the produced yields. Such crop models could
    estimate vine and grape growth and crop yield at larger scales, with spatial sources
    of information on soils, water, land use, and other factors. This way, much larger
    predictions of yield could be achieved across regional scales. This could also
    allow researchers to look at different scenarios of land use change, water, and
    climate change. In the context of the proposed Use Case, we aim to examine the
    efficiency of different optimization techniques on both directions. Indicative
    examples for direction (a) is the usage of quasi-Newton optimization techniques
    like BFGS and its memory optimized L-BGFS variation, where an approximation of
    the Hessian matrix of the cost function is used and, in the latter case, is reduced
    to vector-matrix multiplications. Similarly, for direction (b) we will examine
    the applicability of different parallel matrix multiplication algorithms like
    the Coppersmith–Winograd algorithm which has been shown to achieve the best complexity
    thus far (O(n2.376)) or the memory-optimal Cannon''s algorithm. 3.3. Climate services
    for organic fruit production The increased occurrence of extreme weather events
    due to climate change has heightened the need to develop support decision systems
    that can help farmers to mitigate losses in agriculture. Environmental hazards,
    such as frost and hail, have a relevant economy impact on crops since they may
    cause several damages and injuries in sensitive crops and, therefore, production
    losses. Horticultural crops, such as apple trees, are sensitive to frost and hail
    events. and protecting them from the effects of low temperature and hail damage
    is crucial. Frost is a serious problem for horticultural / fruit-trees production
    both early and late in the season since water within the plants may freeze during
    a frost event, while the damage caused by hail depends on the hailstone size,
    number per unit area and kinetic energy. In both cases, climate conditions influence
    the occurrence probability of these events, together with other issues such as
    vegetation present, topography and soil type with relevance at local scale. Passive
    and active protection methods for frost and hail exist in the market with their
    different characteristics, effects and costs. So, early warning systems at local
    scale with a suitable spatial resolution on frost and hail occurrence and their
    associated risks are relevant for agriculture. Frost and hail forecasts may help
    farmers to reduce any possible injuries to their crops since protection methods
    can be used. Integration and comparison of estimated stage of fruit bud development
    models with temperature and air humidity forecasts and other ancillary data can
    be used for risk probability mapping in order to establish an early warning system
    that can help farms to prevent damage effects through the use of protection methods
    for frost and hail. This pilot demonstrator will be focused on climate predictors
    that are either correlated with frost or hail occurrence and then can be used
    for planning risk prevention operations. satellite-derived earth observation data
    together with climate forecasts approaches will be joined for development and
    validation of the climate services. Moreover, earth observation time series based
    on validated data-sets from internationally leading organizations can be used
    for validation procedures. The aim is to explore the potential added value of
    novel earth observation satellites for climate services as a tool for horticultural
    crop / fruit-trees management. Climate projections, crop growth models, soil parameters
    and satellite based time series of observations will be integrated to produce
    added value indicators for organic fruit producers. 3.4. Autonomous robotic systems
    within arable frameworks Dictated by the weather, farming tasks have often to
    be carried out within a short time window. Consequently, equipment has increased
    in size to complete the work rapidly. One alternative solution is for farmers
    to manage fleets of smaller, autonomous vehicles and carry out the tasks as required.
    The range of operations to be delivered include soil chemical analysis, hyperspectral
    imaging (HSI) of soil/crop condition, real time object level (plant/weed) identification,
    individual plant harvest readiness assessment (particularly for soft fruits) and
    plant level automated harvesting, currently not possible because it would be massively
    labor intensive. The ultimate goal is for minimally sized equipment e.g. small
    tractor or scouting vehicle to carry the sensory devices e.g. spectral analysis
    equipment, imaging (visible and HSI). Such sensor ‘transporters’ can be combined
    with a network of ‘actuator’ devices such as plant level harvesters, precision
    soil enrichment vehicles or cultivation/planting equipment. It is envisaged that
    a pair (at least) of systems can operate in tandem on a given task with the sensory
    elements passing over the crop relaying measurement data to a central location.
    The data can then be processed to identify plant, weed, readiness for harvest
    etc., generating the inputs for the actuator to harvest the appropriate plant.
    3.5. Optimizing computations for crop yield forecasting Crop yield monitoring
    can be used as a tool for agricultural monitoring (e.g. early warning & anomaly
    detection), index based insurance (index estimates) and farmer advisory services
    for various stakeholders. These crop yield monitoring solutions ingest crop, soil
    & historic weather data, while also 10–25 weather data forecasts are used to provide
    a distribution of potential forecasts, using a cropping systems model to provide
    the productivity estimate. In this use case the parcel specific data associated
    with advanced weather forecasts and computations (weather data interpolation,
    crop growth model) will be prepared for computations on an HPC, while also considering
    the addition of a third data source, data processed for Sentinel Satellite Imagery
    for validation of the parcel specific estimates. First step is to reproduce the
    currently used application for Europe to function as a baseline, second step is
    to use the same system for parcel specific estimates, at least for the Netherlands
    and potentially another Member State. There are three scientific challenges in
    this use case: 1) Data preparation for efficient computation on the HPC. Currently
    an individual computation for one grid cell/polygon is optimized for efficient
    computation. 2) The added value of producing crop productivity estimates on a
    farmer''s parcel needs to be explored. 3) With faster and more computations, the
    possibilities for easily ingesting additional data (e.g. NDVI/WDVI derived from
    Satellite Imagery) increase dramatically. This requires scientific advances to
    ingest this data in a smart and automated way. 3.6. Pig weighing optimization
    An accurate estimate of the live weight of slaughter pigs is useful to the farmer
    in several different ways. First of all, knowing the weight of the pigs in a pen
    allows the farmer to know the optimal time to send his pigs to the slaughter house.
    Second, an accurate estimate of the weights of the pigs can be used for more accurate
    dosing of medicine, which can potentially lead to a lower use of e.g. antibiotics,
    which is important for combating the spread of multi-resistant bacterial strains
    in farm animals as well as humans. Knowing the optimal slaughter time alone is
    of such great value that some big pig producers have staff employed for the sole
    task of performing manual weightings. This practice is very laborious and time
    consuming, making it unfeasible for most producers. On these more common herds,
    being able to infer the live weight of the pigs indirectly via e.g. video images
    would be optimal. A number of studies have been published which attempt to achieve
    this using traditional image processing. The demonstrator has three main goals:
    (1) To estimate the mean and standard deviation of the live weight of grower/finisher
    pigs in a pen based on video images; (2) To track the weight of individual pigs
    in a pen based on video images; (3) To incorporate the growth curve estimated
    by the CNNs in previously developed models for early warning of diarrhea. 3.7.
    Sustainable pig production Sustainable pig production and global food challenges
    require producing with optimal productivity, health and welfare of the pigs. The
    pig farmer is becoming a manager of growing farms with several thousands of fattening
    pigs. There are large efforts being done to improve genetics, improve feeding,
    etc. to maximize the productivity of the pigs. However, the usage and fusion of
    all data generated throughout the lifetime and after slaughter is the future way
    to be able to really fully exploit the potential of each fattening pig and remains
    a relatively uncultivated field of innovation. This demonstrator wants to improve
    the health and welfare of the pigs, and work on fulfilling the potential of each
    pig through its life and increase the quality of the end-product for the market
    and the consumers. This will be done through data fusion of various data sources
    coming from multiple on-farm sensors and software systems, image analysis, management
    data and slaughterhouse records. The impact of the data fusion and analytics will
    be demonstrated for the purpose of health and welfare warnings, boar taint and
    meat quality assessment. The demonstrator has two main goals: (1) improve the
    detection of health, welfare and performance problems at fattening pig farms through
    better use of available sensor and farm data; (2) reduce boar taint and improve
    carcass and meat quality by linking on-farm related factors and slaughterhouse
    data at a large scale. In general, the demonstrator aims to bring data and techniques
    together to enlarge the impact. 3.8. Open sea fishing During the last decade,
    fisheries management in the EU increasingly succeeded in rebuilding overfished
    stocks and preventing overfishing. These successes stem mainly from the increased
    availability of data and better analysis methods that enabled to assess, and thus
    provide more precise management for an increasing number of commercially exploited
    fish stocks. Despite this positive trend, the state of the largest part of the
    marine ecosystem, including most fish stocks, remains largely unknown causing
    that little ecosystem-based management has been put in place. An important reason
    for this is that most marine data is collected by means of scientific surveys
    on research vessels. Such surveys are expensive, and consequently, it is practically
    impossible to provide a full spatiotemporal data-coverage of the seas. Due to
    the lack of sufficient processing capacity and adequate database systems, nor
    fishers e.g. to optimise their operational decisions, nor fisheries managers make
    optimal use of these data. Solutions to be explored within the context of CYBELE
    include: 1) Hidden Markov Modelling combined with nonparametric methods (e.g.
    interpolation of vessel tracks) will be used to analyse vessel trajectories, whereupon
    the various states will be coupled to landing data. This will provide information
    about the occurrence of hotspots and provide better insights into the targeting
    behaviour of the fleet, as well as the spatial distribution of fish. 2) The data
    of all the sensors on board of a fishing vessels will be merged whereupon multivariate
    analysis will be used to increase the value of the information and provide advice
    to skippers. This demonstrator''s objective is to reduce the fuel usage per kg
    of landed fish, and to reduce the amount of bycatches. 3) Images of the hyperspectral
    and RGB cameras will be analysed using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. Adapted
    segmentation and classification networks such as YOLO, U-Net, Mask RCNN and others
    will be used to obtain accurate fish species masks during the haul. As deep learning
    architectures are data-hungry, autoencoder networks will be used to apply data
    augmentation in a more efficient way. 3.9. Aquaculture monitoring and feeding
    optimization Aquaculture is probably the fastest growing food-producing sector
    and now accounts for more than 50 percent of the world''s fish that is used for
    food. With the world population expected to reach nine billion by 2050, the aquaculture
    sector will play a key role in ensuring food and nutrition security. However,
    this growth is not without challenges; in order to satisfy the demand and minimize
    the impact on the environment, the sector has to use new technologies to intensify,
    diversify and produce in a more efficient, sustainable and environmental friendly
    way. One of the main issues in commercial aquaculture is the lost food when the
    fish are fed. This not only increases the cost of the produced fish (feed cost
    is a major cost component that accounts for approximately 70% of the OPEX of the
    farm) but furthermore, this wasted food is deposited in the seabed and generates
    an environmental impact on the surrounding area. Another challenge is maintaining
    the farm in a good condition. If the cages are not in the correct positions, have
    deformations, anti-bird nets not placed correctly, etc. this usually leads to
    damages, financial losses and uncontrolled escapes to the environment. The project
    will make use of drones, image processing and data mining to optimize feeding,
    evaluate impact on the environment and evaluate the status of the infrastructure
    in open sea aquaculture. Within the context of CYBELE, we will use methods like
    segmentation and region proposal and object tracking, in order to analyze water
    movements from color, problems in nets and cages, fish positions, etc., up to
    video analysis and machine learning, in order to investigate fish behavior in
    a deeper level. This information will be combined with other data such as weather
    information and sensor measurements (mainly related to Oxygen and current speed)
    in order to develop an efficient feed management system that can help companies
    to make optimum use of the feed, reduce costs and also reduce the impact on the
    environment. 3.10. Necessity of HPC and Big Data infrastructures The following
    table summarises how aligned is the set of demonstrators organized by CYBELE consortium
    partners, with the necessity of integrating and making available HPC and Big Data
    infrastructures as opposed to trying to achieve the demonstrator goals through
    conventional infrastructures, (Table 1). Table 1. Necessity of integrating and

    The scope of the current paper is to introduce CYBELE, a platform aspiring to
    safeguard that the stakeholders involved in the agri-food value chain (research
    community, SMEs, entrepreneurs, etc.) have integrated, unmediated access to a
    vast amount of very large scale datasets of diverse types and coming from a variety
    of sources, and that they are capable of actually generating value and extracting
    insights out of these data, by providing secure and unmediated access to large-scale
    HPC infrastructures supporting advanced data discovery, processing, combination
    and visualization services, solving computationally-intensive challenges modelled
    as mathematical algorithms requiring very high computing power and capability.
    The CYBELE project officially started on January 2019, thus no scientific results
    have yet been made available. Nevertheless, the CYBELE concept, approach and technical
    solution will be evaluated and technically validated through a series of 9 demonstrators,
    5 from the domain of PA, and 4 from the domain of PLF, as briefly presented. Declaration

    critical factor in the agricultural sector’s long-term success. The ﬁndings revealed\
    \ that the agricultural\nbusiness sector is open to implementing Information and\

    \ how advantageous it is for Romanian farmers to invest in\na project that employs\
    \ smart cattle farming methods that incorporate Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI),\n\
    Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and the Internet of Things (IOT). An unstructured\
    \ interview was\nused to gather empirical evidence during a focus group meeting.\
    \ Analyzing the selected primary\nperformance metrics, it was projected that the\
    \ farm’s proﬁtability would increase by 19 percent,\nproductivity would increase\
    \ by 21 percent, and the farm’s environmental impact would decrease\nby 22 percent.\
    \ Automation and remote work would help minimize the farm’s worker burden while\n\
    also making control panels, decision-making ﬁles, and data analysis more available.\
    \ In order for\nthe domain to be as prosperous as possible, farmers must be made\
    \ aware of the beneﬁts of using\nthese emerging technologies for closing the gap\
    \ between farmers and Information Technology (IT)\nsolution providers, and this\
    \ can be accomplished through continuous training for both farmers and\ntheir\
    \ technology vendors.\nKeywords: agriculture 4.0; farm automatization; agricultural\
    \ digitalization; AI technologies; IOT\n1. Introduction\nOne of the basic branches\
    \ of agriculture is cattle farming [1] and it occupies a priority\nplace in the\
    \ economy of animal production [2] (p. 92). Cows are responsible for a variety\
    \ of\nproducts that also derive from this from this important branch, such as:\
    \ milk, meat, skins,\nmanure, etc. [2] (p. 92). The economic situation of dairy\
    \ farms in the European Union (EU)\nis unstable and strongly differentiated from\
    \ one-member countries to another [2] (p. 92).\nAccording to Eurostat’s statistics\
    \ a total of 158.2 million tons of raw milk is produced in\nthe EU, an increase\
    \ of 1.4 million tons from year-to-year [3]. Of these, 143.1 million tons\nare\
    \ cow’s milk. Romania occupies the penultimate position in the EU for cow production,\n\
    which reﬂects the inadequate structure of dairy farms. Farmers need to join associations\
    \ to\nbetter manage agricultural inputs, increase yields and production, reduce\
    \ costs, and sell\nraw milk efﬁciently [4].\nThis paper brings a new perspective\
    \ on how the implementation of IT technologies\nand innovations in agriculture\
    \ (animal husbandry) can improve the overall productivity of\nAgriculture 2021,\
    \ 11, 430. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture11050430\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriculture\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 430\n2 of 15\nthe industry in the ﬁeld. It contributes to\
    \ the existing specialized literature by proposing a\nnew method (methodologies/business\
    \ plan) that can be easily implemented by the busi-\nness owners, with the help\
    \ of a standardized procedure, customized and adapted to the\nspeciﬁcities of\
    \ a farm/business. Cattle breeding and exploitation is a traditional activity\
    \ of\nthe rural population and gives the character of a sustainable and promising\
    \ activity [5],\nwhich must include a grazing plane for the habitat conservation\
    \ purposes [6]. Beef is\nvery important because it is a safe resource for trade,\
    \ ensures labor stability, ensures do-\nmestic and export needs, which bring high\
    \ incomes to producers [7] (pp. 75–96). Milk is\na strategic product with a special\
    \ impact on children, the elderly, and those with various\ndiseases [8]. Due to\
    \ its complex chemical composition, high biological value and high\ndegree of\
    \ digestibility, milk represents a product of high importance [9]. Cows produce\n\
    more milk than their offspring require, and man has taken advantage of this since\
    \ the dawn\nof time [7] (pp. 75–96). Breeding programs have successfully increased\
    \ the amount and\nquality of milk cows produce. Cow’s milk contains about 87.4%\
    \ water and about 12.6%\nmilk solids (total solids) the latter comprising about\
    \ 3.9% fat, 3.2% protein, 4.6% lactose\n(anhydrous), and 0.9% ‘other solids’,\
    \ i.e., minerals, vitamins, etc. [7] (pp. 75–96). Milk could\nbe considered a\
    \ complete food product for people with nutritional needs [10]. Milk is a\ncrucial\
    \ agricultural product for the EU, ensuring that the stability of agricultural\
    \ production\nstill has the greatest importance as it had when the foundation\
    \ of European Community\ntook place [8] (pp. 17–33). The average world milk consumption\
    \ is estimated at 107 L per\ncapital, which varies in 380 L in Europe, 280 L in\
    \ North America, and 50 L in East Asia [11].\nIn general terms, usually the more\
    \ intensive a farm is, the greater the revenue turnover,\nyet efﬁcient farms are\
    \ found in all sizes and categories, with many of the smaller farms\nexperiencing\
    \ relatively high technical efﬁciency [12] (pp. 219–240). The number of farms\n\
    for milk production using any type of Automatic Milking System (AMS) is constantly\n\
    growing, especially in Eastern Europe [13] (p. 2). In recent years, the number\
    \ of AMS\ninstalled worldwide has increased dramatically and the worrying reality\
    \ is the quality of\nmilk produced and how it compares to conventional milk [14]\
    \ (p. 1). Some research shows\nthat the use of any kind of Conventional Milking\
    \ System (CMS) is more cost-effective\nthan the AMS [9] (p. 2). The biggest advantages\
    \ of the AMS are the quality of the milk,\nthe health and welfare of the animals,\
    \ the large amount of milk, the reduction of the labor\nforce and a better social\
    \ life of the dairy producers [15] (pp. 3–14). For commercial farms,\nautomatic\
    \ milking saves time compared to manual milking [16].\nSince the 1970s, there\
    \ has been discussions of food security, a relatively recent concept.\nFood security,\
    \ a component of economic security, requires food producers to have access\nto\
    \ the agricultural resources available for this purpose, with costs that allow\
    \ them to be\nproduced sustainably so that they can be delivered to consumers\
    \ at affordable prices. [17].\nIn the food industry, especially in the dairy industry,\
    \ the concept of hazard analysis and\ncritical control points (HACCP) guarantees\
    \ the quality of food due to their entire chain of\nsupervision, “from farm to\
    \ fork” [18] (pp. 173–177).\nGiven that external threats lead to mass contamination,\
    \ digitalization in the agri-food\nindustry is becoming a necessity [19]. These\
    \ digital technologies such as AI, large volumes\nof data, and robotics can help\
    \ farmers and companies to provide safe food, streamline pro-\ncesses, and create\
    \ new products and services. The beneﬁts of using these digital technolo-\ngies\
    \ are known to farmers and may include animal performance, optimizing production\n\
    factors, reducing labor, agricultural data ﬂows, improving conditions for farmers\
    \ and\nreducing the negative impact of agriculture on the environment [18].\n\
    Smart Farming (SF) refers to the application of ICT in agriculture. The use of\
    \ these\ntechnologies for farming activities stand for innovation and examples\
    \ of innovative tech-\nnologies are sensors, robots, weather satellites, and so\
    \ on [20]. These technologies rely\non data and they are dependent of the internet.\
    \ By collecting and analyzing these data,\nthe efﬁciency of production processes\
    \ increases, so that all actors involved, from farmers,\ncompanies, and institutions,\
    \ are motivated to work together to use innovative technolo-\ngies [19]. SF can\
    \ be deﬁned as a facilitator of efﬁcient, productive, and proﬁtable agricultural\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 430\n3 of 15\nenterprises [21] (pp. 179–187). The development\
    \ of data applications is a social product of\nthe interactions between people,\
    \ institutions, and technology itself. Basically, Big Data (BD)\napplications\
    \ are intrinsically sociotechnical [22]. Currently, farmers considering adopting\n\
    smart agriculture are faced with the absence of legal and regulatory frameworks\
    \ around\nthe collecting, sharing and use of agricultural data [23]. Farmers and\
    \ ﬁrms are creating,\nadapting, and adopting a range of new hardware, software,\
    \ mobile apps, sensor technolo-\ngies, and BD applications, all involved in disrupting\
    \ the established structures within the\nfarm machinery and associated data sectors\
    \ [24].\nSimilar results were observed during research carried on by the authors\
    \ to observe the\nlinks and disparities among the agriculture and ICT sectors,\
    \ with a study case in Romania,\ncarried on in in frame of TRACK Project (COS-CLUSTPARTN-2017-3-02:\
    \ “Tracking oppor-\ntunities to develop and strengthen data collection and big\
    \ data in agri-chain to increase\ncompetitivity of SMEs-TRACK”. Project was co-funded\
    \ by the European Union’s COSME\nProgramme). The main ﬁndings revealed that agricultural\
    \ business sector is open for adopt-\ning ICT solutions, and they need solutions\
    \ dedicated to their speciﬁcities of the farm or\ncompany. IT managers are facing\
    \ complications in adopting appropriate ICT solutions for\ntheir business. A slow\
    \ transition towards agri-food companies is observed. ICT companies\nmust bridge\
    \ the gap between innovation and farmers. There are some unique experiences\n\
    that began on both sides: supply and demand, and this is the starting point of\
    \ this article,\nfrom where the idea of this study came from. Consequently, the\
    \ goal of the paper is to\ndevelop creative solutions to adapt the cow farm software\
    \ model based on innovative ﬁeld\ntechnology, which enables farm productivity\
    \ to be increased while labor and time spent on\nthe farm to be reduced.\nThe\
    \ research question from which the substantiation of this article was based is\
    \ as\nfollows: “Is it opportune for Romania farmers to invest in a project that\
    \ uses smart cattle\nfarming methods integrating Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI),\
    \ Robotic Process Automation (RPA)\nand Internet of Things (IOT)?”\nFor ﬁnding\
    \ the answer to this question, a number of secondary key questions were set\n\
    up for our article:\nHow can innovative technologies on the market be integrated\
    \ into the operational\nactivity of farms and how will the farmer beneﬁt from\
    \ them?\nWill the farm proﬁtability be increased, and will there be an increase\
    \ in production?\nWill these technologies help the environment?\nThe research\
    \ results will lead to the adoption of disruptive technologies in animals,\nRPA,\
    \ Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT), in order to give efﬁciency, sustainability,\
    \ and com-\npetitiveness to enterprises, as well as to increase conﬁdence in disruptive\
    \ technologies in\nIndustry 4.0.\nThe ﬁrst objective is to integrate the Livestock\
    \ Management module with the required\ndevices and sensors, cloud computing, RPA,\
    \ and BD, while paving the road to full au-\ntomation and changing the gates,\
    \ scales, windows, climate systems, watering systems,\nfeeding systems, and adding\
    \ milking robots. The Livestock module is all about the well-\nbeing of the cattle,\
    \ its movement, alimentation, medical treatment, sleeping and milking\nperiods,\
    \ and so on. This ﬁrst objective speciﬁcally will generate many use cases.\n2.\
    \ Materials and Methods\n2.1. Business Models—Innovative Business Model\nPisano\
    \ [25] mentioned in 2015 that in the global framework that seems to affect\ncompanies\
    \ as well as human conduct, new socioeconomic and technical patterns are emerg-\n\
    ing. High uncertainty caused by rapid technological innovation and global competition\n\
    pushes organizations, in order to gain competitive advantages and grow their market\
    \ share,\nto develop and use various business models [26] (pp. 7–17).\nTo understand\
    \ which characteristics of a trend must be integrated in a new business is\nnot\
    \ an easy challenge, but it is strategically vital if entrepreneurs are to maintain\
    \ inspiration\nto run new businesses [25].\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 430\n4 of 15\n\
    The increasingly intense and volatile environment in which modern businesses must\n\
    operate necessitates the use of creative solutions in various areas of business\
    \ activity [27].\nBecause of today’s tough economic conditions for business groups,\
    \ implementing technolo-\ngies only in product and process areas may be inadequate\
    \ for achieving the enterprise’s set\ngoals [27]. Dynamic and tumultuous economic\
    \ environments encourage industries to seek\ninnovation in production, processes,\
    \ and organizational areas of business operations. As a\nresult, the need to make\
    \ changes may affect the company [28] (pp. 352–364), whereas the\nneed for change\
    \ may lead to a new Business Model (BM) [29] (pp. 1023–1030).\n2.2. Focus Group\n\
    Empirical data was collected in December 2020 at a one-day focus-group meeting.\n\
    The focus group is a qualitative data collection method, similar to the interview,\
    \ that is\nintended to use the group dynamics [30] (pp. 491–497). They are unstructured\
    \ interviews\nthat allow the participants and the researchers to create knowledge\
    \ together rather than to\nfocus on a singular solution to address the research\
    \ question [31] (pp. 400–417). The group\nenvironment encourages the participants\
    \ to engage in discussions and express ideas they\nhad not thought of on an individual\
    \ basis [31] (pp. 400–417). In recent years focus groups\nhave become a popular\
    \ research method in this ﬁeld [32] (pp. 400–417).\nThe meeting consisted in two\
    \ parts. Firstly, a group of 10 farmers was consulted in\norder to identify the\
    \ most important problems they face and to discuss their solutions. In the\nsecond\
    \ part the business model and the conclusions of the ﬁrst session were presented\
    \ to a\ngroup of 12 stakeholders and experts. The aim of the second session was\
    \ to validate the\nmodel and the results, and also to identify additional solutions,\
    \ opportunities, limitations,\nand barriers regarding the implementation of the\
    \ model. Thus, the participants were\nselected based on their expertise in different\
    \ key aspects [33] of the proposed model,\nas follows:\n•\nCluster (1; Agriculture)\
    \ and farmers associations (2)—Farmers needs and market\nopportunities for the\
    \ product;\n•\nClusters (3; IT, Environment and Green energy)—the model contribution\
    \ to a low\ncarbon and climate resilient economy in agriculture and food sectors;\n\
    •\nBusiness consultant (2)—business model and economic sustainability;\n•\nIT\
    \ providers (2) and Universities (2)—technical solutions;\nDue to the SARS-CoV-2\
    \ virus pandemic constraints, the research was implemented\nonline, through a\
    \ video conference. This approach limits the interactions of the participants,\n\
    but is less time consuming and expensive, and it is easier to record. The meeting\
    \ was\nrecorded and transcribed. This allowed for a greater familiarity with the\
    \ data and also\ngreater transparency [34].\n3. Results\nThe solutions identiﬁed\
    \ are new so far in the literature and are addressed mainly to\ncompanies in economically\
    \ and technologically developed countries. The novelty brought\nby our article\
    \ through the proposed solution consists in facilitating the diffusion of IoT\n\
    at the level of developing countries, for small and medium enterprises (SMEs)\
    \ in the\nagricultural ﬁeld. The proposed new BM involves changing existing management\
    \ systems\nwith new ones, based on information technologies that ensure increased\
    \ productivity of\ncompanies but also better management of environmental issues,\
    \ while minimizing the\nnegative impact of economic activities and maximizing\
    \ biodiversity conservation.\n3.1. Essential Conditions for the Success of the\
    \ Proposed Business Model\nWhile big sectors will likely invest with sophisticated\
    \ facilities, data-free intuition\nmanagement will no longer reﬂect the way professional\
    \ farms work. In the long term,\nsmall farms will constantly adopt fundamental\
    \ technologies. This should, particularly for\nthe new generation of digital farmers,\
    \ also be seen as a source of opportunities [34].\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 430\n\
    5 of 15\nSMEs are progressively implementing simple technologies, while major\
    \ farms are\nlikely to invest in sophisticated equipment, so data-free intuition-based\
    \ management\nfor future business farms will no longer be the norm. The new generation\
    \ of digitally\nknowledgeable young farmers should see this as a source of opportunities\
    \ [34].\nThe proposed cattle farm robotic solution comes at a time when technological\
    \ ad-\nvancements have reached a favorable level of maturity and the implementation\
    \ of such a\nmechanism has diminished costs [34]. There have been many good AI\
    \ and IOT proof of\nconcepts, most of them reaching the production environments.\
    \ The available technologies\nare either open source or can be used as services\
    \ [35], including a larger extent of provider\nindependence; or they are available\
    \ as standardized technologies from multiple vendors.\nA competitive market in\
    \ terms of service quality, low prices, and accurate cost esti-\nmates is assured\
    \ by the large number of AI and IOT providers.\nCollaborations are also a very\
    \ important factor, for example, within clusters, technol-\nogy adoption is simpler\
    \ and quicker. In terms of maintaining economic sustainability and\nempowering\
    \ entrepreneurs, disruptive innovations can be a solution. The implementation\n\
    of technology for one of a cluster’s members is sped up by proving it for the\
    \ others as well,\nensuring the never-ending demand of business competitiveness\
    \ and empowerment.\nOrganic ﬁrst actors are bound to have a more accelerated development\
    \ if they choose\nto integrate Industry 4.0 technologies in their routine [36].\
    \ This model of farm should stand\nas a foundation of the digitalization mission;\
    \ thus Agri-Food RPA has a serious growth\npotential in terms of market share.\n\
    IT and data gathering have achieved an unprecedented degree of conﬁdence [37],\n\
    while the afferent markets are in constant growth, in order to withhold the increased\n\
    demands for state of the art/disruptive information technologies which are responsible\n\
    as a result of smother and more accessible Agri-Food RPA services while keeping\
    \ the\ncosts competitive.\n3.2. Business Model\n3.2.1. How the Organization Creates\
    \ and Captures Value\nCentric IT, the organization responsible for developing\
    \ the software, creates and\ncaptures revenue by a developed and currently operated\
    \ Software as a Service (SAAS)\nportal which integrates complete business management\
    \ modules. The goal is to further\ndevelop the capabilities with AI and IOT technology,\
    \ transforming the expert software\nsystem to an intelligent software system.\
    \ Farm hardware will be operated by cloud\nsoftware robots, AI generated valuably\
    \ will learn and evolve, learning how the human\nmind learns and interfering with\
    \ prediction on the basis of our interpretation of the data\nthat is being trained.\n\
    3.2.2. The Target Audience\nCattle farmers have been the main focus in the beginning,\
    \ afterwards extending the\nservices towards vegetable milk and meat processing\
    \ businesses.\n3.2.3. The Key Differences\nThe services are reaching the end user\
    \ through a cloud portal which makes it more\naccessible and less costly to use\
    \ the technologies. The modules function as an integrated en-\nvironment, with\
    \ data shared between (e.g., account and stock management work together).\nAt\
    \ the heart of the project are cognitive technology, cloud computing, and remote\
    \ work.\nThe company offers a complete package for cloud computing services SAAS\
    \ that\ninclude management, development, and business operations.\n3.2.4. Its\
    \ Primary Capital and Partnerships\nProviding accessibility, availability, and\
    \ data security are key factors, and there are\nestablished marketing, consulting,\
    \ production, and support teams. A consortium of\ncompanies has been created,\
    \ directly or indirectly interested in the ﬁeld of agri-food, as an\nAgriculture\
    \ 2021, 11, 430\n6 of 15\naddition to our internal team. There is a well-established\
    \ collaboration with farmers’\ngroups that were the direct architects and beneﬁciaries\
    \ of the ﬁrst software module created\nby the company.\n3.2.5. Its Distribution\
    \ Networks\nGiven the fact that the platform is cloud based, the delivery channel\
    \ mostly relies on\nthe internet, through tools such as social media and online\
    \ marketing, the participation in\ninternational events and fairs, symposiums,\
    \ and conferences using the available Digital\nInnovation Hubs (DIH) communication\
    \ channels is a must for the successful propagation\nof the project and a reliable\
    \ BM.\n3.2.6. The Method by Which It Generates Revenue\nThe company’s clients\
    \ beneﬁt from the software’s capabilities through a monthly or\nannual subscription.\
    \ The price is calculated by the number of modules, the scale, and the\nnumber\
    \ of users of each module used in the channel of the customer. This solution allows\n\
    the beneﬁciary to upgrade or downgrade the package according to its needs. The\
    \ AI tech-\nnologies will be taxed as part of the monthly usage fee, while the\
    \ IOT will be invoiced as\nan extra fee.\n3.2.7. Expenditure Framework\nThe business\
    \ model strategy is based on value and in the beginning the current\ncustomers\
    \ would be the ﬁrst to utilize this technology. It is foreseen that the initial\
    \ number\nof customers will rise, in time, due to involvement in fairs, both domestically\
    \ and globally,\nas well as the demonstration activities and showcases that will\
    \ be hosted across Clusters\nand DIH.\nAccording to ﬁnancial forecasts for the\
    \ next three years, the margin will show a\n30 percent growth due to the emerging\
    \ technology that the business is incorporating into\nits goods (modules), but\
    \ the company’s turnover will also increase by 200 percent, fueled by\nthe number\
    \ of agri-food consumers who will pick up enterprise’s inventions alongside\n\
    its partners.\n3.3. Description of Applied Technology\nThe AI RPA with IOT for\
    \ cattle farms in its core is driven by a business process\nautomation designed\
    \ to reduce the burden of repeated work. This technology will be\nincorporated\
    \ with a variety of components, such as ICT, computers, hardware, and other\n\
    robots, through the IIOT. RPA is sometimes correlated and referred to as software\
    \ robotics,\nand ﬁgurative robots (bots) or AI “tour” the facility in order to\
    \ achieve what this technology\ndoes best.\nThe IIOT’s ﬂexibility and adaptability\
    \ makes it suitable for manufacturing, energy stor-\nage, integration of sensors,\
    \ tools and technology relating to electronic industrial applica-\ntions. This\
    \ connectivity makes data gathering, distribution, and analysis simpler. The efﬁ-\n\
    ciency and ease of use beneﬁts as an economic advantage. The IIOT consists of\
    \ developing\na distributed control system (DCS), which makes it possible to optimize\
    \ and improve\nprocess controls by using cloud computing.\nThe main concept of\
    \ this project is to have an AI information store, cognitive apps,\nlinked inside\
    \ a livestock farm to each sensor, computer, or robot. Communications must be\n\
    allowed from sensors to BD to cognitive applications to computers and robots,\
    \ for example\n(Figure 1).\nA lot of hardware (e.g., picture and audio processing,\
    \ air monitoring) has been in-\ntegrated into and with the SAAS-RPA system from\
    \ the 3rd partner, the Faculty’s Re-\nsearch Centre.\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 430\n\
    7 of 15\n3.3.1. Description of the Innovative Process Proposed by the Business\
    \ Model\nThe breakthrough is that RPA is responsible for both market and manufacturing\n\
    processes within agri-food industries beginning with cattle farms in applications.\
    \ The tech-\nnology can help with animal protection, hygiene, and medical treatments\
    \ such as antibiotics\nor other unsafe types of medical treatments. The system\
    \ can help prevent the milk from a\nmedicated cow to be mixed with the rest of\
    \ the untreated cows. This type of system can\nhelp raise the quality of products,\
    \ prevent contamination, and increase food security in a\nmanner that man will\
    \ never be able to without continuous surveillance.\nFigure 1. Industrial Internet\
    \ of Thing connection diagram (realized by authors).\nThe framework uses SAAS,\
    \ RPA, IIOT, Hardware, and Software Integration Tools to\nintegrate/interoperate\
    \ and will be sold as cloud-based services (Figure 2).\nIn virtual assisting and\
    \ information dissemination environments the RPA systems\nhave achieved good results,\
    \ but with this research, RPA and IIOT can be experimented in\nthe production\
    \ processes.\n3.3.2. Interoperability\nAs mentioned earlier, the technology also\
    \ uses the internet and has a component in-\nfrastructure such that connectivity\
    \ and interoperability with other applications, equipment,\nand robotics is central\
    \ to it.\n3.3.3. Replicability\nReplication can be conveniently conducted as a\
    \ SAAS gateway at the heart of the\nproject. For faster international implementation\
    \ and expansion, best practices and conﬁgu-\nration data can be easily replicated.\
    \ Integration hardware is still commonly used at the EU\nlevel by EU suppliers\
    \ and cloud technology.\n3.3.4. Reuse\nThe software center of the project has\
    \ the design “Farm Software Ecosystem”. In a\ntypical environment, a knowledge\
    \ base may often be used to enhance the efﬁciency of the\ncognitive program at\
    \ a reduced cost.\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 430\n8 of 15\nFigure 2. High level diagram\
    \ of software architecture (reproduced from [38], with permission from\nElsevier,\

    \ aim to achieve harmonious and\nsustainable growth for the agrarian sector through\
    \ the goals and actions mentioned. Sus-\ntainability is a must and can be assured\
    \ by:\n1.\nGood practice in the operations carried out and changes made in the\
    \ sector purchased\nalong the way will be a good beneﬁt and will continue through\
    \ the coming years;\n2.\nThe multiplier and multi-function impact would contribute\
    \ not only to beneﬁts for\nconsortiums on the labor market but for future generations\
    \ who are best positioned\nto beneﬁt from the advantages gained, savings made,\
    \ and knowledge gained.\n3.\nThe establishment of reciprocal ties between members\
    \ of the consortium, between the\nconsortium and third companies that would enable\
    \ access not only for the labor\nmarket, but also, indirectly, for the sharing\
    \ of good experience. This will allow the\nacquisition of the requisite practical\
    \ skills for possible business developments.\nThe consortium is structured to\
    \ ensure that its ﬁndings are not a ﬁnal objective but\nrather a starting point\
    \ for prospective efforts which would generate more advantages:\n1.\nTo provide\
    \ participants with cross-cutting business expertise and to assist them in\ncreating\
    \ new income.\n2.\nThe establishment of an advisory committee and its daily consultation\
    \ would lead to a\ncontinuous database that will allow the participants and other\
    \ stakeholders to access\ninformation (from the academic environment, socio-economic,\
    \ or administrative-\nlegislative environment).\n3.\nDiagnostic and inﬂuence analysis\
    \ are elements in which the key strategic directions\nfor adaptation rely, but\
    \ also the creation of new ones, and for the establishment\n(fundamental and/or\
    \ applied) directives for research in the consortium, at cluster\nlevel, will\
    \ be decided.\nIn order to strengthen creativity, collaboration with the corporate\
    \ community, infras-\ntructures, facilities, and technical expertise acquired\
    \ during this time will be further used\nin university teaching at a proper level\
    \ (Figure 3). The outcomes of smart cattle farming\nusing AI and RPA’s efforts\
    \ can be institutionalized.\nThe ﬁndings are incorporated into the agri-food policy\
    \ and plan at the state, regional,\nand national level. As previously discussed,\
    \ the fact that market climate developments are\na positive win and will continue\
    \ in the next few years ensures longevity.\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 430\n9 of 15\n\

    \ of the proposed solution, focus group estimated\na number of Key Performance\
    \ Indicators (KPIs) that could be evaluated during and after\nimplementation.\
    \ Therefore, 15 indicators were proposed and considered by the partici-\npants.\
    \ Five indicators were supported by 83% (10 out of 12), and thus were selected\
    \ as\nKPIs. To substantiate the decision, the KPI levels were estimated based\
    \ on the average\nresults of data collection and results analysis and comparisons\
    \ after digitalization of farm\nactivities/ﬂows. The data has been gathered by\
    \ the digitalization solutions usage and early\nadoption by 7 cattle farms with\
    \ about 200 cattle and about 350 hectares of crops cultivated\nfor animal food\
    \ production, which represents a regular family farm in Romania.\n-\nReduction\
    \ of human working hours at the farm, as an early estimation: in-ofﬁce work\n\
    by 82%, total hours by 14%. Of the whole farmer’s activities more than 20% represents\n\
    the ofﬁce work (e.g., data ﬁll-ins, reports generation, reports analysis, data-based\n\
    decision making) and this can be optimized by 82% percent based on company’s\n\
    statistics. All participants supported this indicator. The biggest supporters\
    \ were the\nUniversities and the Agricultural Cluster. This answers one of the\
    \ key issues raised\nby the 10 farmers in the ﬁrst round of the focus group.\n\
    -\nReduction of variable/hard-to-predict costs at the farm, as an early estimation:\
    \ by at\nleast 32%, as result of digitalization for better management of resources,\
    \ sensors mon-\nitoring and data archiving, pattern recognition of the cognitive\
    \ technologies offers\ngreat premises in terms of costs reduction and costs estimation\
    \ selected by 10 out of\n12 participants. The providers of IT solutions, Cluster\
    \ it, and business consultants\nwere the promoters of the measure.\n-\nIncrease\
    \ the proﬁtability of the farm, as an early estimation: 19%, by better resources\n\
    management, better estimations, better data-based planning support, better yields\
    \ out\nof disruptive industry 4.0 technologies adoption. It was proposed by all\
    \ participants.\nIt was also the main beneﬁt identiﬁed by farmers.\nAgriculture\
    \ 2021, 11, 430\n10 of 15\n-\nReduce the environmental impact, as an early estimation:\
    \ 22%, by better estimation\ntogether with better data-based decision-making generated\
    \ smaller environmental\nfootprints. Supported by 11 out of 12, especially by\
    \ Environmental Clusters and\nUniversities. They believe that: “Given the challenges\
    \ we currently face; an innovative\nbusiness model is bound to include an environmental\
    \ dimension”. In another quote\none of the participants stated that “This dimension\
    \ aligns the vision of the model with\nthe EU environmental principles found and\
    \ supported in the Common Agricultural\nPolicy.” However, the Farmers’ Association\
    \ was slightly retained, because in their\nopinion it can be “a limiting factor”.\n\
    -\nIncrease in production, as an early estimation: 21%, for instance, in the cattle\
    \ farm\nbusinesses the weather has a great impact on daily milk production for\
    \ dairy farms but\nalso in terms of daily weight gains for meat farms, so sensor\
    \ based/weather forecast\nbased decision-making digital systems offer a great\
    \ support for production increase.\nThe idea was supported by everyone, especially\
    \ by farmers and business consultants.\nAccording to a study done by Nesta in\
    \ 2015, precision agriculture and investing in\ntechnological advancements in\
    \ a farm can increase income possibilities by almost 20% [39].\nThis increase\
    \ in income can be achieved by cutting down costs with water or fertilizers,\n\
    for example. Nesta mentions that “new agricultural technologies can drastically\
    \ reduce the\ncosts of fertilizers or increase yields by even 5% [39]”.\nSales\
    \ are projected to increase slightly in the ﬁrst year as a result of the teams’\
    \ efforts to\nmarket the product, according to estimates. A small rise in turnover\
    \ is anticipated in the ﬁrst\nyear as a result of efforts to promote the product\
    \ in particular. The number of new customers\nis expected to rise signiﬁcantly\
    \ during the second and third year of implementation, as a\nresult of the promotion\
    \ carried out in the ﬁrst year (Figure 4). The margin growth is due\nto the increase\
    \ in revenue, and the cross-sales tactics. Customers get to know the brand\nand\
    \ the company goods better and order new linked modules or other offerings on\
    \ the\nsame portal.\nFigure 4. Financial projection over 3 years (authors’ estimation).\n\
    4. Discussion\nThis paper aims to develop modern agriculture platforms and to\
    \ increase the produc-\ntivity of farms by rapidly integrating emerging digital\
    \ innovations and innovative business\nmodels into agriculture.\nBusiness model\
    \ innovation (BMI) is one of the critical tasks that must be carried out\non a\
    \ continuous basis in every enterprise in order to maintain competitiveness in\
    \ today’s\ndigital economy. Although interest in BM has grown substantially since\
    \ the late 1990s,\nthere are few known factors in BMI procedures in SMEs, which\
    \ represent the vast majority\nof companies on the European market [40] (p. 344).\n\
    BMI is described as BMs’ activity-based view leading to modiﬁcations at the BM\n\
    of a company which are novel for the world or simply novel to the companies being\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 430\n11 of 15\nanalyzed [41] (pp. 216–226). The result of\
    \ BMI is to reconﬁgure the existing BM activities\nof an enterprise new to the\
    \ competing market [42] (pp. 183–198). It is a process which\nchanges the core\
    \ elements of a company and its business logic deliberately [43].\nThe digital\
    \ and technological advancements realized through Industry 4.0 transforma-\ntion\
    \ are enhancing the quality of the product, working safety, forecasting faults\
    \ and energy\nsavings [44]. It is expected that in the next 5 years the production\
    \ will be more efﬁcient and\ntrustworthy with up to 20% due to the Industry 4.0\
    \ approach [45,46].\nMany manufacturers are still involved in accelerating the\
    \ adoption and integration of\nsafe, reliable AI [47]. AI-based manufacturing\
    \ in particular has the potential to enhance\nKPIs of the industry processes.\n\
    Gargiulo et al. [48] discussed in 2020 about the low adoption rate of AMS regardless\
    \ of\nthe increased possibility of productivity and proﬁtability rates. Although\
    \ his study results\ncontest the research hypothesis, he concluded that CMS had\
    \ similar results with the AMS\nin terms of human resource costs, income level\
    \ and proﬁtability. The initial investment and\nmaintenance costs entail greater\
    \ cost of AMS [48]. Bijl et al. discovered that the over-cost\nfor AMS in the\
    \ Netherlands were signiﬁcantly lower [49] (pp. 239–248). New Zealand’s\nexpected\
    \ results regarding AMS were much lower than the results of CMS, all this due\
    \ to\nits fast depreciation rate, the high costs of maintenance and extensive\
    \ reparation costs [50]\n(pp. 239–248). In Ireland, the medium-sized CMS farms,\
    \ with an intermediate level of\nautomation, showed that the revenues for AMS\
    \ are much lower [51] (pp. 7700–7713).\nThere are also studies that have shown\
    \ that automated systems can be more proﬁtable\nthan the conventional systems.\
    \ In the United States it has been proven that AMS was most\nproﬁtable for herd\
    \ sizes between 120 and 240 cattle [52] (pp. 7739–7749).\nThe AMS technology is\
    \ growing in importance in this ﬁeld, and the estimates of the\nfocus group participants\
    \ take into account this trend. They argue that the proposed business\nmodel does\
    \ not refer only to milking, but to the entire production ﬂow. From animal welfare\n\
    to the safety and quality of the product obtained. Thus, in addition to increased\
    \ proﬁtability,\nit also reduces the occurrence of certain risks and costs present\
    \ in conventional systems.\nIn Romania, the future of agriculture is Emerging\
    \ Media, and efforts to neglect it reign\nin the growth of this ﬁeld. Farmers\
    \ around the world use the IOT, robotics, AI, and compre-\nhensive data to dramatically\
    \ enhance the farming processes. For agro-industrial nations,\nscientiﬁc advancement\
    \ in the new ﬁeld study is seen as a solution. Agricultural technology\nfocused\
    \ on IT goods, automation, and robotics that are commonly used can catalyze the\
    \ rise\nin efﬁciency and proﬁtability of agricultural operations. Digital technology,\
    \ according to\nresearch in the ﬁeld, is a practical way to address existing challenges\
    \ [53].\nThe digitization of agriculture increases the working conditions of farmers,\
    \ decreases the\ndetrimental environmental effects of agriculture, and also makes\
    \ agricultural holdings\nmuch more proﬁtable.\nIn the near future, digital farming\
    \ becomes the conventional one, and manufactur-\ners realize that they are able\
    \ to obtain productive returns by investing in technologies,\nincluding saving\
    \ seedlings, fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides and fuels [53].\nThe word “digital\
    \ economy” is not described in any particular way. The economy is\nseen as a system\
    \ for producing, exporting, trading, and exchanging products or services.\nA new\
    \ economic framework may be called this as evolving technologies are used to develop,\n\
    deliver, exchange, and consume processes. The major role of the global economy\
    \ is on the\nconsumer: the digital market is a place where goods and services\
    \ are traded through an IT\nand software network. At the same time, the digital\
    \ medium for assessing the operation\npatterns of market players is software,\
    \ the hardware, and some operating regimes [54].\nThe project will help reduce\
    \ the environmental footprint, using the most advanced\ntechnologies, the goal\
    \ is to protect the environment and moderate the energy waste. The pol-\nlution\
    \ should be close to non-existent in the ﬁrst year of use. A specialized procedure\n\
    for recycling, reuse, and transformation will be adopted, starting from the recycling\
    \ of\nordinary waste, streamlining processes, to the use of industrial composts\
    \ which in addition\nto these are ecological and efﬁcient method of recovery of\
    \ organic waste of all kinds, as it\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 430\n12 of 15\nis beneﬁcial\
    \ ﬁnancially. Reducing emissions of air pollutants from many major sources,\n\
    such as transport, industry, and electricity generation, will have a positive\
    \ impact on the\nenvironment. Reducing air pollution helps combat climate change\
    \ [55].\nAt the moment, both agricultural farms and ICT companies prosper for\
    \ collaboration,\nbut the proﬁt is not distributed equally among the participants.\
    \ The ICT are the ones that\nproﬁt the most. Income from partnership will be shared\
    \ by agri-food ﬁrms. Proposals in-\nclude giving people access to BD and eliminating\
    \ the need for labor. A core component\nof the new paradigm may be an online,\
    \ interconnected value chain. There is plenty of\nspace for additional measures\
    \ in the agricultural sector’s method of adjusting supply and\ntechnical demand.\n\
    Limitations\nThis business model, like others, is not immune to possible difﬁculties\
    \ or challenges\nin the implementation process. The main complications that could\
    \ disrupt the attempt to\nput into motion are:\n1.\nThere is a vast number of\
    \ suppliers and lot of proprietary technologies;\n2.\nAnother issue can be represented\
    \ by inadequate data sharing between ICT elements;\n3.\nThe drawbacks of software\
    \ and hardware licenses;\n4.\nData access, data ownership and access control are\
    \ another possible drawback;\n5.\nThe right to intellectual property;\n6.\nLow\
    \ acceptance and high consumption costs are in demand;\n7.\nShort deployment times\
    \ and a rapid learning curve or adoption of technological solutions;\n8.\nLast\
    \ but not least, the demand from the end consumer to slowly but gradually uptake\n\
    the technology.\n5. Conclusions\nThe most important beneﬁts of the AMS are the\
    \ increased milk consistency, ani-\nmal health and welfare, the large amount of\
    \ milk produced, and the reduction of labor\nneeded. Farming dairy cows is a heavy\
    \ physical labor that causes, in the long term, a series\nof conditions in the\
    \ most experienced practicians of the job issues that can be solved with\nautomation\
    \ and remote work. Farmers need to be made aware of the advantages of using\n\
    these emerging innovations. Issues related to the health of the animal can be\
    \ found much\nfaster with the help of RPA, resulting in a better medical assistance.\n\
    It is worth noting that, regardless of political changes, Romania’s industrial\
    \ transfor-\nmation in the agri-food sector is important and should be embraced\
    \ and implemented as a\nstrategic priority in a multi-year strategy. Furthermore,\
    \ digitalization in agriculture and the\nfood industry should be seen as part\
    \ of a larger digitalization phase. Romanian Govern-\nment observed this necessity,\
    \ so it speciﬁcally assumes, for the 2021–2027 strategy, that one\nof the major\
    \ needs for achievement the Speciﬁc Objective 2 of the strategy (Strengthen mar-\n\
    ket orientation and increase competitiveness), so-called Need 05. Increasing investment\n\
    in precision agriculture and digitization is important, as they are essential\
    \ tools for the\nsustainability of the agricultural sector and for increasing\
    \ competitiveness [56].\nAlso, it observed that a close collaboration with transversal\
    \ stakeholders is neces-\nsary. Correlating this need with the promising results\
    \ of the research carried on by a\nheterogenous team, Romanian Government should\
    \ focus on ﬁnancing such consortium\nby allocating funds explicitly for agri-food\
    \ sector needs in the selected European DIH in\nDigital Europe Program (E-DIH)\
    \ from Romania to concentrate on the sector in each of the\ncountry’s development\
    \ regions, as part of the Digital Europe Program’s phase. This is a\nsupplementary\
    \ step for establishing a central digital hub (platform) with the mission of\n\
    integrating, organizing, and managing a collection of digital infrastructures\
    \ (platforms,\ntools) at the regional and national levels, as well as a technology\
    \ transfer center at the\nnational level, representing and promoting technology\
    \ transfer policies. Both are proposed\nin the National Strategic Plan (PNS) 2021–2027,\
    \ which will manage the creation of common\nspaces between technology transfer\
    \ centers and clusters (speciﬁc to the agri-food ﬁeld).\nAgriculture 2021, 11,\

    Recommendations for ethical

    and responsible use of artiﬁcial

    intelligence in digital agriculture

    Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) applications are an integral and emerging component

    of digital agriculture. AI can help ensure sustainable production in agriculture

    by enhancing agricultural operations and decision-making. Recommendations

    about soil condition and pesticides or automatic devices for milking and

    apple picking are examples of AI applications in digital agriculture. Although

    AI ofers many beneﬁts in farming, AI systems may raise ethical issues

    and risks that should be assessed and proactively managed. Poor design

    and conﬁguration of intelligent systems may impose harm and unintended

    consequences on digital agriculture. Invasion of farmers’ privacy, damaging

    animal welfare due to robotic technologies, and lack of accountability

    for issues resulting from the use of AI tools are only some examples of

    ethical challenges in digital agriculture. This paper examines the ethical

    challenges of the use of AI in agriculture in six categories including fairness,

    transparency, accountability, sustainability, privacy, and robustness. This study

    further provides recommendations for agriculture technology providers (ATPs)

    and policymakers on how to proactively mitigate ethical issues that may arise

    from the use of AI in farming. These recommendations cover a wide range of

    ethical considerations, such as addressing farmers’ privacy concerns, ensuring

    reliable AI performance, enhancing sustainability in AI systems, and reducing

    AI bias.

    KEYWORDS

    ethical artiﬁcial intelligence, responsible innovation, transparency, accountability,

    fairness, trustable digital agriculture

    Introduction

    Digital agriculture refers to the use of advanced technologies that have transformed

    the agricultural sector by making farm operations more insightful and eﬃcient.
    This can

    be achieved with the use of automated methods such as AI, Internet of Things (IoT),

    and collection and processing of farm data. Substantial amounts of data are collected
    and

    used by AI-based solutions in data-driven services and decision support systems
    (DSS) in

    farming applications (Zhongming et al., 2021). Farm data are combined with other
    data

    sources, such as weather data, to improve resource management and production (Sykuta,

    2016).

    The application of AI in agriculture and food has been on the rise. According
    to

    Statista’s report, the use of AI-based technologies in the agriculture market
    has had

    signiﬁcant growth. The Market is forecasted to grow from $1.1

    billion in 2019 to more than $3.8 billion by 2024 (von See, 2022).

    AI solutions in agriculture refer to AI algorithms, software,

    and hardware (e.g., robots) used in farming applications

    (Ryan, 2022). AI software applications often analyze data to

    provide forecasts, recommendations, and assistance in decision-

    making to improve farm operations. Advanced hardware

    technologies used in farm robotics and automation such as

    robotic greenhouses, robotic harvesting, and milking robots in

    dairy farms have helped in increasing production yield.

    Figure 1 illustrates AI applications in the agricultural system

    with some examples.

    AI-based technology solutions for farming collect large

    volumes of data on various aspects of farming, such as

    production, environment, and machine data. Data from diverse

    sources such as wireless sensor networks, network-connected

    weather stations, monitoring cameras and drones, and historical

    information are used to build analytics tools for making

    more informed decisions or automated actions by farm

    robots (Sykuta, 2016). Collected data are preprocessed (e.g.,

    cleaned) and transformed (e.g., integrated) into a uniform and

    appropriate format to be used by the AI algorithms. Finally, the

    AI algorithms are built with the collected data. After analysis,

    data are transformed into insight (Figure 2). Insight can be

    a pattern or trend analysis to help farmers make informed

    decisions or it could be automated operations performed by

    a machine or farming robots. For example, predictions can

    help farmers decide when to seed and harvest to approach the

    best productivity. In precision livestock farming, farmers can

    be informed about the possibility of disease or distress among

    FIGURE 1

    Artiﬁcial intelligence applications in digital agriculture.

    animals on the farm. For instance, using image recognition

    tools plant disease can be detected or livestock animal behavior

    patterns can be monitored to help them with potential health

    issues (Ryan, 2022). Market demand and forecasting can help

    farmers adjust the type and amount of production and reach the

    best proﬁtability.

    Examples of AI-based agricultural tools include machines

    that are used on farms to hoe and harvest crops, perform

    weeding, drones to spray weeds and pesticides (Ryan et al.,

    2021b), and devices used in automatic milking (Shamshiriet

    et al., 2018). Robots have contributed to reducing the volume

    of chemicals sprayed on the crops by 80% (Revanth, 2019).

    This optimization has shown to decrease the expenditure

    on pesticides and herbicides by 90% and also to save the

    environment from the side eﬀects of using chemicals (Revanth,

    2019). Images collected from crops using drones can be used in

    diverse applications (Marvin et al., 2021), such as monitoring the

    status of soils for nutrient deﬁciencies, monitoring farm animal

    health, and crop cultivation optimization.

    Although utilizing AI-based solutions in smart farming can

    provide numerous beneﬁts for digital agriculture, they may raise

    ethical issues (der Burg et al., 2019). For example, access and use

    of large amounts of farm data can result in accurate and reliable

    AI models. However, it may make farmers concerned about the

    privacy and conﬁdentiality of their data. Furthermore, the data

    collected from farms can raise concerns about data ownership

    i.e., who owns the farm data and who has control over the use

    of farm data (Mark, 2019). This can lead to a power imbalance

    between farmers and technology or service providers (Ryan

    et al., 2021a). Accountability is another issue when it comes to

    AI-technologies; for instance, if AI systems spray substantial

    amounts of water or pesticides due to errors in the system,

    who will be responsible for the loss of harvest? Automated

    tools’ hardware such as harvesting robots may destroy plants

    during harvesting operations due to an error in the system or

    bad design.

    This paper is aimed at examining ethical issues that

    may arise from the use of digital technologies on-farm and

    providing recommendations on how these issues can be

    mitigated. We ﬁrst present an ethical AI framework in the

    context of digital agriculture. This framework captures ethical

    considerations using six principles: fairness, transparency,

    accountability, sustainability, privacy, and robustness. We then

    provide recommendations for ethical and responsible use of

    AI-based technologies in agriculture in the context of principles.

    A part of our recommendations is targeted at ATPs who

    are responsible for designing, developing, or governance of

    technologies used at farms. We also provide recommendations

    for policymakers who we believe are in a position to enforce and

    promote consideration of ethical requirements through policies.

    These recommendations can help in addressing the ethical issues

    in the digital agriculture domain and can help in bringing clarity

    in how the ethical design principles can be embedded to achieve

    responsible innovation in farming.

    Ethical framework for assessment of

    artiﬁcial intelligence-based solutions

    in agriculture

    This section presents a framework for ethical AI. This

    framework sheds light on ethical considerations and issues

    that may arise from the use of AI-based solutions in farming.

    Studying the ethical framework can give us a lucid perspective

    on how to approach the design and development of AI-based

    technologies in digital agriculture. Building ethical technologies

    ensure ethical legitimacy and accountability and also help

    gain the trust of the stakeholders, in particular farmers, in

    the agricultural sector. Ethical principles are discussed in six

    categories (Figure 3).

    FIGURE 3

    Ethical artiﬁcial intelligence principal in digital agriculture.

    Fairness is one of the principles of ethical AI. Fairness

    refers to monitoring and mitigating bias in the AI model, fair

    collection and use of data, and fair access to digital assets (Jobin

    et al., 2019). Bias in the AI model is the tendency to learn

    a preferred pattern of data rather than learn from the actual

    data distribution when the model is built. The constructed AI

    model will encounter bias if it has prejudiced assumptions made

    during the development process of algorithm or if there are

    prejudices in the data. Also, if the collected data is not an

    accurate representation of the context/problem, the AI model

    constructed from these data may encounter bias. Agriculture

    applications can be impacted by AI bias. For example, assume

    that an autonomous apple picking application is built to detect

    ripe apples. If the collected images for constructing AI model

    are largely provided from the red-type apples, the ﬁnal model is

    biased toward these types of apples. This model may detect ripe

    green apples as raw apples in an orchard with green apples and

    may not pick them. Having diverse apple images of various types

    and stages of growth can lead to constructing a more reliable and

    Frontiers in Artiﬁcial Intelligence

    03

    Dara et al.

    10.3389/frai.2022.884192

    inclusive model. Not only AI systems should be free of biases,

    they should also respect societal values such as human rights,

    democratic values, and diversity (OECD AI, 2019). Another

    unfair situation that may emerge from the use of AI systems in

    farming is imbalanced power distribution resulting from access

    and control of farm data and AI technologies. In cases where

    technology and services providers have access to data from a

    large number of farms and can control the AI systems, this

    power can be misused to control the market, share information

    with third parties, and override farmers rights to their own assets

    (Ryan, 2020). With proper adoption of fariness principle, all

    members in the community will beneﬁt from AI tools fairly and

    inclusively (Aggarwal and Singh, 2021).

    Transparency is another principle of ethical AI that

    reinforces the concept of trust. Transparency is a practice

    of

    being

    open

    about

    policies,

    actions,

    and

    laws

    with

    the

    stakeholders

    to

    enhance

    communication,

    common

    understanding, and collaboration. This is a core principle that

    exists in many ethical AI frameworks. For instance, the OECD

    transparency principle (Ryan, 2020) requires that individuals

    are informed about the data that are being collected from them,

    whether they are engaged in an automated AI-based decision

    making, and what decisions are made about them using their

    data. In the context of agriculture, lack of transparency can

    undermine farmers’ trust and may result in their unwillingness

    to adopt the AI solutions or their discomfort to share farm

    data with the technology providers. The lack of interpretability

    and understandability of the AI model outcome also invades

    the transparency principle (Jobin et al., 2019). Interpretable

    AI refers to the degree to which humans can understand the

    results of the AI algorithms (Slack et al., 2019). Interpretable AI

    models should be developed in a way that can explain decisions

    to ordinary people. An interpretable AI model shows how

    decisions are made and what determining factors are considered

    for that decision (Ausloos and Veale, 2020). Interpretability

    with the aim of enhancing transparency of AI technologies is

    important for the development or governance of agricultural

    AI systems. For instance, to decrease the impact of greenhouse

    gases, AI tools can be used for the assessment and management

    of carbon dioxide in production facilities. Farmers should be

    able to challenge the given assessment of their carbon footprint,

    in cases where they think the decision was unfair or inaccurate.

    Accountability is known as another key principle of ethical

    AI along with transparency (Dignum et al., 2018). The problem

    with available AI models in most automated decision-making

    systems is the lack of legal and policy transparency or clarity

    on who or which organization will be held accountable for the

    mismanagement, errors, or wrong decisions/recommendations

    made by the AI systems (van der Loeﬀ et al., 2019). These are

    valid concerns that are associated with automated technologies

    used in farms. A case in point is where an AI system is designed

    to determine the optimal dose of fungicide and eﬀective

    planning of fungicide application so that the farmers can

    enhance the yield and save money. However, if the fungicides

    are applied on fresh produce too late, this error may cause dire

    consequences for production and even consumers if traces of

    fungicides are left behind on harvested products. The ethical

    question that arises in this situation is who will be responsible

    for such errors? Without appropriate legal agreements that

    establish responsibilities and rights of actors involved in the

    development, maintenance, and use of these technologies, it

    will not be possible to identify who will be accountable for

    the errors, ﬁnancial or reputational losses (Walter et al., 2017).

    Also, there has to be oversight by legal entities to ensure

    terms of use and data license agreements are ethical and the

    beneﬁt of all parties are taken into consideration. Carolan (2020)

    explained an example of violating accountability by John Deere.

    This company has made farmers sign an agreement that the

    company has no responsibility if there is damage to the farmers’

    crops, land, proﬁt, machines, or business. This raises an ethical

    dilemma on who will be responsible for farmers’ ﬁnancial loss

    if digital technologies fail to function properly. According to

    OECD (OECD AI, 2019), organizations developing, deploying,

    or operating AI systems in digital agriculture and related sectors

    should be accountable for the proper functioning of the tools

    and decisions.

    Sustainable use and deployment of AI software and

    hardware need to be considered during the development and

    testing of AI-based technologies (Mark, 2019). Sustainability

    principle has several aspects. On the one hand, it requires that

    AI models are user friendly and useful for farmers (Vinuesa

    et al., 2020). For example, if an AI tool cannot provide actionable

    recommendations to help farmers, the system is not user friendly

    and may be defective in terms of design and usability. The

    usability of AI software is essential to make use of predictions

    and recommendations provided by the farm tool. Usefulness

    of AI-based technologies for farmers, on the other hand,

    depends on the accuracy and reliability of recommendations

    and actions. Software errors, hardware malfunction, and biased

    predictions are just some examples that impact sustainable

    deployment of AI solutions at farms. For instance, robots,

    drones, and autonomous/smart vehicles in farming may leak

    toxic chemicals and emit fumes which can lead to pollution,

    or apply too much or too little water on the farm due to

    errors or mismanagement of AI systems or algorithms (Kacary,

    2021). Lastly, environmental sustainability should be taken

    into consideration when building an AI system in agriculture.

    Algorithms must be developed and measured in a way to reduce

    harm to the environment.

    According to OECD (OECD AI, 2019), AI technologies

    should work safely, securely, and robustly during their farm

    operations. Robustness in farming technologies means that

    farmers have conﬁdence in AI models and equipment due to

    their reliable performance and ability to secure the technologies

    from hacks and breaches. Generally, farms that rely on AI

    and technological automation are more vulnerable to hacking,

    sabotage, corporate espionage, or other failures that lead

    to reliability issues (Carolan, 2020). Reliability refers to the

    application of AI to predict when an asset (e.g., data, hardware,

    software) will fail, malfunction, or deteriorate. For instance,

    robots and automated decision-making tools in greenhouse

    horticulture have reduced the need for human intervention.

    This trend has also increased the need for reliable automated

    machines. Security breaches, weak AI models, low quality data,

    or usability issues that result in system failure to perform may

    damage farm production, result in misuse of farm resources,

    and lead to ﬁnancial loss. Designing systems that can detect

    failures and self-perform construction will be needed in fully

    autonomous environments.

    Ensuring data privacy and conﬁdentiality are other ethical

    principles for AI systems. Privacy is referred to as the right of

    an individual to control the use, sharing, and retention of their

    personally identiﬁable information. Privacy is protected through

    regulations and legal agreements. Conﬁdentiality on the other

    hand is ensured through legal agreements. The main concerns

    related to privacy include lack of control over their data, and

    issues such as what data are collected from farms, how they

    will be used, and with whom they may be shared (Mark, 2019).

    Stock et al. showed that 78% of farmers are concerned about

    their data being shared and sold by corporations without their

    consent or awareness (Stock and Gardezi, 2021). Farm data are

    highly vulnerable to misuse if they are shared with third parties.

    This is more of a concern when the data is shared without

    farmers’ consent, or the data is processed or used beyond the

    stated purpose. Furthermore, farmers should be given a choice

    about their farm data collection, access to their farm data, and

    opting in or out of a service provider’s system. A recent privacy

    invasion case was investigated by the Federal Trade Commission

    in USA on John Deere’s data practices (Herchenroeder, 2021).

    This investigation found that John Deere does not consider

    basic privacy rights for farmers. For instance, John Deere is not

    giving farmers appropriate choices in terms of data access and

    collection of their farm data. Data collection cannot be halted at

    any time by the farmer and John Deere can use the data for any

    purpose they desire.

    Recommendations for agricultural

    technology providers

    ATPs in the farming ecosystem are companies that build

    technologies and platforms for smart farming or install,

    integrate and govern technologies on farms (Huntington, 2020).

    In some ways, they can be considered as stewards of agriculture

    data and technology. Technology stewardship in agriculture

    refers to conducting, managing, or supervising the use of

    technology on farms (Gow, 2020). In many cases, ATPs even

    collect and control farm data, and as technology stewards, they

    should be held responsible for governance and management of

    data and farm technologies (Anidu and Dara, 2021). ATPs can

    also evaluate technology governance challenges such as security,

    sustainability, and privacy and provide advice to farmers on

    addressing these ethical concerns (Gow, 2020). This section

    provides recommendations for ATPs on how to establish ethical

    and responsible AI use in the farming and agriculture systems.

    Transparency

    can

    be

    ensured

    through

    data

    license

    agreements. Since most privacy policies and terms of use

    agreements use legal terminologies, it can be diﬃcult for farmers

    to fully understand the content of these documents (Kaur et al.,

    2018). The ambiguity of agreements and legal frameworks

    around data collection, processing, and sharing is another issue

    that may result in an invasion of farmers’ privacy and can

    lead to misuse of data. These issues can be solved by ATPs by

    creating clear, complete, and unambiguous data and terms of

    use agreements. The data agreements discuss data practices

    and authorized use of technology in a simple language that

    is easy to understand for the farmers (Carbonell, 2016). In

    the agreements, ATPs should be clear and transparent about

    what data are collected from farmers and their farms, for what

    purpose data are used, and possibly even what data are used in

    building the AI models. Moreover, collected data should not be

    shared with third parties without farmers’ consent (Kaur et al.,

    2018). Farmers should be given the choice to give or withdraw

    consent for the use of their data. Lastly, these agreements

    should elaborate on how ATPs address the issues related to data

    ownership and farmers’ access to their data. Data agreements

    should also provide clear details on data retention, farm data

    security, cross-border data integration and transfer (if relevant)

    and other privacy and data conﬁdentiality practices (Tsesis,

    2019).

    Transparency can also be enhanced through processes

    and technologies. Data access, portability, and harmonization

    are some of the recommended methods that can enhance

    transparency. These practices require that farmers should have

    the ability to download, access, use, and transfer their historical

    data to other farm management system suppliers. To achieve

    this, farmers’ data should be available in a digital and well-

    structured, and machine-readable format. For example, an

    aviculture farmer may want to use a newer technology provided

    by another ATP to manage their poultry farm or build tools

    to monitor the health of their animal. Farmers may also want

    to share their farm data with farm co-ops to sell, integrate, or

    use their data for other purposes. To facilitate this as well as

    address data usability, and sustainability, ATPs should enable

    data portability for farm data. Data portability is the ability of

    users to move their data among diﬀerent machines, systems, and

    applications. ATPs should also consider data interoperability

    and standardization while designing their platform in digital

    farming systems (Blobel et al., 2006). Interoperability is a

    system’s ability to store, use, and exchange data in a uniform

    platform. Interoperability makes it possible to work with data

    in diﬀerent domains and applications (Jaleel et al., 2020).

    Frontiers in Artiﬁcial Intelligence

    Dara et al.

    10.3389/frai.2022.884192

    Furthermore, interoperability can address robustness issues and

    is a requirement to comply with security protocols and enhance

    system security (Blobel et al., 2006).

    Transparency in the use of AI approaches in agricultural

    technologies is critical in building trust with the farmers.

    Schwartz et al. (2022) Argue that most farmers are unaware

    of interacting with AI enabled technology (Blobel et al., 2006).

    In some other cases, it was reported that ATPs have obliged

    farmers to participate in farm data collection and use AI as a

    precondition to oﬀer their service (Ryan, 2020). These are ethical

    dilemmas that ATPs should avoid. ATPs must inform farmers

    when an automated AI model is used in their farming system.

    Farmers also should be free to accept or deny the use of AI

    solutions or be the subject of AI decisions. This is a major ethical

    dilemma to tie the use of AI with the farmers’ technology needs.

    Farmers should also have the right to ask about the outcome

    of AI tool, how the decision was made, what data were used,

    and what rules were extracted from data. This can be achieved

    by using interpretable and explainable AI methods (Rai, 2020).

    Interpretability and explainability of AI models, if presented in

    a user-friendly manner, can increase farmers’ trust in the digital

    agricultural system (Rai, 2020).

    Requirements to ensure robustness can impact the design of

    the AI-based technology, deployment and usage processes, as

    well as protocols. In many cases, farmers are not comfortable

    working with new technologies because of tools’ complexity

    or farmers’ unfamiliarity with the technology. ATPs should

    provide training sessions for farmworkers to help them gain

    the right skills with all hardware and software AI tools in the

    technology. Also, including farmers in the process of designing

    and developing AI-based decision technologies and in validating

    and testing these tools leads to more usable and trustworthy

    systems. In addition, farmers should be invited to take part

    in user studies and usability testing of the technology to

    ensure the usefulness and enhance user-friendliness of the tools,

    and improve their comfort level with using the technologies.

    Brochures and guidelines should be created for farmers on

    how to operate AI-based technologies. These resources should

    be created in a straightforward and understandable way so

    that the farmers are encouraged to use the resources and the

    technologies. These practices may result in more equitable and

    fair treatment for all farmers or stakeholders in the agriculture

    supply chain.

    Reliability is one of the requirements that satisfy robustness.

    The usability and reliability of AI technology in farms are highly

    related to the accuracy of recommendations made by AI-based

    systems (Barocas and Selbst, 2016). Inaccurate outcomes

    provided by the technology tools lead to accountability

    problems. If the system has the wrong interpretation or

    recommendation on soil nutrition, for example, it can use

    improper fertilizers which in turn will aﬀect the farm product

    and result in ﬁnancial losses. To ensure reliability, it is required

    to pay attention to data quality that is used to build the AI

    model to avoid errors and biases (Jaleel et al., 2020). ATPs

    should monitor data collection and processing to detect data

    quality issues and reduce the impact. Furthermore, to achieve

    accurate predictions and recommendations, appropriate AI

    models should be used based on the available data and the

    problem objectives. Some models are data-intensive and require

    a large amount of data to operate accurately and reliably.

    For these models, high-quality and diverse data are usually

    needed to enable them to learn about diverse conditions and

    generalize well.

    Privacy concerns in a farm system should be addressed

    by the ATPs. It is recommended that ATPs should follow the

    privacy by design (PbD) recommendations while designing

    a platform for digital farming or working with large-scale

    connected farm data systems (Cavoukian et al., 2009). PbD

    provides instruction on creating eﬀective approaches to

    integrating data protection while designing a system. PbD

    promotes foundational principles that ATPs should consider for

    designing the digital agriculture platforms (Raji et al., 2020)

    such as end-to-end security and full transparency with the

    end-users. Another example of PbD principles is privacy as

    default. In farm technologies, de-identiﬁcation at the source

    can enable default privacy and address identiﬁability concerns

    before storing or sharing farm data (Joo et al., 2018). This

    approach separates personal information from records stored in

    the data tables and stores them in other locations (Raji et al.,

    2020). Pseudonymization (Hintze and el Emam, 2018) is also a

    preventive solution to protect from data identiﬁability (Sedayao

    et al., 2014). Pseudonymization replaces features that could be

    used to identify a person with a value that does not imply a

    person’s identiﬁcation directly. Substituting farmers’ names with

    an identiﬁcation code is a simple example of pseudonymization

    to store their data. To address identiﬁability issues, ATPs can

    disable location data collection for sensors and devices while

    setting technologies up at the farm. ATPs should also consider

    performing a privacy impact assessment (PIA). PIA is a tool with

    which the potential privacy risks are identiﬁed and addressed

    while installing farm equipment and setting up data collection

    procedures. Furthermore, explicit consent must be obtained

    from the farmers before collection or processing or sharing of

    data. Other privacy solutions can include enabling opt-in or

    opt-out of data agreements, limiting data collection, and deleting

    data on request. Data protection impact assessments could be

    used to assess privacy concerns related to an AI system. This way,

    privacy risks and rights imposed by AI system can be proactively

    identiﬁed and managed.

    Bias and discrimination by AI tools aﬀect fairness. Building

    AI tools that favor organizations and actors in power, grant

    economic or social privileges to a particular group, or create

    power imbalance due to access and control of farm data are

    all ethical dilemmas that ATP providers should collaboratively

    address with farmer organizations, government, and other

    agencies (Panch et al., 2019). Bias in AI models and their use may

    Frontiers in Artiﬁcial Intelligence

    06

    frontiersin.org

    Dara et al.

    10.3389/frai.2022.884192

    be caused intentionally or unintentionally by those who created

    AI models or because of embedding pre-existing biases into the

    model. Collecting suﬃcient data from diverse sources, deﬁning

    fair and ethical objectives for the use of data, and considering

    all members of society that are impacted by the AI systems and

    their outcomes can protectively eliminate presence of bias.

    Many scientists believe that AI algorithms cannot address

    fairness concerns (Urruty et al., 2016). Risk of human rights

    invasion, fairness, and other fundamental ethical values that

    may be compromised by AI technologies are examples of ethical

    dilemmas in smart farming. Human-Centered AI (HCAI) can be

    a solution to mitigate these concerns. HCAI intersects AI with

    humanities by combining embedded AI support services with

    user experiences (Shneiderman, 2020). HCAI can bring ethical

    considerations and farm practices to AI models’ performance

    in digital agriculture (UNESCO, 2021). Co-creating models

    and solutions and engaging all stakeholders as well as the

    government can lead to more ethical outcomes from HCAI

    (Camaréna, 2020). Also, since AI-based decisions are susceptible

    to bias and discriminatory outcomes, HCAI can manage to

    prevent these risks.

    Issues related to the robustness of AI technologies may aﬀect

    reliability and performance of the system. AI and automated

    systems are more susceptible to security attacks and require

    defense mechanisms that should be embedded in advance.

    In addition to attacks that may target digital and connected

    technologies, AI models and data can also be attacked by

    adversaries with the aim of detreating their performance.

    ATPs should take proactive measures to monitor data, system,

    network, and all other digital infrastructure in the farm

    continuously to reduce the possibility of cyber-attacks as much

    as possible. ATP should also monitor data breaches such as

    unauthorized access to farm data and data perturbations (Gupta

    et al., 2020). Using the risk assessment methods (Gupta et al.,

    2020) is also a common practice, including ﬁnding potential

    vulnerabilities and loopholes in the system by assessing potential

    risks in/to the farm system.

    Robustness from a hardware perspective requires farm

    equipment to work properly and reliably (Urruty et al., 2016).

    For example, in the livestock industry and in big farms, milking

    dairy cows is performed every day by automatic equipment.

    If there is a sudden failure in technology, it is not feasible

    to milk hundreds of cattle by human labor. Such failures

    may threaten the animals’ welfare and cause ﬁnancial harm to

    farmers. To address this problem, AI models can in some cases

    predict when an asset or hardware may fail to assist farmers

    or ATPs to take proactive actions. For instance, such predictive

    tools can recommend when equipment can be serviced or

    replaced before failing. This can help in reducing unplanned

    downtime, increased safety, lower costs, extended asset life,

    and higher asset utilization rates. Failure and errors resulting

    from technologies’ malfunction or cyberattacks may occur

    despite all types of measures and eﬀorts to prevent them.

    Therefore, ATPs should present an incident response or failover

    recovery plan for such cases. This recommendation requires

    that ATPs proactively address probable issues such as system

    crashes or attacks to protect farm data and failures in the farm

    system (Shneiderman, 2020). Moreover, terms of use and data

    agreements should clearly specify how the organizations will be

    accountable and compensate for the damage caused by error,

    mismanagement, or other deﬁciency or failure in the system

    (Shneiderman, 2020).

    There is a signiﬁcant interest in developing AI tools that

    help ensure sustainable practices and are environmentally

    sustainable tools. AI and automated technologies may cause

    harm and distress to animal welfare, and negatively aﬀect

    the environment. ATPs should consider design strategies that

    take into consideration the requirements for environmental

    sustainability. Milking robots should be developed in a way

    to avoid harming animals and causing pain. Greenhouse

    robots should not damage greens, crops or fruits. Factors

    aﬀecting

    the

    environment

    and

    animals

    should

    always

    be considered while designing and deploying AI tools.

    Furthermore, ATPs can use ﬂeet management technology in

    digital farming systems to decrease their carbon footprint.

    Fleet management uses the science of advanced systems

    to address sudden machine/vehicles’ failure (Sørensen and

    Bochtis, 2010). These systems can estimate important metrics

    and indicators about farm equipment, such as fuel usage,

    engine

    speed,

    and

    upcoming

    maintenance,

    so

    that

    the

    system or ATPs can optimize the system’s productivity and

    eﬃciency (e.g., fuel consumption) which can also help farmers

    save money.

    Finally, tools and frameworks have been designed to detect

    and mitigate performance risks of AI models proactively and by

    design (TensorFlow, 2022). For example, there are tools (Google,

    2022) and platforms (OECD AI, 2019) that can improve AI

    models’ transparency. This way, farmers can understand the

    reasons for the decisions and combine their expertise with the

    results of the algorithms for a better outcome. ATPs can use

    platforms such as Responsible AI by Google (Google, 2022)

    and Explainable AI by IBM (IBM, 2002; Trustworthy AI, 2021)

    to develop and deploy AI solutions that are interpretable,

    less bias, and inclusive. Several Ethical AI frameworks, tools

    and standards such as IEEE Ethics in Action in Autonomous

    and Intelligent Systems (IEEE SA, 2022), ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC

    42 Artiﬁcial intelligence (ISO, 2022), SCC’s Ethical design

    and use of automated decision systems (Standards Council

    of Canada-Conseil canadien des norms, 2022), and European

    Commission’s Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI (European

    Commission, 2022) can be adopted to consider and address

    ethical requirements in the AI applications for farming. TEthical

    assessment of new agricultural and food technologies, such

    as ethical bio-technology assessment tools (Beekman et al.,

    2006) helps improve ethical consideration in all stages of the

    food chain. Using a responsible AI solution can strengthen

    Frontiers in Artiﬁcial Intelligence

    07

    frontiersin.org

    Dara et al.

    10.3389/frai.2022.884192

    trust between farmers and other actors in the value chain and

    increase adoption.

    Recommendations for policymakers

    Governments can be instrumental in ensuring and enforcing

    ethical and responsible innovation in digital agriculture.

    Governments can establish regulations, guidelines, or best

    practices to guide technology providers and other actors in

    the value chain to develop and use digital tools and platforms

    that are for the greater good of communities and society.

    Tools and protocols can be developed or promoted to validate

    ethical principles, such as fairness, explainability, and privacy

    (ongov/Transparency-Guidelines, 2022). Also, governments can

    enforce stakeholders to use frameworks and assessment methods

    to evaluate the ethical aspects of AI tools before and after

    deployment in digital agriculture.

    Policymakers can play an important role in providing a

    higher level of understandability of AI based technologies

    for farmers and agriculture actors (Pylianidis et al., 2021).

    Policymakers can help in educating farmers with AI skills

    that can help them understand how AI models and robotic

    technologies work. Policymakers should also take appropriate

    steps, through social dialogue or other means, to ensure a fair

    transition for farmworkers and other stakeholders to adopt

    technology that can transform the digital agricultural system.

    Furthermore, policymakers should also work closely with other

    stakeholders and promote responsible use of AI at work to

    fairly share the AI beneﬁts and foster the entrepreneurship and

    productivity of digital farming systems.

    The safety of AI equipment can also be a concern similar

    to many other technologies. The only diﬀerence is that the

    concerns in the AI system could be related to data, AI

    model’s ability to generalize, or cyber-attacks on AI systems.

    Nevertheless, the safety concerns of AI systems can be partly

    mitigated by education and training for the users of these

    tools. The education part can be according to workplace safety

    issues, such as working with autonomous vehicles on the farm

    and greenhouse facilities to protect farm workers from risks in

    their workplace. When farm workers’ safety is compromised

    with AI technologies, insurance coverage should be in place

    to compensate and help them in alleviating the consequences.

    Education programs can be prepared for ATPs and farmworkers

    on protecting the environment and reducing emissions, such

    as leaking toxic chemicals on the farm. Animal welfare is

    another ethical issue that requires attention in the context of

    new agricultural innovations, such as using automatic milking

    equipment for cattle. Government can provide incentives or

    funding for AI tools that are built and extensively tested to

    protect animal welfare and ensure environmental sustainability.

    Neglecting farmers’ privacy, lack of transparency and

    ambiguity in accountability may aﬀect farmers’ trust. This can

    lead to farmers’ reluctance to acquire and use AI technologies

    and collaborate in data sharing activities. Policymakers can help

    mitigate some of these concerns by sponsoring development of

    innovative AI solutions that are trustworthy and by creating

    policy and regulatory frameworks and assessment mechanisms

    to test and validate trustworthiness of AI systems. Also,

    policymakers can consider creating and enforcing policies

    on issues related to accountability for AI-based farm tools.

    If farmers experience ﬁnancial or reputation loss, ATPs or

    other stakeholders (e.g., farm insurance) should compensate

    the farmers. Establishing new policies or expanding existing

    policies to protect farmers’ sensitive data, and their privacy, and

    enforcing transparency are important steps to ensure ethical and

    responsible use of these technologies.

    Fair opportunities to access, use and take advantage of

    AI-based technologies for small and medium size farmers are

    important. AI technologies are generally targeted or priced for

    large farms which can widen the inequalities or digital divide

    for small-scale farmers (ACM Interactions, 2022). To improve

    fairness and create a sense of inclusion for small and medium

    farmers, governments should foster the development of a digital

    ecosystem for AI technologies so that the technologies are

    accessible and targeted to all farming stakeholders (OECD AI,

    2019). Furthermore, governments can support and promote

    digital infrastructures for shared data processing such as cloud

    services and edge computing and communication technologies

    such as satellite, Wi-Fi, and 5G cellular (Threats to Precision

    Agriculture, 2018). These facilities can provide diverse farming

    systems with a trusted framework to share their data, process

    data in a secure manner, and share knowledge and insight

    while preserving privacy. These shared infrastructures have

    many beneﬁts including facilitating data and technology

    interoperability, inclusivity, fairness for access to data and

    technologies as well as food safety and sustainability.

    Policymakers also have a key role in supporting research and

    development (R&D) for ethical and responsible AI innovation

    for digital agriculture (OECD AI, 2019). Long-term investment

    in R&D, such as inter-disciplinary eﬀorts to encourage human-

    centered AI and to address legal, social, and ethical implications,

    can encourage various actors in agriculture to collaborate

    on building trustworthy AI technologies for farming and

    food supply chain. Investment in open data repositories to

    protect farm data and provide an equitable environment to

    access data can also support collaboration and development

    of human-centered AI in farming. Open data repositories

    can improve interoperability and use of standards in digital

    agricultural systems which can help with development of

    system’s robustness.

    Although R&D is a necessary step to improve AI systems for

    farming, deployment and adoption of these technologies are still

    a challenge. Governments can establish an innovation network

    or platform for an agile transition from R&D to the deployment

    and operation stage (OECD AI, 2019). An operational practice

    Frontiers in Artiﬁcial Intelligence

    08

    frontiersin.org

    Dara et al.

    10.3389/frai.2022.884192

    to deploy the model is using experimentation (e.g., experimental

    farms) to provide a controlled environment to test and scale up

    the AI system. Governments can support experiments in “start-

    up mode” for the AI technologies to be deployed, evaluated,

    and modiﬁed and consequently help scale up if they pass

    ethical and performance requirements. Governments can also

    support general pilot projects, living labs, and digital twin

    initiatives in experimentation farms to develop controlled and

    transparent environments.

    Educating farmers and farm workforces on various aspects

    of ethical AI technologies is also important. International

    cooperation for trustworthy AI can improve ethics on a

    broader level. It is recommended that governments or NGOs

    co-operate across borders and sectors, speciﬁcally in developing

    countries, and work toward responsible stewardship of AI

    by developing standards and exchanging information. Cross-

    border collaboration can lead to advancing societal goals,

    democratic values, and human rights and foster the sharing of

    AI knowledge as recommended by OECD (OECD AI, 2019).

    Furthermore, policymakers should also encourage international

    metrics to measure AI R&D and deployment to enhance

    implementation of ethical AI principles. Using ethical metrics

    can help assess the AI systems’ performance, such as eﬃciency,

    accuracy, robustness, and fairness.

    Farming

    practices

    can

    damage

    the

    environment

    by

    generating greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and

    nitrogen dioxide. There is a need to promote sustainable

    agriculture tools so that the natural resources and ecology are

    preserved. Therefore, the government should motivate farmers

    to use green technologies and renewable energies to slow down

    climate change and address sustainability concerns. Since the

    required equipment for embedding renewable technologies

    is too expensive, many farmers cannot aﬀord to equip their

    farms. Governments’ support is fundamental for farmers

    in providing the required knowledge and equipment. Also,

    policymakers can establish rules, such as tax exemption, to

    support farmers interested in employing green technologies to

    save the environment.

    Conclusion

    This paper reviewed the ethical challenges in the digital

    agriculture domain and proposed an ethical framework

    which could be used when designing and deploying AI

    based technologies in farming. The paper also provides

    recommendations for ATPs and policymakers on the issues

    and potential solutions that can be considered for ethical

    and responsible AI in agriculture. The presented ethical AI

    framework helps in investigating the ethical principles and

    consequences of neglecting each principle in the agricultural

    ecosystem. AI ethical framework included principles such as

    fairness, transparency, accountability, sustainability, privacy,

    and robustness in the context of agriculture.

    The recommendation for ATPs and policymakers included

    social, ethical, technology, and political considerations. ATPs are

    encouraged to perform risk assessments for ethical implications

    of AI systems under development and consider requirements

    and strategies that can avoid harmful consequences. These

    organizations should also collaborate with various actors in

    the value chain to collectively address ethical issues that

    may arise from the use of these technologies. Best practices

    and protocols such as transparency, providing technology

    functionalities that enable data portability, interpretability and

    usability, HCAI, raising awareness, and training opportunities

    for farmers were only some of the recommended practices in this

    paper. Recommendations for policymakers included creating

    new policies or extending existing policies for farm data and

    infrastructure, funding R&D initiatives, supporting living lab

    initiatives, and providing educational programs for farmers and

    other actors in the smart farming system.

    Farmers are the main stakeholders in the agricultural

    ecosystem. As the end users of AI technologies, they can

    take a few steps to protect their farms, farm data, machinery,

    and farmworkers. Farmers can keep themselves up to date

    about AI technologies that are being used at their farms and

    how they operate. They should review the data and terms of

    use agreements carefully to understand what data is collected

    from their farm, with whom their data is shared, and how

    accountability is integrated into agreement and management.

    They should also inquire from ATP whether an AI model is

    embedded in their machines, what data the AI system uses,

    and what indicators/factors are extracted from the data by

    the AI system. Farmers should secure their machines from

    unauthorized access and use, and physically secure them when

    they are not in use. They should demand transparency regarding

    data use and their rights to data access and portability.

    Researchers can also play a critical role in the development,

    validation, and governance of ethical and responsible AI systems

    for agriculture. Researchers can be instrumental in building

    trust between ATPs and farmers. They can conduct qualitative

    and quantitative research to understand farmers’ needs and

    concerns, ethical dilemmas, AI technology requirements and

    bridge the knowledge gap between diﬀerent stakeholders. New

    technologies, algorithms, and best practices can be proposed

    for agricultural AI-based systems to ensure fairness, robustness

    and reliability, transparency, sustainability and other ethical

    considerations. Researchers can work closely with government,

    ATPs, and farmers on new policies and standards to promote

    responsible innovation in digital agriculture and protect

    stakeholders’ interests.

    There are still many unsolved issues that need to be

    addressed. For example, legal transparency in the context of

    smart farming is unclear. There is a need to develop and test

    best practices and protocols for transparency to enable ethical

    use of data and digital infrastructure and maintain utility of

    data. Fair use of AI system and data in digital agriculture

    is also not well deﬁned. For instance, what constitutes an

    unfair use of AI technologies in farming or what business

    model can be established to make the outcome fair for all

    the actors. Accountability is a complex legal and technical

    issue. There is an urgent need for standardized practices

    and policies to ﬁnd solutions and common agreements on

    these issues. This can be achieved through collaboration

    and knowledge transfer and sharing. For instance, licensed

    insurance agencies and farm co-ops can be given a more

    active role in ensuring transparency, protecting farmers’

    privacy, enabling fair use of farm data and infrastructure,

    and

    facilitating

    governance

    models

    for

    accountability

    and sustainability.

    With

    the

    increasing

    use

    of

    precision

    agriculture

    and

    technological

    development, the agricultural sector has been majorly transformed. Precision

    agriculture uses technological innovations such as sensors, drones, and data

    analysis tools to improve the productivity of resources and management

    decisions on the farm. Since these technologies collect a large amount of

    data related to the farm, the farmers are concerned about the privacy of their

    data. The farmers are worried about unauthorized access, collection, and

    sharing of their data with third parties by the agricultural technology providers

    (ATPs). Furthermore, the ambiguity of agreements and legal frameworks

    around data collection, processing, and sharing may result in uncertainty in

    data privacy practices. Furthermore, this situation is aggravated by a lack of

    adoption of best practices and standards for farm data protection. Violation

    of privacy can cause reluctance among farmers to adopt new technologies

    which can negatively impact various stakeholders, government, and public.

    Protecting farmers’ privacy and respecting their rights related to the collected

    data should be addressed collectively by the actors in the farming ecosystem,

    including farmers, agricultural technology providers, governments, and supply

    chain stakeholders. This paper aims at providing recommendations on how to

    minimize privacy risks and concerns for farmers and reviews some of the data

    governance best practices for data protection.

    Introduction

    With the recent technological advancements, farming has been signiﬁcantly

    transformed by the adoption of so-called precision agriculture. Precision agriculture

    uses innovative technology such as sensors, drones, robots, precision machinery,
    and

    GPS technology to help farmers increase productivity, sustainability, and proﬁtability

    (Monteiro et al., 2021). These digital agricultural technologies use large amounts
    of

    data from multiple sources to improve the use of farming resources such as fertilizers,

    pesticide applications, and livestock health and welfare. Farmers use measurement
    tools

    provided by precision agriculture technologies to enhance farm-

    related decision-making. For example, on a big farm, the soil

    nutrients may vary in each section of the farm, and if a farmer

    uses the same fertilizing procedure for the entire ﬁeld, it can

    be more costly and environmentally harmful. This can be

    addressed by collecting soil health-related data and analyzing

    them to make better management decisions related to the use

    of resources such as fertilizers and water (Caria et al., 2017).

    The use of technologies in livestock farming has also been

    growing. Livestock technology helps in improving the welfare

    and management of livestock animals on a farm. For example,

    implementing automated feeding systems can provide cost-

    eﬀective decisions by monitoring the duration of feed, electronic

    identiﬁcation of each animal, and measuring the weight of feed

    consumed (Monteiro et al., 2021).

    Data

    is

    the

    core

    component

    of

    digital

    agricultural

    technologies. Digital technologies collect, store, integrate,

    and analyze farm data to predict an event, recommend a

    solution, build automated tools such as robots to make an

    automated decision or take an action, or guide farmers to make

    more informed decisions. To turn farm data into eﬀective

    decision making, statistical analysis and Artiﬁcial Intelligence

    (AI) models are used (Monteiro et al., 2021). Many of these

    technologies are data intensive and require large amounts of

    data to operate accurately and reliably. Massive data collection

    raises privacy risks for farmers. Privacy risks vary from

    identiﬁcation, reputation loss, misuse of data, lack/limited

    control over data, social engineering, and unauthorized access

    to data (Wiseman et al., 2019; Linsner et al., 2021). Information

    privacy has many diﬀerent deﬁnitions which cover technical

    and process aspects of data processing. But, in general, the

    objective of data privacy is to protect misuse of data, prevent

    unauthorized access to data, and enforce greater control of

    personal data for the individual.

    The data collected from the farms can be broadly grouped

    into two categories: farm data and personal data. Farm data

    can include information such as crop data, livestock data, and

    machine data. Personal data can include personal data related to

    farmers such as name, email, and location. Personal data can be

    categorized into two groups: data that can make farmers directly

    identiﬁable, such as name and location, or indirectly identiﬁable

    such as a combination of farm activities and information about

    crop and livestock animals. With the substantial amounts of data

    that are being collected from farms, there is a growing concern

    about farmers’ privacy and farm data protection practices.

    Generally, farmers have limited control of their farm data by

    ATPs. This raises concerns about privacy of farm data. Privacy

    is deﬁned as the right of an individual to control or inﬂuence

    what information related to them is collected, how that data are

    stored and used, and with whom they are shared or disclosed

    (Linsner et al., 2021). However, farmers are usually not informed

    about the purpose of data collection from the farm, how their

    data is used, and whether their data is shared with the third

    parties (Linsner et al., 2021). Due to the lack of control and

    lack of transparency, farmers are unwilling to share their data

    with ATPs.

    Many privacy regulations have been developed for the

    protection of personal information and preserving individuals’

    privacy. In most of the privacy regulations, personal information

    refers to any information related to an identiﬁed or identiﬁable

    person (Schuster, 2017). Personal information or Personally

    Identiﬁable Information (PII) such as name, email, location,

    or any other information that can disclose the individuals’

    identity, are the subject of privacy legislation. Some of these

    regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation

    (GDPR) (Schuster, 2017), established European Union (EU),

    are comprehensive in nature and protect personal information

    irrespective of the application domain. This may include

    farming data. However, some other regulations are formulated

    for the protection of personal information that is collected

    by commercial businesses and do not protect personal

    information or PII collected in the farming or agricultural

    sectors such as California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and

    Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act

    in Canada.

    With the lack of speciﬁc regulations or standards related

    to farm data (Kaur et al., 2018), farmers have become even

    more concerned about their privacy. One of the major privacy

    risks is the identiﬁcation of farmers which may result in the

    disclosure of sensitive data without their consent, identity

    theft, or reputation loss. The identiﬁcation of farmers can

    occur through direct identiﬁers (e.g. name, email address, and

    location) and indirect identiﬁers such as PII data related to farm

    practices. For instance, farm data such as data related to crops,

    soil type, fertilization strategies, and water consumption may

    not show the farmers’ identity directly. However, using statistical

    analysis and AI techniques may reveal unique patterns for farm

    practices that can be traced back to a speciﬁc farm and make

    the farmers identiﬁable (9). These types of data are referred to

    as PII. Personally Identiﬁable Information in the farming sector

    can potentially include any representation, combination, and

    analysis of farm data that can disclose farmers’ identity.

    Furthermore, farmers are concerned about unauthorized

    access to their farm data. Agricultural technology providers

    may share their farm data with other technology providers or

    stakeholders in the supply chain without farmers’ consent and

    awareness. Moreover, the farmers are usually not notiﬁed about

    how their data is collected, used, accessed, or disclosed by the

    ATPs. These concerns and lack of transparency in how farm data

    is utilized can result in a loss of trust which may lead to farmers’

    reluctance to share data with the ATPs (Linsner et al., 2021).

    There are existing technical and legal privacy standards and

    practices that are being used in other domains such as healthcare

    and e-commerce. However, the adoption of these standards

    and practices by ATPs and other agriculture stakeholders has

    not been as extensive as it should have been. This paper

    FIGURE 1

    Stakeholders of the farming data.

    provides practical recommendations on how farm data can be

    protected by diﬀerent actors’ groups in the farming ecosystem.

    The main stakeholders that contribute to farm data protection

    can be grouped into four categories: farmers, ATPs, government,

    and other stakeholders in the food supply chain (Figure 1).

    Supply chain stakeholders can include processors, transporters,

    producers, distributors, retailers, farmers’ associations, and any

    organizations that have access to farm technologies. This paper

    intends to suggest legal, technological, and human-centered

    recommendations to protect the privacy of farm data and

    preserve the conﬁdentiality of farmers.

    Recommendations for farmers

    Data is a valuable resource for eﬀective decision-making

    for farmers. However, if large volumes of farm data are not

    eﬀectively managed, it can pose privacy risks to the farmers.

    These risks can be partly mitigated by farmers by taking

    proactive measures that are cost-eﬀective. This section provides

    some practical guidelines for the farmers on how to protect

    privacy and conﬁdentiality of their data.

    Data-driven technologies are becoming more complex and

    connected. To ensure the privacy of the farmers’ sensitive data

    that are collected, stored, and utilized by these technologies

    (Linsner et al., 2021), farmers must advance their digital literacy.

    This means that farmers should keep themselves up to date with

    technological advancements to be able to eﬀectively protect their

    data. There are organizations or agri-cooperatives that provide

    educational programs and training for farmers so that farmers

    can enhance their digital skills. For example, in the EU, COPA-

    COGECA provides training to farmers to enhance digital skills

    that are required for digital transformation in rural areas and

    to make farmers aware of their rights and responsibilities in

    the digital era. Furthermore, farmers can learn more advanced

    technical approaches for data integration and analysis (Wilson,

    2018). This will result in farmers retaining more control over

    their data by keeping and using data locally/on-farm.

    Moreover, farmers can create a set of guidelines that can

    be followed by the farm workers for protecting farm data. A

    data protection guideline is an internal document used in an

    operation, e.g. farm, to set standards for protecting sensitive

    data. A simple approach to this can be, for example, to provide a

    set of practices in the form of a checklist for farm staﬀ. Another

    strategy is training farm workers about farm data protection

    practices. This exercise is not limited to the farm workers that

    directly use farm data; all farmworkers that have access to digital

    devices and computer systems on the farm need to be trained.

    Data breaches occur due to unauthorized access to sensitive data

    which can happen in many ways including opening a phishing

    email, visiting an untrustworthy website, or easy access to a

    device by an intruder or an internal staﬀ with malicious intent.

    Farmers and farmworkers should learn how to take preventive

    measures such as using strong passwords, updating software,

    and backups, and detecting and avoiding phishing emails to

    ensure protection from such threats. All farm staﬀ should also

    have unique and valid credentials to access the computing

    infrastructure at farms.

    Legal agreements are also important in protecting farm data.

    Studies show that 74% of the farmers are not aware of the terms

    of use and data license agreements (Wiseman et al., 2019). In

    fact, 55% of farmers have declared that they sign data contracts

    with ATPs without seeking clariﬁcations on-farm data usage,

    sharing, and other important terms related to data protection

    and use (Schuster, 2017). It is highly recommended that

    farmers read data and terms of use agreements before accepting

    them and seek clariﬁcation for any unclear or ambiguous

    practices. Important data practices that require attention are

    data collection, data sharing, data security, data retention, data

    control, data access and portability, and data erasure. Table 1 lists

    the questions that farmers can ask the ATPs regarding their farm

    data collection, use, and protection. These questions are derived

    from regulations, privacy management best practices, and

    comprehensive research that has been performed on these legal

    documents (OECD., 2013; Guntamukkala et al., 2015; GDPR.,

    2018; Kaur et al., 2018; Oﬃce of the Privacy Commissioner

    of Canada., 2018; Wiseman et al., 2019). For instance, some

    regulations such as GDPR have provided comprehensive sets of

    recommendations on the content of privacy policies and data

    agreements. Furthermore, agriculture codes of conduct have

    also commented on what farmers should expect in the ATPs

    data agreements.

    The lack of standardized data protection practices in farming

    has resulted in inconsistent legal data and use agreements

    created by ATPs (Linsner et al., 2021). This deﬁciency has

    resulted in farmers’ lack or limited control of their data.

    Research also shows that farm’ data are shared with third

    parties without farmers’ consent. This is due to the power

    imbalance between farmers and ATPs which has led to the

    farmers’ inability to negotiate stronger control of their farm

    data. This power imbalance emphasizes the need for farmers to

    educate themselves about the legal terms and data practices that

    are included in the data agreements to understand how their

    data is used and shared and how long their data is retained and

    stored. Farmers should inquire about their options, e.g., opt-

    in or opt-out of the data agreements and ATPs’ service, before

    signing the contract. Additionally, farmers can seek clariﬁcation

    about regulations that apply to their farm data. Privacy laws

    depend on the regulatory regimes in a region.

    Since most of the privacy policies and terms of use

    agreements use legal terminology, it can be diﬃcult for

    the farmers to fully understand the content and learn

    about ATPs data practices (Guntamukkala et al., 2015; Kaur

    et al., 2018). Therefore, it is recommended that farmers seek

    professional help to better understand legal terminology and

    data protection/usage methodologies included in the documents

    (Audich et al., 2021). Seeking legal advice can ﬂag ambiguous

    terms in the agreements. For instance, some ATPs may state

    that “you own the data” in the agreement. This statement may

    give the impression that farmers have the right to control

    with whom and under what condition farm data is shared.

    However, a privacy expert may realize that data ownership

    does not lend itself to greater control due to other conﬂicting

    and ambiguous data sharing statements, e.g. “we will share

    your farm data with our partners to enhance your experience.”

    Such legal services exist in some regions. Janzen Agricultural

    Law LLC, for instance, is a United States non-proﬁt ﬁrm

    that reviews and validates terms and data practices in farm

    data agreements (McIntosh, 2018) and informs farmers about

    potential concerns (Guntamukkala et al., 2015). Ag Data

    Transparent also oﬀers a certiﬁcation program in which legal

    agreements get a transparency seal if they abide by the core

    principles of the Privacy and Security Principles for Farm Data

    (Ag Data Transparent., 2022). Farmers can use such services

    to check farm data and terms of use agreements to make an

    informed decision about the ATPs service and their rights.

    Farmers should also safeguard farm data with apply security

    practices. One approach is enabling data encryption. Encryption

    is a process in which data are converted into encoded

    information, and they can only be decoded using a unique

    decryption key. Encryption helps ensure the integrity of data

    by protecting it from unauthorized access. Farmers can ask ATP

    to encrypt data end-to-end. De-identiﬁcation/anonymization of

    data can be enabled by ATPs if the data is transferred and

    processed out of the farm. This approach removes identiﬁable

    information such as name, location, email or even PII if known

    in advance from farm data before the data is transferred, stored

    in the cloud, or shared with other partners (IAPP., 2022). It is

    also possible to fully anonymize farm data at the source so that

    the identity of farmers is not revealed when integrated with other

    data sources or when processed.

    Farmers can inquire about data retention practices that ATP

    use. For instance, how long the ATP keeps the data or what

    happens to farm data when farmers terminate their service

    with ATP. Farmers can ask about their ability to access and

    download their farm data. Finally, farmers can select ATPs that

    have strong privacy and security protocols if there are multiple

    service providers that they can choose from.

    operations (Yaqot and Menezes, 2021; Yaqot et al., 2021).

    Agricultural technology providers role as stewards of data

    and technology and their ability to control farm IT assets

    enable them to perform a critical role in protecting farm data

    and building trust with the farmers. This section provides

    recommendations to ATPs on how they can contribute to the

    protection of farm data and establish the “long lost” trust with

    the farmers.

    One of the key aspects of building trust with farmers is

    transparency (Jakku et al., 2019). Transparency and legitimate

    data processing can encourage farmers to share data with

    ATPs and other stakeholders. Transparency is one of the

    most important practices in privacy. Agricultural technology

    providers should be transparent about the collection, use,

    sharing, and disclosure of the farmers’ data. This can be achieved

    by creating clear, complete, and unambiguous data agreements

    that discuss the data practices and terms of use. Furthermore,

    these legal documents should be written in simple language so

    that it is easy to understand.

    Agricultural

    technology

    providers

    should

    follow

    the

    privacy by design approaches while designing and developing

    technology products for farms or working with large-scale

    networked farm data systems (Amiri-Zarandi et al., 2022).

    Privacy by design is an approach which encourages data

    protection to be integrated into a product or service from the

    very early stages of development. Privacy by design covers

    seven foundational principles which ATPs should include in

    their business’ core values (Cavoukian, 2009). For example,

    the ATPs should embed privacy protection functionalities

    into the system that are user centric and give more control

    to the farmers. Agricultural technology providers should

    provide farmers with the choice to give or withdraw consent

    for the use of farm data. Agricultural technology providers

    should also embed user-friendly privacy features in the farm

    data collection and processing system. User friendly features

    contribute to transparent privacy practices and make them

    more understandable for farmers. To achieve this, farmers

    can be engaged, through interviews, during the design and

    development of farm systems. Testing the farming technologies

    at the farm is also recommended to examine privacy and

    security loopholes and to proactively resolve them before

    production. Furthermore, educating farmers to work with farm

    equipment can result in a lower rate of technical issues and

    privacy and security violations in the system.

    Farm legal data agreements content should cover a

    comprehensive set of data protection practices related to farm

    data (Ferris, 2017). They should include diﬀerent topics such as

    data collection, data sharing, data access, data retention, data

    security, policy change, purpose, choice, contact information

    of the organization or data steward, and several other

    sections. Regulations and privacy principles such as GDPR

    and Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development

    (OECD) have provided recommendations about the content

    of data licenses and terms of use agreements. They have also

    considered several rights for individuals regarding the collection

    and use of their personal data such as the right to an explanation

    or automated individual decision making, including proﬁling,

    right to erasure, and right to object (OECD., 2013; Oﬃce of

    the Privacy Commissioner of Canada., 2018). The applicability

    of these rights to farmers’ personal data can be investigated by

    ATPs. For instance, the right to automated individual decision-

    making is a right that could allow individuals to request

    clariﬁcation on data processing. For applications such as carbon

    credits or carbon taxes, for instance, farmers may need to know

    how algorithms arrive at decisions about their carbon footprint.

    Agricultural technology providers can design their systems in a

    way that the outcomes of algorithms are explainable. It is also

    recommended that ATPs pay particular attention to the content

    of data agreements. For instance, data agreements should clearly

    specify the data collection process, list of personal and farm data

    that are collected at the farms and inform the farmers how their

    data is used. These agreements should also include the intention

    or purpose of collection, sharing, and usage of farmers’ personal

    information. The farmers should have the right to access data

    and opt out of the service whenever they wish.

    Eﬀective measures should be taken by ATPs to preserve the

    privacy of farmers while processing their data (Zaman et al.,

    2017). The collection and processing of personal data may result

    in an invasion of farmers’ privacy. This issue can be mitigated

    by de-identifying the personal data from the source by removing

    identiﬁable information such as name, address, phone number,

    and location wherever applicable (Jakku et al., 2019). While

    collecting data, ATPs should avoid collecting sensitive or farmers

    personal data if the data are not needed for analytical purposes.

    Furthermore, ATPs should clearly specify the purpose of data

    collection and use in their data agreements and must strictly

    adhere to those purposes (Janzen, 2021). If ATPs use the data for

    other purposes which are not disclosed to farmers before data

    collection, this may lead to violation of farmers privacy.

    One of the strongest approaches to strengthen ATPs’ data

    practices is obtaining consent before collecting, using, sharing,

    or disclosing farm or personal information of the farmers.

    With explicit and informed consent, the farmers will be

    aware of the data practices that ATPs will implement and

    make informed decisions about the services ATPs provide.

    Furthermore, obtaining consent should be a dynamic and

    ongoing process. This would mean that the farmers should be

    notiﬁed if there are any changes made in the data collection, use

    and sharing practices, and ATPs should obtain consent before

    making any changes in privacy practices.

    Data security is considered an important practice in

    protecting the privacy of farmers (Qi et al., 2020; Yaqot et al.,

    2021; Hazrati et al., 2022). Proactive measures must be taken by

    the ATPs to check for data leakages such as loss, unauthorized

    access or use, destruction, modiﬁcation, or unintended and

    inappropriate disclosure of data so that the farmers’ data are

    Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems

    05

    Kaur et al.

    10.3389/fsufs.2022.903230

    kept secure. It is recommended for the ATPs to take proactive

    data security measures to protect the privacy of farmers rather

    than taking remedial measures when a problem arises in

    the farm system (Cavoukian, 2009). Proactive measures can

    include ﬁnding loopholes and potential vulnerabilities in the

    system. This can be achieved by monitoring threats, performing

    intrusion detection, and training staﬀ for privacy protection. To

    protect sensitive farm information, end-to-end data encryption

    is recommended. This will help in encoding the data that can

    only be read when the data are decrypted. Moreover, personal

    information stored by ATPs on laptops and portable hard drives

    should be protected by using technological safeguards such

    as encryption and password protection. Other cyber security

    approaches can be using two-layer authentication and network

    security for data transfer (Gupta et al., 2020).

    If farm data are shared with third parties or industry

    partners, consent must be obtained from farmers and other

    actors

    who

    contribute

    to

    data

    generation.

    Agricultural

    technology provider must ensure that third parties and

    industry partners comply with the same legal terms and

    conditions that have been presented to farmers in terms of

    processing, sharing, and retention of data collected from

    farms.

    Agricultural

    technology

    providers

    should

    develop

    appropriate audit procedures to ensure compliance with data

    agreements and consent by third parties and avoid conﬂicts in

    intellectual property.

    between

    protecting

    farm

    data

    conﬁdentiality, while supporting supply chain stakeholders’

    growth and economic gain, is a challenge for policy makers and

    governments (Jouanjean et al., 2020). The legal frameworks that

    govern farm data are fragmented and do not protect farm data

    as it is expected by the farmers. The government’s intervention

    in farm data protection and establishment of standards for farm

    data practices can address some of the existing governance

    challenges of farm data (Jouanjean et al., 2020). This section

    discusses the possible measures that policy makers can take for

    protecting farm data.

    There is legislation related to the protection of an

    individuals’ personal information by the private sector or

    businesses. For example, Personal Information Protection and

    Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) in Canada provides 10

    fair information principles such as accountability, identifying

    purpose, consent, limiting collection, limiting use, disclosure

    and retention, accuracy, safeguards, openness, individual

    access, and challenging compliance (Oﬃce of the Privacy

    Commissioner of Canada., 2019). Regulations such as GDPR

    TABLE 2 Recommended data practices for ATPs.

    S.no.

    Recommendations

    1

    ATP should provide farmers with a transparent, easy to read, and free

    of legal jargon data license agreement (Guntamukkala et al., 2015; Kaur

    et al., 2018; Oﬃce of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada., 2018,

    2019).

    2

    ATPs should limit data collection to what is directly relevant and

    related to the purpose speciﬁed in the data contract (Hert et al., 2017).

    3

    Collected data from farms and farmers should be transferred and

    stored using safety protocols (Hazrati et al., 2022).

    4

    Farmers should be able to have full access to their farm data collected

    by ATPs.

    5

    ATPs should respect the right of farmers to data portability (Hert et al.,

    2017). This means that farmers should have the right to get access to

    their personal and farm data in a structured, commonly used, and

    machine-readable format.

    6

    ATPs should present a time plan for data retention. To this end,

    farmers’ data must be deleted when the contract ends (Guntamukkala

    et al., 2015; Kaur et al., 2018; Oﬃce of the Privacy Commissioner of

    Canada., 2018, 2019).

    7

    Farmers should have the right to data erasure. This suggests that, upon

    farmers’ request, their data must be completely deleted from the entire

    system, including back-up servers (Guntamukkala et al., 2015; Kaur

    et al., 2018; Oﬃce of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada., 2018,

    2019).

    8

    Farmers’ sensitive information, such as personal information, should

    be collected and stored in an anonymized and de-identiﬁed format as

    much as possible (Amiri-Zarandi et al., 2022).

    9

    ATPs should obtain farmers’ consent before sharing their data with

    third parties (Castelluccia et al., 2018). ATPs should also require these

    organizations to adhere to the data agreements with farmers.

    10

    ATPs should present a failover and disaster-recovery plan. This

    recommendation requires that ATPs proactively address any probable

    issues such as system crashes or attacks to protect farm data (Hazrati

    et al., 2022). Also, the ATPs must notify farmers if a data breach takes

    place that causes disclosure of the data to an outside party (Hazrati

    et al., 2022).

    11

    Farm data agreements should include contact information in ATP’s

    organization so that farmers can seek clariﬁcation about their

    data-related issues (Guntamukkala et al., 2015; Kaur et al., 2018; Oﬃce

    of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada., 2018, 2019).

    12

    Farmers should have the right to inquire about how their farm data is

    used and also how their sensitive data are protected (Guntamukkala

    et al., 2015; Kaur et al., 2018; Oﬃce of the Privacy Commissioner of

    Canada., 2018, 2019).

    13

    Finally, ATPs should implement security best practices, software and

    hardware protocols, in the farm technologies and network. They

    should also continuously monitor the network for possible attacks and

    implement proactive strategies to mitigate the harm (Hazrati et al.,

    2022). These practices should include authentication, access control,

    encryption, and other methods.

    and

    CCPA also

    mandate

    the

    protection

    of

    individuals’

    information privacy. These regulations can strengthen users

    control over their data. These privacy laws enforce privacy

    principles or rights such as the right to be informed of the data

    gathered and how they are be used, the right to remove personal

    information that are collected, the right to withdraw from a

    service and erase the collected data, and the right to object to

    processing. Some of these regulations such as GDPR and the new

    bill 64 in the province of Quebec in Canada can be applied to

    protect farmers’ most sensitive data, e.g. location data (GDPR.,

    2018). However, even those policies may not protect farmers

    against privacy risks such as identiﬁability (e.g., through PII;

    Ferris, 2017). This highlights the need for laws and policies that

    provide more comprehensive protection of farm data exclusively

    and extensively.

    In addition to regulations, governments can implement

    strict measures to ensure compliance and accountability. These

    measures include non-compliance ﬁnes or other penalties

    including

    data

    processing

    suspension.

    Non-compliance

    penalties have been implemented by GDPR for the protection

    of personal information in private and public sectors. Policy

    enforcement is vital for the protection of farmers’ right

    to privacy.

    Given the existing gaps in laws and regulations pertaining

    to farm data, codes of conduct have been formulated by some

    non-proﬁt organizations. These codes provide guidelines for

    protecting farm data. For example, the American Farm Bureau

    has drafted a set of principles referred to as Privacy and Security

    Principles or Core principles (Wiseman et al., 2019). These

    principles provide a benchmark for good practices in farm data

    governance including collecting, storing, using, and transferring

    farmer’s data. Furthermore, this code of conduct encourages

    transparency on how farmers’ data are used and processed and

    even secured. Other codes of conduct are New Zealand Farm

    Data Code of Practice, The European Union Code of Conduct

    on Agricultural Data Sharing by Contractual Agreement (“EU

    Code of Conduct”) and the Australian Farm Data Code. These

    codes of conduct are voluntary to follow and are self-regulatory

    which may reduce their eﬀectiveness.

    Governments can provide incentives for agricultural co-

    operatives to serve as trusted actors in the farming ecosystem.

    Agricultural co-operatives can foster a sustainable environment

    for farm data accessibility and use (Jouanjean et al., 2020).

    Data co-operative platforms can be established as a governance

    structure to facilitate farm data storage and processing by

    technology providers and other stakeholders. They can also

    facilitate access and collection of agricultural data for public

    research and innovation (Canadian Centre for the Study of Co-

    Operatives., 2017). Some examples of farm data cooperatives

    are Ag Data Coalition (ADC), Grower Information Services

    Cooperative (GISC), and JoinData. With the right legal

    frameworks and protocols, data co-operatives can empower

    farmers to manage data and build more conﬁdence in using

    digital technologies on their farms. Data co-operatives can

    potentially resolve some of the farm data governance issues

    including data access; however, other challenges such as privacy

    (e.g., identiﬁability) and interoperability of data still need to be

    resolved. Governments can be instrumental in mitigating some

    of these challenges.

    Since

    data

    is

    a

    useful

    resource

    for

    stakeholders,

    disagreements can occur regarding the status or ownership of

    data between farmers and other stakeholders. A range of policies

    or standards should be developed for well-balanced governance

    of farm data. This can be achieved by established innovation

    platforms for food system stakeholders that foster collaboration

    and knowledge sharing. Furthermore, governments can provide

    guidance on what should be performed or avoided in the

    contracts (Jouanjean et al., 2020).

    Recommendations for other supply

    chain stakeholders

    Data-driven technologies improve eﬃciency of the entire

    supply chain, resulting in reduced concerns regarding food

    safety and security. Food supply chain stakeholders include

    crops, livestock, or other agriculture sector’s actors, resource

    producers such as feed, fertilizing, and pesticide providers,

    as well as producers, distributors, retailers, and consumers.

    With the technological revolution and adoption of data-driven

    technologies, the agricultural sector has become well connected

    and oﬀers beneﬁts to the entire supply chain. This means that

    supply chain stakeholders’ data practices inﬂuence protection

    of farm data. This section brieﬂy discusses the measures that

    the stakeholders in the food supply chain can take to protect

    farmers data.

    Data-driven technologies for food safety and sustainability

    require collaboration among food supply chain stakeholders

    through data sharing and integration. Food traceability and

    provenance, for instance, need data tracking systems such as

    digital identity management, Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation

    (RFID), to integrate data from farms to consumers in order to

    validate the origin of food products (Chen et al., 2008). Food

    recall, supply management, and many other applications rely on

    access and integration of farm data. These interconnected actors

    and processes need responsible data sharing and integration

    practices and tools to protect farmers’ privacy and data assets.

    Standardized data practices and tools are needed to be

    shared and used among the stakeholders to eﬀectively manage

    data provenance, integration, and processing while preserving

    the privacy of all the stakeholders. Explicit consent and

    transparent data agreements are also required to ensure all the

    stakeholders are fully aware of the terms and conditions of data

    collection, sharing, integration, and use. Additionally, supply

    chain stakeholders should ensure the protection of farmers’

    identities by anonymization or de-identiﬁcation of farmers’

    Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems

    data. Other recommendations include securing data end-to-end

    through security standards and platforms (e.g., blockchain) (Al-

    Farsi et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022). Automated auditing procedures

    can help ensure ethical and responsible access and use of data

    through the value chain.

    Conclusion

    The success of precision agriculture is highly reliant on

    the massive amounts of data that are now possible to collect

    and process by big data technologies. With this comes the

    responsibility for data privacy and conﬁdentiality which has

    imposed challenges on the farming system. Fragmented legal

    frameworks, regulations and contractual obligations, lack of

    standards and best practices for protecting farm data, and lack of

    appropriate business models for co-creation, and sharing value

    of data are only some of the challenges. These issues in addition

    to limited adoption of privacy best practices by ATPs and other

    stakeholders in the supply have resulted in farmers’ reluctance to

    share data or even adopt new technologies.

    This paper provides practical recommendations for the

    main stakeholders in the farming ecosystem, on using existing

    best practices to better preserve farmers’ privacy and data

    conﬁdentiality. We believe if these recommendations are

    adopted in a proactive manner by all the stakeholders in

    the agriculture sector, farmers data will be better protected,

    and may encourage them to share farm data. This can help

    in strengthening trust among farmers and other stakeholders

    which may result in increased adoption and usage of technology

    in the agriculture sector.

    This paper is one of the ﬁrst attempts to gather best practices

    for protecting privacy and conﬁdentiality of farm data. Future

    research can examine the social, legal, and economic impact of

    farm data privacy breaches and misuse and evaluate the impact

    and eﬀectiveness of the existing privacy preserving methods

    and protocols.

    The growth in the use of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and Artiﬁcial

    intelligence (AI) has improved the productivity and efﬁciency of modern agriculture,
    which

    is commonly referred to as precision farming. Precision farming solutions are
    dependent

    on collecting a large amount of data from farms. Despite the many advantages of

    precision farming, security threats are a major challenge that is continuously
    on the rise

    and can harm various stakeholders in the agricultural system. These security issues

    may result in security breaches that could lead to unauthorized access to farmers’

    conﬁdential data, identity theft, reputation loss, ﬁnancial loss, or disruption
    to the food

    supply chain. Security breaches can occur because of an intentional or unintentional

    actions or incidents. Research suggests that humans play a key role in causing
    security

    breaches due to errors or system vulnerabilities. Farming is no different from
    other

    sectors. There is a growing need to protect data and IT assets on farms by raising

    awareness, promoting security best practices and standards, and embedding security

    practices into the systems. This paper provides recommendations for farmers on
    how

    they can mitigate potential security threats in precision farming. These recommendations

    are categorized into human-centric solutions, technology-based solutions, and
    physical

    aspect solutions. The paper also provides recommendations for Agriculture Technology

    Providers (ATPs) on best practices that can mitigate security risks.

    INTRODUCTION

    With the advancement of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT),
    the use of

    precision agriculture has been exponentially increasing. According to the MarketsandMarkets

    report (MarketsandMarkets, 2022), $8.5 billion USD was the precision farming market
    in 2022

    and is expected to grow to 15.6 billion by 2030. Precision farming uses technological
    innovations

    in data collection and processing to enhance farm production and raising livestock.
    Precision

    agriculture has enabled farmers to make more informed decisions about farm production
    and

    use of resources. For example, with the help of precision agriculture technologies,
    farmers can

    monitor the crop status by observing and measuring variables such as soil condition,
    irrigation,

    fertilizer and pesticide eﬀect, plant health, and crop yield. Similarly, the farmers
    can monitor the

    health of livestock animals by recording their food and water intake, weight,
    behavior, temperature,

    respiration rate, and sounds produced by animals.

    Hazrati et al.

    Farm Data Security Recommendations

    These technologies are highly dependent on processing large

    volumes of data collected from farms (Cisternas et al., 2020).

    The data are collected using smart sensors, agricultural drones,

    and other farm technologies. According to IBM, 500,000 data

    points were being generated on an average farm per day

    in 2019 (IBM, 2021). This size is expected to grow to 4

    million by 2036. The collected data helps gain insights into

    farm management practices, including tracking crop yield,

    environmental sustainability factors, pest risk analysis, livestock

    health and welfare monitoring, and even food safety and security.

    Precision farming can be compromised by threats to data

    acquisition technologies and increased cyberattacks on farming

    systems (Threats to Precision Agriculture, 2018). Farming

    technologies and access to farm data attract the attention

    of cybercriminals who are looking to take advantage of

    vulnerabilities in the system for ﬁnancial gain or other malicious

    intents (Amiri-Zarandi et al., 2020). Weaknesses in the system,

    fragmented technical security protocols, and human errors can

    allow attackers to easily access the farming network and the

    digital tools and introduce security breaches and risks. Security

    breach refers to unauthorized access and transmission of data

    which can result in leakage of sensitive, protected, or conﬁdential

    information. Security breaches in the farming system may lead to

    compromising the entire system or bringing the network down

    allowing the attackers to control the entire system, and sabotage

    farm data or other assets. Coordinated attacks on a farming

    system can lead to stealing data, loss of proprietary information

    (such as contracts or security design), disruption to supply chain,

    or even reputation loss and ﬁnancial loss.

    West (2018) shares his view on security in farms and describes

    that there are two types of digital farming systems; those

    that have been hacked, and those that will be hacked in the

    future. Security of farms is hampered by the security attacks

    that are being prevalent and targeted in the agricultural sector.

    For example, the “REvil group” attacked and compromised

    the Dairy Farm Group’s network, one of the largest retailers

    in Asia, and demanded roughly $30 million ransom and had

    access to the Dairy Farm network (Connor Madsen, 2021).

    Similarly, a hacking group, BlackMatter, carried out an attack on

    NEW Cooperative, a farmer cooperative, and locked up all the

    computer systems. BlackMatter demanded $5.9 million ransom

    and threatened to publish a terabyte of the cooperative’s data.

    The company was forced to take their computer network oﬄine

    to isolate the incursion. JBS, the world’s largest meat-processing

    corporation based in Brazil, had to pay $11 million ransom

    since their computer network was hacked and the company was

    forced to temporarily shut down nine beef plants, disrupting

    meat processing across North America and Australia for an

    entire week. In 2019, HSBC issued a warning to farmers in the

    UK about the risks of cybercrime, such as phishing campaigns,

    ransomware attacks, and malware. Such security attacks can

    harm the agricultural sector and disrupt countries’ economies

    that are highly reliant on agriculture.

    Security attacks can result in security breaches which can

    have a detrimental eﬀect. Figure 1 provides a classiﬁcation of

    security breaches. Security breaches can be caused intentionally

    or unintentionally on a farm system. For example, hacking is

    FIGURE 1 | Classiﬁcation of security breaches.

    exploiting weaknesses in a network by a person who intentionally

    wants to penetrate the system (Gao and Zhong, 2015). Another

    example of an intentional attack is Malware. Malware is a

    software product designed to cause disruption in a network or

    system or gain unauthorized access to data (Rust et al., 2022).

    Ransomware is prevalent malware that attacks industries and

    new technologies that work with data. Ransomware can encrypt

    the ﬁles on a device and prevent users from accessing their

    information. The attackers usually display a ransom demand

    on the computer screen to release the locked information.

    Phishing is also a common cybersecurity scam that can harm

    farms’ digital infrastructure (De Araujo Zanella et al., 2020;

    Van Der Linden et al., 2020). Through phishing, a hacker

    obtains some sensitive information through an email, phone

    call, or text message. Phishing can target an individual or

    a larger group of recipients and the attacker establishes a

    communication that seems to be a regular vendor of a business

    or a known contact. On the other hand, unintentional actions

    can also lead to many security breaches. Accidental data sharing,

    transmitting sensitive data without proper encryption, and

    unauthorized access to computing infrastructure resulting from

    wrong conﬁgurations are examples of unintentional threats.

    Unauthorized software installation and conﬁguration errors are

    other examples of unintentional actions that may grant access

    to sensitive information or computing infrastructure (Cheng

    et al., 2017). Best practices and technology solutions that can

    protect farm systems from these threats are reviewed in the

    following sections.

    Humans play a signiﬁcant role in the security of IT

    infrastructure since attackers often use social engineering tactics

    to inﬁltrate or compromise a system. Hughes-Lartey et al.

    presented the relationship of security breach incidents and

    human factors (Hughes-Lartey et al., 2021). Human factors that

    can lead to security breaches include but are not limited to lack

    Farm Data Security Recommendations

    of awareness, negligence, or using inappropriate access control

    practices. Moreover, studies show that employee negligence and

    insider involvement are the weakest links in an organization

    that may cause 95% of data breaches. These intentional or

    unintentional human errors can pose serious security risks.

    As indicated above, farming systems are also vulnerable

    to cyber security attacks. Limited cybersecurity awareness

    among farmers, outdated security practices, lack of compliance

    with security standards, and prioritizing productivity on

    farms/farmers over the security of farm data are some of

    the reasons that can increase security attacks. Some research

    studies have also shown that there is a lack of emphasis on

    cybersecurity in the farming industry. Nikander et al. (2020)

    investigated the network and connected devices of six dairy farms

    in Finland and also conducted a survey of security practices

    at farms. The authors concluded that there is a signiﬁcant

    need to improve farm system security at individual farm levels.

    They have also concluded that security threats are caused by

    farmers’ activities or lack of activities, i.e., practicing security

    protection standards. Farm physical environment imposes its

    security challenges according to this study. Farmers in this

    survey have also expressed a lack of conﬁdence in their ability

    to protect their farms against such attacks (Nikander et al.,

    2020). These ﬁndings suggest that enhancing farmers’ awareness

    about security best practices can assist in safeguarding farm data

    and systems.

    This paper provides a series of recommendations for farmers

    to improve security of farm IT infrastructure and farm data.

    We categorize our recommendations in three groups including

    human centered, technology-based and physical security for

    farmers. Furthermore, farm data cannot be eﬀectively protected

    without reliable security technologies. In this paper, we elaborate

    on the important role ATPs or companies that build or govern

    farming systems and platforms can play to protect farm data.

    We also brieﬂy review some of the security best practices and

    technologies that ATPs can provide or recommend to farmers.

    These recommendations can assist in enhancing system security

    and mitigating possible security risks and attacks.

    SECURITY PRACTICES RECOMMENDED

    FOR FARMERS

    Information security is an important requirement that farmers

    should pay careful attention to. Farmers should adopt security

    best practices to protect farm systems from potential cyber

    attacks. In general, the source of security issues can be divided

    into three categories: human error, technology, and physical

    aspects. Human errors refer to unintentional actions or lack of

    actions by users that allow a security breach to occur. Examples

    of such actions include downloading an email attachment

    containing malware, opening a phishing email, using weak

    passwords, and sharing personal passwords with others. As per

    IBM’s report (IBM Security Services, 2014), human error is the

    root cause of 95% of security breaches. Technological security

    risks, such as ransomware and malware, are risks that are

    caused by software vulnerabilities, deﬁciencies in system design

    FIGURE 2 | The main categories of security issues.

    or setups, conﬁguration errors, or other technology-related issues

    (e.g., lack of interoperability). Finally, physical data security

    issues are anything tangible that causes a security breach, such

    as unauthorized access to server rooms. Each of these security

    categories can cause irreparable damage to the farming system.

    Figure 2 demonstrates these main causes of most security threats.

    In this section, we provide recommendations on security

    practices that can be adopted by farmers and farmworkers for

    each of the threat categories in Figure 2.

    Human-Centered Solutions

    Farmers as the end-users of farming technologies can be

    instrumental in securing farm IT infrastructure. Farmers and

    farmworkers’ lack of awareness about potential security risks and

    practices may put farm technologies in a compromising security

    situation (Nikander et al., 2020). Several steps can be taken to

    tackle the human aspects of cybersecurity at farms which are

    imposed by the end-users. This section reviews these solutions.

    Farmers should educate themselves and all farmworkers to

    improve their information security competency and to have a

    reasonably good level of awareness and vigilance. Furthermore,

    farmworkers should be trained to adopt day-to-day cybersecurity

    hygiene and best practices to take proactive steps in protecting

    farms’ digital infrastructures such as servers, sensors, data, and

    other digital devices. For example, farmworkers should be trained

    and informed not to download apps from unknown or unreliable

    sources. They should also be aware of the harmful consequences

    of phishing emails. This can be achieved by showing examples

    of phishing emails and presenting the impacts of those emails.

    Farmworkers should be encouraged to report suspicious system

    performances to get help before other parts of the system are

    impacted (Hanus and Wu, 2016).

    The common process to access a digital system is by using

    an authorized credential such as a username and password.

    Verizon states that the use of compromised or stolen credentials

    caused over 60% of security breaches in 2021 (Barr, 2021). This

    shows the importance of credential management practices such

    as password management and two-factor authentications. To

    prevent farm data from getting breached, farmers should work

    with ATPs to implement appropriate credential management and

    user authentication practices, e.g., passwordless or password-

    based practices. Through these practices, authorized users can

    be identiﬁed by their passwords or biometrics to prevent

    unauthorized access (Butler and Butler, 2014). Hackers can

    exploit weak, short, or exposed passwords to break into a system.

    If the system’s authentication process is through passwords, using

    Farm Data Security Recommendations

    TABLE 1 | Guidelines for creating strong passwords.

    Guidelines to create and use strong passwords for authentication

    1. Create a password longer than the recommended minimum required length

    by the system.

    2. Use a combination of characters to create a password, including small and

    capital letters, numbers, and symbols.

    3. Avoid choosing frequently-used words and personal information that are

    easy to guess (such as ﬁrst/last name, pet name, or family member’s name).

    4. To remember the password, a random sentence and abbreviations can be

    used. Complexity can be added by capitalizing certain letters, such as

    “Take-Me2-Home!”.

    5. In case there is a need to write the passwords so that they are not forgotten,

    it is recommended to put the notes in a safe place.

    6. Create separate usernames or passwords for different farm staff if possible.

    7. Usernames or passwords should not be shared with others.

    8. Change passwords periodically to alleviate the risk of compromise.

    9. Do not save passwords or use auto-ﬁll features on browsers.

    10. If the system is compromised or it has been hacked, passwords should be

    changed immediately.

    11. Change the default passwords of devices and machines at the farm while

    setting them up for the ﬁrst time.

    12. Use a random password generator or password management system if

    possible.

    reliable passwords is one of the most eﬀective precautions to

    keep access to the farm’s digital infrastructure safe for authorized

    users. This can be achieved by deﬁning strong passwords. Table 1

    contains recommendations for farmers and farmworkers to

    create strong passwords and to keep passwords secure.

    Malware can impose diﬀerent kinds of vulnerabilities on the

    digital systems installed at the farm. Malware is a program

    designed to gain unauthorized access to a network or system to

    steal information or cause damage to data or software. Malware

    can be distributed/downloaded by clicking on a link in an

    email, through a malicious website, or by executing a malicious

    ﬁle. Ransomware is one of the prevalent malware that can

    impact various sectors, including farming (West, 2018). One

    way of preventing malware such as ransomware, farmworkers

    should avoid opening suspicious emails, links, and ﬁles and

    should not connect to untrusted memory devices or computers.

    They should also avoid downloading software applications from

    unknown or untrusted sources on farm computing devices.

    Farmworkers should avoid signing in with their personal

    account on applications and websites online. They should also

    avoid linking online accounts to farm desktops, computers, or

    networks. Once an attacker gains access to an account associated

    with a device or network at the farm, they can use this channel to

    connect to other accounts or systems connected to a farm.

    Phishing attacks are other prevalent threats in the farming

    ecosystem (Carneiro et al., 2021). Farmworkers should always

    be vigilant about potential social engineering traps such as

    phishing attacks, spam, and social media scams. Training

    farmworkers with practical examples by presenting past incidents

    and their consequences is a pragmatic way to raise awareness

    and prepare the staﬀ to identify, avoid, or mitigate such attacks

    (Carneiro et al., 2021). It is also recommended not to click

    on links or open attachments embedded in suspicious emails.

    Farmworkers should further avoid sharing sensitive information

    with unknown/untrusted organizations or contacts. The source

    and purpose of information sharing should be clear and should

    be discussed with farm managers or ATPs.

    Although some conﬁdential data leakage incidents in a farm

    can be due to farmworkers’ negligence or lack of action, in some

    cases, a data breach may take place intentionally by farm staﬀ.

    Such incidents are referred to as insider attacks (Bae et al., 2011).

    In this type of attack, a disgruntled staﬀ can sell conﬁdential data

    to make a proﬁt or disseminate data to cause harm. Proactive

    prevention of such attacks is crucial because the insider attackers

    have legitimate access to the system. Limiting those who have

    administrative access to the network, i.e., access privilege, and

    limiting the farmworkers’ access to unrelated components of the

    farming system (Yang et al., 2020) that are not related to their

    work (e.g., data, devices, servers) can alleviate the risk of insider

    attacks. Access privilege can be set up by the ATPs through

    consultation with farm managers. For example, if a farm staﬀ

    requires elevated, privileged access to the system, setting up a

    custom username-password and limiting permissions on what

    they can do can prevent unauthorized activities. Additionally,

    it is necessary to grant minimum access for farmworkers and

    only at a level that they can perform their job, which is also

    called zero trust (Campbell, 2020). If the work contract of a farm

    staﬀ terminates and they are no longer associated with the farm

    operations, it is important to immediately revoke their access to

    farm computers, servers, and systems and change passwords even

    for emails (Data Security Policy, 2021). Also, if the farm staﬀ has

    other work devices, such as a laptop or USB drive, those devices

    should be returned before quitting the job and remote access or

    other access privileges such as passwords should be deactivated

    to prevent unauthorized access to farm system.

    In the case of an attack on the farm system and infrastructure,

    the passage of time can only worsen the situation. Therefore, it

    is highly recommended that farmers mitigate harm such as data

    leakage, system crashes, and compromised device or computer

    by seeking help from ATPs or farm insurances in the shortest

    amount of time possible. A response plan should be provided by

    ATPs for the farmers to execute the appropriate steps and detect

    and limit the damage and facilitate a quick recovery (Thompson,

    2018). The plan should leverage all signiﬁcant scenarios that

    could occur on farms. Also, it is suggested to prepare an on-call

    list of technology providers, technicians, and farmworkers who

    can respond to security events.

    Technological Solutions

    On-farm

    and

    other

    smart

    technologies can be susceptible to security risks. For this reason,

    appropriate technical measures should be taken to reduce

    vulnerabilities and secure the technological aspects of farms

    (Hamed et al., 2017). This section provides recommendations to

    farmers on the technology solutions they can obtain to secure

    data at farms.

    A number of solutions can be implemented by the ATPs to

    protect farm computing infrastructure from such threats. For

    Hazrati et al.

    Farm Data Security Recommendations

    instance, it is often the case that some farm operations are

    performed remotely. To do this, farmworkers need to connect

    to the farm network remotely to monitor, control, or perform a

    task with their own personal device. Setting up the heating system

    of the farm or turning oﬀ the irrigation system remotely while

    raining are examples of such remote activities. Personal devices

    are inherently insecure and may have unpatched vulnerabilities

    (Data Security Policy, 2021). In those cases, farmers can request

    access to farm computing infrastructure through Virtual Private

    Network (VPN). Farmworkers can use VPN to connect remotely

    to perform farm operations securely. Also, connecting from

    unsecured Wi-Fi networks such as open or public Wi-Fi can

    enable attackers to capture traﬃc oﬀ an open access point

    to perform attacks. Setting up multi-factor authentication can

    mitigate such security issues (Yang et al., 2020). Multi-factor

    authentication performs an additional sign-in method, such

    as sending a text or a number to your phone or email with

    a code to conﬁrm the identity. Some authentication methods

    use a face ID (Fard and Hashemi, 2020) or ﬁngerprint as an

    extra step after entering a username and password. The extra

    step to log in to the device or system can help protect the

    farming system from getting hacked or from unauthorized access.

    Protection from malware and ransomware can be improved by

    using antivirus software on all computers and laptops that are

    used at the farm. Furthermore, on-farm software devices need to

    be updated frequently. Automated updates can be set up to make

    the process easier.

    IoT devices have diﬀerent levels of security standards which

    are mentioned in device speciﬁcations (Matheu-García et al.,

    2019). Examples of digital farm devices include sensors, IoT

    irrigation systems, milking robots, and drones. Using devices

    with weak security levels, such as devices using unencrypted

    passwords, can increase the vulnerabilities of farm systems and

    networks. To mitigate this issue, it is recommended that farmers

    ask the technology providers about the farm devices’ security

    features before they are installed at the farm. Farmers can also

    ask ATPs to enable the use of encryption for all data at rest

    or data in motion. It is recommended to list all equipment,

    hardware, and software available in the farm system and update

    the list when any new equipment is purchased. This list can help

    farmworkers to ensure all software and IoT devices ﬁrmware is

    up to date. Also, farmworkers can check the list periodically to

    ﬁnd and uninstall unused software or devices (Matheu-García

    et al., 2019). Eliminating unused software and hardware and

    keeping available ones up to date can increase the security level

    of the entire agricultural system. Finally, if it is suspected that the

    system is infected with malware, it is recommended to disconnect

    the computer or device from the network to prevent the malware

    from spreading. The system should be scanned with an antivirus

    program. It is also recommended to ask ATPs to reinstall the

    system as the attacker can use some other techniques to access

    the compromised system.

    Data loss in a farming system is a challenging issue that should

    be proactively addressed. Data loss can result from hardware

    or software problems, attacks on data, or accidental deletion

    of data. For example, malware and ransomware can lead to

    intentional data corruption and hardware or software problems

    (such as improper encryption) that can lead to unintentional data

    corruption (West, 2018). Backing up data regularly in the cloud

    and or other storage mediums oﬀ-farm is an easy approach to

    ensure that any issues with the data at farm do not impact the

    data backups (Thomas and Galligher, 2018). This strategy allows

    data to be restored from backup copies from an earlier point

    in time. Most of the recommendations provided in this section

    focus on adopting existing security standards and best practices

    by farmers to enhance security. To implement these or other

    technical solutions, farmers can ask the ATPs to install or activate

    these solutions or may recruit a trusted technician/consultant or

    seek technology providers’ assistance to enhance data security in

    the farm system.

    Issues arising from physical threats can also harm the farm

    system. This is a major threat for many farms given their open

    environment. The following are recommendations to secure

    physical space on the farm.

    First of all, the farm entrance should be protected through

    digital locks or other means. It is also recommended that

    unauthorized entry should be strictly prohibited. Farmworkers

    should also be aware if they are expecting an outsider. For

    example, repair workers or maintenance workers should make

    prior arrangements for their visit to the farm. Farmworkers

    should not allow anyone to enter the premises without verifying

    their identity or purpose of visit. This can help in protecting

    farms from trespassing and access to main IT infrastructure,

    servers, routers, and other assets.

    To monitor the physical barriers of the farm, surveillance

    equipment such as a security camera system, motion detector,

    and door alarms should be installed. It is also important to

    protect sensitive information, documents, and devices by placing

    them in secure spaces, such as locked cabinets, rooms, and oﬀ-

    site caches. Unnecessary copies of personal or sensitive data

    raise the risk of disclosure; therefore, they should be wiped

    or shredded. Moreover, physical access control and locking

    classiﬁed places can mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to

    devices and information.

    Another physical security requirement is to protect electronic

    devices from failure. For example, since electronic devices and

    computers are vulnerable to dust, they need to be kept clean.

    This requires regular cleaning services of the electronic devices

    to decrease the risk of failure. Providing stable power as required

    for IoT devices and computers and installing regulators to reduce

    voltage ﬂuctuation are other actions that can be taken to alleviate

    the risk of device failure.

    THE ROLE OF AGRICULTURAL

    TECHNOLOGY PROVIDERS

    Since ATPs design and deploy the technologies in farms, they

    can be instrumental in preventing potential security attacks and

    risks. Also, it is common that technology providers have access

    to digital infrastructure and information at the farm, such as

    farm networks, sensors, or data sources stored on-farm or in the

    Farm Data Security Recommendations

    TABLE 2 | Practices that are recommended to ATPs.

    Security practices recommended to Agricultural Technology Providers

    (ATPs)

    1. Encrypt data transfer and data stored on devices and servers.

    2. Keep operating systems and all software up to date to enable software

    patching.

    3. Install and update virus scanners and malware detection software regularly.

    4. Use ﬁrewalls on all computers and the entire network to protect against

    attacks. Ensure routers and ﬁrewalls are appropriately set up, conﬁgured and

    up to date.

    5. Perform continuous vulnerability assessment, penetration test, and

    end-to-end monitoring in the entire farm system to monitor and address the

    shortcomings in advance (Threats to Precision Agriculture, 2018).

    6. Install antivirus software to secure farm systems as well employee-owned

    devices (routers, phones, tablets, workstations, and servers) (Threats to

    Precision Agriculture, 2018).

    7. Ensure controlled use of administrative privileges to prevent unauthorized

    access to sensitive data.

    8. Utilize user authentication mechanisms, e.g., multi-factor authentication

    (Ometov et al., 2018), to validate user identity when accessing common cloud

    services.

    9. Enable “privileged access” control to farm data to protect sensitive

    information and ease access to less sensitive information that are used

    frequently for farm management.

    10. Ensure the Wi-Fi connection is private and regularly monitor it to prevent

    attackers from accessing sensitive data. Remote access through VPN can also

    be enabled.

    11. Use secure channel and communication protocols for all connections and

    data transfers.

    12. Use automatic session timeout and conﬁguration to automatically log out

    after a deﬁned time to decrease the risk of illegal access to farm system

    (Carneiro et al., 2021).

    13. Provide data recovery capabilities as well as a reliable backup system.

    14. Use de-identiﬁcation at source techniques from the ﬁrst steps of data

    collection to protect farmers’ privacy (Zaman et al., 2016).

    15. Prepare incident response and disaster recovery plans to manage potential

    risks in the system.

    16. Use emerging technologies such as blockchain or passwordless

    authentication systems.

    cloud. This means that working with a trusted ATP is critical in

    providing the required security level in the farm system.

    Adopting information security standards by ATPs in precision

    farming systems is important for implementing a highly secure

    environment (Threats to Precision Agriculture, 2018). Security

    standards and practices should be embedded as a default feature

    in the digital IT architecture and design (Vallois et al., 2019).

    Security by design recommends a set of standards that can be

    used in all the application development (or installation) stages,

    from requirement analysis, implementation, and all the way

    to production. User-friendliness of these features is important

    to encourage use and adoption by farmers and farmworkers

    as they will be more intuitive to learn and remember. For

    example, using a secure, easy to use, and eﬀective biometric or

    password management system for logging in instead of using

    traditional passwords can simplify access to systems in a secure

    manner and reduce the possibility of unauthorized access or

    errors (Obaidat et al., 2019). Also, designing a logout button in

    applications to remind farm staﬀ to log out of the system while

    leaving or an automatic log out function can assist with locking

    the system when they are not in use by authorized staﬀ.

    The software on the farm devices should be kept up to date to

    protect from malware and ransomware. Since having up-to-date

    software decreases the risk of security threats, it would be best to

    set the computers, tablets, cell phones, and other digital devices to

    update software automatically. ATPs should provide farmers with

    instructions on how to install and update security software tools.

    It is also essential to install reliable ﬁrewalls on the systems and

    entire network to keep them up to date all the time (Cain et al.,

    2018). A ﬁrewall is a network security software or device that can

    monitor incoming and outgoing traﬃc to the network and ﬁlter

    suspicious activities based on security rules and machine learning

    based detectors.

    ATPs can use security enhancing tools on the farm system

    or network to detect insider attacks and inform farmers about

    possible threats proactively. Enabling software tools that can

    monitor network activity from time to time and checking for

    suspicious activities are important to secure the farm system

    and network. For example, access to a farm system after work

    hours can be an indication of illegitimate behavior. Also, ATPs

    can use a location-based key management method to combat

    insider threats (Choi et al., 2015). This method automatically

    monitors the location of the person who tries to access the system

    remotely. In the case of suspicious or unknown locations, it asks

    for stronger authorization methods to ensure legitimate access to

    the system (Alneyadi et al., 2016).

    After designing the farm system, ATPs can mitigate security

    risks in the farm by performing vulnerability assessments

    and penetration testing. Vulnerability assessment can identify

    vulnerabilities in the system and create a set of recommendations

    to ﬁx them (Alhazmi and Malaiya, 2005). This identiﬁcation can

    help prevent risks to the entire network and infrastructures of

    a digital farming environment that may impact farm operations

    and processes. Furthermore, penetration testing simulates an

    attack to assess the security level of a system (Bacudio et al., 2011).

    This complementary testing mechanism helps farm staﬀ and the

    entire system to be prepared for potential cybersecurity issues

    in advance. In addition, using proper encryption for all data

    transfers and data stored at farm servers is a secure mechanism

    to protect from security breaches and risks.

    With the rise of emerging technologies such as blockchain

    and passwordless authentication systems, ATPs can consider

    these technology solutions to protect farm data. Blockchain

    is a distributed database and immutable ledger that enables

    secure transactions and transfer of ownership. It also ensures

    transparency and trust among stakeholders (Xiong et al., 2020).

    Blockchain can ensure privacy of transactions, ownership rights,

    and provide greater control of data for farmers by enabling

    an eﬀective mechanism for identity management. Passwordless

    authentication mechanism is an eﬀective way to validate identity

    of the user and allow secure access to computing infrastructure

    at the farm. They have shown to be more user-friendly than

    passwords and can improve compatibility (e.g., interoperability)

    (Parmar et al., 2022).

    Farm Data Security Recommendations

    Table 2 provides recommendations on security practices that

    ATPs can adopt to secure farm data and digital infrastructure.

    CONCLUSION

    Security breaches can cause irreparable harm to farmers. The

    consequences of security threats include, but are not limited to,

    stealing information, reputation loss, destruction of equipment,

    error in system conﬁguration and performance, and gaining

    an improper ﬁnancial advantage over a competitor. Existing

    research suggests that 95% of security breaches are caused by

    humans. In addition, past research by Hanus and Wu (2016) has

    shown that farmers are not aware of security practices that can be

    used to protect their farms.

    This gap suggests the need for security standards that can

    be applied to protect farms. Connectivity of farm systems

    with other systems such as smart cities, supply chain, and

    other smart facilities enforces the necessity for securing digital

    infrastructures at farms. In addition, many countries have

    considered agriculture as the critical national infrastructure that

    requires extra protection. The objective of this paper is to

    provide recommendations on the adoption of existing security

    best practices by farmers and ATPs to prevent security breaches

    and sensitive data leakage. For the farmers, recommendations

    were provided in three categories of human errors, physical

    threats, and technology threats. ATPs can secure the farm digital

    infrastructure by adopting standards for securing technology,

    process, and protocols. The role of governments is also

    important to enforce policies and principles related to farm

    data security. As for the future direction, we will work with

    the national farm associations to present this research in a

    usable format for farmers. We expect that farmers’ trust and

    long-lasting relationship with these associations will enhance an

    adoption of the recommended security practices (Rust et al.,

    2022).

    data are crucial to many aspects of production, commerce, and research involved
    in feeding the global community. However, in most agricultural research disciplines
    standard best practices for data management and publication do not exist. Here
    we propose a set of best practices in the areas of peer review, minimal dataset
    development, data repositories, citizen science initiatives, and support for best
    data management. We illustrate some of these best practices with a case study
    in dairy agroecosystems research. While many common, and increasingly disparate
    data management and publication practices are entrenched in agricultural disciplines,
    opportunities are readily available for promoting and adopting best practices
    that better enable and enhance data-intensive agricultural research and production.
    Abbreviations DIDAg Driving Innovation through Data in Agriculture USDA-ARS U.S.
    Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service 1 BACKGROUND With the
    rise of smart farming technologies in agriculture leading to greater data creation
    and utilization by producers and researchers, many questions have arisen and still
    remain regarding data management throughout the agricultural sector (Wolfert et
    al., 2017). An analysis of 19 federal agency responses to the 2013 Office of Science
    and Technology Policy Memo (OSTP, 2013) requiring federally funded research agencies
    to increase and broaden access to research results indicated that data management
    best practices need further development (Kriesberg et al.,  2017). To improve
    transparency and efficiency, the Data Management Plans as a Research Tool (DART)
    project (Whitmire et al., 2017) is developing data management plan guidance in
    a variety of subject areas to encourage data re-use, to enable meta-analyses across
    disciplines, and to preserve information for future interpretation. The problem
    of transparency is amplified by leading discipline-specific repositories being
    insufficient to meet the needs of data science applications (Assante et al., 2016;
    Tenopir et al., 2015). The importance of data access to agricultural/natural resources
    researchers was identified in the 2017–2018 survey by the DataOne project (Tenopir
    et al.,  2020). In this paper, we address data management common practices in
    agriculture and describe best practices that will advance the field, while focusing
    on agricultural economics, dairy agroecosystems, production agriculture, and extension.
    Two workshops, Driving Innovation through Data in Agriculture (DIDAg), were held
    in June 2018 and August 2019 to bring together agricultural librarians, researchers,
    data managers, extension agents, experiment station personnel, university administrators,
    and other individuals with expertise in agricultural data production and management.
    As shown in the description of disciplinary best practices, DIDAg participants
    identified gaps in infrastructure or services needed to support those best practices
    and the needs of research in the future. Given the desire of the agricultural
    research community to employ growing data resources and emerging analytics approaches,
    and the opportunity to capitalize on historical data accumulated by producers
    and agricultural industry, the adoption of data management best practices is crucial
    for advancing 21st century agriculture. Additionally, we provide a case study
    on current dairy agroecosystem research efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
    while maximizing production through diet and genetics improvement (Figure 1).
    The dairy research community is an ideal model to illustrate the importance of
    integrating of scientific inquiry and historical data. The U.S. Department of
    Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) researchers have a history
    of success developing new genetics methods and genomic statistical analyses for
    biological trait prediction in dairy cows (Van Tassell et al., 2008; VanRaden,
    2008; VanRaden et al., 2009 ). In addition, the recent Dairy Coordinated Agricultural
    Project (e.g., Lane et al., 2019; Veltman et al., 2018 ) made substantial progress
    in integrating data from multiple institutions and disciplines to address key
    dairy sustainability questions. The USDA-ARS “Dairy Agriculture for People and
    the Planet” Grand Challenge Synergy Project (Tricarico et al., 2019) represents
    a unique opportunity to expand the use and integration of data on agricultural–environmental
    interactions. FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer Previous work to improve dairy sustainability
    has focused on only some of the possible areas of impact (CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 clip
    art from pixy.org) 2 BEST PRACTICES VS. COMMON PRACTICES 2.1 Research data peer
    review Peer review is a crucial mechanism for progress in research, including
    a range of methods (e.g., single blind, double blind, etc. [Blank, 1991]), in
    the scientific process for the validation and enhancement of research by disciplinary
    experts. However, there are various pitfalls associated with peer review (Kundzewicz
    & Koutsoyiannis, 2005; Langfeldt, 2006 ), and the common practices of peer review
    can be highly variable, as the amount of information required for peer review
    in scientific journals differs depending on the editorial board. There is uncertainty
    about how best to conduct peer review of repository data. There is also concern
    that the amount of time necessary for peer review of repository data could impede
    publication, or that additional resources necessary to review data could be needed
    after the project funding has ceased. The tasks involved in repository data peer
    review are often time consuming, therefore, clear review criteria will be very
    useful to the community. As a best practice, DIDAg participants indicated that
    it is desirable for data in repositories to have some level of peer review or
    quality control. Ideally, research data are included in the peer review process
    of journal article findings based on the data. Currently, many repositories do
    not themselves offer peer review of research data but they do provide curation
    to ensure that metadata, methodology, and data processing are well described and
    consistent with FAIR principles. Following these principles can aid peer review
    by journals or data consumers, and generally make it easier for the others to
    use the information. The components of datasets that should be included in this
    quality review are clear metadata describing different types of data or estimates
    and limitations for their use, lab work methods or instruments involved, QA/QC
    for instrument calibration to reduce bias, the presence and circumstances of survey
    data, clear identification of raw or processed status of data, citations to any
    source data that was used in compiling the dataset, and references to algorithms
    used that created results from the raw data. Some workshop participants stated
    that five times as much commentary compared to actual data analysis code is necessary
    to fully explain the analysis and provide context to the data. For example, geospatial
    metadata should include which satellite system was used to collect the geospatial
    data being analyzed, because different satellite systems give different degrees
    of accuracy and temporal frequency. Article peer reviewers could ensure that researchers
    deposit all their raw data into a repository with no filters or processing to
    allow a wider range of future analyses. This approach has not yet achieved community
    acceptance in part because the data collector may not see the value of preparing
    the metadata. The purpose of metadata is not for peer review, but metadata does
    allow peer reviewers to identify potential problems and errors in the data set.
    Peer reviewers could determine, for example, if comprehensive metadata should
    have been collected from associated meteorological stations with precision agriculture
    data to provide extensive baseline climate/precision metadata along with researcher-provided
    metadata. Peer reviewers could also check to be sure that additional site-specific
    information is included, (e.g., soil structure down to vadose zone with associated
    soil microbial and eukaryotic communities). Accompanying data, such as associated
    microbial community data, can serve as an important type of metadata (i.e., one
    researcher''s data is another researcher''s metadata and vice versa). 2.2 Minimal
    dataset development A common practice in dataset development is to include only
    data and metadata that are useful for their own project, without considering if
    other data would be useful for others. The cost of developing a dataset can be
    high and this may lead researchers to keep to a narrow scope. However, an appropriate
    best practice is to adhere to “minimal dataset” standards. A minimal data set
    is one that includes at least the minimum amount of data and metadata to ensure
    consistency, utility, and interoperability with other data sets. In many cases
    analyses of existing data must include replicates to quantify variation, but replicates
    or multiple observations are often not provided. The minimal requirements for
    a given category of dataset should be defined by the potential users (a specific
    research community, e.g. Kuru et al., 2013). For example, nitrogen and nutrient
    management researchers that provide average estimates of manure quantity and do
    not provide information on variability are not meeting minimal requirements. Researchers
    re-using data to understand sustainability of agricultural systems need longitudinal
    operational information with respect to manure application, soil nutrients, and
    other parameters. For example, tillage is still poorly understood because the
    agricultural community hasn''t always included that information in datasets over
    time. The research community has census data that is only collected every 5 yr
    with variable quality, so adding a spatial component to census data, while protecting
    privacy (Massey, 2014; Schwartz & Solove, 2011), would be a big step forward.
    A proposed minimal dataset is the Nitrogen Recommendation databases for fertility
    guidelines (Kitchen et al., 2017). Contributors to this project must include the
    information described in Supplemental Table S1. Conversely, water resource data
    is very limited and incomplete (Northey et al., 2016). Due to a lack of large-scale
    research on U.S. aquifers, researcher estimates of aquifer water capacity are
    limited. Minimal aquifer and livestock datasets would be very useful for understanding
    water resource management and risks. With large tradeoffs in how water resources
    are used, adoption of minimal water resource datasets will allow economists to
    apply different analytical approaches for managing at-risk water resource areas.
    Minimal datasets would also make clear the multiple data scales needed to maximize
    the value of the information. A best practice is for water resource data or nutrient
    data to be available at point-scale, and also aggregated on larger scales to increase
    the utility of the data for economic estimates. If researchers want to measure
    nutrients going into a basin they need to know if a point-based model works better
    than a gridded model, and what grid size is optimal to answer nutrient transport
    questions of interest. The finer the resolution, and larger the framework, the
    more scalability is available to answer different levels of questions. An example
    of best practices spatial resolution is the National Agricultural Statistics Service
    (NASS; https://www.nass.usda.gov/) aim to have a representative agricultural production
    sample in most areas of the United States, which incorporates stratified sampling
    that is mostly representative at the state level and in some counties. Key research
    topics in dairy economics over the next 10 yr that would benefit from minimal
    dataset development by the research community are given in Supplemental Table
    S2. 2.3 Using and sustaining data repositories 2.3.1 Using data repositories Managing
    data locally and responding personally to individual requests for data is common
    practice among the research community. A number of attributes make a data repository
    trusted by the research community of a particular discipline, and these repositories
    may pursue certification (e.g., https://www.coretrustseal.org/). The use of trusted
    data repositories is not yet pervasive throughout the agricultural community,
    but this use is an important best practice that should be followed to ensure long-term,
    broad availability of valuable data. With or without formal certification, a repository
    must be secure, have stable funding support, and provide sufficient infrastructure
    and metadata to ensure understandability and usability of datasets. These repositories
    must also be affordable. When multiple repositories serve similar disciplines,
    shared policies and standards will allow users of these repositories to combine
    datasets. Data repositories and big international databases are only as good as
    their data submissions and their ease of use. The Ag Data Commons (https://data.nal.usda.gov)
    is an example of a national, cross-disciplinary repository suitable for U.S.-funded
    agricultural research data. The majority of agricultural and natural resources
    researchers (80.2%) are willing to share data across a broad group of researchers
    (Tenopir et al., 2020), which bodes well for the future utilization of data repositories.

    Project WTO World Trade Organization 2.3.2 Sustaining data repositories In order
    to sustain data repositories, DIDAg participants emphasized that funders could
    require the use of specific data repositories. Subject matter repositories, such
    as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
    and European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI; https://www.ebi.ac.uk/), are well
    established for specific disciplines. Some institutional and commercial repositories,
    including several associated with journals, may be trusted by communities as well,
    although they are often not able to archive large amounts of data. Certain types
    of repositories are more suitable for active use and analysis, whereas others
    are ideal for long-term storage and less frequent data use. The cost of data deposit,
    as quoted by the appropriate repository for the type of data generated by the
    study, should be included in project proposal budgets to ensure that data will
    be archived properly in suitable repositories. Data repositories need to have
    long-term support for storage infrastructure with the ability to adapt to different
    data needs and emerging technology. Depending on funding, some repositories could
    themselves facilitate data integration and meta-analysis rather than relying on
    individual researchers to do this (and if they do, the integrated or harmonized
    data should also be shared). 2.3.3 Managing inconsistent data repository standards
    Different data repositories can follow different practices (e.g. disparate requirements
    for ontologies or data dictionaries or acceptance criteria) that result in inconsistent
    and evolving data standards. For example, NCBI no longer accepts non-human genetic
    variation data as this type of data has become increasingly voluminous and challenging
    to manage. Because of potential repository data requirement changes, researchers
    often want assurances that data from their long-term studies will continue to
    be accepted without major requirements to modify data dictionaries or ontologies.
    Transparency from data repositories on their data requirements and criteria will
    help encourage data submission from researchers performing long-term studies.
    Many data users and researchers indicate that the user community does not have
    much leverage over current practices, but the ability for users to choose between
    different repositories will help them identify the most appropriate requirements
    for their data. International databases do not all have the same definitions for
    different terms, but consistent data dictionaries are important to ensure that
    data is not misused. For example, the World Bank (https://www.worldbank.org/)
    and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD; http://www.oecd.org/)
    do not have the same definition of foreign direct investment. It is important
    for users to know the database or repository and its standards in order to correctly
    analyze data and interpret results. Given that many databases are multinational,
    clearly defined metadata schemas and emphasis on common terms, consistent data
    dictionaries and units of measure should be a priority. Currently, the Consultative
    Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) is working to lead the development
    of metadata standards and ontologies (Arnaud et al., 2020). A useful best practice
    for integrating data from different sources and repositories is the use of smart
    templates that can check for accuracy and validity of data inputs, and identify
    common variables that can be used to link multiple datasets. In general, it is
    a best practice that research data should not be archived in proprietary formats.
    However, for data that can only be interpreted through a proprietary platform,
    all attempts should be made to provide at least some of the data in non-proprietary
    formats or the data submitter should provide software that allows others to use
    the closest approximation to the proprietary-formatted data. In any case, data
    format information must be included in metadata to ensure interpretability, keeping
    in mind that if the data is stored in a form that is difficult to use, then potential
    users will not use the data. 2.3.4 Dataset appraisal As the volume of research
    and observational data increases, repositories may increasingly need methods for
    conducting appraisals for scientific importance in order to ensure that they are
    accepting and keeping high value data. This is not peer review if the appraisers
    are not peer researchers but repository managers. The number of citations and
    reads for a journal article associated with a potential dataset, or for a published
    dataset itself could be a usefulness score. Data appraisal performed by repositories
    could be improved if researchers provide examples in the metadata description
    of how their submitted data is or could be useful to others. Replaceability should
    also be an important metric for assigning value to datasets to determine suitability
    for long-term preservation. For example, sequence data is cheaper to produce than
    preserve, therefore storing the physical sample could be better than storing the
    sequence data. The USDA National Agricultural Library (https://www.nal.usda.gov/)
    and the University of Maryland (UMD; https://umd.edu/) are collaborating on data
    rescue protocols to create rubrics to help determine when the value of data is
    great enough to justify the costs of rescue and preservation (Shiue et al., 2021).
    2.4 Best practices for citizen science in agricultural research Citizen science
    (also known as community or participatory science), including crowdsourcing, provides
    substantial opportunity to increase observational data collection, inform model
    development, and increase engagement between agricultural researchers and people
    who are not trained scientists, including farmers. For example, on-farm replicated
    strip trial research can be performed to evaluate the impact of different practices
    and products on productivity (Kyveryga et al., 2018), and precision agriculture
    technology allows for enhanced data collection. Precision agriculture technology
    now allows farmers and scientists to collect GIS coordinates in concert with agricultural
    data that can be used for precisely selecting varieties, fertilizer and water
    needs, and pesticide application strategies (Fulton & Port, 2018 ). New technologies
    such as these also come with greater data management challenges. In the case of
    farmer-scientist research partnerships, scientists may be reluctant to share data
    that is owned by the farmer. Farmers may not be able to access, much less share,
    their own data due to issues with proprietary software and hardware. Additionally,
    for research conducted in partnership, “dual ownership” of data can cause confusion.
    We recommend creating data management plans and data sharing agreements before
    projects start to avoid such challenges. Because of the differences in data collection
    methods, citizen science repositories, or more typically databases, must be evaluated
    differently than traditional scientific repositories. Citizen science repositories
    can have additional value that traditional repositories cannot necessarily provide:
    very large sets of observations from many citizen data contributors present the
    ability to identify likely outliers and unbiased trends; citizens often have little
    reason to lie unless they have a vested interest (e.g., siting a new industrial
    plant). Many citizen scientists engage with the work out of a deep passion for
    a particular subject. For example, the public produces butterfly monitoring data
    (i.e., eButterfly, http://www.e-butterfly.org/) whose contributors create accounts
    that show who they are and where they live. eButterfly communicates to their users
    to inform them what the data has been used for, what researchers have learned
    from the data, and also asks for citizen feedback when the database tools are
    updated. Giving citizen participants the option to use the data themselves enhances
    participation in data collection. It is important that the data collection and
    submission process is not too complicated, or participants will not take the time
    to submit data. However, educating participants to use good data collection practices,
    and building platforms that follow existing standards will raise the quality of
    the data for subsequent analysis, such as modeling. In agricultural research,
    it would be most beneficial to increase the use of citizen science with farmers
    as the participants, as farmers have a vested interest in agricultural research
    directions and results. Because of these vested interests, this type of citizen
    science tends toward knowledge coproduction (Cash et al., 2003; Djenontin & Meadow,
    2018) because farmers can provide valuable knowledge, including but not limited
    to data collection, throughout all stages of the research process. However, agricultural
    knowledge coproduction often operates within (or is limited by) long-standing
    institutional systems for translating scientific research into usable information
    for farmers. In the United States, agricultural extension agents at land-grant
    colleges and universities act as an educational resource for agricultural producers
    and rural communities; translating scientific research into usable information.
    Additionally, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS; https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/)
    brings scientific research to agricultural producers through technical assistance
    in a range of areas such as soil health, water quality, conservation, and livestock
    management. While these institutional systems are very helpful to agricultural
    producers in many ways, there is still a disconnect between the agricultural scientist
    producing the research and the farmer or rancher who is often the beneficiary
    or end-user of the research results. This disconnect limits the agricultural scientist''s
    ability to understand producer perspectives (“where the farmers are coming from”)
    and can yield research results that are not seen as legitimate by producers due
    to lack of trust. Lack of trust in research results is especially prevalent in
    agricultural model development in which the producers were not involved in the
    model creation (e.g., empirical, process, predictive, risk assessment, etc.).
    Models can be highly useful for crop analysis, but unfortunately, model results
    are often not trusted by agricultural producers. Older models and their results
    are often lost as revisions are made, and model improvements can change the predictions
    and subsequent recommendations to farmers. For farmers to accept new model findings
    there must be greater transparency to show how the model changes have impacted
    the predictions. Based on their own experiences, DIDAg participants acknowledged
    that farmers often don''t trust management decisions made from sensor output,
    or by the people who are collecting the data (government or scientists), unless
    there is a strong local agricultural extension presence. The farmer–scientist
    data collection process should include a trusted advisor, such as an extension
    specialist, NRCS staff member, or local expert such as a certified crop advisor
    (CCA) to improve transparency during the collaboration. Participatory research
    can give farmers a bigger role in shaping the research development process beyond
    just contributing data. Initial participants can be found through enhanced outreach
    by extension agents at field days and show-and-tell events. Continued outreach
    and education by Extension will help build valuable participatory research communities.
    In many areas participatory research is conducted by industry, such as the testing
    of precision agricultural methods (Fulton & Port, 2018). Precision ag is a smaller
    part of a larger emerging structure named smart farming, or smart farming technologies
    (SFT) that integrates data into farming practices (Balafoutis et al., 2017). As
    more farmers adopt “smart” techniques, further trust and strategies to share data
    are needed in the agricultural community. Increased engagement of farmers in the
    research process through participatory methods will improve the perceived legitimacy
    of research results, and improve trust between farmers, Extension, and researchers.
    Farmer engagement with researchers will also yield research that is more relevant
    to farmers and their operations. A valuable best practice for facilitating farmer
    and citizen participation is to make participation simple and not be overly time
    consuming. Using and digitizing farmer and citizen analog data sets will help
    expand participation of individuals who are on the other side of the data divide.
    Understanding the participant community is important for these projects; using
    short survey instruments to gather demographic data and gauge participant knowledge
    can benefit the project and also situate citizens in the science. A very positive
    example of successful citizen science that resulted in community best practices
    is the Wheat Stripe Rust disease effort (Kolmer, 2005). In this case, the citizen
    scientists were farmers, whose boots were on the ground quickly to meet this time-sensitive
    challenge of the rapidly spreading Stripe Rust disease. Farmer participation had
    clear value in fighting the spread of the Stripe Rust disease that was harming
    crop production, and many data points were collected from a broad range of participants.
    Agricultural extension offices taught the farmers who wanted to participate how
    to contribute data, and those farmers taught other farmers. The RustTracker website
    (CIMMYT, 2020) was made available for the data to be input, and early identification
    of the disease was made in order for it to be contained. In particular, successful
    efforts were made to contain Stripe Rust disease in the Walla Walla Valley of
    Washington and Oregon. The Strip Rust disease effort revealed a number of points
    that can be used to improve future agricultural citizen science efforts: Many
    farmers and participants are close to retirement and their knowledge will be lost
    when they leave the profession. Larger corporate farms don''t participate in citizen
    science efforts. Collaboration between Extension and Researchers doesn''t happen
    as often as it should, often due to the reduction in the number of Extension agents.
    Better communication is needed between Extension and Natural Resource Conservation
    Service. Citizen science collaboration, participation, satisfaction, and data
    literacy could be enhanced by building a platform (like eButterfly) that can link
    Extension with farmers and researchers to make Extension fully available. Successful
    use cases often involve tracking the spread of crop diseases because they impact
    a farmer''s bottom line. Expanding effective infrastructure like the Stripe Rust
    example could be used for future agricultural disease citizen science (e.g., citrus
    greening). However, there are many more areas that are ripe for participatory
    research methods. For example, water management could also be tracked to improve
    the bottom line for farmers, as irrigation is an important common management decision.
    Additionally, farmers may be likely to participate in data collection for agricultural
    economics models if an output of those models could give them predictions to improve
    yields and profit. Also, citizens could be involved in agricultural product data
    collection such as milk production data, but data collection and management protocols
    for these data would need to be fully developed. 2.5 Supporting agricultural community
    best practices There are many common practices that result in poor data management
    and minimal public access to publicly funded research data, such as storing analog
    data in notebooks, storing data on hard drives that are not publicly accessible,
    or publishing in journals that do not require data public access. Many scientists
    believe that they own the data that they have collected and that sharing the data
    reduces opportunities to use the data in future analyses and scientific papers.
    When data is jointly owned by farmers and scientists, many farmers are concerned
    that sharing the data may open them up to future lawsuits or that they are sharing
    information with their competitors. Agricultural research is often jointly funded
    by the public and industry, which complicates data sharing and public access.
    However, significant progress has been made to expand best practices in data management
    and public access. The first level of support for agricultural community best
    practices of data management and public access is with funding agencies when they
    require explicit public access policies and digital scientific data standards
    in order to secure and maintain funding. Positive incentives such as citations,
    awards, and credit are also very desirable best practices for encouraging data
    public access. Publishers can require community standards as well as requiring
    or encouraging datasets to be publicly accessible after publication. Additionally,
    journals should require researchers to cite all data sources that are used. CrossRef
    and Scholix make it easier to track the use of data and give it more value. Third
    parties could be contracted for independent assessment and enforcement of data
    public access including data repositories or regulatory bodies, if adequate funding
    is available. It is important for experienced scientists to inform their younger
    colleagues that some results accepted by a research community may not be evidence-based.
    Strong evidence is crucial for decision-making and developing policy. Data dictionaries
    and data standards are essential for other researchers to interpret datasets and
    correctly analyze them for future use, and these are often promoted by data repositories.
    Librarians could assist in the choice of these dictionaries and metadata standards
    and repositories, where standards exist. Standard languages and data formats should
    be defined for different data types or disciplines, and researchers need to incorporate
    these in their metadata. Acceptable data formats and data dictionaries can be
    defined by the funding agency, a standard-making body, or the repository where
    the data will be stored. Clear descriptions of data dictionaries and standards
    should be done at the beginning of the workflow description in the metadata. Policies
    should be put in place that describes what process will be used to manage inconsistencies
    in data dictionaries for long- term curation. Long-term data standardization of
    community best practices should be achieved through collaboration and communication
    within a given discipline. CGIAR, an organization that includes 15 international
    research centers, is developing agricultural data standards to create their own
    associated ontology with input from many sources. The Research Data Alliance Interest
    Group on Agricultural Data promotes dialog across international agricultural research
    communities. Community efforts help build momentum for data standardization, resulting
    in community expectations and requirements that data standards must be met to
    warrant publication. University leadership support for agricultural community
    best practices for data management and public access is crucial. This is why both
    Association of Public & Land-grant Universities (APLU; https://www.aplu.org/)
    and Association of American Universities (AAU – i.e., private universities; https://www.aau.edu/)
    are engaged on this topic. Deans, Provosts, and Department Heads can influence
    their departments and communities to adopt data management and public access best
    practices, in partnership with their research libraries (Chodacki et al., 2020).
    Currently, a lot of money is going into data creation via precision agriculture
    but much of it is private. Competitions such as the Gates Foundation Grand Challenges
    (https://gcgh.grandchallenges.org/about) competition using Microsoft FarmBeats
    (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/farmbeats-iot-agriculture/)
    data can encourage faculty to take advantage of data, public or private, in innovative
    ways. Success of these data-intensive researchers can engage the leadership of
    their colleges and universities, who in turn can use this success to illustrate
    the benefits of community best practices among the rest of their faculty. New
    types of data are now available that agricultural researchers never dreamed of
    in the past, and the research community and university leadership are beginning
    to recognize the value of that data for promoting the public good. 3 CASE STUDY:
    DATA BEST PRACTICES AND DIET AND GENETICS IMPACTS ON DAIRY CATTLE GREENHOUSE GAS
    EMISSIONS Supporting data management best practices will help the dairy sector
    translate research and industry results into policy and productive options for
    farmers. The USDA-ARS “Dairy Agriculture for People and the Planet” Grand Challenge
    Synergy Project aims to improve the availability of safe and nutritious dairy
    products, and decrease the environmental impact of dairy production (Tricarico
    et al., 2019). Additionally, new innovations in diet and genetics are being developed
    to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the dairy industry and the greater livestock
    industry (Beauchemin et al., 2009; Boadi et al., 2004; Buddle et al., 2011) (Figure
    2). A food systems analysis of the diary sector recognizes that data is a significant
    constraint towards integrating the different disciplines, spatial and temporal
    scales, and multiple vocabularies that is necessary for reducing the environmental
    impact of dairy production (Finley & Fukagawa, 2019). In order to take advantage
    of emerging greenhouse gas remote sensing technologies, Geenhouse gas Reduction
    through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network (GRACEnet) (Jawson et al., 2005)]
    can provide examples of minimal greenhouse gas dataset development as a foundation
    for remote sensing data. Industry data repositories are a valuable historical
    data resource to use in concert with research data repositories, and developing
    new crowdsourcing techniques will help enhance consumer data among younger generations.

    from their milk. Modified from Aguirre-Villegas et al., 2018) 4 CONCLUSIONS AND
    RECOMMENDATIONS Agricultural data is crucial to many aspects of production, commerce,
    and research involved in feeding the global community. However, standard best
    practices for agricultural research data management and publication do not exist
    given the wide range of disciplines associated with agriculture. Support for agricultural
    community best practices should come from funders, institutions, and organizations;
    the support from these entities will facilitate faster adoption of best practices
    data management by researchers. A wide range of best practices identified by DIDAg
    participants could replace data management common practices and improve data-intensive
    research in agriculture. The following key recommendations emerged from the DIDAg
    workshops to improve data management without overburdening agricultural researchers
    and data repositories. (a) Peer review is important for ensuring quality data
    publication. Broad-purpose repositories can enable peer review, whether it happens
    before or after publication, by ensuring that adequate metadata is present, particularly
    regarding collection and analysis methodology. (b) Minimal dataset development
    that includes detailed metadata and data dictionaries is a crucial best practice
    that should be adopted by agricultural sub-disciplines. Agricultural research
    communities should develop minimal dataset requirements that will make archived
    data more useful and interoperable for researchers within and across different
    disciplines or locations. (c) Agricultural researchers should use data repositories
    that provide long-term data preservation and consistent collection criteria and
    other standards. Appraisal processes should be used to ensure high standards of
    data quality and value for data going into these repositories. (d) Funding agencies,
    scientific journals and other publications, and university leadership are crucial
    partners that should be centrally involved in promoting agricultural community
    standards and best practices. Funding agencies should encourage and provide funding
    for data publication and archiving in trusted data repositories. (e) Citizen science
    has a strong potential to drive innovation in agricultural research by generating
    new or improved observational datasets, improving the salience and perceived legitimacy
    of research results, and building trust between researchers, Extension, and agricultural
    producers. More citizen science and participatory research efforts, involving
    farmers in particular, should be pursued by agricultural researchers. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

    \ Author(s) 2021\nAbstract\nResearch on agri-food supply chains (AFSCs) has attracted\
    \ significant attention in recent years due to the challenges associated\nwith\
    \ sustainably feeding the global population. The purpose of this study is to review\
    \ the potentials of big data for sustainable\nAFSCs. One hundred twenty-eight\
    \ (128) journal articles were selected to identify how big data can contribute\
    \ to the sustainable\ndevelopment of AFSCs. As part of our focus, a framework\
    \ was developed based on the conceptualization of AFSCs in the extant\nliterature\
    \ to analyse big data research in the context of AFSCs and to provide insights\
    \ into the potentials of the technology for\nagri-food businesses. The findings\
    \ of the review indicate that there is a noticeable growth in the number of studies\
    \ addressing the\napplications of big data for AFSCs. The potentials of big data\
    \ for AFSC sustainability were synthesized in a summary framework,\nhighlighting\
    \ the primary resources and activities that are ready for improvement with big\
    \ data. These include soil, water, crop and\nplant management, animal management,\
    \ waste management and traceability management. The challenges of big data integration\n\
    in AFSCs, the study’s implications, contributions, and the future research directions\
    \ are highlighted in detail.\nKeywords Big data . Agri-food supply chain . Sustainability\
    \ . Soil . Water . Environment\n1 Introduction\nIn recent years, agri-food supply\
    \ chains (AFSCs) have\nwitnessed a series of structural changes that have significantly\n\
    changed how firms do business and deliver products to con-\nsumers (Marques Vieira\
    \ et al. 2013). Aside from being com-\nplex and exposed to several risks and uncertainties,\
    \ AFSCs\nencounter increasing volatility across a variety of business\nparameters\
    \ ranging from cost, raw material availability to un-\nstable exchange rates (Christopher\
    \ and Holweg 2011; Vlajic\net al. 2013). Moreover, several scholars argue that\
    \ AFSCs\nhave to take into consideration specific issues associated with\nquality\
    \ management of perishable products, harvesting\nmethods, logistics activities\
    \ and risk management (Ahumada\nand Villalobos 2009; Soto-Silva et al. 2016).\
    \ AFSCs are sen-\nsitive to these issues, which, thus, necessitate developing\
    \ re-\nsilience and responding to consumer concerns for food quality\nand safety.\
    \ Models for AFSCs production and distribution\nshould be developed to make harvesting\
    \ plans more efficient\nand to meet customer demands as well.\nWith the rapid\
    \ pace of globalization, AFSCs have become\nmore sophisticated, fragmented, and\
    \ scattered, requiring the\nintroduction of new technologies as alternatives to\
    \ the tradi-\ntional ones (Sun 2014). The vulnerabilities arising from the\nlimited\
    \ shelf-life of food products and the variability in quality\nbring further difficulties.\
    \ Therefore, AFSC actors need to re-\nthink their existing business practices\
    \ and adopt new technol-\nogies in order to become more efficient and productive\
    \ in the\nagri-food industry. Although the food sector is traditionally\ncharacterized\
    \ by low research intensity (Garcia Martinez and\nBriz 2000; Grunert 1997), several\
    \ factors drive the adoption of\nemerging technologies in AFSCs. For instance,\
    \ AFSC busi-\nnesses seek to enhance customer perception of fresh food\nproducts,\
    \ reduce production costs, shorten lead times, achieve\na competitive advantage\
    \ and optimize AFSCs processes\n(Gašová et al. 2017). Through the application\

    \ would also be possible to expand the market\nboundary of agricultural production\
    \ and accelerate the circu-\nlation speed of agricultural products (Liu 2019).\
    \ A potent\nexample of such technologies is big data.\nAccording to Subudhi et\
    \ al. (2019), big data is defined as a\n“conglomeration of the booming volume\
    \ of heterogeneous\ndata sets, which is so huge and intricate that processing\
    \ it\nbecomes difficult, using the existing database management\ntools.” The concept\
    \ of big data is a relatively novel and prom-\nising field of research (Guo and\
    \ Wang 2019; Kellengere\nShankarnarayan and Ramakrishna 2020) that offers methods\n\
    for increasing the utility of data to extract meaningful insights.\nAs such, the\
    \ essence of big data is to process and analyse\nsizeable parallel data sets obtained\
    \ from multiple sources such\nas online user interactions, commercial interactions,\
    \ monitor-\ning systems, sensor devices and any other consumer tracking\nmethods.\
    \ The critical attribute of big data is the fine-grained\nnature of the data (George\
    \ et al. 2014) which is generated by\nenormous computing power that monitors a\
    \ variety of digital\nstreams and is analysed using “smart” algorithms (Davenport\n\
    2014). Similarly, Devenport (2014) posits that big data repre-\nsents a new era\
    \ of the changing technology landscape that\nengendered a large volume of data\
    \ generated continuously\nfrom multiple data sources and with multiple data formats.\n\
    The extant literature has also indicated that big data has many\nfeatures such\
    \ as volume, velocity, value and variety (Aljunid\n2019). These characteristics\
    \ have garnered much attention and\ncaptured the interest of researchers across\
    \ many disciplines.\nBeyond the technical scope of big data, business scholars\n\
    concur that big data is key to the development of more effi-\ncient and effective\
    \ AFSCs (Guo and Wang 2019; Lioutas and\nCharatsari 2020). Big data constitutes\
    \ a means for generating\nnew insights and supporting decision-making processes\n\
    across several segments in the AFSC.\nThe usage of big data provides real-time\
    \ analytic insights\nfor proactive data-driven decision-making in AFSCs. It feeds\n\
    researchers, practitioners and policy decision-makers with\nquick-witted intelligence\
    \ (Lioutas et al. 2019) and guidelines\nnecessary for the successful management\
    \ of AFSCs (Sharma\net al. 2018). Besides helping AFSC actors to make effective\n\
    decisions, big data can assist AFSC partners to mitigate dis-\nturbances (weather\
    \ hazards, market changes, etc.) by reducing\nthe economic waste related to agricultural\
    \ production (Lioutas\net al. 2019), stimulating agricultural policy impacts (Coble\n\
    et al. 2018) and improving the economic performance of\nAFSC actors (Lioutas and\
    \ Charatsari 2020). The benefits of\nbig data also involve the ability of food\
    \ firms to understand\nconsumer preferences and expectations better, develop prod-\n\
    ucts based on real-time market insights and enhance the over-\nall working circumstance\
    \ and efficiency levels of the business.\nThe World Bank reports that the food\
    \ and agriculture sector\nrepresents 10 per cent of global gross domestic product\
    \ with\nthe potential to increase in the future as a result of population\ngrowth\
    \ and changes in consumer behaviour (Coyle 2016).\nThe contribution of big data\
    \ to this trend is inevitable due to\nits myriad applications, many of which are\
    \ tied into the agri-\nfood industry. However, the benefits of big data for AFSCs\n\
    cannot be realised easily due to data ownership, privacy, se-\ncurity and ethical\
    \ issues in AFSCs (Klerkx et al. 2019).\nWolfert et al. (2017), nevertheless,\
    \ argue that the implemen-\ntation of big data for smart farming is challenged\
    \ by the tech-\nnical and governance concerns that can arise in the different\n\
    stages of the AFSC. In summary, the authors posit that the\ntechnical issues linked\
    \ to data formats, hardware and informa-\ntion standards may limit the availability\
    \ of big data for further\nanalysis, whereas the governance issues are those that\
    \ restrain\nthe performance of AFSC business processes, such as the lack\nof agreements\
    \ on responsibilities and liabilities.\nIt is easy to understand that AFSCs can\
    \ substantially ben-\nefit from the adoption of big data as an empowering tool\n\
    within the food industry. Less clear are the challenges encoun-\ntered during\
    \ the transition towards smart and data-driven\nAFSCs, such as the lack of data\
    \ standards, the digital divide\nbetween AFSC actors and the shortage of organizational\
    \ ca-\npabilities and technical skills to handle data mining and per-\nform analytical\
    \ tasks. However, to the best of our knowledge,\nfew studies have focused on the\
    \ role of big data in enabling the\ndevelopment of sustainable AFSCs. The objective\
    \ of this pa-\nper is to explore big data as a critical driver for the develop-\n\
    ment of sustainable AFSCs through a systematic literature\nreview (SLR) in order\
    \ to analyse the prior studies, capture\nthe central concepts and subjects discussed\
    \ on big data appli-\ncations for AFSCs and identify future research directions.\n\
    Hence, as detailed in the next sections, a representative\nsample was selected,\
    \ and an SLR was conducted. The\nfindings obtained enabled us to examine the evolution-\n\
    ary pattern of big data- AFSC research, the distribution\nof publications according\
    \ to countries and journals, and\nthe potentials of big data for AFSC sustainability.\
    \ Our\nguiding research question is the following:\n1.1 What are the potentials\
    \ of big data for the\ndevelopment of sustainable AFSCs?\nThe insights discussed\
    \ in this paper offer a sharpened under-\nstanding of the value of big data for\
    \ sustainable AFSCs and\nattempt to benefit agri-food firms interested in using\
    \ big data\nfor their business processes. The novelty of this study consists\n\
    in trying to identify what has been studied and can be con-\ncluded about the\
    \ sustainable AFSCs which are supported by\nbig data implementations. Moreover,\
    \ we believe that by in-\nvestigating the potentials of big data for AFSC sustainability,\n\
    we can contribute to the broader discussion on the prospective\nopportunities\
    \ of data-driven AFSCs in the agri-food industry.\nWe also argue that the increasing\
    \ complexity of AFSCs, their\nfragmentation and the increasing complexity of their\n\
    168\nJ. of Data, Inf. and Manag. (2021) 3:167–182\nmanagement call for serious\
    \ consideration of big data as a\npotential support to unlock the value of continuously\
    \ generat-\ned data and promote more evidence-based decision- making\nprocesses\
    \ (Coble et al. 2018). The results of this review, added\nto its limitations,\
    \ helped uncover future research trajectories\nand questions, as discussed in\
    \ Section 5. The last section\nbriefly concludes the paper and highlights the\
    \ study contribu-\ntions and limitations.\n2 Research method\nThe present study\
    \ employs an SLR method to investigate the\nrole of big data as a key driver for\
    \ the development of sustain-\nable AFSCs, identifying the evolution of big data\
    \ research in\nthe food industry since its emergence. Our focus is on the most\n\
    productive countries, the influential authors and articles, and\nthe major contributing\
    \ journals to big data research in the\ncontext of AFSCs. An SLR allows researchers\
    \ to identify\nthe boundaries of existing knowledge and communicate the\nresults\
    \ of other studies that are directly related to the one being\nundertaken (Tranfield\
    \ et al. 2003). It constitutes a broad pic-\nture of the current research trends\
    \ and provides a comprehen-\nsive approach to map out the theoretical perspectives\
    \ and the-\noretical practices emerging in a particular field (Mardani et al.\n\
    2020). A structured research methodology, consisting of ade-\nquate search terms\
    \ and accompanied by a literature search and\nanalysis, is essential to perform\
    \ a useful literature review\n(Rowley and Slack 2004). For the review, our study\
    \ used\nthe PRISMA guidelines (Liberati et al. 2009) pursuing a 3-\nstep methodology\
    \ for data collection and analysis. The steps\nwere as follows: (1) defining search\
    \ procedure and sample, (2)\ninitial descriptive analysis on sample and (3) data\
    \ analysis.\n2.1 Defining search procedure and sample\nCronin et al. (2008) discuss\
    \ the need to formulate a well-\ndefined research question for a literature review.\n\
    Accordingly, our research is mainly focused on reviewing\nthe literature on big\
    \ data for sustainable AFSC management.\nKeyword searches are the most common\
    \ method for locating\nthe relevant literature where a keyword combination facilitates\n\
    the careful selection of the research sample (Khalil et al.\n2015). Therefore,\
    \ guided by the research question of this study\nand using the common Boolean\
    \ operators AND and OR, the\nfollowing keyword search query was used in Scopus:\n\
    TITLE-ABS-KEY (“big data” AND (sustainb* OR environ*\nOR eco* OR green* OR social\
    \ OR societal OR ethic* OR\nCSR OR eco- OR efficiency OR “triple bottom line”\
    \ OR\nTBL) AND (food* OR “agri*” OR perishable* OR fruit*\nOR vegetable* OR “cold\
    \ chain” OR fresh*).\nUsing this keyword search query, the scope of our present\n\
    study is appropriately narrowed down to our research focus,\nwhich is limited\
    \ to AFSC management. The choice of Scopus\nas a main source of academic literature\
    \ is explained by its\ncomprehensive coverage of quality peer-reviewed scholarly\n\
    journals. Scopus is a vast repository of academic articles that\nspan over several\
    \ scientific disciplines, making it widely used\nfor the extraction of studies\
    \ for literature reviews and\nbibliometric analyses. This study was conducted\
    \ in\nJune 2020. In particular, the search in Scopus was performed\nin title,\
    \ abstract, and keywords fields. No temporal restriction\nwas applied to the search.\
    \ The subject areas used for the re-\nview were Agricultural and Biological Sciences;\
    \ Social\nSciences; Decision Sciences; Environmental Science;\nBusiness, Management\
    \ and Accounting; Economics,\nEconometrics and Finance. To ensure the academic\
    \ nature\nof the retrieved data (Ramos-Rodríguez and Ruíz‐Navarro\n2004), we only\
    \ selected English-speaking journal articles for\nthe review. The used search\
    \ query resulted in an initial sample\nof 311 papers to be initially screened\
    \ for relevance using their\ntitles and abstracts. Based on the inclusion criteria\
    \ and\nthe research question, the final number of selected arti-\ncles was 128.\
    \ The metadata data of those articles were\nexported in CSV and .txt formats.\
    \ This helped to ensure\nthat all necessary information about the articles (titles,\n\
    authors’ names‚ authors’ affiliations, abstracts, key-\nwords, and references)\
    \ were extracted.\n3 Findings\n3.1 Descriptive statistics\n3.1.1 Publications\
    \ per year\nFigure 1 depicts the trend in the number of articles published\nfrom\
    \ 2014 onward. As can be observed, there is a consistent\nincrease in the number\
    \ of publications about big data applica-\ntions for sustainable AFSCs. In less\
    \ than a decade, the big data\nannual scientific production has grown remarkably.\
    \ However,\nthe real start of the scientific panorama was in 2016 when\nattention\
    \ was focalized on the promising potentials of big data\nfor AFSC sustainability.\
    \ The next years (2017–2020) can be\ncharacterized by a noticeable upward trend\
    \ and research inter-\nest in the subject. During this study period, big data\
    \ research\nhas witnessed significant growth, reflecting the rapid digitiza-\n\
    tion and modernization of AFSCs.\n3.1.2 Publications by country\nFrom the perspective\
    \ of individual researchers, Fig. 2shows\nthe countries with at least five publications\
    \ in the reviewed\n169\nJ. of Data, Inf. and Manag. (2021) 3:167–182\nliterature.\
    \ Scholars from the USA were the most productive,\naccounting for 26.56 per cent\
    \ of the total contribution. In the\nUSA, Climate corporation has employed big\
    \ data to promote\nsustainable farming practices by developing a cloud-based\n\
    farming information system that merges weather measure-\nments, agronomic data\
    \ modelling and high-resolution weather\nsimulations (Orts and Spigonardo 2014;\
    \ Rubens 2014). In\nsuch an initiative, big data allows farmers to adjust their\
    \ work-\ning practices according to the weather forecast, especially\nwhen they\
    \ need to know the climatic conditions to spray their\nland. To a lesser extent,\
    \ Chinese scholars significantly con-\ntributed to the literature with 30 studies.\
    \ Considering that\nChina has become the largest CO2 emitter in the world, there\n\
    is a tremendous potential for big data to reduce the environ-\nmental impacts,\
    \ mitigate desertification and sequester carbon\nemissions from the environment\
    \ in the country (Zhang and\nHuisingh 2018). Scholars from India contributed with\
    \ 15 pa-\npers, while Australians and researchers from the UK pub-\nlished 13\
    \ articles each.\n3.1.3 Publications by journals\nFigure 3 depicts the academic\

    \ discussion\nIn this section, we provide our answers to the research ques-\n\
    tion of the study. The analysis of the literature is guided by the\nframework\
    \ presented in Fig. 4. We decompose AFSCs into\ntwo main constructs: AFSC resources\
    \ and AFSC manage-\nment. These groups represent the application fields of big\
    \ data\nin the AFSC. Following several studies, soil and water are\nconsidered\
    \ to be the two most essential resources for agri-\nfood production (Jara-Rojas\
    \ et al. 2013; Sarangi et al. 2004;\nSarkar et al. 1995). The second cluster comprises\
    \ four para-\nmount activities in AFSCs, namely, crop/ plant management,\n1\n\

    \ man-\nagement. These sub-components emerge from the typical def-\ninition of\
    \ AFSC which covers a range of functions, including\ncrop and livestock production\
    \ (Munz et al. 2020). Moreover,\nwaste is a central concept in AFSCs and its effective\
    \ manage-\nment can increase the profitability levels of AFSC members\n(Otles\
    \ et al. 2015). Equally important is to consider traceabil-\nity management as\
    \ it concerns all the agri-food industry stake-\nholders, including final consumers\
    \ (Astill et al. 2020).\n4.1 Sustainable AFSC resources\n4.1.1 Soil\nSoil plays\
    \ a critical role in sustaining biodiversity and provid-\ning the necessary elements\
    \ for agricultural production, plant\ngrowth and survival, animal habitation,\
    \ environmental quali-\nty, and animal sequestration, which are a stepping stone\
    \ to-\nwards the achievement of the United Nations’ Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals\
    \ (SDGs) (Hou et al. 2020). Soil is consid-\nered to be the support and sustenance\
    \ of crops and forests, and\nrepresents a vital component of the ecosystem that\
    \ is affected\nby all agricultural production activities (Fernández-Getino\net\
    \ al. 2018). Given that the properties of soil have an impact\non the ecosystem,\
    \ environmental quality, climate change,\nAFSC sustainability and human health\
    \ (Hou et al. 2020), the\ndegradation of these properties can lead to the damage\
    \ of soil\nstructure and the quality of crops produced. Soil is a valuable\nand\
    \ non-renewable natural resource, thus, there is a need to\npreserve the fertility\
    \ of soil and improve its performance.\nSeveral scholars argue that big data has\
    \ the potential to\npromote more proper cultivation practices that are necessary\n\
    for maintaining soil fertility. For example, a recent study by\nHou et al. (2020)\
    \ points out that big data and machine learning\ntools facilitate the collection,\
    \ analysis and sharing of data re-\nlated to soil. With big data implementation,\
    \ it would be pos-\nsible to uncover hidden patterns from soil datasets and obtain\n\
    the necessary information for identifying soil conditions, such\nas nutrients,\
    \ pH levels and soil moisture (Finger et al. 2019;\nKolipaka 2020). The continuous\
    \ monitoring of soil fertility\nmeasures could provide more detailed insights\
    \ into the data\ncharacteristics of soil and support farmers in their crop yield\n\
    predictions and decisions (Rajeswari and Suthendran 2019).\nGarg et al. (2019)\
    \ employ big data along with machine learn-\ning methods to extract knowledge\
    \ from data. The authors\nargue that big data could help find out fertilizer recommenda-\n\
    tion classes on behalf of existing soil nutrition composition.\nMoreover, the\
    \ technology can automate all intelligent actions\nrequired to ensure decontaminated,\
    \ fertile and healthy soil. As\n9\n6\n4\n4\n3\n3\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\

    \ automation enabled by big data systems is useful\nfor farmers to control AFSC\
    \ processes through alerts and to\nmake evidence-based decisions (Coble et al.\
    \ 2018; Hou et al.\n2020; Chapman et al. 2018). The availability of big data is\n\
    crucial for soil analysis in order to achieve better knowledge\nregarding the\
    \ nutrient contents of soil and the appropriate\namount of fertilizers that can\
    \ be used, resulting in a more\nbalanced nutrient soil content and better agricultural\
    \ produc-\ntivity (Garg et al. 2019).\n4.1.2 Water\nWater is the vital natural\
    \ resource that determines the survival\nand development of the global inhabitants\
    \ (Cai et al. 2019).\nAccording to Zhang and Huisingh (2018), water is considered\n\
    the most essential ecological and environmental factor that\ncan control, alleviate,\
    \ and manage decertified lands. For\nAFSCs, water is regarded as the primary input\
    \ necessary for\ncultivation activities and animal farming. However, the expo-\n\
    nential growth of the world population, coupled with the ris-\ning living standards,\
    \ have led to an increase in the demand for\nAFSC products and the higher pressure\
    \ over water (Badia-\nMelis et al. 2018). On the global scale, industries are\
    \ encoun-\ntering constraints from water accessibility, which are caused\nby the\
    \ intensified urbanization and the expansion of agricul-\ntural activities (Capmourteres\
    \ et al. 2018; Fleming et al. 2018;\nKhanna et al. 2018). Therefore, aspects that\
    \ concern water\nscarcity or increased consumption (wastage) should be urgent-\n\
    ly reappraised. The modernization of AFSCs through the in-\ncorporation of big\
    \ data is a promising opportunity for address-\ning water sustainability issues.\
    \ Seminal research by Wolfert\net al. (2017) emphasizes the importance of big\
    \ data applica-\ntions in equipping farmers with the predictive capabilities nec-\n\
    essary for saving water while maximizing crop yields.\nBig data can increase water\
    \ use efficiency (Ciruela-\nLorenzo et al. 2020) for different decision-making\
    \ units in\nthe agri-food industry. Meanwhile, various big data- based\nclimate\
    \ models can serve to assess annual agricultural condi-\ntions, set annual agricultural\
    \ production plans, and ensure the\nefficient use of water and the prevention\
    \ of land degradation\n(Zhang and Huisingh 2018). The value of big data lies in\
    \ the\npotential to create prescriptive plans for AFSC actors and\nassist in water\
    \ audits and policy formulations (Weersink\net al. 2018). For instance, Weersink\
    \ et al. (2018) note that\nthe technological development associated with big data,\
    \ in-\ncluding the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors for monitoring\nwater pollution\
    \ of farms, can be useful to create predictive\nalgorithms that can cope with\
    \ the stochasticity of the environ-\nment. For water-stressed regions, these algorithms\
    \ can provide\nAFSCs players with specific information necessary for com-\nbatting\
    \ water shortages and maintaining the sustainability of\nwater systems. Furthermore,\
    \ the analysis of big data allows\nmonitoring the quality of water from the mass\
    \ data generated\nin real-time from various sources (Kamilaris 2018). As a re-\n\
    sult, this helps AFSC stakeholders to achieve accurate predic-\ntions of soil\
    \ water patterns, properly manage agricultural wa-\nter resources, and increase\
    \ crop yields (Cai et al. 2019). Most\nimportantly, big data is useful for evaluating\
    \ environmental\nrisks and increasing AFSC awareness for water issues. To\nillustrate,\
    \ Aqueduct is an interactive big data-based water-risk\ntool from the World Resources\
    \ Institute that can monitor and\nmeasure water risk anywhere in the globe using\
    \ various pa-\nrameters like water quantity and quality (Aqueduct 2019).\nTherefore,\
    \ the integration of big data in the AFSC can sub-\nstantially optimize water\
    \ consumption, minimize permanent\nloss of water (Reynolds et al. 2018), and overcome\
    \ issues of\nwater accessibility.\n4.2 Sustainable AFSC activities\n4.2.1 Crop/\
    \ plant management\nCrop management constitutes the art and science of control-\n\
    ling or directing crop production in order to ensure the deliv-\nery of safe food\
    \ products to society at reasonable costs to final\nconsumers and with a sufficient\
    \ margin of profit for the pro-\nducer (Wiese 1982). For the sustainability of\
    \ AFSCs, integrat-\ned crop management is a top priority for achieving sustainable\n\
    agriculture (Camin et al. 2010). This implies that agri-food\nfirms should set\
    \ efficient crop planning, with greater consid-\neration for quality standards,\
    \ appropriate crop varieties, and\nconsistent supply of food products. To sustain\
    \ crop manage-\nment practices, digitization has transformed AFSCs into\nsmarter\
    \ and data-driven processes. For instance, drones have\nbeen used to capture plant\
    \ growth data, optimize the quantity\nof nitrogen for the fertilization of crops,\
    \ whereas robots have\nsignificantly expanded farmers’ abilities to control vast\
    \ ex-\npanses of crops (Ciruela-Lorenzo et al. 2020). Besides these\ntechnologies,\
    \ the reliance on big data in AFSCs opens new\nprospects for farmers to effectively\
    \ obtain critical information\non crop cultivation and improve their productivity\
    \ (Carbonell\n2016; Li et al. 2011). The learnings obtained from big data are\n\
    conducive to effective crop management decisions, higher\noperational efficiencies,\
    \ cost reductions, and risk minimiza-\ntion (Gašová et al. 2017). Big data generated\
    \ from the IoT\nnot only helps to ease crop tracking, but also to ensure precise\n\
    dosage of crop pesticide sprays, thereby increasing the mar-\nketability of the\
    \ crop, farm returns, and environmental sustain-\nability (Dupaľ et al. 2019;\
    \ Marvin et al. 2017; Saiz-Rubio and\nRovira-Más 2020).\nThe tremendous generation\
    \ of data could potentially create\na gold mine of knowledge about plant performance\
    \ (e.g.,\nstress tolerance, nutritional quality, overall crop) in diverse\nclimatic\
    \ conditions, soils, and management regimes\n(Halewood et al. 2018). This data\
    \ variety and richness could\nembolden breeders and farmers to engage in crop\n\
    172\nJ. of Data, Inf. and Manag. (2021) 3:167–182\nimprovement programs, thereby\
    \ creating effective decision\nsupport tools (Finger et al. 2019; Chapman et al.\
    \ 2018;\nHalewood et al. 2018; Serazetdinova et al. 2019).\nEquivalently, big\
    \ data helps farmers to overcome the harmful\nissues related to improper crop\
    \ protection practices because\nthe technology could lead to valuable insights\
    \ into the effects\nof pesticides and other chemicals on crops (Carbonell 2016).\n\
    Zhang and Huisingh (2018) highlight that big data is a turning\npoint in pest\
    \ control, and research in this direction would\ncontribute to AFSC sustainability.\
    \ Li (2019) finds that the\nuptake of a crop cultivation system based on big data\
    \ could\nprovide farmers with timely information, which is necessary\nto improve\
    \ the economic efficiency of AFSCs and increase the\nadded value of science and\
    \ technology in the agri-food indus-\ntry. Coble et al. (2018) suggest that big\
    \ data plays prospective\nroles in addressing nutrient runoff concerns, which\
    \ are the\nprimary cause of the degradation of water quality. The authors\nfurther\
    \ note that the utilization of big data tools could signif-\nicantly substantiate\
    \ the value of the tools used to manage\nnutrient concerns through better evaluations,\
    \ policies, and\nmodelling of nutrient management strategies. Overall, big data\n\
    can be utilized in cropping systems to renovate management\npractices and foster\
    \ environmental sustainability through the\nminimization of negative impacts and\
    \ the creation of resilient\nAFSCs (Delgado et al. 2019).\n4.2.2 Animal management\n\
    The increasing intensification of animal farming has led to\nmany sustainability\
    \ challenges (Eisler et al. 2014; Steinfeld\net al. 2006) such as excessive pollution\
    \ and contamination\nof land, water, and air (Kamilaris 2018). Within the agri-\n\
    food sector, animal farming has the largest environmental\nfootprint (Steinfeld\
    \ et al. 2006). According to Gerber et al.\n(2013), livestock farming is responsible\
    \ for 14.5 % of GHG\nemissions produced by human activities, of which cattle farm-\n\
    ing for beef and dairy accounts for 1 per cent of emissions\ngenerated by the\
    \ sector, either from pasture-based or confine-\nment systems. To reduce the environmental\
    \ impacts of\nAFSCs, animal farming has shifted from traditional practices\ntowards\
    \ smart farming or precision agriculture (Sharma et al.\n2018; Kolipaka 2020).\
    \ Smart farming is conceptualized as the\ndevelopment that integrates information\
    \ and communication\ntechnology in the cyber-physical farm management cycle\n\
    (Wolfert et al. 2017). With the use of advanced technologies,\nfarmers would be\
    \ able to maximize their efficiency levels,\nwhile causing minimum disturbances\
    \ to the environment.\nOn this subject, Finger et al. (2019) and Weersink et al.\n\
    (2018) contend that big data constitutes a key enabler for\nsmart animal farming,\
    \ allowing farmers to manage the needs\nof individual animals in real-time. Tan\
    \ and Yin (2017) note\nthat big data systems can aid animal producers in producing\n\
    sufficient animal feed, optimizing the use of additives,\nreducing wastage, and\
    \ controlling pollution from animal pro-\nduction. Through the analysis of big\
    \ data, AFSC actors can\nobtain a large amount of data, which were not quantifiable\
    \ in\nthe past, to monitor their livestock and increase animal health\nand welfare\
    \ (Eastwood et al. 2019; Ramirez et al. 2019). Real-\ntime data that are generated\
    \ from smart sensors could be used\nto unlock higher value from animal farming\
    \ operations and\nassist AFSC partners in making data-driven decisions (Astill\n\
    et al. 2020). Additionally, the wealth of knowledge gained\nfrom the use of big\
    \ data opens the opportunities for the devel-\nopment of individual diagnostic\
    \ and herd-level management\ntools that are necessary for the detection of health\
    \ events and\nmonitoring of high-risk physiological periods, resulting in\nproduction\
    \ and animal health benefits (Pralle and White\n2020). For sustainability to be\
    \ achieved, AFSC actors can rely\non big data to derive actionable insights, ensure\
    \ increased\ncontrol over the ambient atmosphere of the farm, and maxi-\nmize\
    \ the economic return of their animal management opera-\ntions. Therefore, big\
    \ data could support precision livestock\nfarming practices by providing a variety\
    \ of farm generated\ndata and the necessary analytical tools for improving the\
    \ care\nand monitoring of livestock (Astill et al. 2020).\n4.2.3 Waste management\n\
    Agri-food waste is a broad concept that refers to any residue\ngenerated by agricultural\
    \ activities, such as food waste\nstreams like potato or citrus peels (Forster-Carneiro\
    \ et al.\n2013). Mishra and Singh (2018) estimate that approximately\none-third\
    \ of the food produced is discarded or lost, amounting\nto 1.3 billion tons per\
    \ year. The impact of waste on the envi-\nronmental performance of AFSCs is seriously\
    \ enormous as\nscholars argue that agri-food waste can produce large amounts\n\
    of toxins and stench gas, which pollute water and air (He et al.\n2012). Beyond\
    \ environmental concerns, Irani et al. (2018)\nemphasize that food waste is an\
    \ increasingly pressing societal\nissue that questions the fair distribution of\
    \ food products, the\nmethods of food production, and the reasons of food waste.\n\
    Therefore, AFSC players, ranging from farmers, wholesalers,\nlogistics services\
    \ providers, to food retailers should revisit\ntheir AFSC practices to minimize\
    \ agri-food waste and its en-\nsuing carbon emissions and social implications.\
    \ To provide\nsolutions for food waste, agri-food businesses can use big data\n\
    applications to limit food waste and decrease their carbon\nimpact (Mishra and\
    \ Singh 2018). The massive amount of\nAFSC data generated by the IoT can be analyzed\
    \ using data\nanalytics techniques to identify the sources of food waste in\n\
    the supply chain (Kamble et al. 2020) and support AFSC\nmanagers to reduce the\
    \ potential economic waste associated\nwith AFSC activities by making effective\
    \ decisions (Lioutas\net al. 2019). Because AFSC businesses are required to develop\n\
    proactive practices to support resource recovery from waste\n(Sgarbossa and Russo\
    \ 2017; Xia et al. 2016), they can use big\n173\nJ. of Data, Inf. and Manag. (2021)\
    \ 3:167–182\ndata to produce a reliable analysis of the extensive misuse of\n\
    AFSC resources and thereby reduce food waste (Kamble et al.\n2020). Furthermore,\
    \ by using big data, AFSCs can mitigate\nthe waste of production inputs, such\
    \ as soil, water, land, and\nfoster environmental sustainability.\nThe collaborative\
    \ capabilities of big data applications are a\nforemost step toward the acceleration\
    \ of effective waste man-\nagement and disposal solutions (Sharma et al. 2020).\
    \ In other\nwords, increasing collaboration with big data solutions can\noptimize\
    \ AFSCs, support effective food waste reduction\nstrategies, and prevent food\
    \ spoilage. Related to these\npoints, Mishra and Singh (2018) submit that AFSC\
    \ retailers\ncan leverage big data analytics to eliminate waste by utilizing\n\
    consumer complaints made in retail stores or rely on social\nmedia data. Likewise,\
    \ agri-food businesses can capitalize on\nbig data to mitigate potential resource\
    \ waste, even at every\npre-consumer phase. The role of big data to minimize AFSC\n\
    waste is emphasized by Singh et al. (2018) who develop a big\ndata cloud-computing\
    \ framework to assist farmers in measur-\ning their carbon footprint in a cost-effective\
    \ manner. While the\ncarbon footprint of food products generates substantial GHG\n\
    emissions every year, big data can be a promising solution for\nAFSCs to plan\
    \ and direct waste prevention initiatives.\n4.2.4 Traceability management\nFood\
    \ traceability is a central notion in AFSCs, and it refers to\nthe ability to\
    \ trace the history of a product and to identify the\norigin of a food product,\
    \ sources of all ingredients used and\ntheir location in the supply chain by means\
    \ of records (Opara\nand Mazaud 2001). As per Bosona and Gebresenbet (Bosona\n\
    and Gebresenbet 2013), traceability can be conceptualized as\nthe part of logistics\
    \ management that capture, store, and trans-\nmit appropriate information about\
    \ foods throughout all the\nstage of the AFSC in order to assure quality and safety.\n\
    From the AFSC sustainability perspective, the importance of\ntraceability is evident\
    \ since the primary goal of AFSC actors is\nto increase food safety and bring\
    \ other benefits to production\nsystems and supply chains (Giagnocavo et al. 2017).\
    \ The op-\nportunities of traceability involve the improvement of opera-\ntional\
    \ efficiencies and the increase of consumer trust and\nconfidence in the ethical\
    \ dimensions of values and processes\nin the AFSC. Recognizing that traceability\
    \ has a critical role in\nthe value chain of the AFSC products, Giagnocavo et\
    \ al.\n(2017) advocate that the use of new technologies can contrib-\nute to the\
    \ sustainable development of the agri-food industry.\nBased on such consideration,\
    \ advances in big data technolo-\ngies have the potential to redefine AFSC traceability,\
    \ allowing\nagri-food stakeholders to verify the environmental steward-\nship\
    \ traits across the AFSC from the farmer to the final con-\nsumer (Khanna et al.\
    \ 2018).\nBy integrating big data in AFSC traceability systems, agri-\nfood businesses\
    \ would be able to improve their process\ncontrol, optimize material use, and\
    \ manage production more\nefficiently. For example, in the grain market, Jakku\
    \ et al.\n(2019) suggest that big data applications could improve sup-\nply chain\
    \ traceability and create value for consumers, retailers,\nprocessors, and growers.\
    \ In the AFSC, the combination of big\ndata, the IoT, and blockchain is potentially\
    \ able to bring in-\ncreased levels of visibility, traceability, transparency,\
    \ authen-\nticity, and quality of food products (Kamble et al. 2020). The\nautomation\
    \ of data capture merged with big data analytics can\nsubstantially benefit food\
    \ traceability and turn AFSCs into\nconsumer-driven chains (Lioutas et al. 2019).\
    \ The adoption\nof sensor-based technologies and big data analytics permits\n\
    agri-food businesses to monitor their AFSCs carefully and\ntrace any contaminated\
    \ food products to their source. In turn,\nthis could also positively affect consumer\
    \ willingness to pay\nfor sustainable AFSC products (Khanna et al. 2018).\nTherefore,\
    \ big data radically transforms AFSCs and turns\nthem into data-driven supply\
    \ chains, supporting sustainable\ngoals, efficient information sharing, and effective\
    \ decision-\nmaking processes. All of these opportunities are echoed in\nthe study\
    \ of Kamble et al. (2020) who suggest that big data\ncould simplify traceability,\
    \ shorten AFSCs, and empower de-\nprived communities in the agri-food industry.\n\
    Overall, Fig. 5 presents a summary framework of the vast\npotentials of big data\
    \ applications for the development of sus-\ntainable AFSCs. The findings of the\
    \ review illustrate that the\nbenefits of big data for AFSCs span the three foundational\n\
    elements of sustainability. The practitioners can use the frame-\nwork developed\
    \ in the current study as it elucidates how big\ndata contributes to the overall\
    \ efficiency of AFSCs and alle-\nviates several challenges faced by the agri-food\
    \ industry, such\nas soil health, water misuse, and agri-food waste. The pro-\n\
    posed framework will guide the practitioners in deciding the\nappropriate AFSC\
    \ resources and AFSC management for im-\nproved sustainable performance.\n5 Discussions,\
    \ challenges and implications\n5.1 Discussions\nThe applications of big data are\
    \ used in a variety of sectors—\nthe agri-food industry is no exception. In general,\
    \ big data\ndenotes large data sets (generally built by integrating multiple\n\
    sources of related data) that can be analysed through informa-\ntion systems in\
    \ order to reveal patterns, trends, and associa-\ntions of value for a variety\
    \ of decision-making purposes. In\nthis study, we aim to review the extant literature\
    \ on the inter-\nsection of big data, AFSCs, and sustainability, and to provide\n\
    insight into how big data can improve the sustainable perfor-\nmance of AFSCs.\
    \ Typically, the unique contribution of big\ndata is to aggregate the vast amount\
    \ of data from farming\n174\nJ. of Data, Inf. and Manag. (2021) 3:167–182\noperations\
    \ to develop alternative management strategies for\ndesired outcomes. Consequently,\
    \ agri-food organizations can\nleverage the aggregated data to create sustainable\
    \ AFSCs,\nwhere they can enhance the marketability of their products\nand add\
    \ specified sustainable attributes in their supply chains\n(Kamble et al. 2020).\
    \ According to Delgado et al. (2019), big\ndata analysis will be one of the critical\
    \ tools that will acceler-\nate the development of sustainable systems. The authors\
    \ also\nargue that the challenges of the 21st century for AFSCs are to\nconserve\
    \ soil and water and to guarantee food security.\nTherefore, the sustainability\
    \ of AFSC is highly required due\nto the intensive nature of agriculture and the\
    \ rapidly changing\nclimate. Sustainable AFSCs can contribute, to some extent,\
    \ to\nthe reduction of environmental impacts and the pace of cli-\nmate change.\
    \ It is well noticed that AFSCs are at the initial\nstages of utilizing big data\
    \ tools to support farmers in achiev-\ning higher efficiencies and economic gains,\
    \ enhancing process\nvisibility, promoting trust and transparency, and reducing\
    \ en-\nvironmental footprint.\nFrom an AFSC sustainable perspective, both AFSC\
    \ re-\nsources and AFSC activities require proper handling and dis-\nposal especially\
    \ related to end-of-life treatments, such as\nlandfilling or incineration, which\
    \ have substantial impacts\non the environment. Likewise, disposal and the loss\
    \ of value\nof wasted food products are examples of direct economic im-\npacts.\
    \ In addition, sustainable AFSCs can have significant\nimpacts on food security\
    \ and poverty. Therefore, appropriate\nstrategies aiming at the realization of\
    \ AFSC sustainability,\nemissions prevention, and resources valorisation can help\n\
    avoid or mitigate the negative impacts of AFSCs. As argued\nby Östergren et al.\
    \ (2017), maintaining resource efficiency is a\nhigh priority, and policymakers\
    \ and different stakeholders\nshould seek more alternatives for production and\
    \ consumption\nactivities within AFSCs so that the balance between the envi-\n\
    ronmental, economic and social dimensions of sustainability\ncan be maintained.\n\
    5.2 Further challenges\nThe implementation of big data in the agri-food industry\
    \ helps\nto forge a pathway towards more sustainable AFSCs. In sev-\neral ways,\
    \ the use of big data can substantially benefit AFSC\nresources that are a determining\
    \ factor for the abilities of agri-\nfood businesses to deliver higher yields\
    \ at greater efficiencies\n(Ryan 2020). Although it is ascertained that big data\
    \ can assist\nfarmers in better managing their crops, livestock, agri-food\nwaste,\
    \ and traceability processes, several challenges still lay\nahead for the progress\
    \ towards big data-enabled AFSCs. For\ninstance, the poor quality of data and\
    \ its limited availability\ncould restrain the value of big data for AFSCs (Villa-\n\
    Henriksen et al. 2020). Analysts estimate that the cost of poor\ndata quality\
    \ within a typical firm could reach between 8 per\nFig. 5 Summary framework of\
    \ the potentials of big data for AFSC sustainability\n175\nJ. of Data, Inf. and\
    \ Manag. (2021) 3:167–182\ncent and 12 per cent of revenues (Sethuraman 2012).\n\
    Generally, AFSCs consist of farmers that are adopting tradi-\ntional farming practices,\
    \ instead of analysing data to make\nevidence-based decisions. The lack of information\
    \ infrastruc-\nture curtails agricultural production, operations of data analy-\n\
    sis, and forward-looking guidance (Guo and Wang 2019). In\nthe case of generating\
    \ large-scale agricultural data, Li et al.\n(2019) argue that AFSC stakeholders\
    \ would need to meet the\nanalytical needs for rapidly mining knowledge and informa-\n\
    tion and developing data warehousing capabilities.\nAs per Villa-Henriksen et\
    \ al. (2020), the introduction of big\ndata poses significant issues for data\
    \ analysis because of the\nincreasing complexity and heterogeneity of datasets.\
    \ This would\nfurthermore require the use of advanced data analytical tech-\n\
    niques and solutions to generate actionable insights in the\nAFSC. The transition\
    \ to big data-enabled AFSCs might expose\nsome actors to the risk of lacking the\
    \ basic mechanisms and\nabilities to symmetrically compete, afford the cost of\
    \ big data\nagriculture, and effectively use and analyse big data (Lioutas\nand\
    \ Charatsari 2020). The weak ICT infrastructure, the lack of\nresources, and the\
    \ shortage of skilled and experienced profes-\nsionals (Eastwood et al. 2019;\
    \ Kamilaris 2018; Lioutas and\nCharatsari 2020) might hinder the ability to use\
    \ big data for\nprecision livestock farming (Ramirez et al. 2019). To sustain\n\
    their operations, agri-food firms are compelled to hire highly\ntalented data\
    \ scientists (Wolfert et al. 2017) for the analysis and\nmanagement of AFSC data\
    \ (Kamble et al. 2020). As a result,\nagri-food businesses have to incur additional\
    \ costs and make\ninvestments (Reynolds et al. 2018) in order to modernize their\n\
    existing infrastructure and link data from a variety of on-farm\nsystems, equipment,\
    \ and records (Ramirez et al. 2019). The ab-\nsence of governance modes can be\
    \ a significant barrier to the\nimplementation of big data in the AFSC (Astill\
    \ et al. 2020).\nSpecifically, a more data-driven AFSC must be developed based\n\
    on data processing pipelines that could seamlessly use datasets\nwith easy access,\
    \ reusability, and interaction (Donohoe et al.\n2018). This is essential as proper\
    \ governance mechanisms\n(Rotz et al. 2019) are the key to AFSC sustainability\
    \ (Astill\net al. 2020; Eastwood et al. 2019; Costello and Ovando 2019).\nFurther,\
    \ the shift toward big data-enabled AFSCs is not an easy\ntask given that processes\
    \ and procedures for data governance,\nsecurity, and legal compliance have to\
    \ be developed so that data\nquality and integrity is ensured (Astill et al. 2020).\
    \ Therefore, the\ndevelopment of organizational, ethical, and legal arrangements\
    \ of\ndata sharing is imperative to facilitate collaboration between\nAFSC entities\
    \ and data scientists (van Evert et al. 2017).\n5.3 Implications\n5.3.1 Implications\
    \ for practitioners\nThe pressing need for increasing efficiencies and sustainability\
    \ has\naccelerated the digitization of AFSCs. The emergence of high-tech\ndata\
    \ innovations presents an opportunity for agri-food firms to\nrenovate their practices\
    \ and improve sustainability, efficiency,\nand competitiveness. In this study,\
    \ we examined the role of big\ndata to sustain AFSCs by a systematic analysis\
    \ of the retrieved\nliterature. Practically, the current research offers several\
    \ implica-\ntions. The practitioners can employ big data to strengthen the\nconservation\
    \ of their AFSC resources. For improving soil perfor-\nmance, agri-food practitioners\
    \ and scientists can rely on big data to\ngather enormous amounts of data related\
    \ to soil chemistry, condi-\ntions, and properties (e.g., humidity, temperature).\
    \ The collection\nof such data is beneficial for boosting AFSC digitization and\n\
    informing decisions on soil monitoring (Fernández-Getino et al.\n2018). In an\
    \ attempt to optimize their crop productivity, AFSC\npartners can use big data\
    \ to provide a favourable soil environment\nwhile protecting soil from further\
    \ damage and compaction. The\nconservation of water resources is a must, and agri-food\
    \ practi-\ntioners should consider water at the top of their sustainable devel-\n\
    opment agenda. To do so, the practitioners can be equipped with\nbig data to ensure\
    \ water accessibility, devise sustainable irrigation\npractices, and enhance water\
    \ quality.\nGaining insights into the use and value of water resources is\ncrucial\
    \ to inform investments in the water sector and optimize the\nallocation of water\
    \ and its pricing. Moreover, the review suggests\nthat big data is a key enabler\
    \ for successful crop/plant manage-\nment. Crop maximization is realized by the\
    \ efficient management\nof AFSC inputs, notably, soil and water. Big data solutions\
    \ can\nsubstantiate the utility of precision farming, thereby better\nresponding\
    \ to the field variability for crops and increasing food\nsupply. The AFSC practitioners\
    \ can take advantage of big data to\nameliorate the accuracy of their crop forecasts,\
    \ monitor the health\nand growth of crops, and ensure efficient handling of crops.\n\
    Here, the increase of food production is significant as it can lead\nto the reduction\
    \ of hunger, food security, and increase of the\noverall income of the population,\
    \ as highlighted by the World\nBank (World 2020). The analysis of data captured\
    \ by agriculture,\nthe IoT and smart sensors can generate actionable insights\
    \ that\nimprove farm productivity and profitability. It is furthermore\nevident\
    \ that the practitioners will consider the investment in big\ndata technologies\
    \ as a vehicle to foster AFSC sustainability,\nwhile achieving higher operational\
    \ efficiencies. Besides crop/\nplant management, big data provides tremendous\
    \ support and\nguidance to improve the management, monitoring, and control\nof\
    \ animals in the AFSC.\nThe availability of big data can bolster precision livestock\
    \ farm-\ning, making sure that farmed animals receive real-time care (Astill\n\
    et al. 2020). Hence, the practitioners will find value in acquiring\nthe data\
    \ necessary for minimizing the effects of animal diseases,\nstreamlining animal\
    \ feeding operations, and increasing animal\nwelfare. Without rigid monitoring\
    \ of livestock health, the agri-\nfood practitioners would incur substantial losses\
    \ arising from the\nlow productive capacity of livestock systems, death of animals,\n\
    and possible public health outbreaks. When it comes to waste\nmanagement, the\
    \ application of big data can enable agri-food\n176\nJ. of Data, Inf. and Manag.\
    \ (2021) 3:167–182\nbusinesses to mitigate wasteful practices, which may be caused\
    \ by\nthe unrealistically low prices of AFSC inputs (e.g., water, energy),\nsupply\
    \ chain opacity, or duplication of business processes.\nThoughtless AFSC practices\
    \ are destructive, of course, and the\npractitioners will be required to harness\
    \ big data capabilities to\nprompt actions that promote waste minimization and\
    \ seize further\nopportunities, such as enhancing AFSC processes, optimizing\n\
    profits, and achieving cost savings. The last thing to consider is\nAFSC traceability.\
    \ One of the primary reasons why AFSC man-\nagers should recognize the potential\
    \ of big data is its ability to\nachieve transparency (Wang et al. 2016), which\
    \ is in the view of\nSkilton and Robinson (2009), a necessity to ensure effective\
    \ trace-\nability and increase food quality and safety.\n5.3.2 Implications for\
    \ researchers and future research trends\nThe present study has several implications\
    \ for researchers.\nFirst of all, this study is different from past reviews (Wolfert\n\
    et al. 2017; Saiz-Rubio and Rovira-Más 2020; Kamilaris et al.\n2017) in that it\
    \ aims to study the potentials of big data for the\ndevelopment of sustainable\
    \ AFSCs. More precisely, the focus\nof the review has been narrowed down to the\
    \ intersection\nbetween big data, sustainability, and AFSCs. Informed by\nthe\
    \ findings of the review, we summarized the potentialities\nof big data in a comprehensive\
    \ framework that encapsulated\nthe major resources and activities of the AFSC.\
    \ Mapping the\nbenefits of big data in the framework can support researchers\n\
    to understand the application boundaries of big data for agri-\nfood sustainability.\
    \ It is important for researchers to be aware\nof the AFSC resources and activities\
    \ that can be sustained by\nbig data implementations. Throughout the review, we\
    \ noticed\nthe lack of studies clarifying the relationship between big data\n\
    and AFSC sustainability, therefore, bridging this knowledge\ngap is an urgent\
    \ need. It is also the primary contribution of this\nstudy to systematize big\
    \ data research from the perspective of\nAFSC and to unfold the conceptual development\
    \ of this field.\nThis study argues that big data can be a potential remedy to\n\
    the degradation of AFSC resources and a key enabler for the\nlong-term performance\
    \ of agri-food businesses. Thus, no so-\nlution should be expected to become a\
    \ long-term success if it\nis not compliant with the economic, social and environmental\n\
    dimensions. Consequently, the summary framework that we\nsuggested here yields\
    \ to a sharpened understanding and prag-\nmatic guidance for scholars to scrutinize\
    \ the following re-\nsearch gaps and address them in their future research. The\n\
    study contributes to the existing body of knowledge in the\nfollowing ways:\n\
    &\nThe what: through recognizing a distinctive part of critical\nexamination of\
    \ the big data that has been previously\noverlooked or restrained in the literature\
    \ such as:\n1.\nLess focus has been placed on the challenges of big\ndata-enabled\
    \ AFSCs within agri-food businesses.\nTherefore, future research should propose\
    \ feasible so-\nlutions to overcome the barriers hampering the effec-\ntive integration\
    \ of big data in AFSCs.\n2.\nPrevious studies suggest that big data could contrib-\n\
    ute to the conservation of soil and water for AFSC\nactivities. However, the potential\
    \ importance of big\ndata in the sustainable development of clean and\nenergy-efficient\
    \ agriculture was overlooked. The use\nof big data to produce accurate energy\
    \ estimations\nand predictions can increase the efficiencies of\nAFSCs. Investigating\
    \ best practices for energy saving\nin the agri-food industry constitutes a promising\
    \ re-\nsearch direction.\n3.\nThere is a lack of knowledge relating to the tech-\n\
    niques necessary to improve big data quality and re-\nduce the negative impact\
    \ of data inaccuracies within\nAFSC datasets. A likely first endeavour in this\
    \ regard\nis to purify data through fast model algorithms in\norder to generate\
    \ better analysis in AFSCs.\n&\nThe how: through emphasizing the integrative approach\n\
    rather than the linear nature of the process such as:\n4.\nResearchers should\
    \ seek to pin down potential behav-\nioural changes associated with big data\n\
    implementations to increase the resilience of AFSCs\nand also provide agri-food\
    \ industry policymakers\nwith insights and means to assess new and existing\n\
    AFSC policies.\n5.\nFrom a systems lens, a multi-disciplinary approach\nthat considers\
    \ the role of big data in developing effec-\ntive policies and stimulating decisions\
    \ that affect\nAFSC sustainability will add substantial value to big\ndata research\
    \ in the agri-food industry.\n6.\nFuture research needs to empirically investigate\
    \ the\nimpact of big data on AFSC collaboration, perfor-\nmance, and provide guidelines\
    \ on how to employ\nbig data for optimizing the efficiency of AFSC sys-\ntems.\
    \ The framework developed in this study may be\nuseful and inspiring for researchers\
    \ to derive compat-\nible constructs for the assessment of this impact and\nthe\
    \ formulation of guidance policy and practice.\n7.\nThe findings of the review\
    \ reveal that big data can\nencourage the wise management of AFSC re-\nsources\
    \ and facilitate the synergy between AFSC\nprocesses. Nevertheless, adequate and\
    \ efficient\nanalytical methods to leverage and integrate large\namounts of data\
    \ on soil quality, water, weather,\nland cultivation, and AFSC partners’ decisions\n\
    should be examined in order to devise develop-\nmental agendas for sustainable\
    \ agri-food industry,\nstrategies for environmentally sustainable land ex-\nploitation,\
    \ and efforts to understand the drivers of\nagri-food stakeholders’ behaviours.\n\
    177\nJ. of Data, Inf. and Manag. (2021) 3:167–182\n8.\nAnother interesting avenue\
    \ for future research is to\nstudy the impact of big data on not only the perfor-\n\
    mance of AFSCs but also the structure of agri-food\nbusinesses and the quality\
    \ of farm life. As indicated in\nour study, both AFSC resources (i.e., soil and\
    \ water)\nand activities (i.e., crop/ plant management, animal\nmanagement, waste\
    \ management, and traceability\nmanagement) are varyingly affected by IoT technol-\n\
    ogies utilized for data collection and the application\nof data analytics.\n9.\n\
    Researchers can reuse an extended version of our frame-\nwork analysing new conceptual\
    \ and application fields of\nbig data. This helps to advance big data research\
    \ in\nAFSCs and to cope with the expansive evolution of\ntechnologies in the agri-food\
    \ industry. Moreover, the\nelements of the proposed framework can be implement-\n\
    ed to develop a big data-based recommendation system\nto improve AFSC management.\n\
    &\nThe why: through identifying a new logic underlying the\nprocess that accommodates\
    \ for (a) the nature of data-\ndriven innovations, and (b) the confusing boundaries\
    \ be-\ntween big data teams and their users such as:\n10.\nAdditional studies\
    \ on the validation of the techno-\nlogical potentials of big data are necessary\
    \ to help\nscholars understand how exactly big data can\nstreamline AFSC processes.\n\
    11.\nThere is a need to develop advanced algorithms and\nmodels for enhancing\
    \ the prediction and forecast of\nweather conditions in order to deploy sustainable\n\
    irrigation measures effectively.\n12.\nFuture research can examine the role of\
    \ organiza-\ntional values in big data-supported AFSC designs,\nagri-food businesses,\
    \ and governance of big data.\n13.\nThe impact of institutional pressure on big\
    \ data\nadoption in AFSC remains unaddressed. Whether\nmarket-driven and non-government\
    \ incentives are\nunderlying motives for the uptake of big data in\nthe agri-food\
    \ industry is a knowledge gap that\nshould be closed.\n6 Conclusions\nThis study\
    \ used an SLR method in order to gain insight into\nthe current state-of-the-art\
    \ of big data research in the AFSC.\nThe sustainability of AFSCs has been identified\
    \ as an impor-\ntant and significant research field with a multi-disciplinary\n\
    nature. The upward trend in the number of publications in this\narea confirms\
    \ this tendency. The analysis of the literature\npointed toward the development\
    \ of a summary framework that\nencapsulates the potentials of big data for the\
    \ development of\nsustainable AFSCs. We also recommended 13 actionable fu-\nture\
    \ research directions.\nAlthough this is not the first time the environmental\
    \ im-\npacts of AFSCs have been studied, our proposed framework\ngoes beyond current\
    \ practices to improve sustainability, effi-\nciency, and competitiveness for\
    \ AFSCs. The framework is\nunderpinned by a multi-disciplinary approach balancing\
    \ agri-\ncultural and ecological issues and underscoring the power of\nbig data\
    \ to better understand the interdependency of AFSC\nresources and activities and\
    \ to rationalize the economic, so-\ncial, and environmental benefits of the technology.\
    \ This\nframework highlights the importance of big data for sustain-\nable AFSCs\
    \ and its ability to ensure food security and satisfy\nenvironmental goals. While\
    \ the environmental goals currently\nfocus on emissions mitigation, the framework\
    \ can be easily\nextended to consider other environmental factors. For exam-\n\
    ple, careful consideration should be laid on the impact of big\ndata on soil and\
    \ water resources in order to devise more com-\nprehensive strategies for sustainable\
    \ development. Full aware-\nness of the observed elements of the agro-food system,\
    \ includ-\ning climate, soil properties, and related agronomic parameters\nfor\
    \ each food variety and crops is required. Despite\npolicymakers’ interests, most\
    \ AFSC actors are currently more\nconcerned with costs than carbon footprints,\
    \ and incentive\nbarriers and technological constraints impede the implemen-\n\
    tation of mitigation options in the food sector (Smith et al.\n2007). However,\
    \ through the use of big data, this study sug-\ngests that it would be possible\
    \ to minimize the environmental\nimpacts generated throughout the different stages\
    \ of the\nAFSC. Indeed, another objective of this study is to promote\nmore sustainable\
    \ data-driven AFSCs.\nImportantly, the summary framework derived from the\nfindings\
    \ of the review provides a greater opportunity for re-\nsearchers to further explore\
    \ AFSC resources and activities that\ncan be sustained by big data implementations.\
    \ Although there\nis a lack of studies clarifying the relationship between big\
    \ data\nand AFSC sustainability, nevertheless, this study fills an im-\nportant\
    \ knowledge gap. Moreover, it helps to synthesize big\ndata research in sustainable\
    \ AFSCs and confirm the role of\nemerging technologies in making AFSC sustainability\
    \ a real-\nity and not an illusion. The potentials of big data integration in\n\
    AFSCs span disciplines as various as agronomy, manage-\nment, and environmental\
    \ engineering, thereby providing in-\nsight into the development of sustainable\
    \ AFSCs. From a\npractical perspective, the accountability of AFSC actors for\n\
    improved food safety can be realized through big data appli-\ncations and sound\
    \ AFSC practices. Moreover, agri-food orga-\nnizations need to develop big data\
    \ analytics capabilities and\ncapitalize on digitization to effectively build\
    \ competitive and\nsustainable AFSCs, which are much needed for achieving\ntriple-bottom-line\
    \ sustainability in the agri-food industry.\nDespite its scholarly contributions,\
    \ this study is not without\nlimitations. The use of Scopus as the sole database\
    \ for this\n178\nJ. of Data, Inf. and Manag. (2021) 3:167–182\nreview may not\
    \ help to capture all studies that are potentially\nrelevant to the scope of the\
    \ paper. Moreover, the review con-\nsidered only journal articles and omitted\
    \ other equally essen-\ntial sources of knowledge such as books, chapters, and\
    \ con-\nference papers. Finally, the findings of the review were guided\nby the\
    \ set of keywords used by the authors, and thus, they\nshould be validated with\
    \ empirical approaches such as expert\ninterviews and surveys.\nAcknowledgements\

    Share Abstract Building a more resilient food system for sustainable development
    and reducing uncertainty in global food markets both require concurrent and near-real-time
    and reliable crop information for decision making. Satellite-driven crop monitoring
    has become a main method to derive crop information at local, regional, and global
    scales by revealing the spatial and temporal dimensions of crop growth status
    and production. However, there is a lack of quantitative, objective, and robust
    methods to ensure the reliability of crop information, which reduces the applicability
    of crop monitoring and leads to uncertain and undesirable consequences. In this
    paper, we review recent progress in crop monitoring and identify the challenges
    and opportunities in future efforts. We find that satellite-derived metrics do
    not fully capture determinants of crop production and do not quantitatively interpret
    crop growth status; the latter can be advanced by integrating effective satellite-derived
    metrics and new onboard sensors. We have identified that ground data accessibility
    and the negative effects of knowledge-based analyses are two essential issues
    in crop monitoring that reduce the applicability of crop monitoring for decisions
    on food security. Crowdsourcing is one solution to overcome the restrictions of
    ground-truth data accessibility. We argue that user participation in the complete
    process of crop monitoring could improve the reliability of crop information.
    Encouraging users to obtain crop information from multiple sources could prevent
    unconscious biases. Finally, there is a need to avoid conflicts of interest in
    publishing publicly available crop information. crop monitoring, crop condition,

    EARTH SCIENCES INTRODUCTION The establishment of a more resilient food system
    for the realization of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals is reliant
    on various factors, including the collection of concurrent and near-real-time
    data for monitoring agricultural production conditions and infrastructures to
    allow rapid and accurate data processing [1,2]. Uncertainties in global food markets
    have dramatically increased recently due to the adversely changing climate, catastrophic
    events (such as droughts, floods, the COVID-19 pandemic, desert locusts, and regional
    conflicts), and increasingly strained global competition and trade. Therefore,
    it is critical to establish efficient and inclusive data collection and analysis
    systems to provide the necessary information for agricultural policy-making [2]
    and to maximize the impacts of policy interventions with limited resources. Furthermore,
    accurate, near-real-time information affects the entire agricultural production
    chain, and obtaining this information could enhance the capabilities of the importers
    and/or exporters of agricultural products in advance of negotiations, allowing
    them to better cope with the substantial fluctuations in global food prices that
    have become evident during the current food logistics disruption resulting from
    the COVID-19 pandemic and regional conflicts. Such information can also aid in
    improving farm management support for farmers, securing the informed hiring of
    seasonal employees, adjusting pricing schemes for traders or insurance companies,
    altering stock and logistics routes for suppliers, revising national food balance
    sheets to guide food imports and exports, and mobilizing food aid for humanitarian
    purposes [3]. Satellite remote sensing has become one of the major methods used
    for local, regional and global crop monitoring since the 1970s [4]. Here, the
    term ‘crop monitoring’ specifically refers to monitoring for staple crops rather
    than the general term of agricultural monitoring, which includes livestock, horticulture
    and aquaculture. In general, a typical crop monitoring activity consists of agroclimatic
    analyses, crop condition and stress monitoring, and crop production predictions,
    some systems also include food security assessments and thus an early warning
    of likely food insecurities. From the perspective of remote sensing, crop monitoring
    mainly focuses on crop growth status and ultimate production. Agro-climate analysis
    and food security assessment are the analysis of its causes and impacts. Currently,
    free access to medium- to high-resolution satellite data has generated new opportunities
    in the development of timely and all-weather satellite-driven crop monitoring
    capacities at high spatial and temporal resolutions [5,6]. Cloud-computing platforms,
    such as Amazon, Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Microsoft AI for Earth, have greatly
    enhanced the capabilities of satellite data processing and information extraction
    techniques, together with meteorological, soil and elevation information and other
    auxiliary data [7]. Thus, satellite data and processing capacities no longer serve
    as constraints in crop monitoring. Therefore, the focus of crop monitoring has
    shifted to developing new methods for retrieving crop information from satellite-derived
    data and establishing robust crop monitoring systems (CMSs) [6,8–10]. However,
    combinations of crops, locations, geographic extents and temporal dynamics make
    obtaining crop monitoring data streams a complex task. Most recently developed
    methods have failed to be implemented as operational activities (Table 1). In
    addition, nine CMSs with global and/or regional operational perspectives exist,
    but only a few have full functions. Most systems mainly target crop conditions
    and do not have crop yield or production prediction capabilities [8]. Few national
    CMSs are currently in full operation and publicly accessible globally. Most national
    CMSs still rely on traditional field surveys to derive crop acreage or to obtain
    average yield estimates with the support of remote sensing products such as land
    cover or crop data layer (CDL) [11]. Progress in crop monitoring has not fundamentally
    changed the methods of obtaining necessary information for agricultural policy-making
    or altered pathways by which agricultural statistics are derived, despite the
    sharp increase in the availability of Earth observation data [7] and the development
    of national EO programmes both in developed and developing countries. Table 1.Methods

    [6,12,13] reveal a substantial body of research on topics of crop mapping [14,15],
    crop condition assessments [16–18], crop yield predictions and forecasting [3,19,20],
    drought monitoring [21–23], CMSs [8,9] and precision agriculture [24,25]. They
    summarize popular topics in research and are dedicated to technical methods, but
    seldom discuss what has limited crop monitoring activities in providing reliable
    and actionable information in support of food security. Few raise the concern
    that the lack of reliable crop information poses a serious threat for decision
    making with respect to food security. Therefore, in this paper, we review recent
    developments in crop monitoring while mainly focusing on limitations in the operational
    capacities of these methods. Then, we discuss the consequences of these limitations
    and propose solutions for bridging some of these constraints to improve and strengthen
    the reliability and applicability of crop monitoring information in the context
    of food security decision making. DERIVING CROP CONDITIONS AND STRESS Temporal-spatial
    and qualitative information on crop conditions is critical to policy-making, preventing
    market disruption and speculation, thereby contributing to early warning of food
    security [26]. Such attributes are the main focus of crop monitoring (Table 1)
    [8,27]. Crop biophysical features are considered proxies of crop conditions. Multispectral
    vegetation indices (VIs) or metrics, which are relevant to the morphological,
    physiological and biophysical traits of crops, have been developed to describe
    the growth status of crops. These include the normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI), crop canopy cover, leaf area index (LAI), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically
    active radiation (fAPAR), aboveground biomass (AGB), net primary productivity
    (NPP), leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), canopy chlorophyll content (CCC), solar-induced
    chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), leaf equivalent water thickness (LEWT), crop water
    deficit, vegetation health index (VHI) and growth stage [28,29]. These metrics
    have been applied to assess crop growth status and the impacts of agroclimatic
    conditions, pests and diseases, water stress and management practices on crop
    growth and, hence, to support early warning systems. Sudden changes in abnormal
    weather conditions could result in stressed crops, and the negative impacts are
    complicated, intertwined and often associated with specific crops, growing stages,
    and genetic varieties. For instance, the significantly below-average wheat conditions
    observed in Central Europe in 2016 were mainly a result of insufficient PAR [43].
    Heat stress is critical, especially for wheat between the flowering and grain-filling
    stages, when the maximum temperatures exceed 32°C [44,45]. Frost damage and stress
    caused by low temperatures and/or cold waves are also commonly observed in winter
    crop cultivation regions after the jointing stage, although winter crops are more
    tolerant to low temperatures than are summer crops [46]. However, indicators and/or
    metrics are mainly applied for assessing crop conditions, stress and drought severity,
    which can then be used to infer variations in yield, area and production in qualitative
    categorized methods and criteria. These assessments fail to quantitatively convert
    indicators and/or metrics into crop growth status [47,48] and unmix the stresses
    and disturbances. Thus, further studies need to consider the intersystem consistency
    and community awareness that the comparability of crop information across CMSs
    is low due to different categorized criteria of crop conditions. Standard and
    quantitative methods for monitoring crop growth status and stress should be explored,
    which need to incorporate more biophysically and biochemically related VIs to
    investigate the causes of stress by abiotic factors such as floods [49] and drought
    [22] and/or biotic factors due to diseases and pests. To identify and explain
    what drives crop stress, the integration and synthetic analysis of multiple factors,
    including climatic (precipitation, temperature, radiation, etc.), environmental
    (soil moisture), biophysical (LAI) and biochemical (nitrogen content) variables,
    are needed. Hyperspectral data and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data in
    combination with optical data are promising in effectively improving the capability
    to output early warnings and discriminate the causes of regional crop stress [50]
    and the severity of the stress in terms of effects on final yield in a quantitative
    way. However, those satellites are currently unable to support operational requirements
    due to narrow swaths, large footprints or low resolutions. Limitations on monitoring
    crop conditions There are similar methods employed across global, regional and
    national CMSs for analysing crop conditions in near-real-time, most of which rely
    on maps of anomalies of metrics from the average values to investigate spatial
    variations, or on temporal development to reflect crop growth dynamics (Table
    1). These methods require a seamless and comparative historical archive of metrics
    and a real-time satellite data processing capacity to produce biophysical products
    using dedicated algorithms. The differences are then qualitatively interpreted
    as crop growth classes. There are three ways to present these metric differences:
    (1) an anomaly map at a specific date, indicating spatial variations and offering
    comparisons across large regions; (2) aggregated profiles of current and reference
    years to reflect the development of crops over the growing season for the specific
    spatial extent, as derived from the VI time series, showing the start, length,
    ascending and descending slope, and peak of crop greenness; and (3) spatial clustering
    maps in which pixels reflecting similar crop development conditions are grouped
    [31]. However, the differential method cannot provide reliable assessments due
    to a lack of standard categorized methods and criteria and may be biased due to
    shifts in crop phenology, crop rotations and other factors [29,51]. Aligning the
    time series VI curves according to the accumulated growing degree days based on
    the air temperature or the results of in-season crop growth modelling could thus
    avoid the occurrence of misleading information caused by crop phenology shifts
    and could suppress biased information and improve the overall crop condition monitoring
    performance [52]. The maximum vegetation condition index (VCIx) [31] over the
    crop growing season, for example, over a three-month period, can generate spatially
    consistent crop condition series by eliminating phenological impacts arising from
    large latitude spans. Additionally, the proportion of land that is cultivated
    with crops may vary greatly across different years, thus limiting the comparability
    of vegetation signals. The integration of cropped versus uncropped arable land
    ratios derived from high-spatial-resolution data and coarse-resolution VI time
    series could generate adjusted VI data and reduce the uncertainties caused by
    temporal crop rotation shifts and spatial shifts in the cropped area [29]. In
    terms of indicators, although many metrics could potentially be used or are already
    in use by some national, regional, or global CMSs, the most used variable is NDVI,
    which has a strong relationship with the crop AGB, leaf area, light interception,
    and yield and offers relatively simple operation and timeliness [9,53]. However,
    NDVI is insensitive to densely vegetated areas and sensitive to soil background
    variations. Nevertheless, the high NDVI values caused by excessive crop growth
    do not necessarily represent favourable conditions for crop production [26]. Other
    indicators such as EVI, LAI, AGB, NPP and fAPAR are rarely used due to their crop-specific
    uncertainties, complex processing methods and the need for ancillary and baseline
    data, although they have been verified to be less affected by signal saturation
    and highly effective for various crop conditions [54]. Alternatively, multiple
    indices can be combined to overcome the limitations of individual indices [31]
    and to take full advantage of multisource satellite data, including optical and
    synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, to develop temporally comparable crop condition
    indices for different phenological periods, thus reflecting the real crop conditions
    and alleviating signal saturation bias [55]. Identifying a proper baseline product
    and a suitable remote sensing product at a suitable spatial resolution could effectively
    reduce uncertainties in crop condition monitoring. For instance, as crop conditions
    vary significantly between irrigated and rainfed crops, especially during the
    dry seasons (and in dry-prone regions), these conditions can be monitored individually
    according to location-specific irrigation conditions [56]. The current crop condition
    monitoring methods still largely use low-resolution satellite data (with spatial
    resolutions ranging from 250 m to 1 km) [8,26]; these data often contain multiple
    crops in coarse pixels and can rarely indicate the conditions of individual crops,
    except in large parcels. The emerging availability of Sentinel-2–like satellite
    data makes medium- to high-resolution crop condition monitoring possible, though
    invariably with a vast amount of data processing, while high spatial-resolution
    data could also lead to other issues, such as geolocation mismatch and soil background
    impacts [57]. Users should be free to select appropriate spatial scale data for
    their specific monitoring targets. Limitations on detecting crop stress driven
    by drought Drought is the major natural disaster that causes the most extensive
    crop stress and yield losses [58], and drought assessments are incorporated in
    most CMSs as part of the crop condition component or individual component (Table
    1). A lack of precipitation combined with higher evaporation rates can propagate
    from a meteorological drought into an agricultural drought, leading to a reduction
    in crop yield or even to complete crop failures. In this regard, many drought
    indices have been developed for detecting meteorological droughts caused by climate
    variabilities, such as the standardized precipitation index (SPI), the standardized
    precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and the Palmer drought severity
    index (PDSI). Drought conditions directly affect the morphology, greenness, photosynthesis,
    biomass accumulation, and evapotranspiration of crops. Many vegetation-based agricultural
    drought indices have been developed, such as the vegetation condition index (VCI)
    and mean vegetation condition index (MVCI). Given that drought events cause soil
    moisture drying and land surface temperature (LST) changes, the temperature condition
    index (TCI) based on LSTs, soil moisture agricultural drought index (SMADI) [22,59],
    evaporative stress index (ESI) and hydrothermal weather index (HWI) have been
    proposed to determine agricultural drought conditions. The LST is a timely response
    indicator that can reflect crop stress before substantial visual symptoms arise
    [23]. The popular VHI is the combination of VCI and TCI reflecting both biophysical
    and environmental conditions. However, some of the indices developed for detecting
    drought compensate for the difference between meteorological drought and agricultural
    drought by incorporating climate variables, environmental variables and the vegetation
    status (Table 2). When monitoring a meteorological drought, indicators derived
    from climatic variables, such as SPI, are sufficient to reflect climatic anomalies.
    Adding variables such as soil moisture, which might be affected by anthropogenic
    anti-drought measures, reduces the effectiveness of using climate variables alone.
    An actual agricultural drought may not occur if agricultural practices are appropriately
    implemented to preserve soil water moisture in accordance with crop-specific water
    requirements, even after a severe meteorological drought. Therefore, agricultural
    drought indicators cannot be straightforwardly derived from climate variables
    or validated with climate variables; for example, it would be incorrect to use
    SPI-3 and/or SPEI-3 to verify agricultural drought indices. Table 2.Summary of

    Because drought is a recurrent phenomenon that is highly associated with climate
    variabilities [60], many indices involve the relative differences of indicators,
    such as the departure of the indicators from their long-term averages, to qualitatively
    reflect the impacts of drought; these indices include the precipitation condition
    index (PCI), soil moisture condition index (SMCI), VCI, TCI, and many other indices
    [61]. All of these indices are normalized over a given reference period. However,
    there is also a lack of any standardized method for converting the differential
    values of indices into drought severity information. Limitations on determining
    the impacts of nutrients, diseases and pests on crop stress If crop stress is
    not caused by adverse weather, it is likely to be caused by nutrient stress, diseases
    or pests. Nutrients have been reported as another stress factor after water stress
    at the global scale [70]. Inversion algorithms involving CCC or leaf nitrogen
    content (LNC) have been developed to detect nutrient stress in wheat and other
    crops [25]. Although many visible-band VIs have been developed to relate to chlorophyll
    or nitrogen content, red-edge bands, special bands located between the red and
    near-infrared bands, have been proven to be more sensitive to chlorophyll content
    [71]. The advantage of the red-edge band in detecting the nutrient status or chlorophyll
    content has been continuously demonstrated [72], but it is only effective for
    dense crops. Sentinel-2 satellites have three red-edge bands, making it possible
    to detect chlorophyll content using imagery from these satellites. Many metrics
    have been developed to identify types of diseases and pests, assess the corresponding
    infection severities, and map their distributions at the plot or regional scale
    [18]. However, prior knowledge is needed to identify the types of local disease/pest
    or other stresses that occur in the field. In areas for which prior knowledge
    is lacking, it is thus difficult to proactively achieve reliable and precise assessment
    [18], as a variety of signs and plant damage caused by crop diseases and pests
    can also be caused by other factors, such as nutrition deficiencies, thus leading
    to challenges when attempting to separate the actual stress factor. For instance,
    the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) is used not only for wheat yellow rust
    detection, but has also commonly been used to detect water stress, frost stress
    and damage, and nitrogen content and stress [73]. New indicators and metrics are
    needed to distinguish the various causes of stress and to quantify different severities.
    Nevertheless, hyperspectral data are more advanced in detecting leaf biochemical
    constituents or identifying abnormal spectral features affected by pests and diseases
    through spectral derivatives, continuous removal transformations and continuous
    wavelet transformations. The scattering from a leaf responds differently at different
    wavelengths to changes in leaf properties such as pigment concentration, other
    chemical constituents [74], or disturbances of pests or diseases. A blueshift
    was observed in the red-edge peak in the first derivative of rice plant spectral
    curves infested by rice leaf folder [75], as well as in the PRI for detecting
    wheat yellow rust [76] and the chlorophyll absorption ratio index (CARI) for wheat
    powdery mildew [77]. However, the low temporal resolution of satellite hyperspectral
    sensors due to narrow swaths makes it infeasible to implement them in operational
    activities. Therefore, the detection of nitrogen stress or the identification
    of crop diseases and pests are rarely implemented in operational crop monitoring.
    Alternatively, new sensors with narrow spectral bands, which are sensitive to
    nitrogen stress, diseases and pests, and wide swaths are expected to increase
    temporal resolution. FORECASTING CROP PRODUCTION Crop production is forecast with
    the support of crop area estimates and yield predictions for specific combinations
    of agro-ecological regions, administrative units and crop types. Crop type mapping
    and geostatistical methods are two categories of methods to derive crop area estimations,
    while crop type mapping not only provides data to estimate crop area, but also
    provides baseline data for crop condition assessment and yield prediction [31].
    Limitations on crop type mapping Most crop-mapping studies have been conducted
    in local areas with high dependence on field data and lack transferability to
    other regions [6]. Additionally, most methods rely heavily on local knowledge
    of management practices, phenology and prior knowledge of cropping patterns [14].
    Thus, crop area estimates are constrained by the spatial and temporal representativeness
    of the in situ data used for training the classifiers [10]. Although high-resolution
    satellite data provide rich spectral and textural information, crop mapping methods
    are relatively well developed only for local areas, with an overall accuracy (OA)
    of approximately 66%–94%, but with a lower accuracy of only 50%–79% at early growing
    stages, while mapping crops to a larger extent remains a challenge [10]. Accurate
    classification models calibrated for one region cannot be readily extrapolated
    to another region due to the location specificity of crop phenotype and phenology
    information or the differences in canopy-level spectral reflectance among different
    environments and management practices [5]. In addition, irregularities in the
    data acquisition time and cloud-cover conditions throughout the crop-growing season
    make it even more challenging to develop a universal crop-mapping method incorporating
    only optical remote sensing data. To overcome such limitations, a series of methods
    locally calibrated with in situ data collected in a crowdsourcing manner [78]
    by various partners across China and regional characteristics have been developed
    to identify staple crops, including winter wheat, canola, rice, soybean and maize,
    at 10-m resolution over the major agricultural production regions of China with
    a relatively high accuracy of up to 97% [79]. Methods for exploiting all-weather
    imaging SAR data to eliminate cloud impacts in optical data have increased in
    popularity in crop areas where these data are available. SAR has already been
    used to identify paddy rice fields [80]. The coupling of the interferometric and
    backscattering information of SAR data can significantly improve crop type mapping.
    The first 10-m–resolution crop type map based on the Copernicus Sentinel-1 and
    Sentinel-2 satellites was successfully produced for the entire European Union
    (EU) [81] and paddy rice of China [82], with respective OAs of 76% for 19 crop
    types and 90% for paddy rice, underpinning the operational delivery of in-season,
    high-resolution crop maps from the local scale to the global scale. The rice mapping
    algorithm was also extended to South and Southeast Asia, generating a 10-m–resolution
    paddy rice map for 2020 (Fig. 1). Figure 1. Open in new tabDownload slide a–d,
    paddy rice in Southeast and South Asia at 10 m resolution in 2020. Machine learning
    and deep learning techniques are widely used in crop mapping but achieve different
    performances, with OAs ranging from 70% to 99% [13,83]. More models, frames or
    complex architectures are expected to exploit the spectral and temporal dimensions
    of satellite data and fuse other features extracted by various methods to improve
    the overall performance. Therefore, the incorporation of multisensor data, satellite-derived
    crop phenology, and cropping practice information [83,84], as well as the application
    of both spatial (e.g. field-measured data) and historical data (e.g. crop rotation
    histories) [85] to deep learning methods, constitute major future directions that
    can lead to cloud services to ensure globally accurate crop mapping and area estimation
    results. Furthermore, transfer learning methods, in which a model pretrained on
    a large dataset could be easily fine-tuned to improve the prediction effect on
    the target dataset, must be further developed to improve the learning performance
    and reduce the reliance on in situ data, thus reducing the dependence on ground
    data collection efforts, which need to couple crop phenology and prior knowledge
    of cropping practices. When the crop type map is determined, the crop area can
    be estimated, as it is an intrinsic derivative from the map. However, the crop
    area cannot be estimated directly by counting pixels in crop maps, as the classification
    errors and resolution bias will directly affect the resulting crop area statistics.
    Resolution bias is unavoidable and depends on the spatial resolution and fragmentation
    of the agricultural landscape [86]. Pixels can cover small ponds, canals, and
    other noncrop features, thus resulting in resolution bias, particularly in mountainous
    areas. Thus, the actual crop area in a given region must be adjusted using an
    unbiased estimator by measuring the effects of the mixture of arable land pixels
    [87]. Such an unbiased estimator could be derived by overlapping high-resolution
    crop field delineation based on AI technologies and targeted arable land masks
    over selected sample plots (Table 3). Table 3.Unbiased estimator to adjust crop
    area estimation. Provinces of China Location Morphology Field size (ha) Unbiased

    in new tab Limitations on geostatistical methods Geostatistical methods to derive
    crop areas generally rely on field survey information based on area sampling frames
    with the support of satellite data products [88,89]. Early attempts obtained cropped
    areas by extrapolating selected subregion crop mapping to a larger region with
    statistical inference [4,89]. However, large uncertainties and time lags in crop
    mapping make these methods infeasible for crop area estimation. In contrast, cropped
    and noncropped arable lands can be easily separated or segmented using remote
    sensing due to the contrast signals of crops with respect to the land surface.
    Therefore, the crop-planting proportion, as estimated by segmenting cropped and
    noncropped areas from satellite data, and the crop type proportion, as estimated
    by transect sampling results, were multiplied by the arable land area to obtain
    the cropped areas with a relative error of approximately 4% at the crop strata,
    provincial and national levels [89]. Freely accessible, full-coverage public satellite
    data help to derive the crop-planting proportion during the growing season. This
    method to derive seasonal crop acreage estimations for regions with complex agricultural
    practices [89], while a crop type mapping method is applied over regions with
    homogeneous agricultural landscapes, was called CPTP in CropWatch [27]. However,
    both require field data to quantify the crop type proportions or to train the
    classification algorithms. A complete area estimation also requires skills in
    crop mapping, spatial sampling and a survey of the sample sites [33]. These requirements
    constitute the primary factor preventing many CMSs from containing crop area estimation
    components (Table 1). Limitations on predicting crop yield At present, four types
    of satellite-driven methods have been developed for predicting crop yields weeks
    or months ahead of harvest, including (a) statistical regression methods, (b)
    crop growth models, (c) biomass and harvest indices, and (d) machine learning
    methods (Fig. 2). Methods are calibrated and transformed into a final crop yield
    to forecast food production. Most food security programs use approaches that combine
    satellite data with agroclimate indices, which are calibrated and transformed
    into a final crop yield to predict food production. Figure 2. Open in new tabDownload
    slide Crop yield prediction methods. a, regression method; b, biomass and harvest
    index; c, crop growth model; d, data-driven models. Statistical regression methods
    use remote sensing VIs, metrics (the same as crop conditions) and/or weather variables
    that are specific to the targeted locations and time spans. Weather variables
    correlated well with crop yield in rainfed agricultural regions, as weather conditions
    drive crop growth and crop stresses [90]. However, it is clear that statistical
    models do not fully reflect plant stresses due to complicated soil–plant–atmosphere
    interactions and can only capture 67%–80% of yield variance [3,90]. Incorporation
    of VIs can improve the model ability, with an increase in the coefficient of determination
    (R2) of approximately 2%–10% [91]. However, VI saturation in dense crop canopies
    can lead to poor index performance when predicting crop yields [57]. The integration
    of optical and SAR data can help predict crop yields by reducing the saturation
    effects of VIs [92]. The VH and VV backscattering coefficients and VH:VV ratio
    of the SAR are related to the water content and geometric information of the crop
    canopy. The interferometric coherence and VH:VV ratio are sensitive to the canopy
    development of wheat [93]. The coherence SAR information coupled with the red-edge
    vegetation index also performs well for rice yield prediction at the heading stage
    [94]. The integration of weather variables, remote sensing-based VIs and other
    metrics, such as the SIF values from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment version
    2 (GOME-2), allowed more accurate crop yield prediction [95]. The Sentinel-2–based
    red-edge chlorophyll index combined with the soil-regulated vegetation index achieved
    optimal results in plot-scale yield prediction [54]. While the regression models
    are simple and straightforward, these models often require recalibration using
    new field measurements for new locations. Models using both remote sensing and
    weather data may suffer from collinearity issues among the exogenous input variables
    [3]. The accuracy of yield prediction increases with the development of the crop
    growth stage [90]. However, each new setup requires a proper validation step.
    In the future, more satellite data could be incorporated, but inevitably, this
    will create some collinearity issues and as such will need to be validated across
    temporal and spatial scales. Grain formation is mainly influenced by two factors:
    (1) the accumulation of aboveground dry matter, i.e. the crop biomass, and (2)
    the proportion of dry matter that is converted to grains, i.e. the crop harvest
    index [31]. The crop harvest index varies over time and among cultivars and is
    a determining factor in the yield formation process. Most VIs showed strong correlations
    with crop yields until anthesis or until peak biomass accumulation, after which
    their predictive power diminished [3], with reported R2 values in the range of
    0.69–0.79 for estimating the harvest index with remote sensing [96]. This finding
    suggests that the estimation of harvest indices from satellite data needs to be
    further explored. Crop growth models integrate remote sensing indicators and weather
    variables by data assimilation to better accommodate changes in the location,
    weather, and timing of satellite data. More specifically, models could capture
    crop growth patterns more accurately by incorporating time-sequential remotely
    sensed metrics [95] to generate the spatial distributions of crop yields [97].
    However, the strong uncertainty of canopy state variables and soil properties
    derived from satellite data significantly reduces the accuracy of crop yield prediction.
    In addition, only a limited number of remote sensing-derived variables, mostly
    crop emergence dates and LAI, have been incorporated into crop models, and these
    variables differ somewhat from the agronomic variables [6]. Pixel-based remote
    sensing-derived metrics such as the LAI are often average values of complex agricultural
    landscapes, but the LAI variable in a crop model assumes a homogeneous land surface.
    The complexity of crop physiological processes posed a difficulty to accurate
    simulation by crop growth models, resulting in great variations of the yield forecasting
    accuracy across the growing stages and regions, ranging from 0.3 to 0.97 [90,98,99],
    and hindered the crop model when scaling the results up for use in operational
    processes. One alternative is to train empirical models by correlating the model
    outputs and other variables, including remotely sensed metrics, with actual yields
    to improve their predictive power [100]; this would require the support of highly
    accurate ground observation data or production data at the administrative unit,
    but this still captures only approximately one-third of the field yield variation
    [101]. As many factors influence crop yields, machine learning and deep learning
    methods have recently been extensively explored to forecast crop yields [19,20].
    Machine learning or deep learning-based methods establish statistical relationships
    among VIs, weather variables, soil proportions and crop yields to predict crop
    yield [102]. The selection of statistical algorithms, feature engineering and
    data processing strategies exerts a strong impact on crop yield prediction ability.
    Random forests (RFs) [54], support vector machines (SVMs) [33], artificial neural
    networks (ANNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory
    (LSTM) [103] and deep neural networks (DNNs) are the most widely used algorithms,
    with R2 values between 0.15 and 0.78 [19,20]. Due to the diversity of the machine
    learning algorithms, models with climate data alone (R2 of 0.59–0.73) sometimes
    outperform models with VIs alone (R2 of 0.49–0.70) [104]. This suggests that the
    appropriate algorithms and feature engineering should be carefully compared and
    designed to improve the overall performance. Overall, the yield prediction component
    is the weakest component in crop monitoring due to large uncertainties. This also
    indicates that current models and/or VIs cannot fully comprehend the determinants
    of crop yields, especially under extreme climatic conditions [3]. For example,
    wheat yields in France declined significantly in 2016 due to unusual extreme climate
    conditions involving abnormally warm temperatures in late autumn 2015 and unusually
    wet conditions in the following spring; however, the MARS system in Europe failed
    to predict wheat yields correctly for this year [105]. This was mainly due to
    the inaccurate crop yield models for extreme climate conditions, as the observed
    extreme climate and environmental conditions had rarely occurred before. VI saturation
    also leads to poor performance of these indices when predicting yields, especially
    in dense or irrigated crop regions. In addition, the uncertainty of current crop
    growth models makes it difficult to scale these models up to facilitate operational
    yield predictions. CropWatch adopts averaged values of three yield models to reduce
    the uncertainty of yield prediction [31]. Furthermore, new sensors need to be
    explored for predicting crop yields, specifically from the perspective of geometric
    structures with simultaneous observations in the optical, SAR and thermal infrared
    bands in narrow spectra and multiview azimuth angles; this would allow the phenotypic
    characteristics related to the physiological processes of photocatalysts to be
    measured more accurately at the canopy, field and regional levels. CONSEQUENCES
    AND SOLUTIONS OF THE LIMITATIONS IN CROP MONITORING Limitations in current crop
    monitoring methods have been identified in the previous sections. Some limitations,
    including in situ data accessibility and knowledge-based analysis, might reduce
    the applicability of crop monitoring and lead to uncertain and undesirable consequences.
    Existing methods usually require new ground-truth data for each new setting to
    parameterize algorithms and models and assess their accuracies. The field sampling
    requirements prevent most global systems from obtaining crop area estimates and
    yield prediction components (Table 1), as collaboration with local institutions
    is required to conduct field work [26] and access to in situ data for training
    and calibrating algorithms and modelling outside national boundaries is still
    challenging. GEOGLAM has implemented an in situ data coordination strategy to
    leverage partner investments and to ensure that data are curated with a standard
    protocol. GEOGLAM embraces the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS)
    Data Sharing Principles that encourage full open sharing of data, including both
    EO data and in situ data, although open sharing of in situ data is still a challenge,
    as it sometimes involves privacy issues. Nevertheless, the GEOGLAM Joint Experiment
    for Crop Assessment and Monitoring (JECAM) initiative demonstrates a best practice
    method of data sharing to enhance the availability of in situ data through intercomparison
    projects or scientific data papers [10,106,107]. However, the ground-truth dataset
    is not yet fully publicly available due to restrictions imposed by the in situ
    providers. Moreover, in the foreseen future, it is unrealistic to expect the full
    sharing of ground-truth data with increasing trade tensions and strained global
    cooperation. Therefore, the requirement for ground-truth data in crop monitoring
    should encourage crop monitoring activities at the domestic and local levels.
    As in situ data collection is one of the major challenges for crop monitoring,
    closing the ground-truth data gaps and improving the data collection efficiency
    are essential for strengthening the reliability of crop monitoring. However, the
    acquisition of field data, especially at large scales, is time- and cost-consuming
    and labour-intensive. To address this issue, crowdsourcing might provide an alternative
    and efficient solution for acquiring field-based data [78]. Crowdsourcing information
    has become a widespread data acquisition method in environmental and resource
    monitoring [108], serving as a potential solution for closing the ground-truth
    data gaps. With the wide use of mobile phones, smartphone sensors, such as cameras,
    satellite positioning, and photoreceptors, have become major platforms for crowdsourcing
    information collection [109]. A mobile global positioning system (GPS)-video-geographic
    information systems (GIS) application (called a GVG app) can collect such data
    as crop types, planting dates, irrigation and expected yields with corresponding
    geolocation information [78]. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used
    to automatically identify crop types from Google Street photos or GVG photos (Fig.
    3) [78,110]. Figure 3. Open in new tabDownload slide Automatic crop type identification
    from geo-tagged photos using a deep learning algorithm. Data collection of the
    actual crop yield is not only labour-intensive and costly, but also difficult
    to be implemented efficiently. It relies on the grain harvest of samples in the
    field with uncertainties in both sampling and unavoidable grain losses during
    harvest. A new method for field yield data measurement involving AI and computer
    vision to count the numbers of spikes, seed numbers per spike and the sizes of
    seeds for weight determination (Fig. 4) is urgently needed for integration into
    GVG. Figure 4. Open in new tabDownload slide Framework for nondestructive yield
    data measurements. The reliability of crop information is essential, as such information
    serves as an important resource factor with significant economic value and consequences.
    There is a lack of transparent and standardized methods for synthesizing various
    information in crop monitoring to support decision making [47], thus affecting
    food prices [111]. Instead, knowledge-based analyses are mostly applied in crop
    monitoring activities, especially in the process of generating actionable reports.
    Analysts explore the indicators provided by the system and identify the indicators
    that best explain the actual crop growth and crop stress conditions. They then
    select robust methods to conduct accurate crop acreage estimates, yield predictions,
    and production forecasts for specific agroclimatic regions and publish the results
    in the form of regular bulletins. Therefore, analysts must specialize in the specific
    region for which they have expertise in regional agroclimatic conditions and management
    practices if they are to understand how the crop indicators generated by the system
    describe the actual yield variations in that region. In this case, the personal
    knowledge, views, or preferences of analysts all affect their working practices.
    To ensure the reliability of a synthesized crop monitoring report, it needs to
    follow a transparent and interactive process with respect to users. Although satellite
    images have neutral aesthetics because of their photogenic quality, their production
    and analysis have profound political [112] and economic implications. Crop monitoring
    of global/regional CMSs provides free access to crop information, but publicly
    released crop information corresponds with obvious business interests with significant
    economic value and consequences. Clearly, by establishing global and regional
    CMSs and releasing crop information regularly, hosts have ensured their dominant
    position in food export opportunities and enhanced their voices in global food
    security governance. Thus, there are concerns that these CMSs are more likely
    to fail to disseminate crop monitoring information that may be unfavourable to
    the hosts [112]. Additionally, it would be extremely difficult to question these
    reports without direct access to the algorithm code and the underlying data used
    to generate such information. Therefore, it is essential that potential conflicts
    of interest are avoided to maintain the integrity of unbiased crop information
    released by those global or regional crop monitoring activities. For example,
    crop monitoring should be conducted by an entity entirely independent of government
    or business bodies, or by an international agency. To mitigate these subjective
    effects, the GEOGLAM Crop Monitor performs a collective negotiation process to
    confirm the derived results by consulting local partners, but limits the involvement
    of analysts in the generation of the input data products. The international analysis
    team of CropWatch is facilitated through a platform that enables analysts who
    specialize in specific regions to call indicator data and thematic maps to assist
    in the analyses and work jointly to output bulletin chapters and sections. This
    participatory approach ensures the transparency of the analytical process and
    provides expert knowledge as a reference for the generated reports in supporting
    decision making for stakeholders. Alternatively, crop monitoring should be inclusive
    of users and provide user-driven services. All components and functions of CropWatch,
    including the self-calibration abilities of models and the collaborative analyses
    of indicators, were transferred to APIs in the CropWatch-Cloud, which enables
    users to carry out self-serviced crop monitoring by selecting their preferred
    indicators for the user''s area of interest. This allows users to complete crop
    monitoring independently and autonomously from the data download to the final
    synthesized analysis. For example, with the support of a customized CropWatch
    for Mozambique local conditions, officials in the Mozambique Ministry of Agriculture
    and Rural Development (MARD) who respond to crop monitoring and earlier warming
    can apply specific programming language environments to call APIs and organize
    processing workflows [1] and can also set up self-defined projects/systems for
    any areas of interest in their country by invoking the appropriate APIs. As users
    from MARD have defined the modules themselves, calibrated and used the tools,
    MARD enhances the capability and reliability of crop monitoring for Mozambique
    without additional investment in storage and computational resources. This effort
    was recognized as one of the best rural solutions in 2020 by the International
    Fund for Agricultural Development and one of the good practices in South–South
    and Triangular Cooperation for Sustainable Development. Furthermore, it would
    be better for users to obtain crop information from their own systems or from
    different sources to ensure the reliability and representativeness of information
    and to prevent unconscious biases. This is why, immediately after the global food
    crisis of 2008, the Group of Twenty (G20) Agriculture Ministers launched a crop
    monitoring initiative with international participation, i.e. GEOGLAM during the
    French G20 Presidency in 2011. The objectives of GEOGLAM were to increase market
    transparency, improve food security and stabilize commodity prices by producing
    and disseminating crop information and enhancing crop monitoring capacities. The
    dissemination of global or regional crop information from various hosts, including
    CropWatch (Table 1), increases the availability and transparency of food-related
    information by providing regularly released bulletins and reports. CONCLUSION
    Satellite-derived crop monitoring approaches have been utilized by various institutes
    and agencies to inform policymakers about issues related to crop production and
    food security, but they are still far from providing near-real-time, reliable
    and quantitative crop information, although satellite data and processing capacities
    are no longer constraints. In this paper, we reviewed the systematic progress
    made to date, the likely limitations, and the future development pathways and
    proposed potential solutions to address the existing issues in crop monitoring
    efforts. We have identified that in situ data accessibility and knowledge-based
    analysis of satellite-derived metrics are two essential issues that reduce the
    applicability of crop monitoring and lead to undesirable consequences. There is
    a need to explore satellite data to better capture determinants of crop production
    and to enhance analytical capacities in order to transform satellite-derived metrics
    to understandable and useful knowledge for stakeholders. In particular, there
    is a need to be concerned about conflicts of interest when publishing publicly
    available crop information. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors would like to thank Chris

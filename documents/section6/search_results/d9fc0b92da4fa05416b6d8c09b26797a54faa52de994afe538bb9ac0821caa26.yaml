    Keywords Metrics Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) has recently advanced
    from an experimental technology to what will become the backbone of future customer
    value for both product and service sector businesses. This underscores the cardinal
    role of IoT on the journey toward the fifth generation of wireless communication
    systems. IoT technologies augmented with intelligent and big data analytics are
    expected to rapidly change the landscape of myriads of application domains ranging
    from health care to smart cities and industrial automations. The emergence of
    multi-access edge computing (MEC) technology aims at extending cloud computing
    capabilities to the edge of the radio access network, hence providing real-time,
    high-bandwidth, low-latency access to radio network resources. IoT is identified
    as a key use case of MEC, given MEC''s ability to provide cloud platform and gateway
    services at the network edge. MEC will inspire the development of myriads of applications
    and services with demand for ultralow latency and high quality of service due
    to its dense geographical distribution and wide support for mobility. MEC is therefore
    an important enabler of IoT applications and services which require real-time
    operations. In this survey, we provide a holistic overview on the exploitation
    of MEC technology for the realization of IoT applications and their synergies.
    We further discuss the technical aspects of enabling MEC in IoT and provide some
    insight into various other integration technologies therein. Published in: IEEE

    The concept of IoT caught attention in 1999, by means of Auto-ID center at MIT
    and its relevant market investigation publications. Basically, IoT is an integration
    of multiple devices which communicate, sense and interact with their internal
    and external states through the embedded technology that IoT contain [1]. IoT
    has become the megatrend for next generation technologies which can impact the
    whole business spectrum with extended benefits which are advanced connectivity
    of end devices, system and services. IoT offers appropriate solutions for multiple
    applications such as smart health care, smart cities, security, retail, traffic
    congestion industrial control and agriculture [3]. A significant amount of work
    has been done regarding IoT technology in agricultural area to develop smart farming
    solutions [4]. IoT has brought a great revolution in agriculture environment by
    examining multiple complications and challenges in farming [5]. Now a days, with
    the advancement of technology it has been expected that by using IoT agriculturalists
    and technologists are finding out the solution of those problems which farmer
    are facing such as shortages of water, cost management and productivity issues
    [6], [7]. State-of-the-art IoT technologies have detected all these issues and
    provide solutions to increase productivity while lowering the cost. Efforts made
    on wireless sensors networks enable us to collect data from sensing devices and
    send it to the main servers [8]. Data collected through sensors gives information
    about different environmental condition to monitor the whole system properly.
    Monitoring the environmental conditions or crop productivity is not only the factor
    for the evaluation of crop but there are many other factors which effect the crops’
    productivity, e.g. field management, soil and crop monitoring, movement of an
    unwanted object, attacks of wild animals, and thefts etc. [9], [10]. Moreover,
    IoT provides a well-organized scheduling of restricted resources which makes sure
    that the best use of IoT enhances the productivity. Figure 1 shows a schematic
    diagram showing the agricultural trends which provide easy and cost effective
    interactions through a secure and unblemished connectivity across individual Greenhouse,
    Livestock, Farmer, and Field monitoring. Whereby, the IoT agricultural networks
    using the wireless devices enable real time crop and animal monitoring. The figure
    shows that two sensor kits (Libelium Smart Agriculture Xtreme IoT Vertical Kit
    and Crop/Plant Monitoring Sensor Kit) have been implemented which monitor the
    soil moisture, leaf wetness, temperature, humidity, productivity, and air flow.
    While, MooMonitor sensor monitors the animal health, fertility, feeding, ruminating
    and resting. The agricultural servers, gateways, and agriculture database play
    an important role to store agriculture records and provide on demand agricultural
    services to authorized users. FIGURE 1. Agricultural trends. Show All As a whole,
    in agriculture field there are multiple applications, protocols and prototypes.
    IoT agriculture research trends include network platform, network architecture,
    applications, security, and challenges among others [28]–[30]. Moreover, in many
    countries and organizations over globe different IoT policies and guidelines have
    been implemented in agriculture field. However in IoT agricultural environment
    a reasonable amount of work has been done and there is a need of thorough study
    on IoT in agriculture context to understand the current research status. To transform
    agriculture technologies via IoT innovation this paper analyzes various issues
    and trends in IoT smart farming. In this research as a contribution following
    IoT agricultural techniques have been added from literature: Present major components
    of IoT based smart farming along with relevant technologies in Section II. Section
    III presents a rigorous discussion on network architecture of IoT that involves
    network architecture and layers, network topologies used; and devices and protocols
    used in agriculture IoT. Different application domains and relevant smart phone
    and sensor based applications have been discussed in Section IV. The security
    and privacy issues in IoT based agriculture have been discussed in Section V.
    The industrial trends have been discussed in Section VI that provides the details
    related to top technology industries investing in this area. The IoT agricultural
    policies made by different countries for the standardization of IoT based agriculture
    have been discussed in Section VII. This section also presents few success stories
    in this area. Lastly, the open issues and challenges to improve IoT based agricultural
    technologies from many aspects have been presented in Section VIII. SECTION II.
    Major Components and Relevant Technologies for IoT Based Smart Farming A. Major
    Components of IoT Based Smart Farming IoT based smart farming consist of four
    major components as shown in Figure 2. FIGURE 2. Major components of IoT based
    smart farming. Show All These four major components are physical structure, data
    acquisition, data processing, and data analytics. The physical structure is the
    most important factor for precision agriculture to avoid any unwanted happening.
    Whole system is designed in such a way which controls the sensors, actuators,
    and devices. A sensor performs multiple tasks like soil sensing, temperature sensing,
    weather sensing, light sensing, and moisture sensing. Similarly devices perform
    many control functions like, node discovery, device identification and naming
    services etc. All these functions are performed by any device or sensor which
    is controlled through a microcontroller. This controlling operation is performed
    by any remote device or a computer which is connected through the Internet. Data
    Acquisition is further divided into two sub components namely: IoT data acquisition
    and standard data acquisition. Whereby, the IoT data acquisition component consists
    of seven protocols that are Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Websocket,
    Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Node, Constrained Application Protocol
    (CoAP), Data Distribution Service (DDS), and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
    Depending on the requirements and condition more protocols can be used for the
    implementation of smart farming. Whereas, in the standard data acquisition ZigBee,
    WIFI, Long Range Wide Area Network (LoraWan), SigFox and ISOBUS protocols have
    been used. Data processing consists of multiple features that are image or video
    processing, data loading, decision support system, and data mining as shown in
    Figure 2. According to the system requirements any feature may be added that may
    work in parallel to provide other services. Data analytics consists of two main
    features that are monitoring and controlling. Monitoring involves three main application
    in smart agriculture that are Live Stock Monitoring, Field Monitoring, and Green
    house Monitoring. IoT enables farmers to monitor livestock via multiple sensors
    which are used to monitor different animal’s diseases like temperature, heart
    rate, and digestion etc [11]. Whereas field monitoring applications intend to
    report different conditions of field like soil richness, temperature, humidity,
    gas, pressure (air pressure and water pressure), and crop disease monitoring [12],
    [13]. A smart greenhouse design eliminates the manual intervention and measures
    different climate parameters by intelligent IoT devices and sensors according
    to plants requirements [14]–[16]. B. Iotagricultural Relevant Technologies A Large
    number of technologies are being used in IoT agricultural solutions due to which
    it is hard to make an explicit of all those due to which our discussion focused
    on several core technologies which have played a vital role to modernize the IoT
    agricultural services. 1) Cloud and Edge Computing Collaboration of IoT and cloud
    computing in agriculture provides pervasive access to shared resources. To meet
    various agricultural needs upon request over network and execute operations cloud
    computing plays vital role [17]. Cloud based software architecture has been proposed
    which process and retrieve information and agricultural tasks in a more accurate
    way [18], [19]. In the field of IoT edge computing is considered as a solution
    to facilitate data processing at the source of data generation which are sensors,
    actuators and many other embedded devices. Edge computing or fog computing are
    measured as the backbone of cloud computing. This technology is deployed according
    to the features and requirements of smart farming [20]. 2) Big Data Analytics
    and Machine Learning Big data consist of a large amount of essential which are
    generated by agricultural sensors. Big data analysis provides different and efficient
    crop monitoring methods at different stages [21]. A good systematic review on
    big data analysis in agriculture has been presented [22]. Neural networks are
    very famous because they provide optimal solutions at a very high speed. Intrusion
    detection has been realized by using advance principles and technology of neural
    network. On the other hand most important feature of neural network is that they
    provide detection module and data training [23]. By using deep neural networks
    an IoT based hydroponic system has been developed [24]. 3) Communication Networks
    and Protocols IoT agricultural network consist of different kinds of long ranges
    and short ranges networks for communications. Several IoT networks technologies
    help to design a crop or field monitoring sensors and devices [25]. Communication
    protocols are the backbone of IoT agricultural network system and applications
    [26]. They are used to exchange all agricultural data or information over the
    network. 4) Robotics Multiple Agribots have been developed for the purpose of
    smart farming which are minimizing the amount of farmers by increasing the speed
    of work through advance techniques. Agribots performs elementary functions like
    weeding, spraying and sowing etc. All these robots are controlled by using IoT
    to increase the crop productivity and efficient resource utilization. A multi
    sensor robotics approach has been proposed for characterization and ground mapping
    [27]. SECTION III. IoT Agricultural Networks IoT agricultural network or IoT network
    for agriculture is one of the vital elements of IoT in agriculture. It helps to
    monitor agriculture data and facilitate the transmission and reception of agriculture
    data. As shown in Figure 3, the framework consists of IoT agricultural network
    architecture, IoT agricultural network platform and IoT agricultural network topologies
    and protocols. FIGURE 3. IoT agricultural network. Show All A. IoT Agricultural
    Neworkt Architecture The IoT agricultural network is the main factor of IoT in
    agriculture field [31]. IoT Agricultural network architecture suggests an outline
    for the specification of an IoT agricultural network physical elements as well
    as their working principles, and techniques. Most of the IoT applications usually
    follow the four layer architecture (Network Layer, Application layer, Physical
    and Mac Layer and Transport Layer) due to the popularity and interoperability
    of IP as suggested by Naik [32]. After reviewing these four layers protocol we
    have also survey two more approaches that are IPv6 and 6LoWPAN as shown in Figure
    4. This layer is the final level of abstraction which allows the development of
    multiple user applications. At this layer deployed communication protocols monitor
    different agricultural parameters such as weather information, soil moisture values,
    irrigation monitoring etc. FIGURE 4. Layer structure of the 6LoWPAN. Show All
    1) Application Layer Due to the energy constraints and stringent computation involved
    by the IoT devices there are many lightweight protocols on application layer such
    as CoAP, MQTT, AMQP, and HTTP. These protocols can be increased or decreased according
    to the system requirement. CoAP protocol runs on UDP and works on the principle
    of request or response architecture [33]. AMQP protocol runs over the TCP protocol
    by following publish/subscribe architecture asynchronously and use TSL/SSL for
    security assurance. MQTT is a bandwidth-efficient protocol which uses little battery
    power and designed for receiving and transmitting sensor information [34]. HTTP
    is a well known web messaging protocol which based on the request/response architecture
    [35]. Runs over TCP and does not define any QoS, uses TSL/SSL for security purpose.
    2) Transport Layer This layer is also called host to host transport layer, and
    is directly transferred from IP to IoT domain. The main task of network layer
    is to collect and encapsulate the agricultural information which is obtained through
    sensor layer. There are two protocols that are transmission control protocol (TCP)
    and user datagram protocol (UDP). TCP is a connection oriented protocol which
    ensures the reliability of delivered data. TCP data transmission speed is low
    as compare to UDP. UDP is a connection less protocol which does not ensure reliability
    of data. Its data transmission speed is high as compared to TCP. Both of these
    protocols are used in different applications because their choices depend upon
    the requirements of application. 3) Network Layer This layer is an indispensable
    technology for precision farming and responsible to transmit agricultural information
    at application layer. IP is the major choice with the existing two versions that
    are IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 came into existence due to increasing the large number
    of addressable devices. Whereas, invention of IPv6 was expected which gradually
    establish on all networking devices. Routing protocol for Low Power and Lossy
    Networks (RPL) is considered as the main protocol while applying routing on 6LoWPAN
    [36]. RPL consist of distance vector routing protocol which uses Destination Oriented
    Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAG) to specify routes. To support different flows
    of traffic RPL modify itself according to network speed and acknowledge routing
    metrics such as status of the battery used in device, link quality, and higher
    computational cost exchange. 4) Adaptation Layer Adaptation Layer (AL) aim is
    to ensure the interoperability, and implement fragmentation, compression and reassembly
    mechanism. Although AL attained many advances but still there is a complexity
    for IPv6 supporting because its direct use on IoT devices is not considered reasonable.
    Usually clashes were seen with constraints which are associated with IoT devices.
    That’s why, 6LoWPAN made a big effort in order to decrease the limitations of
    IPv6 and make it suitable for IoT devices. Sensors and devices use IPv6 and 6LoWPAN
    to transmit data over IEEE 802.15.4 protocol in IoT agricultural network. 5) Physical
    and Mac Layers This is the bottom most layer in agriculture network archichture
    which is responsible to sense and actuate different agricultural parametrs. Within
    physical and MAC layer IEEE 802.15.4 is one of the most popular standard which
    was designed for low cost, low consumption and low complexity [37]. This standard
    was adopted by many protocols like Wireless HART, ZigBee and ISA100. IEEE802.15.4
    mainly operates in ISM band of 2.4 GHz. Furthermore, it also operate 915 MHz (in
    United Nations of American) 868 MHz (in European countries) and supports up to
    250 kbps data rates. However literature shows some significant limitation of later
    approaches, which are regarding to mobility and network formation [38]. EPC-Global
    (designed for RFID technologies) [39] and Z-wave (particularly designed for domotics)
    [40] have also been used as alternative of IEEE 802.15.4 to exchange information
    directly from internt protocol (IP). B. IoT Agricultural Network Platform IoT
    agricultural network platform refers to both the big data analytics model and
    cloud model. 1) Big Data Analytics Big data analysis applied to find out the required
    and meaningful information from the large amount of data from different data formates.
    The crop disease control and crop growth models build on the basis of farm data.
    Big data analysis also provides decision support services to farmers for crop
    productivity and optimal cost analysis. Figure 5 shows IoT agricultural network
    platform based on big data analytics. The proposed network platform consists of
    six components namely: i) Farmer/User experience, ii) Big Data analysis, iii)
    Sensing and monitoring, iv) Storage services, v) Communication protocols, and
    vi) Physical implementations. This platform provides access to the IoT backbone,
    and helps collecting information about soil fertility, weather conditioning, moisturization,
    and online crop monitoring etc. FIGURE 5. IoT agricultural network platform based
    on big data analysis. Show All a: Farmer Experience Farmer experience layer is
    designed to help the farmers to monitor crop productivity in multiple ways such
    as, for effective growth of crops farmers are awared by identifying the appropriateness
    of fertile selection. Climate conditions, crops growth conditions, soil quality,
    or cattle health monitoring helps the farmers to track the state of their business
    and mitigate the lower production risks. b: Predictive Analysis This analysis
    makes the whole environment smarter by the combination of smart farming market
    intelligence and IoT technology. The major task of predictive analysis is to analyze,
    explore and process the agricultural information for digital awareness. Predictive
    analysis is made to check the probabilistic chance of crop productivity up to
    the next season. Here different detecting devices are applied to check the, Crop
    disease, weather conditions, and estimate the profit/loss on the basis of crop
    productivity. Predictive analysis facilitates the farm to understand the optimal
    time for planting & harvesting and various farm management techniques. c: Multicultural
    Analysis Elaborates the multiple forms of agriculture. In this analysis big data
    analysis minimize the risk of crop destruction according to scientific ways. To
    enhance the growth rate of water featured Botanic Aquaculture layer is equipped
    with big data. Other multicultural techniques like Citriculture, Horticulture
    and Floriculture avail direct benefits when enabled with big data analysis. It
    is helpful for decision making related to crop or plants seasonal growth, and
    pest control. Vermiculture is used for the cultivation of earthworms. Arboriculture
    is basically used for the cultivation of woody plants. Olericulture is an application
    which is used for the prediction and measure the growth rate of different vegetables.
    d: Sensing and Monitoring Sensing and monitoring analysis is made by applying
    different sensing and monitoring devices. Sensors sense data and store the crop
    disease information. Data which is processed through multiple resources is automatically
    achieved by sensing layer. Ststistical analysis has been made on data received
    from sensors in order to actuate the disease. Farmers obtain necessary information
    such as ph value, temperature, soil moisture and humidity through web and message
    service. Real time image and video monitoring on data helps the farmer to gat
    timely and accurate information. e: Communication Protocols Communication protocols
    collect and encapsulate agricultural data. To process and transmit data by using
    these protocols have been considered as the nerve center of IoT in agriculture.
    These protocols consist of internet related technologies like WIFI, LoraWan and
    Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technologies. ZigBee is considered as the
    main enabler for communication over long distances when third party service providers
    such as Long-Term Evolution (LTE), CDMA or Global System for Mobile (GSM) are
    not available. f: Storage Services Farmers’ store crop related information to
    make better analysis in future and use stored information in multiple seasons
    for more productivity. g: Physical Implementations Multiple sensors, different
    types of actuators and microcontrollers are implemented physically to monitore
    different agricultural applications. Many other network equipments also implemented
    at physical layer like switches, routers and gateways are included. At this layer
    whole environmental conditions are sensed and then actuate according to a predefined
    instructions. Microcontroller plays the supervisor role and performs networking
    related operations and some other functionality which are done by sensors and
    actuators. An IoT based functional frame work is shown in figure 6. The functional
    framework shows that how agriculturists and farmers can access multiple databases
    with the assistance of support layer from application layer. Business layer contains
    all necessary operation which are important for any IoT farm. Data acquisition
    layer provides connection with session layer through IoT protocols like MQTT,
    AMQP and COAP etc. FIGURE 6. Functional framework for an agricultural information
    service model. Show All 2) Cloud Infrastructure Cloud provides a large amount
    of storage through large virtualized servers which are connected together to perform
    necessary action. A cloud based IoT design has been presented in [41] for precision
    farming. In which IoT techniques are applied to analyze and manage data from farms
    through sensors and devices to generate information for decision making. Design
    recommendations for IoT agricultural network on the basis of Cloud is shown in
    Figure 7. FIGURE 7. IoT agricultural network platform based on cloud. Show All
    Platform has been proposed on the basis of four layers which are Cloud Storage,
    Gateway, Fog Computing and hardware modules. Cloud storage layer centerlized the
    all agricultural related data such as weather related, soil, fertilization, crop
    and agricultural marketing in the cloud and provides on demand resources through
    networked infrastructure. Analyics resources and web services are also installed
    on cloud or internet which are accessible by cloud services. Most of the devices
    or sensors are not designed in such a way which can connect with internet for
    the purpose of data sharing. To resolve this data sharing problem local gateways
    are designed which act as bridge between all hardware devices and sensors for
    connectivity, security and controllability. Implementation of gateway in greenhouse
    or field improves the ability of automation and control the real time greenhouse
    monitoring system. Hardware modules and cloud services are distributed whereas
    resources are integrated through fog computing. Fog computing reduces the computational
    load of cloud and ensures the real time processing. Basic purpose of fog computing
    in this proposed network platform is to leverage the on demand scalability of
    cloud computing resources by taking the advantage of both cloud and edge computing.
    In hardware modules multiple actuators, sensors, microcontrollers and central
    processing unit have been implemented to monitor and sense various agricultural
    variables. Hardware modules are distributed in global or local networks and used
    to create services or processes. For the implementation of smart farming fast
    response time and capability to exchange information is necessary. Both of these
    requirements (fast response time and capability to exchange information) are fulfilled
    by two protocols that are Representational State Transfer (REST) and Message Queuing
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT). Instead of using big data center distributed system
    is more effective for smart farming because it breaks up large computation into
    easy and smaller tasks like: Crop, Temperature, nutrients, energy, climate, moisture
    of soil etc. C. IoT Agricultural Network Topology and Protocols IoT agricultural
    network topology shows the arrangement of multiple elements of an IoT Agricultural
    network and represents an ideal scenario for smart farming. Figure 8 described
    how heterogeneous computing grid collects necessary sensor data by using multiple
    sensing devices such as moisture sensor, humidity sensor, temperature sensor,
    gas sensor, ph sensor, ultra violet sensor etc and forms an IoT agricultural network
    topology. FIGURE 8. Conceptual illustration of IoT-based ubiquitous agricultural
    solutions. Show All This ubiquitous Agricultural solution transforms the storage
    capacity of multiple electronic devices like Smartphone, Laptops, and agricultural
    terminals into hybrid computing grids. Figure 9 visualize a scenario in which
    multiple crop parameters are monitored by implementing agricultural devices and
    sensors in all over the field. FIGURE 9. Farm remote monitoring in agriculture.
    Show All Sensed data is then analyzed and stored, and stored data from multiple
    sensors and devices becomes useful for aggregation. On the basis of aggregation
    and analysis agriculturists/farmer can monitor the different crop variables in
    all over the field from anywhere. Moreover, topology consists of a proper network
    configuration for the streaming of agricultural videos. For example figure 9 support
    the streaming of pests via an interconnected network with an internet protocol
    (IP), GSM, WiMAX and access service network gateway. 1) Low Power WSN Topology
    Figure 10 shows a topology in which low power wireless sensor network has been
    designed to monitor and control the various farming factors. In this topology
    ZigBee is being used for data transmission which consists of multiple end devices
    and router to propagate the information on larger distances. End devices which
    are scattered in the field consist of different kind of sensors such as temperature,
    gas, humidity, soil, Motion detector, PH, UV, PIR sensors and a microcontroller.
    FIGURE 10. Low power WSN topology. Show All End devices are directly connected
    to the router and controller, where controller communicates with base station
    by using serial port to analyze the received information. According to software
    monitoring perspective each end device is properly initialized and attached sensors
    are activated in an appropriate way. Once the sensors are activated then each
    device follows the router to connect in the same way according to which they have
    been designed. After confirmation end device may connect to the WSN by using identical
    key. Data which is collected through sensors is send to the base station which
    takes analysis on received data. When the sensors attached with end devices are
    being read then data is transmitted via ZigBee to the Controller or router. Major
    advantage of this net topology is its bi-directional communication by using ZigBee.
    2) IoT Protocols for Agriculture There are many IoT communication protocols which
    are widely used in agriculture for the purpose of smart farming. By using these
    protocols farmers can communicate in a more convenient way and make more efficient
    decisions for smart farming to enhance and monitor the growth of crop. Most common
    wireless protocols which are being used named: IEEE 802.11 WIFI, 2G/3G/4 G-Mobile
    Communications Standards, LoraWan, WiMax, Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks,
    Bluetooth, RFID, and ZigBee. Comparison of all these wireless protocols is given
    in Table 1. TABLE 1 Comparison of Existing Wireless Protocols a: IEEE 802.11 WiFi
    IEEE 802.11 is a compilation of communication standards Wireless Local Area Network
    that is 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n and 802.11ac. All these standards operate
    in different bandwidths that are 5 GHz, 2.2GHz, 2.4/5 GHz, 60 GHz and 5 GHz. Data
    transfer range of these standards is from 1Mb/s to 7 Gb/s. Its communication range
    is from 20 m to 100 m [42]. A wifi based wireless sensor network in IoT has been
    discussed for smart agriculture [43]. b: LoraWan LoraWan is a long range communication
    protocol which is developed by an open and non-profit association namely Lora
    TM Alliance. The main purpose of this LoraWan protocol is to assure the interoperability
    between multiple operators [44]. To improve agricultural productivity and anticipate
    the problems a framework has been presented in [45] whose component based on Lora
    and ARIMA technology. c: WiMax Data transfer range of Worldwide Interoperability
    for microwave access is from 1.5 Mb/s to 1 Gb/s. But now a days with the advancement
    of technology data transfer rate has been changed [46]. WiMax provides broadband
    multi access connectivity that includes fixed, portable, nomadic and mobile communication
    through wired or wireless connectivity. Both WiFi and WiMax technologies have
    been deployed in Ministry of Food and Agriculture, Ghana (MOFA) which enables
    user to connect either WiMax networks or building Wifi [47]. d: 2G/3G/4G-Mobile
    Communications Standards There are multiple generations of Mobile Communication
    Standards consist of Second Generation, Third Generation, and Fourth Generation.
    IoT devices Communicate by using these standards over cellular networks. Through
    the use of mobile communication farmer can detect temporal variability across
    their fiels and monitor crop yield, soil and climate conditions [48]. e: LR-WPAN
    Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks figure out the specification of high
    level communication standards like ZigBee. Data transfer rate of LR-WPAN consist
    of 40 Kb/s-250 Kb/s. The major property of this standard is that it provides low
    speed and low cost communication services [49]. LR-WPAN is mostly used for indoor
    agriculture such as home garden or in small farms. f: RFID RFID works on the principal
    by assigning a unique number individually to each object in order to record information.
    RFID consists of readers, host and tags where tags receive and transmit radio
    waves due to which it is also known as responder. RFI tags consist of active tags
    and passive tags which are available in different sizes and shapes. Passive tag
    is more advantageous as compare to active tag because it is cheap than active
    tags. Tags have unique ID number and environmental information such as moisture
    level, temperature condition, and humidity etc. These tags are embedded and attached
    in multiple objects to identify that object. g: ZigBee ZigBee is on the top of
    IEEE 802 standards created by ZigBee Alliance. It is a set of specifications for
    device to device network having low power data rates. With the advancement of
    technology and increasing the demand of throughput there is a need of faster and
    low power consumption technology. These requirements are fulfilled by more established
    technologies which provides faster data transfer. In agriculture environment IoT
    sensors sense the data and transfer it towards remote server. After sensing, collected
    data is analyzd for decisions making [50]. h: MQTT MQTT is a messaging protocol
    in IoT which is mainly designed for remote connections. It’s a bandwidth efficient
    protocol and uses little battery power. MQTT is used for continuous analysis and
    deploy a smart system for agriculture sector. A low cost web based IoT solution
    has been presented by using MQTT for monitoring, tracking and analyzing agricultural
    data and collect knowledge from field ambience and improve environmental conditions
    [51]. By using MQTT a low cost irrigation system has been proposed for receiving
    and transmitting sensor information [52]. i: SigFox It’s a low data rate and an
    ultra narrowband wireless cellular network which is appropriate for IoT and machine
    type communications [53]. To construct a geo location system SigFox network was
    used which localize animals pasture of the whole summer [54]. System proposed
    in [55] helps the farmers to locate their cattle’s position and increase their
    productivity. j: Bluetooth Bluetooth is a low power and low range Personal Area
    Network which is best for short range mobile communication. There are many IoT
    agricultural devices which are bluetooth enabled such as Farmnote Air gateway
    and color sensor work with bluetooth enabled sensors. Bluetooth has ubiquitous
    nature due to which it is considered as an appropriate technology for multi-tier
    agricultural applications [56]. SECTION IV. IoT Agriculture Applications IoT agriculture
    system applied as an array of wide variety of fields such as, Precision farming,
    livestock monitoring, and greenhouse monitoring. Agriculture applications have
    been categorized into three sections: IoT agricultural applications, Smartphone
    based applications and sensor based applications. IoT and sensor based applications
    categorization has been illustrated in figure 11 which is framed by reviewing
    the today’s available IoT solutions in agriculture. FIGURE 11. IoT structure in
    agriculture. Show All A. IoT Agricultural Application Domains There are number
    of IoT agriculture applications which are being used to create more efficient
    resources for agriculture productivity. Main domains of IoT agriculture applications
    are precision farming, livestock monitoring, greenhouse monitoring and agricultural
    drones. The following subsection consists of various types of agricultural applications.
    1) Precision Farming Precision farming helps the farmers to improve, automate
    and optimize all feasible directions in order to enhance the agricultural productivity
    and make cropping system smart [57]. Different IoT sensors are deployed to measure
    soil quality, weather conditions, moisture level, and effectively plan to optimize
    harvesting techniques. To enhance the crop production a correlation analysis between
    agricultural environment information and crop statistical analysis has been developed
    to collect crop data [28]. In [58] an IoT based platforms has been developed for
    precision agriculture and ecological monitoring. IoT based weather forecasts helps
    to optimize productivity and take anticipatory analysis to prevent the crop from
    damage. Multiple monitoring devices/sensors are used to predict pest behavior,
    plant or crop growth and address any pending pest issue before they damage crop.
    Ranchers use IoT based irrigation solutions to manage and analyze crop irrigation
    requirements. In [59] a remote agricultural monitoring platform has been presented
    on the basis of monitored data. A conceptual architecture based on cyber systems
    and software defined setworks has been presented in [60] for precision farming.
    IoT base Precision farming consist of multiple monitroing and controling applications
    such as climate conditions monitoring, soil patterns monitoring, pest and crop
    disease monitoring, irrigation, determine optimal time to plant and harvest and
    tracking/tracing. a: Climate Conditions Monitoring In agriculture it is the most
    important to monitor weather conditions continuously so that future activities
    can be planed accordingly. Weather stations are the most popular gadgets in the
    field of agriculture which are used to monitor different climte conditions. Weather
    parameters which are being monitored include temperature, humidity, wind direction,
    and air pressure etc. Located across the field, weather stations collect the environmental
    data and send it to the cloud server. Collected data is used for weather analysis
    to map climate conditions, and provide new insights to take required actions to
    improve agricultural productivity. US Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
    has been defined a weather related approach called Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA)
    which helps the user to transform agriculture system by identifying climate conditions
    [61]. A wireless sensor network has been deployed by using IoT technology to monitor
    weather changes by integrating the sensors and devices [62]. b: Soil Patterns
    Soil monitoring has become one of the most demanding practices in agriculture
    field for both industries and farmers. In soil monitoring there are many environmental
    issues which affects on crop production. If hese kinds of issues are identified
    data accurately then the farming patterns and processes can be understand easily.
    Soil patterns which are being monitored consists of Soil Humidity, moisture, fertilization
    and temperature. Soil humidity and moisture sensors are deployed to monitor the
    moisture content in soil [63]. An adequate amount of fertilization in the field
    also increase crop yield [64]. Soil monitoring test report increase crop productivity
    and recommends an appropriate fertilization solutions to farmer [65]. Moreover,
    identification of contaminated soil by using IoT technologies protect the field
    from over fertilization and crop loss. c: Pest and Crop Disease Monitoring Root
    causes of revenue and production losses are crop diseases. Due to the boom of
    IoT agricultural system has been changed into digital system which helps the farmer
    to make informed decisions. Prediction of crop diseases at early stages helps
    the farmers to generate more revenue by saving crop from pest attacks. IoT protect
    crop in multiple ways by detecting different diseases and prevent crop from animal
    attacks. An IoT based monitoring system has been presented in [66] to monitor
    the wheat diseases, pest and weeds. Crop raiding is the biggest issue due to contraction
    of cultivated land into different wildlife haunts. In [67] a monitoring and repelling
    system for the protection of crop against wild animals attack has been presented.
    Detection of crop disease at early stages is very challenging in the field of
    agriculture. Because to detect crop or leaf disease a team of experts is called,
    which is expensive and time taking process. Whereas, automatic detection of diseases
    is very beneficial, accurate and cheaper for farmer as compared to manual observation
    by experts. Image processing technique also plays a vital role for the earlier
    detection of plant disease [68]. A crop disease detection scenario has been shown
    in figure 12. FIGURE 12. Disease detection scenario. Show All Sensed raw data
    via sensing devices is converted into usable format via remote server and then
    stored into database which is displayed through a user interface. After getting
    data multiple data mining models are applied for disease (bacterial, fungal, viral
    etc) analysis. d: Irrigation Monitoring System IoT improve the current irrigation
    system in a more innovative way. A farmer can optimize irrigation system in multiple
    ways by monitoring weather conditions and soil conditions. IoT technology monitor
    irrigation system in four ways like weather forecasting data, control and monitor
    whole field from anywhere, Ethernet connection and WIFI. This modern irrigation
    system facilitates the farmers by installing multiple sensors, reducing farmers
    monthly irrigation cost, and limit water resources [69]. In [70] an intelligent
    irrigation management system has been presented by using Maching learning and
    open source technologies which sense different soil and weather parametrs. An
    IoT based Low cost irrigation system has been designed in [71] which uses HTTP
    and MQTT protocols to inform the user. Water quality is monitored by sensor nodes
    which are empowered with wireless communication. IoT technology measure both physical
    and chemical constraints of ph, dissolved, temperature, conductivity and oxygen
    [72]. Gathered data about water management system is viewed on internet by using
    cloud computing services. Recently multiple IoT irrigation platforms have been
    developed to control the water consumption in the field. In [73] a simple irrigation
    system has been developed by using WSN. In more advance system users can control
    the process of irrigation through cellular technologies. Likewise, system is proposed
    in [75] in which user transfer sensors data via cellular technologies to a database
    system. e: Determine the Optimal Time to Plant and Harvest IoT increase operational
    efficiency and enhance the crop productivity by determining the best possible
    time to harvest and plant. IoT amalgamate multiple existing technologies like
    cloud computing applications, end user applications, wireless sensor networks
    (WSN’s) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) to determine the accurate time
    of weeding and seeding [76]. f: Tracking and Tracing IoT provides informative
    data to agricultural companies for better decisions making such as planning, managing
    and connect with business partners intelligently by saving money and time. In
    growing environment soil, air, water, fertilizers, and pesticides conditions are
    monitored by RFID and Global Positioning System (GPS). GPS system is used to find
    the exact location of agriculture field and monitor various agricultural parameters
    by using wireless communication networks. In [77] an architecture has been develop
    which remotely monitor the soil condition and soil structure as per requirement
    of crops culture. In this structure ZigBee is connected with other devices like
    content management system (CMS), Global System for Mobile (GSM) and General Packet
    Radio Service (GPRS) by using Wireless sensor networks to monitor and realize
    real time data checking. GPS provides interface to interact with ARM (an intelligent
    monitoring system to achieve functions like SMS/MMS) and gives an alarm to farm
    manager when an unwanted changes occur and helps the farmers to take corrective
    action. Although it’s operational and maintenance cost is high but it is widely
    used in agriculture due to its exact location monitoring and tracking property.
    g: Farm Management System The adoption of smart farming is correspondingly increasing
    the amount of productivity by reducing the environmental impact but this smart
    farming technique can be possible via Farm Management System (FMS). FMS is a key
    element for processing, planning, and decision making for the purpose of smart
    farming [78]. An integrated FMS allows the farmers to monitor the entire where
    whole data is collected via WSN, GSM modules and microcontroller. An identifier
    is used on the sensors and devices in all over the farm which gives the proper
    knowledge of fertilization, weather data, automatic buffer zone width monitoring,
    and automatic detail record is generated according to per day activities of farm.
    This whole information is stored in the computer in standard format and can be
    accessible via cell phone or internet for further processing. To optimize the
    use of water resources an automated irrigation and monitoring system is used [73].
    Apart from irrigation system farm is also protected from pest and animal intrusion
    [66], [67]. h: Agricultural Drones Drones are defined as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
    (UAVs) which are being utilized in agriculture to improve various practices of
    farming. These flying devices are controlled remotely by remote control or autonomously
    programmed. Agricultural processes which are performed by drones are crop health
    assessment, spraying, screening, planting, scouting reports, measurement of nitrogen
    in wheat and analysis of soil conditions. Drones facilitate the farmers via integration
    with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping, and crop health imaging. Drones
    are mostly deployed in large farms where issues related to bacteria fungus are
    difficult to handle and require regular monitoring. In the area of agriculture
    pesticides and fertilizers are very important for crop yield [65], [66]. Agricultural
    drones are carrying out this job efficiently because of its high speed and effectiveness
    in the spraying operation. In addition they also deployed to monitor forests,
    livestock and aquaculture. An organization Precision Hawk is using drones for
    valuable data gathering through sensors for surveying mapping, and imaging of
    agricultural land. They perform in-flight monitoring, farmers enters the detail
    about which field to survey and select a ground resolution. An IoT based Farm
    management information system approch has been developed to meet the bussiness
    objectives [29]. Agricultural drones are integrated with GPS devices cameras and
    sensors to monitor crop health, like planting, crop spraying, screening and analysis
    of soil. There are many other advantages of drone’s utilization like crop health
    imaging, plant counting, amount of nitrogen in wheat, plant height, drainage mapping,
    and weed pressure etc. 2) Greenhouse Monitoring In greenhouse plants are grown
    under controlled environment. This glasshouse technology provides benefits to
    growing plants anytime anywhere by monitoring appropriate environmental conditions.
    Cultivation of greenhouse is more intense, therefore in terms of controlling and
    monitoring it requires high precision. To monitor environmental or weather conditions
    there have been several studies on the applications of WSN’s in greenhouse. Recent
    studies shows that how IoT can be implemented in greenhouse to minimize the human
    resources, accumulate energy and provides direct link of greenhouse from ranchers
    to customers. Most of the studies have focused only on remote monitoring and localized
    [14]–[16]. In addition, for the purpose of high precision there have been a lot
    of studies which integrates meta-processing structure with data to transfer it
    on remote infrastructures through internet. By applying well evaluated crop models,
    assessment of the crop status helps the ranchers to take better decisions [80].
    In Figure 13 a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has been implemented to monitor the
    greenhouse environment. Whole network is divided into multi parts which processes
    the data and gives feedback. FIGURE 13. WSN for monitoring greenhouse environment.
    Show All Data can be obtained by corresponding sensors and detectors and then
    transferred to the main server for processing. In physical implementation the
    major components are the sensors and network for accurate data transmission. Growers
    setup the different monitoring devices and sensors according to the specific requirements
    and track or record the required information. Agriculturists make better decisions
    by analyzing the received information and achieve specific goals by obtaining
    optimal data. There are many IoT based greenhouse applications such as water management,
    plant monitoring, and climate monitoring etc. a: Water Management To measure the
    exact amount of required water in greenhouses is a key problem. Smart sensors
    are implemented which are controlled by applying multiple IoT techniques to avoid
    from excessive use of water. In greenhouses water management is carried out by
    using automatic drip irrigation which works by following soil mositure threshhold
    that is set accordingly [81]. b: Plant Monitoring IoT sensors and cameras creates
    ideal environment for plants by monitoring the state of plants regularly and generates
    an alert if any problem is recognizable. On the other side, cloud based IoT solutions
    store the sensed data and view it periodically which is helpful for growers to
    ensure that all plants obtains ideal attention in the greenhouse [82]. c: Climate
    Monitoring There are many parameters which are combined to maintain and create
    an ideal environment for plants within strict limits such as, the maintenance
    of ventilation, temperature, carbon dioxide, and oxygen level. This can be made
    possible by deploying IoT enabled greenhouse where smart devices and sensors share
    their information for strong decision making [81]. 3) Livestock Monitoring Optimal
    environment or weather circumstances which absorbs excessive amount of climate
    conditions leaves negative impact on the productivity of animals that is a serious
    issue for many researchers [83]. Whereas, due to increasing the demand of high
    quality dairy products precision livestock also considered as the major concern.
    Each year ranchers lose a large amount of profit because of animals illness. But
    IoT based livestock management solutions helps the farmers to improve the farming
    principles, livestock conditions and dairy products [11]. Just like crop monitoring
    sensors, different livestock monitoring sensors are also attached to the animals
    to monitor their log performance. Livestock monitoring factors varies on the categories
    of animals under consideration such as conductivity of milk, pest attack, humidity,
    and water quality. By tagging RFID to individual animal allow farmers to track
    their location, thereby preventing animal from theft. Connected sensors and wearables
    in the livestock allow the farmer to monitor overall animals’ activities and data
    streamed to the cloud directly helps the farmers to identify the issues. Cowlar
    and SCR by Allflex are using smart agriculture sensors to monitor animals health,
    activity, temperature, nutrition and collect information on each individual as
    well as about the herd [84], [85]. In the field of livestock several studies have
    been realized. Wireless Sensor have been used which are most advantageous for
    large farm as well as for hazardous gas monitoring. An IoT based livestock scenario
    is shown in Figure 14. FIGURE 14. IoT based livestock scenario. Show All In the
    field different IoT sensing devices have been deployed to monitor the weather
    conditions via weather station and sense other activities in the field by all
    other data sources which have been implemented in the whole farm. Sensed data
    is stored on the cloud server, which user can use for decision making. User can
    interact remotely by using multiple smart devices (Laptops, Tablets, and Mobile
    etc.). Some IoT base applications of livestock monitoring have discussed below:
    a: Animal Temperature Monitoring Identification of disease symptoms and prevention
    is the major function for animal health monitoring. Normal body temperature of
    dogs is 38.3°C-39.2°C and cow’s is 38.5°C-39.5°C. When the body temperature is
    increased or decreased from the normal body temperature then it indicates that
    animal is suffering from any disease [86]. b: Heat Stress Level Heat stress decreases
    the cow’s milk productivity with same dietary input, due to which farmers face
    the cost production issues. In summer season moisture content becomes low due
    to which stress level in animals increased, because of this animal can also die.
    c: Physical Gesture Recognition Gesture analysis can be made by using IoT animal
    monitoring devices. Animal’s gesture behavior is classified into different groups
    such as in cattle, this behavior is consisting of two classes that are traveling
    and stationary. Traveling behavior consists of animal’s walking, running and grazing
    whereas stationary behavior is animal’s sitting, sleeping and standing. d: Rumination
    Rumination monitor the digested food by animal and it is detected by mounting
    a monitoring device in the animal’s (cows) nose. In this way farmer can get accurate
    indication about animal’s health. e: Heart Rate Measurement of heart rate is an
    indirect method which impacts due to the agitation and stress that cow have. Normal
    heart rate of cow is 43 to 84 bpm whereas calf’s normal heart rate is 100 to 140
    bpm. By using IoT devices and sensors heart rate can be monitored constantly.
    f: GPS Based Monitoring GPS system is used to obtain the specification of farm
    and sends the monitored parameters to central monitoring station by using wireless
    sensor network. To prevent animals from theft, wild attacks or weather conditions
    a repelling system has been provided by using wireless technologies like Zigbee,
    WIFI, and LoWPAN [88]. B. Agricultural Solutions by Using Smart Phones From the
    last few years it has been observed that integration of electronic devices with
    smartphones innovate the technology world and smartphones are taken as a driver
    of IoT. To make smart phones versatile in agriculture field various hardware and
    software have been designed. A good (but not complete) survey of smart phone apps
    providing agricultural solutions has been presented [98]. Figure 15 showing a
    classification illustration of smart phone apps for smart farming. Morever, there
    is a number of recent apps which are serving similar functionalties. All smart
    phone apps which are elaborated in figure 15 discussed in tabular form with a
    small description of each. These smart phone apps are not limited; developers
    from all over the world have developed many e-Farming apps therefore, this paper
    highlighted some selected apps which have been discussed according to their popularity.
    FIGURE 15. Smartphone applications for agriculture. Show All C. IoT Devices and
    Sensors in Agriculture In today’s modern world everything needs to be automatic
    with less man power by consuming less time. Sensor is such a device which can
    fulfill this requirement by detecting same input from the existing physical environment
    and responds back. User set some setting over sensing devices to perform their
    task without the involvement of human. There are some major IoT sensors like:
    Motion Detector, PIR, Soil Moisture, Temperature, Humidity, Barometric Pressure,
    Ultra Violet, PH, and gas sensor. In Table 3 various sensor based agricultural
    applications, their operations and IoT association have been discussed but table
    2 pay attention only on smart phone agricultural apps. TABLE 2 Smartphone Agricultural
    Applications Description TABLE 3 IoT Sensor Based Applications in Agriculture
    SECTION V. IoT Agricultural Security In the coming years agricultural sector is
    expected to witness the extensive acceptance of IoT and grow through the new e-farming
    IoT applications and devices. These agricultural applications and devices are
    expected to deal with a large amount of sensitive data. Due to the distributed
    nature of IoT a single security protocol is not sufficient therefore, leakage
    of information is a major security concern [107]. If we adopt IoT fully in the
    field of agriculture then it will be more critical to analyze and identify the
    distinctive features of privacy and security like different security requirements
    and threat models in the perspective of Agriculture. On the basis of literature
    some security issues has been presented in Figure 16. FIGURE 16. IoT security
    issues in agriculture. Show All A. Security Requirements IoT based smart farming
    security requirements are similar to standard security scenario. Therefore, to
    achieve a secure farming solution we have need to pay attention on the following
    security requirements: Confidentiality: Agricultural information or personal data
    relevant to it should be accessible only by authorized users. Integrity: Here
    integrity means received and stored data or content is not changed. Authentication:
    Authentication means peer devices should have an identity to which it is communicating.
    Data Freshness: It consists of key freshness and data freshness because IoT agricultural
    networks sometime provides varying measurements, therefore it is necessary to
    ensure that every message is fresh. Non Repudiation: Its means a node can never
    deny to send a message that sent earlier. Authorization: Here authorization means
    for network or any other resources only authorized devices are allowed. Self Healing:
    If any device in an IoT based agricultural network fail or out of energy then
    other devices in the network should be able to provide security to some extent.
    B. Security Challenges Security of IoT based smart farming mainly consists of
    three basic requirements that are Authentication, access control and confidentiality
    of the stakeholders. Whereas, at the perception layer network must be secured
    from external attacks and in the network layer aggregation of the data should
    be secured. Authorize specific entities ensures that only authorized user can
    access data from application layer [28]. The most common issue of security in
    the perception layer is physical security that is the security of hardware and
    information acquisition security [108]. Here physical security is very important
    because all the devices are deployed in an open field. That’s why a single security
    protocol is not enough because IoT devices may be implemented in a diverse environment.
    Another major security issue is leakage of information, this information consist
    of location and sensitive data. Security countermeasures consist of data encryption,
    jamming, blocker tags use, modification in tag frequency, and tag destruction
    strategy. There is a difference between sensor nodes and RFID tags that’s’ why
    while implementing encryption algorithm, intrusion detection policies, key distribution
    and routing policies, hardware restrictions should keep in mind [109]. In IoT
    concept data flows from an end device towards gateway, during this process data
    also uploaded to other platform such as cloud infrastructure. There are multiple
    security policies exist for sensor nodes like identity authentication, data filtering,
    cryptographic algorithm, data flow control mechanisms etc. Cheating, wiretapping,
    replay attacks and tampering are also security threats. Due to which, confidentiality,
    authentication and integrity should be must employed while data acquisitions phase
    [17]. C. Stack Challenges Middleware layer also plays a vital role in IoT to increase
    security. Middleware stands in between application layer and network layer which
    is responsible to process data and provide interface for communication between
    these layers. Middleware layer requires secure and confidential data storage.
    Secure transmission via wireless medium is very challenging in IoT deployment
    due to which IoT based architecture is at risk like vulnerability, denial of services,
    illegal access, and many virus injects. In this way data integrity and confidentiality
    is affected by such attacks. According to IoT vision application layer is one
    of the top most layers and closely related to the cloud due to its computation
    resources and storage nature. Security issue at application layer and cloud are
    very similar such as data security, backup, recovery and privacy. Therefore, access
    rights of the data, information and ownership for physical users, machines and
    organizations should manage and administered by a control mechanisms. D. Threat
    Model Both IoT agricultural devices and networks are at risk because of increasing
    attack surface. IoT agricultural threat model consist of three scenarios. First
    one is cloud networks, second is native networks expansion and third is cloud
    services. Threat may be generates from internal or external network. If an attack
    is arise from an agriculture device then it will be considered as one of the more
    severe attack. Because it is very difficult to detect the malicious device within
    the network. In addition an adversary may attack on an agriculture device and
    network and use power device like mobile, laptop or tablet or may be same kind
    of IoT devices to penetrate the network. E. Attack Taxonomy There are many types
    of attacks in IoT paradigm due to which an attacker may attack by adopting a method
    on future or existing IoT agriculture devices and networks. In IoT agricultural
    field threat may be tangible, predictable or unpredictable. In this paper existing
    and possible threats are classified on the basis of three key factors: which are
    Information Disruption, Host, and networks. 1) Attacks on the Basis of Information
    Disruptions Stored agricultural data may be analyzed or manipulated by a hacker
    to provide wrong information. Such attacks consist of Interruption (denial of
    services), Interception (threaten data privacy and confidentiality), Modification
    (unauthorized access to the agricultural data), Fabrication and replay. 2) Attacks
    on the Basis of Host Properties Host properties attacks occure in two forms namely:
    hardware compromise (attacker may attact on device program code data or keys and
    reprogram the devices with malicious code) and software compromise (attacker may
    take the advantage of software vulnerabilities and glitches like operating system,
    applications software and system software). 3) Attacks on the Basis of Networks
    Properties Two types of attacks can be arised on basis of networks properties.
    Namely: standard protocol compromise (to threat service availability like integrity
    and authenticity where attacker deviates from standard protocols) and network
    protocol stack (consist of different types of vulnerabilities). F. Reference Security
    Model for IoT Based Agriculture IoT agricultural paradigms are not yet strong
    but continued to build up due to which currently it is difficult to discover all
    possible threats and vulnerabilities in IoT agricultural field. However, when
    experts find the security solution to solve the apparent security threats at that
    point they should have the ability to mitigate the hidden security issues. To
    accomplish a security solution, security checks should be deployed with dynamic
    properties. Consider a framework in which security mechanism consist of different
    systems which can detect and prevent IoT agricultural system from attacks. Now
    consider, that an attacker generate a new type of attack on agricultural applications
    devices and networks to steal agricultural information integrity. In such conditions
    existing security techniques should indentify this new attack by using dynamic
    algorithm. A security model presented in Figure 17 has been discussed to resolve
    these issue. The model is illustrated with its three security systems: protection
    system is designed to mitigate the attack while, dignosing system collects activity
    data from agricultural applications, networks, nodes and analyzes detected agricultural
    data. Reaction system is designed to help the agricultural entities survive all
    types of attacks. FIGURE 17. An intelligent collaborative security model for smart
    farming. Show All FIGURE 18. Selected IoT agricultural products. Show All Whole
    system has been designed by following dynamic algorithms. To prevent from present,
    probable and hidden attacks this system has strong collaboration. Upon intrusion
    detection system issues an operation command and store in reaction system after
    that share their anomaly diagnosing experience with protection system to prevent
    from further attacks. Operation command receive response from identification service,
    reaction system remove the system failure risks and after that pass out its experience
    with other two systems that are protection and diagnosing systems. In this way
    a complete inter collaboration system is accomplished. SECTION VI. IoT Agricultural
    Industry Trends and Practices The IoT in agriculture field has experienced a burst
    of creativity, activity, venture capital firms and exciting entrepreneurs. The
    space becomes visible as an active group of large firms and new start ups that
    are willing to become the part of what may be a giant market and technologies.
    In this section an extensive record of some products and technologies has been
    provided for a good understanding of IoT position in agriculture field. 3D Crop
    Sensor Array with PAR Addon can be mounted on any location, to monitor temperature,
    humidity and carbon dioxide in the farm [110]. EC-1 Controller monitors the environmental
    conditions and then programs them to control the environment by turning off and
    on devices [111]. Arable Mark is the first device which links the global weather
    data within the field observations developed by Arable. With the unprecedented
    ground truth accuracy device makes informed decisions and deliveres real time
    monitoring information to the palm of user’s hand [112]. Growlink designed Growlink
    one controller to deliver smart farming experience. It has highest processing
    power and components quality to coordinate with multiple sensors and devices in
    all over the farm. This device is simply all in one and farmers can expand the
    system according to their requirements by adding additional microcontroller via
    IP networks [113]. Easternpeak offers an IoT GreenIQ agricultural device which
    control irrigation and saves water of your garden’s lawn from anywhere. Growers
    can save up to 50% outdoor water bills by using a GreenIQ smart sprinklers controller
    [114]. Grofit provides a climate monitoring device based on Bluetooth and its
    transmission range is up to 200 m in all over field. This device also provide
    data log which store maximum 30 days measurements. Growers can monitor air humidity,
    real time air temperature and sun radiations by using this device [115]. MeteoHelix
    weather station designed by allmeteo which provides reliable, stable and open
    meteorological solutions according to weather requirements. This weather station
    provides multiple features like temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, dew
    point, sun radiations, and solar radiations measurement [116]. Leaf Wetness sensor
    is developed by Smart Element which determine the wetness of leaf by electrical
    resistance on the surface of sensor. It is used to measure wet and dry time on
    the leaf surface [117]. Swip Track Micro locates any moving object in all over
    the field that may be any farming machine, vehicle or engines [118]. Waspmote
    Plug & Sense! Smart Agriculture Xtreme is a sensor node which provides more reliable
    and accurate information about weather. This sensor measures the wind and rainfall
    condition via optical technology. The presence of fertilizers and soil morphology
    can be analyzed through this sensor by measuring the oxygen level, water content,
    and soil water potential [119]. SKY – Lora Weather Station can easily communicate
    to nearby master sensor through LoRa [120]. This is suitable for those locations
    where there is nearby connectivity. This weather station can send data up to 600
    meter away to a master sensor which has WIFI connection. Pycno has been developed
    a Pulse IoT automation sensor which comes in a self-sustained package powered
    by a tiny solar panel [121]. Sensor is WIFI and LoRa enabled device which has
    multiprotocol port in the bottom. In future Pulse Automation Sensor and Pycno
    soil sensor will be integrated to actuate devices and talk with each other in
    the field. CropX Starter Kit – Soil Temperature 24/7 is a real-time soil-temperature
    monitoring Sensor. This sensor has direct cellular connection and better accuracy
    which provides advance sensing capabilities [122]. Some top technologies firm’s
    trends and directions are highlighted in Table 4. TABLE 4 IoT Agricultural Trends
    and Directions of Some Well Known Technology Industries SECTION VII. IoT Smart
    Farming Policies and Success Stories A. Policies Many countries have understood
    the importance of IoT and facilitating through its advance monitoring techniques.
    Government of different countries is seizing the IoT opportunity and investing
    maximum to boost up the crop productivity. Adaptation of IoT technology in different
    countries has been discussed in this section. 1) Australia Government of Australia
    has invested AU$ 134 million to boost up farming. Due to this large investment
    a center was created by a private company in Sidney to implement IoT technologies
    for Smart farming [150]. In 2014 an Innovative Network for Precision Agriculture
    System was established for the purpose of a collaborative frame work to create
    a national agenda in Australian agriculture. In terms of privacy and security,
    in 2015 an American farm Bureau took the lead in establishing a privacy and security
    set for farm data [151]. 2) Ireland Irish Farmer’s Association (IFA) Launched
    a program for agriculturists to reduce the cost, to improve the soil quality and
    guides the farmer how to save water and energy by adopting new technologies [8].
    When the farmers follow these instructions the results were very positive and
    encouraging. Companies saved almost 8700 euro, 10% reduction in green house gas
    emission, 21% savings in pasture management and 47% saving was achieved by Soil
    Fertility. In 2016 a nationwide SigFox network was launched by VT-Networks Ireland
    which provides solution for tracking security sensors and farm assets [153]. 3)
    France Ministry of Agriculture in France has become the partner of the Agriculture
    Innovation Project 2025. The basic aim of this project is to increase the strengthen
    of agricultural land, monitor the climate conditions and create incubators to
    improve agriculture field in France. Ministry of agriculture also share the collected
    data with farmer’s to propose new solution in the field of Agriculture [154].
    French agriculture is administrated by European Union (EU) rules and supported
    through a policy called Common Agriculture Policy (CAP). A new CAP framework was
    defined in 2015 at EU level for next five years which is beneficial for different
    agro ecology projects for farming. 4) China In 2016 china launched its 13th five
    years plan to integrate IoT in the field of agriculture to enhance profitability
    [156]. Project has been started in different eight provinces, with multiple products,
    technologies and 426 applications. Data was collected from multiple provincial
    and national level data centers. Moreover, NB-IoT App by Huawei company in china
    transforming the agriculture in a more efficient and an innovative way. NB-IoT
    provides low cost agriculture solutions as compare to cellular network where gateway
    implementation is not necessary. Huawei NB-IoT has large number of connections
    and wide coverage due to which it can resolve issue of scattered agricultural
    data [157]. 5) Malaysia Agricultural policy in Malaysia was established in two
    periods of time policy before and after independence 1948–1957 and 1957–2020 [158].
    The purpose of the policy was to enhance the growth of crop and decrease the poverty.
    Multiple solutions have been created by Malaysian Institute of Microelectronic
    System (MIMOS) which are best for agriculture development. A sensor named Mi-MSCANT
    PH has been developed by MIMOS to gather environmental data. An agricultural framework
    has been developed by MIMOS to integrate IoT technologies which create a bonding
    between suppliers, traders, and agricultural producers mutually in unified manners.
    This framework utilizes technologies named Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS)
    and WSN which automatically collect environmental data [159]. 6) USA USA has funded
    million Dollars to generate new agricultural technologies to fulfill the necessary
    requirements of energy and food. National Institute of Food and Agriculture worked
    on a project that is Internet-of-Ag-Things and develop sensing technologies for
    smart farming practices. The major purpose of this project is to develop precision
    technologies to enhance the efficiency of agriculture industries and make better
    use of water, fertilizers and organic food [160]. The U.S. Department of Agriculture
    (USDA) has started a project to address water management challenges and develop
    new solution for those issues which are affecting agriculture. Technology experts
    are using USDA datasets to improve and design agricultural services [161]. 7)
    Thailand In Thailand National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC)
    applying innovative IT technologies for the purpose of smart farming and their
    major focus is on four agricultural products including Rubber, Rice, Sugar and
    Cassava [162]. The major concern of this movement is to increase the agricultural
    productivity and facilitate the farmers in all rural areas of Thailand [163].
    Faculty of Science and Technology at Thammasat University developed an IoT-based
    irrigation control system which helps the grower to preset watering cycle timing
    in advance. A smart farm service provider namely; FarmD Asia was established in
    2015 to boost up the agricultural productivity by its flagship products. FarmD
    Asia has also designed a pesticides aerial drone which covers upto eight acres
    land in single fly. National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA)
    launched Agricultural System Integrator (ASI) program which was primarily designed
    for farmers to start and run smart farm successfully [164]. 8) India Different
    IoT policies have been formulated by Indian government in order to leverage the
    strength of their agricultural field in all over the world. Indians basic purpose
    is to monitor the earth density, soil conditions, temperature and alerts the farmers
    to control pest related issues. In 2015 a policy on IoT in India was released
    by Ministry of Communication and Information Technology to transform digital landscape
    by using IoT [165]. 9) Philippine Philippines have used the remote sensing techniques
    to increase the production of rice. They are also using ground data processing
    and satellite imagery techniques to generate more information on different agricultural
    conditions. University of Southeastern Philippines (USeP) proposed an intelligent
    solution to monitor crop heat stress by using IoT technology with the collaboration
    of Western Mindanao State University (WMSU). In this project research team is
    on the brink with an effective technology counter heat stress which helps the
    farmer to get maximum benefit with the fewest inputs [166]. B. Food and Agriculture
    Organization of United NATIONSNN Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations
    (FAO) is an e-agricultural organization which follows the international efforts
    to fulfill the deficiency of food in all over 130 countries worldwide. FAO predicted
    that there is a most probability that world population will reach 9.8 billion
    by 2050 therefore, it is necessary to increase the food production 70% by 2050
    to fulfils the growing demand of food through the utilization of IoT technology.
    Mitsubishi Corporation (MC) and Vegetalia, changing Japanese agricultural sector
    by their join forces through AI and IoT. By using tensiometer sensors Tevatronic
    develops an autonomous irrigation system which is placed in the ground near the
    plants for monitoring. From the last 74 years FAO has been changed the agricultural
    world by launching its top ten achievements given in table 5 [167]. TABLE 5 Top
    10 E-Agricultural Strategies of FAO C. IoT Agriculture Success Stories This research
    indicates that there have been several tools and techniques which helps the farmers
    to improve the crop productivity in a more innovative ways. Some IoT agriculture
    relevant technologies have been discussed in section I which provides additional
    tools to the farmers or agriculturists to increase the crop yield. Section III
    describes the different IoT and Smartphone based applications which facilitate
    the farmers to enhance the agriculture productivity by providing extended benefits.
    However over the globe governments are seizing the IoT opportunities in agriculture
    by making large investment. There are many pilot projects which reflects a great
    potential in the future of IoT in agriculture at country level such as china,
    India, Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan etc. Therefore, in this research we have also
    discussed the results of some pilot projects conducted and being executed in different
    countries. Table 6 prepresents the success stories of these pilot projects in
    different countries with the main IoT agricultural applications (precision farming,
    greenhouse, and livestock). TABLE 6 IoT Agriculture Success Stories SECTION VIII.
    IoT Agricultural Challenges Many researchers have worked on IoT agriculture system
    and solve multiple technological issues and architectural problems by implementing
    and designing various IoT agricultural solutions. Moreover, according to the research
    point of view in the literature, there are also several open issues and challenges
    which are needed to address successfully [57]. There are many challenges which
    are linkage with IoT smart farming deployment and applications. This research
    has identified some explored and unexplored IoT agricultural issues and challenges.
    A. Hardware Challenges Several challenges arise in IoT agricultural setup. First
    of all the equipments which exists at the perception layer are directly expose
    to harsh environmental experience such as, rain, high level temperature, extreme
    humidity, hard winds, and many other possible dangers which destroy electronic
    circuits. End devices works consistently for a long period by depending on inadequate
    batteries power resources. So, a suitable programming tools and less power potential
    is necessary because in case of any program failure instantly battery replacement
    is complicated especially in a large scale open field [144]. B. Networking Challenges
    These challenges are not only for the hardware implementations, but also exist
    at the network layer. Due to high cost of wiring, wireless communication is most
    important for the deployment of IoT based agriculture. Physical deployment shows
    that accepted transceivers performance is exaggerated by human presence, temperature,
    humidity and many other barriers inside the space where wireless device or node
    wants to communicate. Due to which there should use most reliable and robust technologies
    to transfer data according to the environmental challenges and rural conditions
    [8]. A detailed analysis on IoT agriculture networking challenges and issues is
    given [145]. C. IoT Agricultural Platforms IoT agricultural architecture is more
    complicated as compare to other IoT end devices and requires real time monitoring
    system with additional stringent requirements. For this a tailored computing platform
    is needed with run time libraries. A service oriented approach (SOA) can also
    take to build a suitable platform; such services can be exploited by using different
    API’s. In addition, appropriate frameworks and libraries should be developed so
    that agricultural developers can make resourceful use of available document, classes,
    codes and other useful data. D. Other Technical Issues 1) Interfernce To implement
    smart farming a large number of IoT devices are deployed for agricultural purpose
    that creates hindrance especially for those IoT devices which are using unlicensed
    spectrum like Sogfox, ZigBee, LoRa, and WIFI. These technical issues reduce the
    reliability and loss of data. Moreover, unnecessary interference can be eliminated
    by using IoT devices with licensed spectrum. But, among the IoT devices which
    are using cellular licensed spectrum the reprocess of non-orthogonal multiple
    access method can create hindrance because of restricted pilot assignment in cellular
    band. 2) Reliability In agriculture field mostly the IoT devices are deployed
    in an open environment. Due to which there may occur some inconsiderate environmental
    impacts which may cause the communication failure as well as degradation of deployed
    sensors. Therefore, physical safety of IoT devices and system is necessary to
    secure the expensive gadgets from unauthorized user and severe attacks like weather
    conditions or theft. 3) Scalability Billions of IoT devices have been increased
    gradually, due to which more devices are getting connected. Therefor, large number
    of gateways and protocols are needed to support IoT devices. Moreover, IoT agricultural
    back end databases and network applications should be reliable and scalable because
    with the addition of diverse application related operations becomes more complex.
    Therefore, design a highly scalable security scheme and an intelligent IoT system
    for each end device. 4) Resource Optimization Farmers need optimization of resources
    to measure how many IoT devices, gateways, size of cloud storage, and amount of
    transmitted data is required. Due to different farm sizes and variables like crop
    or livestock monitoring resource optimization has become challenging because there
    is a need of different sensors and devices to perform each function. Therefore,
    this will require complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to determine
    the resource allocation for maximum agriculture productivity. 5) Cost Analysis
    and Lack Knwoledge of Technology In the field of agriculture profit margin is
    very important, there is a need of stability the trade-off between the deployments
    of IoT enabling technologies. When an IoT system is deployed the cost of implementations
    are very high like IoT devices/Sensors, gateways, and base station infrastructure.
    After that maintenance cost also important for the use of central services which
    are necessary for IoT devices management, data collection, and information sharing
    among all other services. Moreover, the major factor of slowing IoT in rural areas
    is basically the lack knowledge of IoT and its applications. This is the main
    problem because majority of ranchers is uneducated and lives in rural areas. Therefor,
    it is most important to overcome these obstacles by educating farmers in order
    to generate more revnue [7]. 6) Deployment of LPWA Technologies There is a large
    number of IoT devices in Agriculture scenario, and such devices should liable
    to be heterogeneous in the context of their transmit, receive, sleep, and deep
    sleep along with others. In the terms of power requirements each communication
    layer confronts a supplementary challenge. For example, to confirm the service
    accessibility at MAC layer to find a low power device discovery protocol is a
    difficult task. 7) Universal Platform Adaptation of IoT in agriculture will shift
    from just specific crop to a standard platform which can support multiple smart
    farming applications for crop productivity. This standard platform creates a system
    which can be easily modified to support multiple agricultural applications ranging
    from monitoring to managing. This kind of platform will be free from any kind
    of geographical limitations work as an enabler in IoT agriculture system. 8) Mobility
    IoT agricultural network should have the capability to hold up and maintain the
    farmers mobility. So, that they can connect their farms from anywhere at any time
    [146]. 9) Quality of Service (QOS) Recent studies on QoS highlight that at each
    layer of IoT architecture QoS is required [147] [148]. The ability to make sure
    that devices which needs to transmit sensitive information will be capable to
    do this by using IoT technology without any barrier is still an open research
    issue. There is a need to do more work by providing a mechanism that guarantees
    QoS throughout IoT network layers. E. The Business Model IoT agricultural business
    approach is not still vigorous because it consists of a set of essential elements
    with the latest requirements like new operational policies and processes to transform
    the organizational structure. F. Organizational Challenges When talk about food
    organizations and agricultural sectors, is mean the exchange of information and
    goods transportation. IoT is renovating this whole business process by providing
    reliable and accurate delivery of all products and materials [1]. At the circumference
    of network to store and process the data cloud computing provides highest quality
    of services like efficient storage, computational resources, and application development
    tools for hardware diagnostic. That’s why cloud computing is an ideal accompaniment
    in the world of IoT technologies. At the end of the network a large amount of
    data is produced which needs high cost to transfer towards cloud in terms of latency
    and money [18]. Due to which it is a serious issue because of workload and optimal
    balancing. On the other hand fog computing also the cloud computing extension
    which expanding cloud technologies like tools, and the application development
    scope [149]. SECTION IX. Conclusion All over the globe researchers are exploring
    technological solutions to enhance the agriculture productivity in a way that
    complements existing services by deploying IoT technology. In this article, we
    have presented a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art for IoT in agriculture.
    To this end, we discuss agricultural network architecture, platform, and topology
    which help to access to IoT backbone and facilitates farmers to enhance the crop
    productivity. In addition, this article provides an extensive overview on current
    and continuing advances in IoT agricultural applications, devices/sensors, communication
    protocols and many innovative technologies. This research considers various IoT
    agricultural challenges and security requirements for the better understanding
    of IoT smart farming security. Furthermore, many important dimensions of IoT based
    agricultural including technologies, industries trends and countries policies
    have been also been presented to facilitate various stake holders. Government
    has started patronizing IoT in agriculture and it is anticipated that soon IoT
    in agriculture will revamp the conventional farming method. It is also clear that
    many big organizations have started investing and developing new techniques for
    farm management system using IoT. Finally, it is expected that this comprehensive
    survey results into a very useful piece of information for researchers, professionals,
    agriculturists and policy makers who are participating and working in IoT field
    and agricultural technologies. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

    are upgrading their inner workings in order to create Shipyards 4.0, where the
    principles of Industry 4.0 are paving the way to further digitalized and optimized
    processes in an integrated network. Among the different Industry 4.0 technologies,
    this paper focuses on augmented reality, whose application in the industrial field
    has led to the concept of industrial augmented reality (IAR). This paper first
    describes the basics of IAR and then carries out a thorough analysis of the latest
    IAR systems for industrial and shipbuilding applications. Then, in order to build
    a practical IAR system for shipyard workers, the main hardware and software solutions
    are compared. Finally, as a conclusion after reviewing all the aspects related
    to IAR for shipbuilding, it proposed an IAR system architecture that combines
    cloudlets and fog computing, which reduce latency response and accelerate rendering
    tasks while offloading compute intensive tasks from the cloud. Topic: Human-Centered
    Smart Systems and Technologies Test of a Microsoft HoloLens based Industrial Augmented
    Reality system in Navantia''s shipyard 4.0. Published in: IEEE Access ( Volume:
    6) Page(s): 13358 - 13375 Date of Publication: 21 February 2018 Electronic ISSN:

    I. Introduction The shipbuilding industry is aimed at providing integral solutions
    for delivering fully operational vessels together with their life-cycle maintenance.
    Shipbuilding main working areas include, among others, the design and construction
    of hi-tech vessels, the development of naval control and combat systems, overhauls
    of military and civil vessels, ships repairs, and diesel engine and turbine manufacturing.
    In all those areas, most companies are transferring the Industry 4.0 principles
    to their shipyards in order to build Shipyards 4.0, seeking to apply the newest
    technologies related to ubiquitous sensing, Internet of Things (IoT), robotics,
    Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), 3D printing or Big Data to improve the efficiency
    of the many processes that occur in a shipyard. This paradigm shift will change
    the way that operators perform their daily tasks. Therefore, they must be equipped
    with devices that act as an interface for human-machine communication and collaboration,
    and even as a Decision Support System (DSS) that would help to optimize their
    actions. Augmented Reality (AR), and specifically Industrial Augmented Reality
    (IAR), is one of the technologies that provide powerful tools that support the
    operators that undertake tasks, helping them in assembly tasks, context-aware
    assistance, data visualization and interaction (acting as a Human-Machine Interface
    (HMI)), indoor localization, maintenance applications, quality control or material
    management. Specifically, AR technology is expected to grow significantly in the
    next years together with Virtual Reality (VR), creating a market of US $80 bn
    in 2025 [1]. IAR is one of the technologies analyzed by Navantia, one of world’s
    largest shipbuilders. At the end of 2015 Navantia created together with the University
    of A Coruña (UDC) the Joint Research Unit Navantia-UDC, which studies the application
    of different Industry 4.0 technologies to shipyards through various research lines.
    One of such lines is called “Plant Information and Augmented Reality” and has
    among its objectives to evaluate the feasibility of using IAR to provide information
    to operators about shipyard processes. The present paper is aimed at analyzing
    the latest research and the best technologies to build an IAR system for a shipyard.
    Specifically, its main contributions are the following, which, as of writing,
    have not been found together in the literature: The article reviews the main characteristics
    of the most recent IAR systems for industrial and shipbuilding applications. It

    for creating IAR solutions. This article also identifies and discusses different
    use cases where IAR can be useful for shipbuilding. It proposes a novel IAR architecture
    that makes use of Edge Computing to reduce latency response and accelerate rendering
    tasks. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews
    the main IAR concepts to provide a basic understanding of the underlying technology.

    industry. Section V describes the most relevant use cases of IAR for a shipyard.

    shipbuilding applications. Section VII analyzes the traditional IAR architecture
    and then proposes the ideal architecture for a Shipyard 4.0. Finally, Section
    VIII is devoted to the conclusions. SECTION II. IAR Basics A. Origins, Current
    Trends and Prospects of IAR The term IAR can be defined as the application of
    AR in order to support an industrial process [2]. This definition is broader than
    the one given by other researchers [3], who disregarded photo-based augmentations,
    which have proved to be effective in industrial environments. Although the origins
    of AR can be traced back to the 1960s, when Ivan Sutherland performed his visionary
    experiments [4], [5], the concept of IAR actually emerged in the early 1990s,
    when Caudell and Mizell [6], from Boeing, presented a head-up see-through display
    used to augment the visual field of an operator with information related to the
    task she/he was carrying out. It was not until the end of the 1990s when IAR started
    to gain some traction, mainly thanks to the German government, who funded the
    ARVIKA project [7], [8]. In such a project companies like Airbus, EADS, BMW or
    Ford participated in the development of mobile IAR applications [9]. Such a project
    represented an important milestone and promoted diverse IAR initiatives. The research
    efforts of ARVIKA derived in 2006 in the ARTESAS (Advanced Augmented Reality Technologies
    for Industrial Service Applications) project [10], which focused on the development
    of IAR technologies for automotive and aerospace maintenance. The first IAR systems
    were mostly experimental, but in the last years they started to move away from
    research and several relevant commercial initiatives have been launched. For instance,
    in 2013 Google Glasses [11] caught the attention of a broad audience that was
    not familiarized with AR or IAR and gained the enthusiasm of certain industries.
    Since then, technological giants have been actively developing AR prototypes and
    products [12]. Moreover, ABI Research [13] anticipates a fast-growing market with
    shipments forecast to expand from just over one million units in 2016 to more
    than 460 million by 2021 [14]. In addition, according to IDC [15], worldwide spending
    on AR and VR is forecast to reach US$ 17.8 billion in 2018 [16]. Furthermore,
    products and services will continue to grow at a similar rate throughout the remainder
    of the 2017-2021 forecast period, achieving a five-year Compound Annual Growth
    Rate (CAGR) of 98.8%. Nevertheless, according to numerous sources [17]–[19], it
    will take a few years until IAR reaches the maturity level to be fully deployed
    in industrial applications. B. Essential Parts of an AR System AR involves a set
    of technologies that make use of an electronic device to view, directly or indirectly,
    a real-world physical environment that is combined with virtual elements. The
    elements that make up an AR system are: An element to capture images (i.e., a
    Charge-Coupled Device (CCD), stereo, or depth-sensing camera). A display to project
    the virtual information on the images acquired by the capture element. Display
    technologies are divided basically into two types: video-mixed (example in Figure
    1) and optical see-through displays [20] (e.g., projection-based systems). There
    is also a growing interest in retinal projection, but its use is currently very
    rare in industrial environments. In a video-mixed display, the virtual and real
    information previously acquired with a camera are digitally merged and represented
    on a display. This technology presents, among others, the disadvantages of providing
    limited fields of vision and reduced resolutions. In contrast, in an optical see-through
    display, virtual information is superimposed on the user’s field of view by means
    of an optical projection system. The hardware used by these two display technologies
    can be classified as: Hand-Held Displays (HHD). They embed a screen that fits
    in a user’s hand (e.g., tablets, smartphones). Spatial Displays. They use digital
    projectors to show graphic information about physical objects. These displays
    ease collaborative tasks among users, since they are not associated with a single
    user. Head-Mounted Displays (HMD). They are the displays included in devices like
    smart glasses and smart helmets, which allow users to see the entire environment
    that surrounds them. A processing unit that outputs the virtual information to
    be projected. Activating elements (e.g., images, GPS positions, QR markers, or
    sensor values from accelerometers, gyroscopes, compasses, altimeters or thermal
    sensors) that trigger the display of virtual information. FIGURE 1. Example of
    video-mixed display. Show All Regarding the internal logic of an AR system, it
    is essentially composed by the functional modules shown in Figure 2. In such a
    Figure it is represented a pipeline where, first, the device camera captures a
    frame, which is then processed by the AR software to estimate the camera position
    regarding to a reference object (e.g., an AR marker). Such an estimation can also
    make use of internal sensors, which also help to track the reference object. Accurate
    camera positioning is essential while displaying AR content, since it has to be
    rotated and scaled according to the scenario. Usually, the image is rendered for
    the appropriate perspective and it is presented to the user on the display of
    a device. Note also that interaction with the image is possible through the Interaction
    Handling module and that, when certain local or remote information is required,
    the Information Management module is the one responsible for obtaining it. FIGURE
    2. Simplified AR pipeline. Show All In this pipeline, the major technological
    challenges are the internal registration of the objects displayed by the system,
    the tracking of visual elements and features, and the development of the information
    display system [21]. In addition, rendering (i.e., photometric registration, comprehensive
    visualization techniques, or view-management techniques) and real-time data processing
    are also challenging, since their performance is key when superimposing graphic
    elements in the environment in a rapid, consistent and realistic way. Thus, accurate,
    fast and robust registration and tracking are required to develop AR techniques
    that allow for determining the position and orientation of the observer and the
    real/virtual objects. Such techniques can be classified into: Techniques based
    on sensors (e.g., Inertial Measuring Unit (IMU), GPS, infrared, ultrasounds).
    Image-based techniques that make use of markers, which can be synthetic or natural.
    Sensor and image fusion techniques. In addition, there are different techniques
    for image recognition. Some are based in traditional AR markers, which usually
    are square or rectangular markers that contain a high-contrast figure similar
    to a QR code. These type of markers are usually framework-dependent and the software
    is, in most cases, optimized to recognize them by means of specific algorithms.
    On the contrary, Natural Feature Tracking (NFT) techniques [22], [23] extract
    characteristic points from images. Such points are then used to train the AR system
    to detect them in real time. NFT techniques have the disadvantage of being more
    computationally intensive and slower than other alternatives, and less effective
    at long distances, but they provide a seamless integration of the augmented information
    with the real world, since there is no need for placing an artificial marker visible
    in the scene [24]. In order to mitigate the disadvantages of NFT, small artificial
    markers called fiducial markers are often added to the scene to accelerate the
    initial recognition, improving the performance of the system and reducing the
    algorithm computational requirements. SECTION III. IAR for Industrial Applications
    The combination of the latest advances in electronics, sensors, networking, and
    robotics, together with paradigms like IoT, enable the development of advanced
    applications for industrial systems [25], energy efficiency [26], [27], home automation
    [28], precision agriculture [29], high-security IoT applications [30]–[34], transportation
    [35] or for defense and public safety [36], [37]. Among the enabling technologies,
    IAR has proven to be a suitable tool for the manufacturing strategies proposed
    by different countries (e.g., Industry 4.0 [38], Industrial Internet of Things
    [39], Made in China 2025 [40] or smart factories [41]), allowing workers to collaborate
    among them, to interact with real-time information and to monitor and control
    systems. Figure 3 summarizes the most relevant industrial tasks and sectors where
    IAR can bring value. FIGURE 3. Value of IAR across Industry 4.0. Show All One
    of the IAR most common applications is the assistance to workers in maintenance/repair/control
    tasks through instructions with textual, visual, or auditory information [42].
    Such an information is rendered ubiquitously, so that the worker perceives the
    instructions with less effort, thus avoiding the change from a real context to
    a virtual one where the relevant data is accessed. Remote assistance is also key
    when companies have machines installed in remote locations. Such machines need
    to be monitored, operated and repaired with the minimum amount of people on-site.
    IAR can help by easing remote collaboration between workers [43], [44]. Augmented
    communications can also be used for collaborative visualization in engineering
    processes during stages related to design or manufacturing [45]. Likewise, IAR
    is helpful for assisting workers in the decision making in real scenarios, combining
    the physical experience together with the display of information extracted in
    real time from databases [46]. Furthermore, IAR can provide quick access to documentation
    like manuals, drawings or 3D models [47]–[49]. Well-trained operators are also
    essential for productive factories. IAR can help during the training process by
    giving step-by-step instructions to develop specific tasks. This is especially
    useful when training workers to operate machinery like the one used for assembly
    in sequence, what reduces the time and effort dedicated to check manuals [50].
    Thus, IAR can reduce the training time for new employees and lower the skill requirements
    for new hires. In addition, it is possible to adjust the instructions to the experience
    of the worker, what accelerates the learning process by focusing more on acquiring
    skills. IAR training systems are also useful for preserving certain practical
    knowledge acquired by the most skilled (and usually aged) workers. What happens
    in different industries is that during the 1960s and 1970s there were massive
    hirings of workers that are currently retiring [51]. Such workers take with them
    a lot of experience, knowledge and skills that are difficult to reproduce in traditional
    ways. Therefore, IAR solutions can include such a knowledge in applications to
    train new hirings [52], [53]. Another area where IAR can help is marketing and
    sales, since AR demos are usually really attractive when showing other people
    a certain scenario or the capabilities of a product. Therefore, AR has the ability
    to transform the customer experience, enabling the inclusion of different parameters,
    options, settings or configurations [54]–[57]. Moreover, an improved customer
    experience is able to reduce the levels of uncertainty about their choices shortening
    the sales cycle. Furthermore, it can also be used to collect data about product
    preferences. A good marketing and sales example was created by BMW [58] for a
    campaign for selling its latest electric vehicles. After-sales service to the
    customers can be also enhanced through IAR, since it can guide them through repairs
    and can connect them with remote experts [59], [60]. Feedback can be also obtained
    by using an IAR interface, either by receiving it directly from the customers,
    or by analyzing how such consumers have used the product [61], [62]. The 3D models
    provided by IAR are a useful tool for engineers while creating and evaluating
    designs and products [19], [63]. IAR makes it possible to place a virtual object
    anywhere and observe at full scale whether it fits or not in a specific scenario.
    Moreover, IAR enables providing on-site CAD model corrections, thus improving
    accuracy, alignment and other details of the model [64], [65]. In addition, during
    product the different product manufacturing stages, IAR can help during the quality
    assurance controls and show performance dashboards [66]. Manufacturing can also
    be benefited from IAR, which IAR can deliver the right information at the right
    time to avoid mistakes and increase productivity [67]. This is especially critical
    in dangerous manufacturing tasks, where a mistake may mean that a worker gets
    injured or that a costly equipment is damaged. In addition, in such situations
    an IAR solution could be used as a monitoring and diagnosis tool capturing the
    information provided by control and management systems, and sensors [68]. For
    example, Frigo et al. [69] show some use cases in aerospace manufacturing processes.
    Assembly is one of the processes whose performance can be improved dramatically
    by IAR [70]. For example, some researchers have studied different methodologies
    for developing CAD model-based systems for assembly simulation [71]. In addition,
    it has already been evaluated the performance of Microsoft HoloLens for assembly
    processes [72]. Furthermore, a comprehensive review of AR-based assembly processes
    can be found in [73]. Regarding logistics, IAR can enhance the efficiency of the
    picking process in warehouse by providing an indoor guidance system [74]. Note
    that picking items represents from 55% to 65% of the total cost of warehousing
    operations [75], which are still mostly carried out through a pick-by-paper approach.
    Thus, IAR can give instructions to the workers and guide them using the best route.
    Finally, after reviewing the state of the art, the following aspects can be pointed
    out as essential in order to develop a successful IAR application: The use cases
    and applications selected must provide added-value services. Functional discontinuities
    or gaps in the operating modes that can affect the functionality should be avoided.
    Reduce cognitive discontinuities or differences between old and new work practices.
    Learning new procedures may hinder the adoption of the technology. Reduce physical
    side-effects caused by the devices on users in the short and long term (e.g.,
    headaches, nausea, or loss of visual acuity). Avoid unpredicted effects of the
    devices on users unfamiliar with the technology, like distractions, surprises
    or shocks. Take into consideration the user perception regarding ergonomic and
    aesthetic issues. Make user interaction as natural and user-friendly as possible,
    avoiding lapses or inconsistencies. SECTION IV. IAR for Shipbuilding In the last
    years, several IAR solutions have been presented to help in the accomplishment
    of daily tasks in a shipyard and in the shipbuilding industry. Some examples are
    the systems presented in [76]–[78], which facilitate welding processes. In particular,
    in [76] it is detailed a system that replaces the traditional welder’s screen
    with a helmet that incorporates a display where useful information is projected.
    Through the screen, a virtual assistant actively suggests corrections during the
    welding process and indicates possible errors. Similarly, in [77] it is described
    a system to control a welding robot inside a ship. The proposed system uses an
    interface that allows operators to interact with the workspace: the operator receives
    visual information from a projection system mounted on the robot and controls
    the robot using a wireless controller. Thus, the system is designed to increase
    the operator concentration on the actual task, avoiding the distractions related
    to the use of a traditional screen. Another relevant welding system is presented
    in [78], which is aimed at training welders. Such a system consists in a torch,
    a pair of AR glasses, a motion tracking system and external speakers. Welding
    is simulated in real time and uses a neural network to determine the quality and
    shape of the weld based on the speed and orientation of the torch. Another activity
    that takes place in a shipyard is spray painting. To simulate the working environment,
    in [79] it is proposed a system that uses a paint gun as user interface. Such
    a gun features force feedback and emits painting sound. During training, the student
    uses this gun to paint on virtual models of steel structures that are shown on
    the screen of the AR glasses, showing the results immediately, just upon the completion
    of the exercise. A system potentially applicable to the shipyard is the one proposed
    in [80]. It provides AR functionalities on a tablet, allowing the operator to
    place virtual geo-referenced notes in production modules as a method of communication
    between workers. The central element of the system adds and processes data from
    different sources, while the applications running on the tablets retrieve and
    display such an information for maintenance and for helping in plant processes.
    Regarding maintenance in industrial processes of the shipyard, many of them are
    described in paper or electronic documents that the operator must read and memorize
    to apply on the ongoing maintenance operations. This task is usually prone to
    human errors. To avoid them, the system described in [81] presents an IAR-based
    assistant that makes uses of a tablet to indicate step-by-step instructions that
    include the necessary information for carrying out an operation. Similarly, in
    [48] it is detailed an IAR application that provides assistance to military mechanics
    when performing repair and maintenance tasks on the field, inside an armored vehicle.
    The prototype proposed uses a wrist control panel and an HMD to augment the mechanic’s
    natural vision with animated text, labels, arrows and sequences to facilitate
    the understanding, localization and execution of tasks, which include installing
    and removing locks and warning lights, or connecting wires. Note that, since all
    those tasks have to be performed in the reduced interior space of an armored vehicle,
    the IAR prototype makes it easier for the mechanics to locate elements, which
    is also carried out faster than when making use of traditional documentation systems.
    Specific issues arise when building ships for the first time. A common situation
    is that construction and production processes often overlap over time. When discrepancies
    between the construction data and the actual ship happen, it is necessary to modify
    the CAD models. To solve this problem, the AR system detailed in [82] allows the
    user to visualize the pipe construction data and modify them in the case of misalignment
    or collision. The modified pipe geometry can be saved and used as an input for
    bending machines. To ensure the fitting of a pipe, the system integrates an optical
    measurement tool into the alignment process. All these tasks are performed by
    using an IAR application in a tablet with a built-in camera that, before the actual
    installation, allows for visualizing, modifying and verifying pipe segments virtually,
    being able to interact with them through a touch screen. Another problem in the
    naval industry is related to the diagrams used to help managers and engineers
    to identify the technical requirements and to understand what is going to be built.
    The correct interpretation of such diagrams is complicated, since they are expressed
    numerically when they are created during the design stage. In order to overcome
    this issue, the system detailed in [83] proposes an AR application based on mobile
    devices that is able to visualize 3D models created from design diagrams. The
    application does not make use of markers and augments every diagram with a 3D
    model that is shown through the display of the mobile device. The scanned designs
    are uploaded to the server with their characteristic points and are stored in
    databases along with the 3D model. For the recognition of the designs, a picture
    is taken with the camera of the mobile device and then it is performed a search
    in the database to locate a match. In the case of finding a match, the 3D model,
    together with its characteristic points, is transmitted to the mobile device for
    its interactive visualization. Finally, it is worth mentioning that companies
    like Newport News Shipbuilding [84], Index AR Solutions [85] or BAE Systems [86]
    have already marketed AR solutions focused on specific applications for the naval
    industry. SECTION V. IAR Use Cases for a Shipyard 4.0 After analyzing the state
    of the art and the processes carried out in workshops and in a ship, the following
    use cases were selected as the most promising in terms of possible efficiency
    improvements achieved through the application of IAR: 1) Quality Control Its objective
    is the automation of the quality control processes through the use of computer
    vision techniques. Product modeling would be carried out by using 3D cameras and
    reconstruction software. Once the actual model of the product is obtained, it
    would be possible to detect deviations from the CAD model. 2) Assistance in the
    Manufacturing Process This use case is intended to assist operators in the manufacturing
    process inside a workshop by visualizing 3D models on tangible interfaces located
    on the workbench. The use of tangible interfaces involves introducing a visual
    marker/identifier on the working environment that acts as a spatial reference
    for the IAR system. The marker can be printed on a fixed surface placed on the
    table of the manufacturing station or on a mobile support that allows for its
    manipulation by the operator. 3) Visualization of the Location of Products and
    Tools Thanks to an already developed system based on RFID tags [87]–[89], in Navantia’s
    shipyard in Ferrol it is possible to visualize the 2D-location of products and
    tools in portable devices such as tablets or IAR glasses (illustrated in Figure
    4). This system would make use of sensor values and artificial tags distributed
    throughout the workshop that allow for determining the positioning of the user
    in the shipyard. FIGURE 4. Localization of products inside a workshop using an
    IAR system. Show All 4) Management of Warehouses This use case is intended to
    assist warehouse operators in the processes of storage, localization, relocation
    and collection of parts. The immediate advantage of displaying information on
    IAR devices is a decrease in human errors and in the time associated with the
    different processes involved in the management of the warehouse. 5) Predictive
    Maintenance Using Data Mining The purpose of this use case is to carry out predictive
    maintenance actions using data mining techniques. To this end, information related
    to the quality control of the processes is collected as well as data from sensors
    in machines and throughout a workshop. Then, the information can be analyzed and
    shown through IAR devices to the operators. 6) Augmented Communication IAR facilitates
    augmented communication between operators and controllers/experts through portable
    IAR devices. It enables guidance or resolution of incidents on the spot, sharing
    the Point of View (POV) of the operator regardless of location, enabling the superposition
    of information over the actual image seen by the operator, recording annotations
    and audio/video communications. 7) Visualization of Installations in Hidden Areas
    This use case consists in the visualization of hidden installations behind bulkheads,
    roofs or ceilings, by overlapping 3D virtual elements over the real environment.
    The ideal IAR system would assist operators during the assembly processes, both
    during the pre-assembly and the block assembly, in order to reveal internal elements
    that would be difficult to see otherwise. In addition, such a system would ease
    maintenance or fault repairs. An example of scenario would be one in which, after
    the detection of a failure in a ship, the operator uses the proposed system to
    inspect the installations that are invisible to the naked eye in the affected
    area, deciding in a more agile and fast way the repair operation (Figure 5). FIGURE
    5. a) Real visualization b) Augmented visualization of hidden areas. Show All
    8) Remote Operation of IIoT and Smart Connected Products/Devices A virtual control
    panel (digital user interface) can be superimposed on the smart product to be
    operated directly using an IAR headset, hand gestures, voice commands, or even
    through another smart product. SECTION VI. Main IAR Technologies for Shipbuilding
    Applications A. Hardware Devices Traditionally, assembly and other industrial
    tasks were constrained due to computational and hardware limitations, thus requiring
    the use of cumbersome machinery. Tablets and smartphones were an improvement,
    but they can distract the worker’s attention, needing their hands to operate the
    device when switching between instructions and the industrial process itself.
    Head-Mounted Display (HMD) devices overcome such distractions by allowing users
    to view the information in a hands-free manner whilst simultaneously performing
    an operation. In addition, the glasses can make use of gestures, touch and voice
    recognition. In fact, the evolution of these latter devices will contribute to
    increase sales, which are expected to grow from 114,000 units shipped in 2015
    to 5.4 million units in 2020 [105]. Another approach would consist in utilizing
    projectors to display graphical information onto physical objects, known as Spatial
    Augmented Reality (SAR). SAR detaches the technology from the operators and enables
    seamless collaboration among them. However, the large extension of a shipyard
    makes it really difficult and expensive to deploy an effective system that covers
    most of the production areas, whereas an HMD device can be carried by the operator
    throughout the shipyard. In addition, recent improvements in HMDs and see-through
    displays provide appealing features that generate an immersive and personalized
    user experience that cannot be currently obtained through SAR. This section is
    aimed at providing an insight into the current state of IAR technology as far
    as hardware is concerned. To this end, it has been carried out a comparison of
    the latest HMD devices, either commercially available or that are scheduled to
    be launched for sale to the public soon. Table 1 shows a summary of the characteristics
    of the selected models. Such a table allows for concluding that the general characteristics
    of these devices are: The price of the devices ranges from 500to 4,900 (the price
    of the Daqri helmet is still unknown, but presumably more expensive). The average
    autonomy of these devices in full operation is about 4 hours. All devices include
    3-axis gyroscopes and IMUs with accelerometers with several DOF (Degrees of Freedom).
    The most commonly embedded sensors measure altitude, humidity, ambient light,
    pressure, infrared and proximity sensors. In addition, GPS receivers and compasses
    are also common. They include up to 1-2GB of RAM and up to 128GB of ROM. Some
    models support external memory expansion cards. All devices support Wi-Fi and
    Bluetooth connectivity. Other models, additionally, support LTE. All devices except
    for the FUJITSU Ubiquitousware HMD embed optical see-through displays, whose field
    of vision, resolution and color depth differ from one model to another. The quality
    of the embedded camera also varies remarkably depending on the model. It should
    be noted that: The Epson Moverio BT-2000 glasses include a deep-focus camera.
    The Daqri smart helmet includes an additional thermal camera and an Intel RealSense
    camera (which is a combination of three cameras: a traditional one and two infrared
    stereo cameras). Some models have built-in microphone and a headset. Others support
    such connections via an audio jack. Depending on the model, the navigation can
    be performed via buttons or gestures, or by using voice commands. TABLE 1 Characteristics
    of the Most Relevant HMD Devices for IAR It is worth mentioning that other authors
    [106], after performing a systematic review, point out five key characteristics
    that smart glasses should have when implementing applications for smart factories:
    The field of view should be as wide as possible, being 30° (horizontally) the
    recommended minimum for a good user experience. Since smart glasses are meant
    to be worn during the whole day, they should be as light as possible. Batteries
    should last through the working day. The video-based display technologies should
    be avoided, since they incur in delays that harm the user experience. Optical
    and retinal projection are then recommended. Voice-based interaction is recommended
    to free the operator hands, but it is currently a challenge to make it work properly
    in noisy industrial environments. Furthermore, some additional constraints regarding
    the implementation of applications for a shipyard environment should be remarked:
    Due to the limited memory of current IAR hardware devices, their use tends to
    be limited to reduced areas, which have to be mapped (usually on-the-fly) by using
    different sensors. It is possible to load data dynamically, as the operator enters
    a new production area, but that complicates the development and requires fast
    storage and processing hardware. Since IAR algorithms make use of computer vision
    techniques based in thresholding and color measurement metrics, the lighting characteristics
    (light of the environment, type of light, light temperature) can impact the system
    performance significantly. Most IAR systems are based on detecting physical characteristics
    of an object or a place. Such a detection is complex and compute intensive and,
    therefore, powerful hardware is required. Moreover, the detection of physical
    patterns is also influenced by ambient light, being often even more sensitive
    to changes in the environment than other marker-based detection techniques. Electrical
    interference produced by the industrial machinery inside the shipyard may affect
    sensor readings and their accuracy. There are IAR systems that complement visual
    pattern recognition with embedded sensor measurements. A problem may occur in
    a shipyard when a system relies on a GPS receiver or in Wi-Fi signals to locate
    a user or a room, since in certain environments (for instance, indoors or inside
    a ship under construction) such positioning techniques may not work properly.
    Some IAR systems rely on incremental tracking, combining information collected
    from different sensors and from the camera. Nonetheless, a dynamic environment
    like a shipyard workshop or a ship that is being built, where the geometrical
    structure of the place changes through time, can mislead the IAR system. Finally,
    it should be mentioned that the vast majority of current IAR hardware devices
    can be still considered experimental developments, what makes it difficult their
    integration with existing IAR frameworks and the implementation of new features.
    An open-source framework would make it possible to develop modifications to work
    with different platforms. B. Software Development Tools for IAR Nowadays, there
    are many libraries for the development of IAR applications, each implementing
    certain functionalities required in a specific scenario. In general, for the development
    of an IAR application it is necessary: 2D and 3D graphic libraries, which should
    enable real-time visualization and overlapping of virtual elements in the field
    of view. Recognition mechanisms to be able to follow objects or to superimpose
    information on them. Speech recognition, which is very useful when the user is
    not able to interact with physical controls. Gesture recognition is also useful
    when ambient noise prevents voice recognition. Reconstruction of 3D environments
    to get an understanding of the surroundings. Overlapping 3D virtual elements (with
    or without AR markers). All these features should be addressed by the different
    pieces of an IAR Software Development Kit (SDK), which is responsible for interacting
    with the hardware of the device to obtain data from the environment in order to
    show contextual information to the user depending on the surrounding scenario.
    The most relevant SDKs for developing IAR applications are shown in Table 2. They
    are compared according to several requirements. First, their license type: open-source
    (i.e., ARToolkit, ArUco, BazAr, UART, OpenSpace3D), free (i.e., ALVAR, Armedia,
    Vuforia, Wikitude), or commercial versions (i.e., Armedia, Vuforia, Wikitude,
    ZappCode Creator). Other criteria are the platforms supported (i.e., Android,
    iOS, Linux or Windows) and requirements about the marker generation, tracking
    or the overlaying capabilities. TABLE 2 Most Relevant SDKs for Developing IAR
    Applications Beyond the general requirements explained, the SDK should be compatible
    with the chosen HMD device (i.e., Vuforia is compatible with Epson Moverio, ODG
    R-7 and HoloLens). Moreover, the compatibility with Unity should be considered.
    Unity is currently one of the most advanced game engines in the market and it
    is possible to use it for developing and deploying IAR applications. Examples
    of SDKs with this feature are UART, Vuforia, ARKit or ARCore. Additionally, the
    SDK chosen should consider geo-location support for creating location-based IAR
    applications, and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to map an environment
    and track movements in order to enable indoor navigation. Examples of this feature
    can be seen in ARKit or Instant Reality. Cloud services and text recognition features
    should be also taken into account in scenarios where they are required. At the
    time of writing this article (December 2017), all of the referred SDKs are available.
    Nevertheless, the IAR landscape is constantly evolving and many SDKs available
    in the last years have gone away, changed (e.g., different license type) due to
    the shifting commercial priorities or have been overridden by newer projects (e.g.,
    ARToolkit has been recently acquired by Daqri). SECTION VII. IAR Architecture
    for a Shipyard 4.0 A. Traditional Communications Architecture The traditional
    IAR architecture is composed by the three different layers depicted on the left
    in Figure 6, which are responsible for data acquisition, data transport, and visualization
    and interaction with the user. FIGURE 6. Traditional IAR architecture. Show All
    The Visualization and Interaction System (VIS) layer is composed by HMD, HHD and
    spatial display devices, as well as by human-interaction interfaces through which
    the operator, located in the ship under construction, the workshop or the shipyard,
    is able to interact with the system. The Data Transport System (DTS) is responsible
    for collecting the information obtained by the Data Acquisition System (DAS) and
    transmitting it from the cloud infrastructure to the location where operators
    are using the IAR system. This process involves certain difficulties due to the
    environmental conditions: the shipyard’s structural barriers and the large number
    of metal parts that impact wireless communications performance. Moreover, it has
    to be taken into account the electrical interference produced by the industrial
    machinery used for the different production processes. It is worth mentioning
    that the communications between each IAR device and the cloud layer can be performed
    through Wi-Fi connections considering that many shipyards have already deployed
    an IEEE 802.11 b/g/n/ac infrastructure. However, note that communications inside
    a ship suppose a challenge for electro-magnetic propagation due to the presence
    of numerous large metal elements, so other technologies would need to be further
    studied in such environments. Considering that electrical wiring is usually deployed
    for temporary lighting during the ship construction, Power Line Communication
    (PLC) technology can be used to transmit information, although it should be noted
    that the network speed could be influenced by the electrical interference coming
    from electric circular saws and other tools that demand high-current peaks. Thus,
    a PLC system would consist of two modules connected electrically to the same power
    phase. The first module would have direct connection to the DAS via Ethernet.
    The second PLC module would be in the area of limited connectivity and would be
    coupled with a high-speed Wi-Fi access point to which the VIS can be connected
    to. Regarding the DAS layer, which is hosted in the shipyard’s cloud infrastructure,
    it can obtain from the Manufacturing Execution System (MES) data about work orders
    and the elements to be installed. Note that the described IAR architecture, although
    it has been previously implemented by making use of a central server, a cloud
    or a PC-cluster [43], [130], [131], it has certain limitations when applied to
    IAR systems. Since IAR devices project information dynamically on a display, they
    require it to be loaded and rendered as fast as possible to provide a good user
    experience. For this reason, the content to be displayed is usually stored locally,
    either in static or dynamic memory, which guarantees in most cases low-latency
    responses when loading data. However, although the local-storage approximation
    works fine in certain scenarios that only need static content, the information
    that flows through smart factories and other Industry 4.0 environments is dynamic,
    especially in cases when showing data that is collected from IIoT networks or
    other third-party systems (e.g., from the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) or
    the Product Lifecycle Management (PLM)). In addition, this traditional architecture
    can be enhanced by adding a proxy server that caches dynamically IAR information.
    Thus, when the IAR solution predicts that certain content will be required soon,
    a parallel process of the IAR device can download the data in the background.
    Nonetheless, such an approximation has several drawbacks. First, IAR mobile devices
    are usually limited in terms of computational power and battery life, so multi-thread
    or multi-process applications may reduce the overall performance and derive into
    increasing energy consumption. Second, caching algorithms involve certain degree
    of complexity, since content has to be synchronized periodically to guarantee
    that the latest version is the one loaded. And third, the prediction algorithm
    has to be accurate enough because unnecessary file exchanges imply wasting resources
    and energy. B. Advanced Communications Architectures Due to the constraints introduced
    by cloud-centered architectures in IAR applications, several researchers have
    studied alternatives that improve latency response and rendering performance.
    The most common approximation involves the use of local high-end PCs that store
    content and process video information [132], [133]. In the last years it has been
    proposed the use of the Edge Computing paradigm to enhance IAR systems [17], [45].
    Such a paradigm can be implemented through different approximations, including
    basically Fog Computing, Cloudlets and Mobile Edge Computing [134]. All these
    variants have the same objective: to move the cloud processing power to the edge
    of the network, as close as possible to the IAR devices. In the case of IAR Fog
    Computing based solutions, they make use of nodes scattered throughout a factory
    or industrial environment that process and store the information received from
    IAR devices before forwarding it to a Cloud. In the same way, the data received
    from the Cloud can be cached locally and then delivered to IAR devices on demand.
    The Mobile Edge Computing paradigm is similar, but the nodes are deployed in cellular
    network base stations. Regarding Cloudlets, they use similar hardware to Cloud
    Computing servers, but at a low scale and close to the user IAR devices. There
    are not many examples of IAR Edge Computing based systems, being currently the
    most relevant approach the one presented in [45]. In such a paper it is proposed
    an architecture that offloads the demanding real-time IAR algorithms to a high-end
    PC, which enables for decreasing end-to-end latency for video transmissions. Nonetheless,
    the authors conclude that their system works fine for handheld IAR devices, but
    that higher bit-rate communication interfaces and smaller network latencies are
    required for most HMD solutions. Therefore, the use of IAR Edge Computing still
    has to be further studied. C. Proposed Architecture for Future Shipbuilding IAR
    Applications Taking into account the considerations mentioned in the previous
    subsections, it can be proposed an IAR architecture that both reduces latency
    response and on-line rendering time. The architecture, depicted in Figure 7, makes
    use of Fog Computing nodes and Cloudlets. Fog computing nodes are ideal for providing
    IAR services thanks to its ability to support physically distributed, low-latency
    and QoS-aware applications that decrease the network traffic and the computational
    load of traditional Cloud computing systems. Cloudlets offload the rendering from
    resource-constraint IAR devices and also reduce latency response with respect
    to a Cloud. Such an Edge Computing architecture is composed by three layers. FIGURE
    7. Architecture of the IAR system proposed. Show All The layer at the bottom is
    the Node Layer, which includes all the IAR devices that interact with the services
    provided by the Edge Computing Layer. The Edge Computing Layer also exchanges
    data with the shipyard’s IIoT ecosystem, which is composed by all the elements
    that can be monitored and/or controlled remotely, like sensors, actuators, robots
    or additive manufacturing devices. It is worth emphasizing that the architecture
    connects IAR devices with the Edge Computing Layer through a WiFi AP because it
    is already deployed in many industries and thus it is highly likely that an IEEE
    802.11 standard (i.e., IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ad) would be used. However, any
    other wireless communication technology could be used in the architecture and
    further research should be performed about this topic in shipyards, especially
    inside ships that are being built, since electro-magnetic propagation is a challenge
    in such environments with so many metal elements. One alternative that is currently
    being evaluated by Navantia is PLC, but its application still has to be studied
    in detail in situations where electric interference from saws and other tools
    occur. The Edge Computing Layer is in the middle of the architecture, and it is
    actually divided into two sub-layers that can interact with each other, but whose
    objective is different. The Fog Computing sub-layer is composed by one or several
    Single-Board Computers (SBCs) that are installed in fixed positions throughout
    the shipyard workshops and in a ship. Each SBC acts as a gateway and provides
    fog services. In the case of the IAR service, it supplies IAR devices with localized
    data and responds faster than the cloud, thus acting as a proxy caching server
    for IAR data. The second sub-layer is composed by Cloudlets, which are local high-end
    computers specialized in rendering and performing compute intensive tasks. Note
    that shipbuilding requires handling sophisticated 3D CAD models that may be too
    complex for resource-constrained IAR devices, so, instead of rendering the objects
    locally in every IAR device, the tasks are delegated to a cloudlet that then delivers
    the resulting image to the IAR device faster than the cloud. In addition, cloudlets
    can also perform other processing tasks that are too heavy to be performed in
    an SBC and that require a fast response. The cloud is at the top of the architecture.
    It receives, processes and stores data from the Edge Computing Layer. The cloud
    also provides third-party services to IAR devices. For instance, in the case of
    a shipbuilder like Navantia, such services include the access to the content of
    the ERP (SAP ERP), the CAD models (through FORAN), the information of the PLM
    (Windchill) and to the IIoT platform (ThingWorx). Finally, note that a modern
    IAR architectures have also to take security into account. This aspect is often
    neglected, but the future dependency on IAR systems make security essential. This
    has been addressed recently by some researchers [17], but further study is required,
    especially in industrial environments. SECTION VIII. Conclusions This article
    reviewed the different aspects that influence the design of an IAR system for
    the Industry 4.0 shipyard, considering diverse scenarios like workshops and a
    ship. It was first presented a brief overview of the underlying technologies and
    the main industrial IAR applications. Next, the article analyzed the most relevant
    academic and commercial IAR developments for the shipbuilding industry. Then,
    different use cases of IAR for a shipyard were described and a thorough review
    of the main IAR hardware and software solutions was presented. After such a review,
    it can be concluded that there are many options for developing software IAR developments,
    but IAR hardware, although it has progressed a great deal in the last years, it
    is still not ready for a massive deployment like the one required by the Industry
    4.0 shipyard. Regarding the communications architecture for an IAR system, it
    was analyzed the traditional version and it was proposed an enhanced three-layer
    Edge Computing architecture based on Cloudlets and on the Fog Computing paradigm,
    which allows for supporting physically distributed, low-latency and QoS-aware
    applications that decrease the network traffic and the computational load of traditional
    cloud computing systems. Moreover, considering that fog gateways are usually constraint
    in terms of computing power, if an IAR system demands real-time rendering or compute-intensive
    services, Cloudlets are necessary. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords

    a critical role in modern society and enables a range of applications from infrastructure
    to social media. Such system must cope with varying load and evolving usage reflecting
    societies’ interaction and dependency on automated computing systems whilst satisfying
    Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees. Enabling these systems are a cohort of conceptual
    technologies, synthesized to meet demand of evolving computing applications. In
    order to understand current and future challenges of such system, there is a need
    to identify key technologies enabling future applications. In this study, we aim

    will influence future cloud computing systems. Further, we identify several technologies
    driving these paradigms and invite international experts to discuss the current
    status and future directions of cloud computing. Finally, we proposed a conceptual

    Intelligence 1. Introduction The last two decades have seen active research in
    the definition and evolution of cloud computing. Driven by innovation in networking
    and distributed architectures, cloud computing is a manifestation of distributed
    systems research since the initial conception of the client server model in 1958
    [2]. Due to the rapid growth of cloud computing, it has been adopted as an important
    utility across all aspects of society, from academia, governmental institutions
    and industry. Characteristics of cloud computing such as dynamic, metered access
    to a shared pools of computing resources [1] have enabled the realization of new
    technologies and paradigms to fulfill the demands of emerging applications including
    scientific, healthcare, agriculture, smart city, and traffic management [3]. Presently,
    well-known cloud providers such as Facebook, Google and Amazon utilize large-scale
    Cloud Data Centers (CDCs) to provision heterogeneous Quality of Service (QoS)
    requirements. Furthermore, cloud computing platforms are able to provide a unified
    interface over heterogeneous resource found in the Internet of Things (IoT)-based
    applications which improve the reliability of cloud services [4]. There is a need
    to sign a Service Level Agreement (SLA) between cloud user and provider to deliver
    the required service in specified time and budget based on QoS parameters. Substantial
    growth in end-user demand and data volume has resulted in the creation of more
    CDCs at ever growing scale, which in turn increases system energy consumption,
    CO2 emissions, and waste heat that requires cooling infrastructure for removal.
    To address the problem of energy consumption, there is a need for new resource
    scheduling policies to reduce the energy consumption without impacting QoS such
    as deadline, reliability, availability, cost, security and privacy [5]. To increase
    the reliability of the cloud computing systems, there is a need to develop new
    fault tolerant mechanisms, which can maintain the cloud service quality during
    the occurrence of hardware or software faults. Moreover, security can be improved
    by using new technology called Blockchain (it is distributed ledgers within Cloud)
    to protect the communication from attackers, which can further increase reliability
    of the computing systems [46]. The diversity of large distributed application
    means there is a requirement for effective big data analytics mechanisms to process
    the required data in an efficient manner using innovative data processing techniques
    [61,66]. Further, new programming models such as serverless computing enable new
    patterns of resource consumption, autonomically driven by application utilization.
    Lightweight virtualization provided by container technologies, can improve utilization
    in clouds, and enable low latency provisioning of application environments [150].
    Further, the emergence of fog computing reduces the latency and response time
    of processing in IoT devices but still research challenges within this domain
    are not solved effectively. New resource provisioning and scheduling polices are
    required for fog and cloud computing using Artificial Intelligence (AI) based
    deep learning techniques to predict the resource requirement in advance for geographically
    disparate resources [47,140]. Cloud Computing is emerging as a new tool for solving
    the complex challenges faced by the Earth Sciences researchers both in the context
    of compute and analysis [139]. It offers a promising hope for the community which
    presently relies on dedicated supercomputers coming at a huge cost and can regularly
    go through slag periods or inefficiencies. The introduction of cloud computing
    as a supplicant or replacement of dedicated supercomputers is an interesting hypothesis.
    Due to continuous growing research in the field of cloud computing, there are
    various new research areas such as quantum computing, software-defined network,
    software engineering, bitcoin currency, 5G network and beyond are emerged. 1.1.
    Our contributions Earlier methodical surveys and system reviews have been identified
    previous innovations, however innovations in the field of cloud computing require
    a revisit of paradigms (IoT, AI, and Blockchain) driving cloud computing. There
    is a requirement for a systematic review to evaluate, upgrade, and integrate the
    existing research presented in this field with respect to the emerging paradigms
    and technologies such as IoT, AI and Blockchain. This systematic review presents
    an updated study to evaluate and discover the research challenges based on the
    available existing research along with the evolution and history of computing
    systems as per new frontiers as an amalgamation of these technologies having a
    high impact on cloud computing and related domains. Finally, we offers critical
    insights and points out possible future work. We proposed a conceptual model which
    integrates and enables computation using a plethora of technological advancements
    and provides an enhanced and holistic setup for next generation computing environments.
    The motivation behind this systematic review is to study the history of computing
    and identify how the emergence of triumvirate “IoT + AI + Blockchain” will transform
    cloud computing to solve complex problems of next generation computing. Further,
    the international experts of different cloud computing research areas come together
    and discuss the existing research and proposed future research directions for
    academicians, practitioners and researchers working in the field of cloud computing.
    This is the first systematic review which explores the evolution of computing
    paradigms and technologies and the influence of triumvirate (Blockchain, IoT and
    Artificial Intelligence) to the evolution of cloud computing. The rest of the
    article is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the background of cloud computing
    paradigms and techniques and their evolution. Section 3 presents the drivers (IoT,
    AI and Blockchain) of cloud computing. Section 4 presents the impact of new paradigms
    and technologies on cloud computing along with their future research opportunities
    and open challenges. Section 5 presents the insights of triumvirate to the cloud
    computing evolution. Section 6 presents a conceptual model for cloud futurology.
    Finally, Section 7 summarizes the research article. 2. Background: history of
    decades Computing systems have evolved from year 1958 to improve the use of hardware
    resources in an efficient way. During these decades of computing, there have been
    various types of computing paradigms and technologies have been developed and
    invented, which contributes extensively to the current research in the field of
    computing. 2.1. Evolution of computing paradigms and technologies: a journey Initially,
    one system can execute one specific task at a time and multiple systems are needed
    to run parallelly to execute multiple tasks concurrently [1]. A secure communication
    network is required to exchange data among different computing systems. Fig. 1
    shows the evolution of computing technology along with their objectives and focus
    of study from year 1958. • Client server: This is distribution application or
    centralized system developed in 1960 to divide the workloads or tasks among resource
    providers (servers) and clients are service requesters [1]. Computer network is
    used to communicate between servers and clients and server shares resources with
    clients to execute their workloads in a load balancing manner [2]. Email and World
    Wide Web (WWW) are two important examples of client server model. In this model,
    clients cannot communicate with each other directly [7]. • Supercomputer: It is
    a system with high performance computing capability to execute computationally
    intensive tasks in different scientific fields such as molecular modeling, climate
    research and quantum mechanics [3]. Energy usage and heat management in supercomputers
    remained a main research challenge thought its evolution since 1960 [7]. The important
    examples of supercomputers are Multivac, HAL-9000 and The Machine Stops [2]. •
    Proprietary mainframe: This is large-high speed computer, which can further support
    various devices and workstations, are used to process large amount of data such
    as transaction processing, consumer statistics and census [4]. Mainframe computers
    can provide reliability and security and achieves high throughput through virtualization
    [7]. In year 2017, IBM launched latest version of mainframe IBM z14 [2]. The performance
    of mainframe computer is excellent, but these computers are quite expensive. •
    Cluster computing: This technology uses fast local area network to communicate
    available computing nodes and clustering middleware is used to make coordination
    among different computing nodes [5]. The main objective of cluster computing is
    to execute a single task using different interconnected computing nodes to improve
    the performance of computing environment [1]. • Open massively parallel processing
    (MPP) and symmetric multi-processing (SMP): There are two main types of parallel
    processing environments: massively parallel processing (MPP) and symmetric multiprocessing
    (SMP) systems [1], [2], [3]. In SMP environment, other hardware resources (disk
    space, memory) are shared by multiple processors but using a single operating
    system. The sharing of resources effects the computing speed of the completion
    of a particular job [7]. In MPP environment, only file system is shared but there
    is no sharing of resources during execution of job. The scalability can be improved
    by adding computers and related disk and memory resources. • Grid computing: This
    technology enables to achieve a common objective using distributed computing resources
    and executes non-interactive workloads, which contains huge number of files [4,5].
    The single grid is dedicated to an execution of a specific application [7]. Grid
    computing provides services such as resource allocation and management service,
    secure infrastructure and monitoring and discovery service. • Commodity clusters:
    It is also called commodity cluster computing, which offers low cost computation
    of user workloads by using huge numbers of computing resources in a concurrent
    manner [2,4]. Different vendors are using open standards to manufacture commodity
    computers to reduce the variation among products of vendors [7]. Presently, off-the-shelf
    commodity computers are available to fulfill the business computing requirements
    quickly. • Peer to peer: It is a distributed architecture to divide the workload
    or task among different peers or computing nodes and peers can communicate with
    each other directly at application layer [4,7]. In Peer to peer architecture,
    peers can access different resources such as processing power, disk storage or
    network bandwidth without the requirement of central coordinator. TCP/IP network
    is using to exchange data among peers. The main applications of peer to peer architecture
    are multimedia, file-sharing networks and content delivery. • Web services: This
    technology enables the communication among different electronic devices through
    World Wide Web using different types of machine-readable file formats such as
    JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and Extensible Markup Language (XML) [1,2].
    Basically, web service provides the user interface to end user for the interaction
    with database server [7]. • Virtualized clusters: It is an implementation of a
    real computing system to perform similar functions using virtualized environment
    [1]. Virtualized cluster enables the sharing of resources among different Virtual
    Machines (VM) to execute workloads or tasks [2]. VM hypervisor provides the software
    layer-based virtualization to execute on top of operating system or on the bare
    metal [7]. VM based computing systems saves resource cost and executes the large
    number of workloads using same resources. • HPC system: This is the tool which
    is used to solve large problems (which requires high computing power) of business,
    engineering and science [5]. High Performance Computing (HPC) system contains
    different types of computing resources to solve different types of problems and
    access these resources are controlled by batch system or scheduler [5,7]. HPC
    systems are sharing resources and it can access different resources remotely and
    execute workloads or tasks using scheduling of parallel resources. • IaaS, PaaS,
    SaaS: There are different types of web services, which can be accessed via Internet
    such as SaaS (Software as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service) and IaaS (Infrastructure
    as a Service) [6]. SaaS offers software functionality as a service without any
    maintenance and initial cost with high quality and an example of SaaS is Gmail.
    PaaS offers the framework, where user can deploy their application with required
    scalability and an example of PaaS is Microsoft. IaaS offers infrastructure resources
    such as network, memory, storage and processor to execute workloads or tasks in
    a cost and time optimized manner and an example of IaaS is Amazon. • Cloud computing:
    The cloud services are generally denoted by – XaaS where X = {I, P, S…} and practice
    of using remote resources to execute user tasks (processing, management and storage
    of data) through Internet [6]. Cloud computing enables sharing of resources to
    reduce execution cost and increase availability of service. There are four different
    types of cloud computing models: public, private, hybrid and community. The Quality
    of Service (QoS) parameters such as reliability, security and energy efficiency
    are important to deliver an efficient cloud service. • Fog computing: This is
    latest architecture which performs significant amount of storage and computation
    using end devices or fog nodes and Internet is used to establish communication
    among these devices [151]. Fog computing comprise of data plane and control plane
    [6]. Data plane provide services at the edge of network to reduce latency and
    increase QoS, while control plane is part of router and decides network topology
    [8]. Further, fog computing supports Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as
    mobile phones, sensors, health monitoring devices. • Internet of Things: IoT devices
    are network devices such as actuators, software, home appliances and sensors and
    Internet connectivity is used to exchange data among these network devices [8].
    There are number of applications of IoT in different fields such as agriculture,
    healthcare, weather forecasting, transportation, smart home and industrial robotics
    [152,153]. • Edge computing: It is a distributed computing paradigm, which performs
    computation on distributed edge devices and it enables the data collection and
    communication over network [6]. Further, edge computing moves the large volume
    of data by processing at edge devices instead of cloud server, which improves
    the QoS, reduce latency and transmission cost [8,154,155]. The time sensitive
    applications can take more advantage from edge computing, but it needs continuous
    Internet connection to perform dedicated functions within given time. Download

    3. Triumvirate: IoT + AI + Blockchain Cloud computing becomes an intelligent computing
    with the emergence of innovative technologies and paradigms such as Internet of
    Things, Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence. 3.1. Internet of Things (IoT)
    The modern Internet integrates objects known as Things, equipped with sensing,
    actuating and networking capabilities with dynamic monitoring and control services.
    Such devices are pervasive in modern life and can be found in homes, public transport,
    motorways and vehicles [22]. As such, IoT applications are able to operate across
    heterogeneous domains and enable rich analyses and management of complex interactions
    [150]. Thus, IoT devices and service are able to address challenges in a wide
    range of application domains, including e-health, infrastructure, building management
    systems, manufacturing and transport [23], [24], [25]. The Internet of Things
    possess several characteristics central to their operation, including: (I) Systems
    are often highly dynamic and network membership must cope with volatility, where
    a device may appear and reaper across several networks [24], (II) devices are
    highly heterogeneous in terms of both computing performance and functional capabilities,
    and as such system must cope with limited processing, memory and persistent storage
    [26] and (III) Systems are managed and controlled by multiple stakeholders, requiring
    federated mechanisms for secure management of collected IoT data [25]. Historically
    IoT applications have offloaded processing, and persistent storage to cloud services,
    however as the number of ‘Things’ grows, these services fail to support real time
    demand of IoT devices [24, 27]. This is because such systems operate in physical
    environments, across large geographic ranges, and as such require low latency
    response times, and have high density data ingestion requirements/bandwidths [46].
    Fog/Edge computing extends cloud system boundaries, by decentralizing resource
    orchestration from datacenters to edge networks [25]. Organized as hierarchal
    networks of Fog nodes or cloudlets [28] providing deployment of ingestion, processing
    and management services. Geographic locality allows lower response latencies and
    increase''s ingestion bandwidth by horizontally scaling resources, whilst consuming
    less energy and enabling resource mobility when compared to cloud services. These
    characteristics enable IoT applications to scale in terms of a both logical scale
    and geographic range, whilst providing real-time response latencies, and as such
    Fog/Edge computing can be considered a future architecture of IoT applications
    [23]. Smart e-health applications are able to monitor patient data in real-time,
    by collecting data from implantable and wearable devices forming personal area
    networks [61]. Smart-Gateways collect and perform local processing of data collected
    from devices, including noise filtering from medical devices, data compression
    and fusion, and analyses allowing detection of dangerous trends in a patient''s
    health. Whilst long term trends can be analyzed at cloud layers [22,29]. Furthermore,
    Fog enabled IoT systems are adaptable and can change their behavior according
    to state determined by collected sensors’ data. For instance, a smart gateway
    collecting samples from a pacemaker can increase its sample prior to a heart attack,
    detected via pre-processing at the fog layer [22,25,29]. The Internet of Energy
    (IoE) paradigm introduces the notion of smart grids and energy management [30].
    In which distributed networks energy generators capable of monitoring power consumption
    and generator, or battery capacity and providing coarse grained statistics about
    grid health. Whilst ‘Smart-Meters’ are able to monitor capacity, generation and
    usage at a finer granularity and report energy demands to utility providers [25,30,31].
    As such, IoT is enabling technology of future systems, such as electronic vehicles,
    and micro-grids. Furthermore, such a grid can provide safer, more reliable and
    robust power delivery, to meet changing consumer demands [32]. The interested
    readers can further explore using extensive surveys on IoT [8,22,[24], [25], [26].
    3.2. Blockchain Recently Fog, Edge and Cloud computing paradigms have gained significant
    popularity both in industry and academia. With their increased usage in real-life
    scenarios; security, privacy and integrity of data in such frameworks has gained
    high importance [9]. Malicious deletion, theft and corruption of data due to ransomware,
    trojans and viruses, etc. has been a menace in this domain [10]. Maintaining integrity
    of data and ensuring that data is not sent by unregistered source are very important
    for the credibility of the systems [14]. Being used in mission critical applications
    like hospital care, Smart cities, transportation, surveillance, the tolerance
    in such systems is very low. As most Edge devices have compute and storage limitations;
    difficult constraints arise in providing an optimal scheme for data protection
    and maintaining integrity. To ensure data is protected, Blockchain technology
    has been adopted in the IoT domain and other real time systems. Theoretically,
    Blockchain is a suite of distributed ledgers that can record and track the value
    of a commodity [11,129]. Whenever new data is added to the system, it is converted
    to a Block where a Proof of Work (PoW) is created, which is a hash value difficult
    to produce without changing the PoW of all blocks preceding it in the ledger.
    Miners in the Fog system mine the blocks and generate and validate such PoWs.
    Once a miner completes the proof of work, it publishes the new block in the network
    and the rest of the network verifies its validity before adding it to the chain.
    Moreover, this fraudulent manipulation of data in a Blockchain will not be successful
    unless 50% of its distributed copies are individually reformed by following the
    same set of operations. Thus, it becomes very hard to alter any data in Blockchain
    within rigid time limit. To support and operate with the Blockchain, network peers
    must provide, the following functionality: routing, storage, wallet services and
    mining [12]. Despite such problems there have been many efforts to provide robust
    frameworks that integrate Blockchain with Fog computing [15], [16], [17]. Most
    such frameworks like FogBus in [15] maintain a dynamically allocated mining strategy
    where some nodes which are less utilized at a point of time mine and validate
    the chains and others are used for load distribution, compute and data collection.
    If any worker reports error in terms of Blockchain tampering or signature forgery,
    then the Blockchain in majority of the network is copied to that node. Other additional
    features that they provide are encryption with dynamic exchange of public key
    pairs for identity authentication. Although, the key concept of Blockchain is
    simple, it faces from several challenges while integrating with Fog computing
    frameworks. Storage capacity and scalability are highly debated due to high cost
    and maintenance overheads [13]. Even though, only full nodes (nodes that can fully
    validate the transactions or blocks) store the full chain, the storage requirements
    are significant. Another weakness of Blockchain is the anonymity and privacy of
    data. Privacy as such is not embedded in the design of Blockchain and hence third-party
    software are required to achieve this. This may lead to unoptimized implementations
    which are more expensive in terms of compute and storage requirements. Many open
    challenges and directions are still existing where Blockchains can be improved
    in IoT frameworks. Resource limitation is the main limiting factor for high quality
    data protection and reliability. Due to resource constraints, highly sophisticated
    encryption or key generation cannot be integrated with such chains of data. Only
    limited cryptographic algorithms can be deployed. More efficient algorithms can
    be developed keeping in mind of the resource constraints. Another important direction
    is the modification of such chains in high fault rate settings where the edge
    nodes can be compromised at any instant of times. Revalidating blocks and copying
    chains from the majority network leads to large overhead on network and I/O bandwidth
    requirements. Most frameworks also work in a Master–Slave fashion and hence have
    single point of failure. This is natural in heterogeneous environments. Significant
    research is needed to ensure redundancy while keeping in views the costs and reliability
    trade-offs. Also, the Blockchain vulnerabilities still affect Fog frameworks [18].
    Effective consensus mechanisms need to be developed that can validate blocks with
    limited sharing and copying of blocks. The interested readers can further explore
    using extensive survey on Blockchain [179]. 3.3. Artificial Intelligence Artificial
    Intelligence (AI) aims to make IoT and Fog nodes aware of the workload environment
    and continuously adapt to provide better QoS characteristics, reduce power consumption
    or overall cost of the infrastructure. AI encompasses various search algorithms,
    machine learning, reinforcement learning and planning [146]. In the modern world
    of data intensive tasks with growing fog and cloud deployments, more and more
    intelligence are required at different levels to provide optimum task scheduling
    decisions, VM migrations, etc. to optimize mentioned previously under various
    constraints. These constraints can range from computation capabilities, bandwidth
    limits to SLA or deadline requirements of tasks. There have been several works
    that aim at leveraging AI techniques to improve the performance of fog and cloud
    systems [144,145,[147], [148], [149]. Different works focus on optimum scheduling
    policies for cloud, virtualization algorithms, distribution systems among others.
    They use search methods like genetic algorithms, supervised machine learning and
    even deep reinforcement learning to optimize their objective functions [154,155].
    AI provides a lucrative avenue to optimize large systems with huge amounts of
    data with engineering simplicity and efficiency by allowing automated decision
    making instead of human encoded heuristics which provide more efficient decisions
    very quickly. Cloud computing is growing quickly, and CDCs become an important
    part of eminent industries such as Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Amazon [58]. However,
    it is difficult to monitor the performance of large-scale cloud data centers manually.
    Yotascale is a next generation computing and automatic performance monitor solution
    to reduce the accountability on humans. Yotascale uses historical data to make
    forward predictions or decisions about cloud costs using Artificial Intelligence
    and helps to save more cost. Further, real-time analysis can be done using Yotascale
    to detect anomalous trends using deep learning techniques (supervised/unsupervised
    techniques or prediction models), finds the root cause and gives future predictions
    about cloud usage and its cost. The interested readers can further explore using
    extensive surveys on AI [180,181]. 4. Impact of new paradigms and technologies
    on cloud computing: open challenges and trends Cloud computing is evolving very
    rapidly, and various number of researchers and academicians are working actively
    to solve the research challenges existing within the cloud computing domain. We
    have identified various research areas related to cloud computing, which utilizes
    its available technologies and paradigms in an efficient manner to solve the current
    problems. Fig. 2 shows the emerging research areas for future practitioners, industries,
    academicians and researchers. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Emerging
    research areas. We have given the foundations of emerging paradigms and technologies
    for researchers, academicians and practitioners in this section and their corresponding
    future research directions and open challenges are presented at the end of every
    subsection. 4.1. QoS and SLA Quality of Service (QoS) is an important challenge
    of cloud computing systems, which can predict the performance of the system at
    runtime [6]. The QoS parameters such as execution time, cost, scalability, elasticity,
    latency, reliability etc. can measures the performance of the computing system
    [46]. QoS parameters are defined using Service Level Agreement (SLA), which is
    an official document signed between cloud user and provider based on different
    QoS parameters [157]. In this era, there are wide range of IoT applications which
    have different QoS parameters based on their domain, purpose and requirement [52]
    with more stringent security requirement which can utilize Blockchain and related
    technologies. Further, SLA can be measured using a metric called SLA violation
    rate, which can estimate the deviation of actual SLA from the required (estimated/predicted)
    and decides about the compensation in case of SLA violation [53]. QoS is progressively
    important when comprising cloud services because damaging QoS in one of the services
    can hazardously affect the QoS of whole computing system. To offer an efficient
    cloud service, there is a need to provision the required amount of cloud resources,
    which can fulfill the QoS of an application such as budget, response time and
    deadline [55,56]. Therefore, cloud providers must ensure to provision enough resources
    to avoid or reduce the SLA violation rate in order to execute the user workloads
    within their specified deadline and budget. The future of next-generation computing
    systems depends on the QoS-aware resource management mechanisms, which can identify
    and satisfy the QoS requirements of the computing system [6,58]. There are various
    research challenges [59,61,63,66,67] are existing which hinders the achievement
    of QoS in an efficient manner. Firstly, there is an unavailability of cloud resources
    to execute an application at runtime, which increases the execution time and reduce
    the performance of the system. Secondly, there is a need of an efficient SLA-aware
    resource management mechanisms reduces the SLA violation rate and maintain the
    performance of the computing system. Thirdly, there are different SLA standards
    for the different cloud providers and there is a need of centralized SLA standard
    to achieve the common goal of multi-cloud environment. Finally, there is a need
    to find out the trade-off among different QoS requirements due to wide range of
    IoT applications are running on cloud computing systems using AI based supervised/unsupervised
    learning techniques or prediction models. Open challenges and trends: The interested
    readers can further explore using extensive survey on QoS and SLA [166]. The open
    challenges and future research directions for QoS and SLA are summarized as follows:
    1. There is a need to find out the trade-off among different QoS requirements
    due to wide range of IoT applications are running on cloud computing systems.
    2. Applications should be able to provide optimum QoS and SLA characteristics
    with minimal overhead for maintaining data integrity with Blockchain. 3. AI based
    approaches have entirely changed the landscape of IoT applications, also the portable
    devices for transmitting multimedia content in IoT application has become very
    necessary for the end-users. 4.2. Fog computing Fog computing is the form of distributed
    computing paradigm which acts as a middle layer between IoT devices and the cloud
    data centers [150]. Fog is supplement to the cloud, not a replacement. Fog can
    never replace cloud completely as we still need cloud to handle big or complex
    data problem. Fog just provides more or less services which cloud does not provide
    in the same time limit or latency requirements [151]. Fog reduces latency so the
    applications which need low response time (as real-time applications i.e., traffic
    system, emergency system, healthcare system etc.) go for fog services instead
    of cloud services. However, it fails when the data is very heavy to process by
    its local nodes [46]. If the application is not time sensitive, then use of computing
    services of cloud datacenter is more beneficial. The term cloudlet is used to
    denote small data centers, which have almost the same types of features as the
    large data center, but in small capacity, like they can process small data not
    very large data [61]. They are close to the site of data production. Cloudlet
    can be single computer or group of computers with Internet connectivity. Cloudlets
    reduce the incoming bandwidth required by the centralized data center. It was
    becoming very difficult to timely handle large amount of data in centralized cloud
    environment. Huge data production by IoT devices is also the reason to accept
    fog computing paradigm as these data cannot be handled by the current cloud system
    even with high computation ability [128]. Apart from low latency, various services
    like mobility support, security, good performance and low bandwidth requirement
    are also provided by the fog. Fog generally provides a resource rich middle layer
    between the end devices and the cloud system to meet the above objectives. It
    acts as a bridge between end users and the cloud system. Fog nodes are also attached
    with the cloud with the help of Internet to use its computing power and storage
    services. Fog nodes generally analyses the data produced by these end devices
    and sensors [152]. Then the important output data is sent to cloud so that further
    processing and storage can be taken place. Therefore, the concept of edge computing
    came into existence. It provides the computing service at the edge of network
    [129]. Many applications need very less response time, it is not possible to handle
    them at very far located data center and reply them back on time. Thus, small
    data center, cloudlet with little processing power are established at the edge
    or near data generation site. They can handle these applications in time. Possible
    areas where this type of system is needed such as healthcare system [61,153],
    traffic system, emergency system etc. But the problem with technology is that
    it needs more complex resource management strategy. Cloudlet also faces some issues
    which are as following: (1) VM handling services must be easily transferable from
    one cloudlet to another cloudlet as these devices are mobile, they also need to
    switch among cloudlets for easy operation. (2) Since, there can be any number
    of cloudlets near end user devices, so there must be a policy to first search,
    choose and then join with the best cloudlet from many cloudlets before the provisioning.
    (3) Cloudlets are needed to be more efficient in provisioning as they are connected
    with the mobile devices. Thus, the behavior of these devices is quite dynamic
    as they are mobile. In IoT applications, every simple entity can also become part
    of it using a device like Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) tag etc. That
    can act like data connecting device which will connect these simple devices via
    Internet. Number of devices connected to IoT is increasing exponentially. This
    cannot be handled by IoT alone, therefore, amalgamation with fog and cloud is
    done to perform the action efficiently which reduces latency and response time.
    Moreover, security threats on such devices have risen in recent years leading
    to increased requirements of security and data integrity technologies like Blockchain.
    As this amalgamation becomes more popular different challenges arise. With the
    rise in compute requirements, more and more tasks need to be executed with better
    QoS. The scheduling of these applications is complex due to several factors. Firstly,
    due to the heterogeneity of the computation resources and the hierarchy of fog
    nodes, there is significant differences in the compute capabilities, speed, response
    time and energy consumption between edge and cloud resources. Moreover, the mobility
    of the IoT devices changes the response time and bandwidth capacities dynamically.
    Furthermore, the tasks are stochastic in nature of their arrival, expected completion
    times, QoS requirements which makes this problem too complex. Most existing job
    scheduling algorithms are based on heuristics [141], [142], [143]. Other works
    use adaptive techniques to optimize job placement and migration decisions [144,145].
    Still, the current works focus on the aspect of scheduling with a limited perspective.
    It is well known that heuristics work for generic cases and fail to respond to
    the dynamic changes to the environments. The adaptive schedulers still lack the
    ability to optimize for a diverse set of user or application requirements and
    no model or scheduling architecture exists which aims to optimize multiple objectives
    simultaneously. Some works focus on optimizing energy, other focus on response
    time or SLA violations. However, for the diverse needs of users, there is a requirement
    of schedulers which can optimize multiple metrics at once, prioritizing those
    that the application needs. There can be a convex combination of multiple such
    metrics and higher weight can be given to those that are of primary importance.
    For example, mission critical applications like surveillance, healthcare can have
    an optimization object with higher weight to response time. Scientific applications
    can give higher weight to quality of results. Energy sensitive applications like
    smart cities can have an all-round objective with more weight to energy. Similarly,
    for other applications such functions can be modified. In this regard, AI based
    techniques can be leveraged to provide more efficient and robust algorithms for
    enhanced and user requirement directed task placement. Open challenges and trends:
    The interested readers can further explore using extensive survey on Fog Computing
    [167]. The open challenges and future research directions for Fog Computing are
    summarized as follows: 1. Generic interfaces are required for fog gateways to
    be able interact with the plethora of IoT devices. 2. Blockchain APIs must be
    runnable on resource constraint fog/edge nodes. 3. State of the art AI techniques
    can be used for proper task scheduling on heterogeneous fog environments. 4.3.
    Energy management The amount of data collected and processed has been increased
    manifold in the past few decades. This trend has been forcing the computation
    and thus the power consumption capabilities of Cloud platforms to extremes. There
    has been an increase in the electricity consumption of cloud datacenters by about
    20% to 25% every year [72]. Due to this, a turn has been observed towards distributed
    computing, resulting in increasing popularity of Fog and Edge Computing platforms.
    The shift from centralized Cloud-based computing to edge devices and networks
    immensely helps in reducing latency [73], improving Spectral Efficiency (SE) and
    increasing cost effectivity. However, this comes with its challenges. In many
    mission critical and remote sensing applications, intermittent power supply, if
    not the power delivery itself poses serious challenges. With the massively growing
    number of IoT devices [74] and the increasing data collected, the data-handling
    capacity, computation capability and bandwidth requirements of networks are being
    pushed to its limits. On the other hand, smaller IoT devices with low computation
    power, storage and battery are being developed [128]. Thus, increasing the efficiency
    of Fog/Edge nodes has become crucial. At the same time, maintaining the sustainability
    of the Cloud datacenters and reducing carbon footprint [75,76] has also gained
    importance. All of this has to be done without compromising on the Quality of
    Service (QoS) [6]. Despite the challenges, several developments can be seen in
    this field. Energy management has been tackled in three major levels, namely software,
    hardware and intermediate. Software-level efficiency optimization techniques and
    algorithms (like Mobile Edge-Computing offloading in [77]), backed by simulation
    models [78] have been developed. On the hardware side, application specific devices
    have been developed to deliver high performance and reduce the power footprint
    [79]. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have discussed energy conservation in detail
    [80,81]. At the intermediate level, resource management and active Fog/Edge-node
    sleep duration scheduling techniques and other energy conservation architectures
    [10] have been employed. For sustainable Cloud Computing, a comprehensive taxonomy
    has been proposed [58]. Many open challenges and directions for improvement remain
    where efficiency and sustainability of Fog/Edge/Cloud platforms can be improved
    [47]. More sophisticated algorithms need to be developed to encode information
    into a smaller number of bits to reduce the bandwidth budget and thus the transceiver''s
    power requirement (which is much more significant than the CPU itself). Common
    encoders in almost every mobile device can be exploited to employ encoding techniques
    without the requirement for extra/dedicated hardware. However, an increasing amount
    of data sharing, and loss has made it difficult to reduce the theoretical bandwidth.
    Another direction is to develop thermal-aware resource scheduling for reduced
    heating, thus improving (SoCs) and memories, CPU and data usage planning need
    to be modeled at the transistor level, using 3D thermal simulation architectures
    developed. Finally, the goal is to reduce power consumption to bare minimum, so
    that energy harnessing/scavenging techniques can be used to power both the CPU
    and the transceiver, making the node a completely independent entity. Therefore,
    reduction in the granularity of the Fog/Edge network can be achieved resulting
    in widely dispersed, redundant and more fault tolerant frameworks [139]. Other
    domains like energy constrained Blockchain models can be explored with other adaptive
    AI based learning models for more efficient energy scheduling. Open challenges
    and trends: The interested readers can further explore using extensive survey
    on Energy Management [58]. The open challenges and future research directions
    for Energy Management are summarized as follows: 1. Enhanced algorithms for efficient
    data encoding for reduced bandwidth consumption and energy efficient communication
    in data intensive IoT devices. 2. Blockchain design should allow energy constraint
    execution. 3. Using novel AI motivated techniques for more efficient thermal aware
    scheduling of tasks and resources. 4.4. Resource management Resource management
    in distributed systems is a challenging task due to the scale of modern data centers.
    The diverse nature of network devices, components and communication technologies
    in large-scale distributed systems makes the complexity of resource management
    techniques increase [52]. Therefore, there is a demand for new resource allocation
    approaches that would contribute to stability and efficiency of such systems.
    Resource management is a core concept within distributed systems (including Cloud,
    IoT, Fog computing), however there must be assurances that such systems exhibit
    high performance, latency-sensitivity, reliability, and energy-efficiency [46,47].
    These systems do not simply comprise the software layer, but must also factor
    in other systems including networking, server architecture, and even cooling.
    The security of cloud system can be increased by utilizing the Blockchain technology
    during the sharing of resources or VM migration. There is a need to explore new
    techniques for resource management for computing systems by considering a holistic
    view of the system by utilizing AI techniques [47]. Further, experiment driven
    approaches can be explored to investigate techniques to optimize resource management
    approaches. There is a need to incorporate data abstraction in resource management
    and its one example of a cluster management system is Borg [58]. This system hides
    details about resource management so that users can focus on development of applications.
    Borg logically partitions the whole cluster into cells, each one containing a
    Borgmaster (controller) and a Borglet that starts and stops tasks in a cell [5].
    The master handles client Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) that can request to create
    a job or to read data, and it also communicates with the Borglets. This is a very
    scalable centralized architecture. The key design feature is that even if a master
    or a Borglet goes down, the already launched tasks will keep running. In order
    to enable fair sharing of commodity clusters, a platform called Mesos can be used
    [6]. It manages sharing of commodity clusters between different frameworks that
    run on these clusters. The main principle is using resource offers. Mesos decides
    how many resources to allocate to each framework based on framework''s constraints,
    while those in turn decide which offers to accept. Therefore, the burden of making
    scheduling decisions falls on frameworks. Besides, Mesos allows the development
    of specialized frameworks (such as Spark) that could significantly improve performance.
    A framework called YARN is used to perform resource management and scheduling
    [7]. It allows applications to request resources on different levels of topology
    – machines, nodes, racks etc. YARN resource manager is the main component responsible
    for making allocation decisions [63]. Just like Mesos, it lets commodity clusters
    to be shared among many frameworks. YARN also has built-in fault tolerance that
    hides the complexity of fault detection and recovery from its users [130]. Open
    challenges and trends: The interested readers can further explore using extensive
    survey on Resource Management [6,52,56]. The open challenges and future research
    directions for Resource Management are summarized as follows: 1. QoS-aware autonomic
    resource management is required to run IoT based applications without violation
    of SLA at runtime. 2. Proper Blockchain mining and hash generation allocation
    must be done for load balanced execution. 3. New resource provisioning and scheduling
    polices are required for fog and cloud computing using AI based deep learning
    techniques to predict the resource requirement in advance for geographically disparate
    resources. 4.5. Fault tolerance Cloud provider should provide the continuous service
    to users while maintaining the reliability of the cloud services even in the presence
    of faults [63]. There is a one mechanism called fault tolerance, which is used
    to provide the service in an efficient manner while satisfying the QoS requirements
    of the computing system. The faults occur during the working of computing system
    can be software, hardware or network. Further, the fault tolerance ensures the
    robustness and availability of cloud services [47]. The other issues related to
    reliability in cloud computing are timeout failures, overflow failures and resource
    missing failures. The other failures can be generated by catastrophic failures,
    which often leads to cascading systems failures. There are various proactive and
    reactive fault tolerance techniques are proposed to deal with such kind of failures
    [63]. Checkpointing is the most popular fault tolerance technique, which is used
    for long running process by saving the states after every change. Further, checkpoint
    is used when there would be any failure to start from the same point. Another
    renown technique is replication-based fault tolerance, which replicates the nodes
    or tasks to finish the job within their required deadline [58]. Task migration-based
    fault tolerance technique can migrate job to another machine if current machine
    is busy or suffering from some failures. To maintain the reliability of the computing
    systems, the existing fault tolerance techniques need failure-aware provisioning
    models, autonomic reliability-aware resource management technique and service
    reliability mechanisms, trustworthy data integrity (Blockchain) [52]. Reliability
    in cloud computing makes an impact on QoS while delivering the cloud service in
    an efficient manner. One of the most important challenge in cloud computing is
    how to provide an efficient and reliable cloud service while reducing the energy
    consumption as well as carbon footprints [58]. There is a need of Reliability-aware
    cloud as a service to offer resilience with required QoS and system performance
    [6]. Further, an efficient resource management needs to consider different failure
    and workload models to execute different types of applications such healthcare,
    smart city and agriculture [46]. Failure prediction in cloud computing systems
    is also a challenging task and which can also affect the reliability of the system
    [63]. There is a need to consider various machine or deep learning techniques
    [128,129] to predict the failures and achieve the required reliability of the
    cloud service to maintain the QoS. For IoT applications, the replication-based
    fault tolerant techniques are efficient, which can improve the latency and response
    time of task. Further, to handle the big data applications, there is a need of
    reliable cloud storage system to provide an efficient retrieval system for processing
    of big data. Open challenges and trends: The interested readers can further explore
    using extensive survey on Fault Tolerance [63]. The open challenges and future
    research directions for Fault Tolerance are summarized as follows: 1. For IoT
    applications, the replication-based fault tolerant techniques are efficient, which
    can improve the latency and response time of task. 2. An analytical modeling framework
    for Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) – a consensus method for Blockchain
    in IoT networks is required to define the viable area for the wireless PBFT networks
    which guarantees the minimum number of replica nodes required for achieving the
    protocol''s safety and liveliness. 3. There is a need to consider various machine
    or deep learning techniques to predict the failures and achieve the required reliability
    of the cloud service to maintain the QoS. 4.6. Security and privacy Recently,
    in research and industry, there has been a massive shift from personal computing
    to IoT, Edge and Cloud computing to provide smarter and more efficient services
    to end users. For this big shift in paradigm, many issues and challenges have
    arisen in the privacy and security pertaining to the data on these devices. Due
    to various characteristics of Edge computing like low latency, geographic distribution,
    mobility of end device, and high processing, heterogeneity, etc [58,128]. The
    security and privacy properties need to be more robust and versatile. Moreover,
    the diversity of applications and heterogeneity of devices makes it difficult
    to develop seamlessly connected software platforms. To study these security and
    related concerns in cloud and fog computing paradigm, the following factors become
    prominent: (1) Trust and privacy of end users (2) Internode source authentication
    and validation (3) Impenetrable communications among, sensors, compute and broker
    nodes (4) Identification and protection of the systems against malicious attacks
    (5) Robust data management and tamper proof databases (Blockchain) [93]. Existing
    work in this area focus to solve challenges like detection and recovery from malicious
    or malfunctioning nodes, identification of and safeguard against attacks, prevention
    of malicious threats, safeguarding user-information against theft, dynamic mutual
    authentication [95,96]. Recent work has made possible to identity and location
    privacy for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) assisted compute nodes, keeping in mind
    their integration in the distributed frameworks [97]. Also, in Fog forensics,
    other works have provided digital evidence by reconstructing past computing events
    and identified how the key characteristics are different from cloud forensics
    [94]. Mobility management, interference mitigation, and resource optimization
    in Fog Radio Access Networks (F-RAN''s) [98] are some of the main topics which
    have had many contributions in recent past. New models have emerged for diverse
    applications addressing privacy issues. Some such directions include face identification
    and resolution, vehicular crowd-sensing, geo-location sensing and data analysis,
    storage architectures and data centers with renewable nodes, fog based public
    cloud computing [82,83,92,99,100]. Such works have addressed concerns regarding
    many vulnerabilities including protection against data theft, man in the middle
    attacks, user anonymity, location privacy, forward secrecy, secure user level
    key-management, among others [87]. Many of the privacy and security models developed
    for fog/cloud computing face some limitations in terms of their scalability to
    the next generation edge computing shift [88]. Due to the inherently decentralized
    nature of fog computing, many unforeseen security threats arise in the fog layer
    and IoT devices which are not a concern in cloud computing [84], [85], [86]. Threats
    to edge focused networks include Advanced Persistent Threats (APT attacks), threats
    caused by bi-directional communication, malware, Distributed Denial of Service
    (DDoS) attacks, micro servers lacking hardware protection mechanisms in edge data
    centers, restricting the authentication protocols that can be deployed [89], [90],
    [91]. These works also highlight future directions in Mobile Edge computing framework
    including high speed pertaining to real-time encryption using nodal collaboration
    of edge networks. In prior works, security issues are exploited from a narrow
    perspective and computing capabilities of both edge and remote resources have
    not been fully leveraged [85]. Once cloud computing-like capabilities are brought
    to the edge of the network, novel situations arise. Some such situations include
    collaboration between heterogeneous edge data centers, migrating services at a
    local and global scale, concurrence to end users, Quality of Services, real-time
    applications, load balancing, server overflow problems, detection of stolen devices,
    robust and reliable inter node communication. These are the avenues for future
    research. To solve these problems, other domain ideas can be explored like clustering
    model-based security analysis (AI based prediction models) which is useful in
    DDoS attack mitigation in server systems and in intrusion detection systems, evolutionary
    game theoretic approaches to the privacy models inspired by the adversarial attack
    models, communication protocols in Sensor cloud systems. The security mechanisms
    also need to consider the existence of mobile devices using these data-centers.
    Open challenges and trends: The interested readers can further explore using extensive
    survey on Security and Privacy [168]. The open challenges and future research
    directions for Security and Privacy are summarized as follows: 1. Due to the inherently
    decentralized nature of fog computing, many unforeseen security threats arise
    in the fog layer and IoT devices which are not a concern in cloud computing. 2.
    With integrity, Blockchain structures should also allow other security measures
    for data like encryption, signature management, etc. 3. AI based security-aware
    techniques can be explored like clustering model-based security analysis which
    is useful in DDoS attack mitigation in server systems and in intrusion detection
    systems. 4.7. Software-Defined Network There is a need to enable the concept of
    networking virtualization in cloud is called Software-Defined Network (SDN) and
    utilize SDN for cloud computing by extending the idea of virtualization of all
    the cloud resources such as network, storage and compute [131]. Further, it improves
    the abstraction of physical resources and automation and optimization of configuration
    process. SDN paradigm provides a platform to enable flexibility or agility in
    network, which can be create a cost-effective communication among modern cloud
    datacenters. Further, SDN based cloud computing reduces the power consumption
    while optimizing the network virtualization. Network functions virtualization
    (NFV) is another emerging networking paradigm which forwards network functions
    such as Domain Name Service (DNS), load balancing and intrusion detection while
    executing software-based applications [132]. Moreover, NFV improves the elasticity
    of network function and increases the flexibility and agility of the service,
    which further reduces the cost [133]. Further, an efficient VM migration policy
    can be used for VM consolidation in virtualized network to reduce energy consumption.
    There are different research challenges are still open for academicians and researchers.
    Firstly, there is a need provide the security mechanism for SDN-based cloud computing
    to secure the transfer of data among different cloud datacenters [134]. Toosi
    et al. [116] developed a low-cost Raspberry-Pi-based micro datacenter for software
    defined cloud computing, which saves cost, but reliability of service is still
    questionable. Secondly, the trade-off between cost and energy consumption is still
    existing due to replication of SDN enabled cloud infrastructures. In future, there
    is a need to deploy SDN-based cloud computing environment, which can reduce energy
    consumption and increase reliability while providing the network virtualization
    service in a cost-effective manner. Further, we can extend existing data integration
    in such SDN environments to support Blockchain technologies with enhanced data
    distribution and results collection techniques motivated from AI based models.
    Open challenges and trends: The interested readers can further explore using extensive
    survey on Software-Defined Network [131]. The open challenges and future research
    directions for Software-Defined Network are summarized as follows: 1. There is
    a need provide the security mechanism for SDN-based cloud computing to secure
    the transfer of data among different CDCs using IoT devices. 2. Decentralization
    and virtualization chain of data is required for Blockchains to work in SDN paradigm.
    3. There is a need to deploy SDN-based cloud computing environment using AI learning
    models, which can reduce energy consumption and increase reliability while providing
    the network virtualization service in a cost-effective manner. 4.8. Big data analytics
    and data science A complicated procedure of examining large datasets to uncover
    hidden patterns [33], market trends, correlations and preferences specific to
    customers that can help the companies to make well informed decisions [127]. In
    simple words, these technologies help in analyzing data sets and then to draw
    conclusions from it using cloud computing platform. It is a form of analytics
    which involves elements as statistical algorithms, predictive models etc. Driven
    by high computing powered systems, it offers several advantages including effective
    marketing, revenue opportunities, operational efficiency etc [43], [44], [45].
    It allows professionals to analyze the growing volumes of unstructured, semi structured
    and structured data. There are few research directions in this area as discussed
    below: 4.8.1. Healthcare Large amount of data is generated in the healthcare industry
    [34] ranging from medical health records, X-ray reports, diet regime, record keeping
    etc. In order to give efficient cloud services, it is necessary to analyze this
    healthcare ecosystem-based data. Also, there is a need to build a fog, edge or
    cloud-based system for real time analysis on the enormous data set (collected
    by IoT devices). Including this, there is a need to keep this data tamper proof
    using Blockchain models. Further, future research directions can be: • Patient
    services: Big data analytics-based systems can provide evidence-based medicines,
    giving faster relief to the patients as they can detect diseases at the earlier
    stages based on the clinical data available. This will help in minimizing drug
    doses to avoid side effect and reducing readmission rates thereby reducing cost
    for the patients. Customized patient treatment could be delivered by monitoring
    the effect of dosages of medicine continuously and looking on analysis of the
    data generated by the patients who already suffered from the same disease using
    cloud computing system. • Detecting diseases: Viral diseases can be predicted
    earlier before spreading, based on the real time analysis. This can be identified
    by analyzing the history of the patients suffering from a disease in a particular
    geo-location [39]. This helps the healthcare professionals to advise the victims
    by taking necessary preventive measures. • Hospital management: Hospital''s inventory
    could be planned and managed in advance to tackle problems like seasonal demand,
    uncertainty and economies of scale. 4.8.2. Government Any government of the nation
    also generates petabytes of data [58]. Big data-based systems can assist government
    in providing value added services to its citizens. These systems could help the
    government in financial, healthcare, education budget planning by understanding
    the data patterns and the relationship between them with the help of machine learning
    algorithms [35,63]. Further, future research directions can be: • Unemployment:Analyzing
    the market conditions and data of students before, government can predict the
    jobs. Cloud computing-based system enables government to create curriculum for
    trainings in order to absorb youth in the different domains and organizations.
    • Decision making: By analyzing the sentiments and predicting the future trends,
    government can improve the quality and speed of decision making [38]. The government
    could take advantage of big data-based cloud computing systems in understanding
    current conditions and acceptability of the society before taking any action.
    It will help in creating more acceptability of the government in citizens. 4.8.3.
    Retail With new sources of data like social media, geo location sensor data (IoT
    or edge devices), it has created more opportunities for retail companies to get
    competitive advantage and unprecedented value. Cloud based Big Data analytic systems
    can make best decisions flows, uncover hidden patterns and understand customer
    behavior. To better understand the value of big data analytics in the retail industry
    [36], let us take a look at the following use cases, which are currently in production
    in various leading retail companies. • Conversion and campaign: Customers today
    interact more than they were before, and these interactions are happening on new
    platforms like social media. So, retail companies can get holistic view of customers
    and understand their preferences [40]. Data Science and engineering is capable
    of correlating customer purchase histories and profile information, with their
    behavior on social media sites. And these relations can reveal unexpected insights,
    in turn helping the retailer is likely to have higher conversion rates and reductions
    in customer acquisition cost. Using data science platforms, retailers can: – Analyze
    the impact of different promotional campaigns on customer behavior. – Use customer
    purchase history to identify the needs then generate personalize promotions catering
    to customer''s needs. – Monitor customer social media activity to make timely
    offers to customers to incent online purchases. • Customer churn prediction: Data-driven
    customer insights are critical to tackle challenge of customer churn prediction
    [41,42]. It is done by predicting future churn from data of the past. Retailers
    can look at characteristics of customers that have churned before in order to
    predict something about current customers. 4.8.4. Operational analytics Improvement
    in complicated product life cycles cause retailers to employ big data-based technologies
    to deploy product distribution strategies to reduce time and costs associated
    with them [43]. The key to utilizing data science and cloud computing platforms
    is to increase operational efficiency by unlocking insights buried in sensor and
    machine data through machine learning and pattern recognition techniques. These
    analyses help in predicting trends, patterns and outliers that can improve decisions
    [37] and save millions of dollars in computing world. Open challenges and trends:
    The interested readers can further explore using extensive surveys on Big Data
    Analytics [57,66] and Data Science [169]. The open challenges and future research
    directions for Big Data Analytics and Data Science are summarized as follows:
    1. There is a need of bio-inspired based big data analytics mechanisms to process
    the data of edge devices of IoT applications at runtime. 2. Efficient Blockchain
    data structures need to be developed for efficient storage and retrieval of large
    amounts of data. 3. Cloud based Big Data analytic systems can utilize the AI based
    techniques to make best decisions flows, uncover hidden patterns and understand
    customer behavior. 4.9. Data processing Before diving deep into data processing,
    Let us try to understand “What is the need of data processing in today''s world?”.
    The present world is overwhelmed with information from various sources such as
    IoT devices, social media, smartphones (IoT or edge devices), medical health records,
    click stream data, ecommerce etc. According to DOMO''s research, “By 2020, it
    is estimated that 1.7 MB of data will be created every second for every person
    on earth” [103]. Imagine, with current 7.7 billion population of the world, 13
    petabytes of data will be created per second leading to 1 Million petabytes a
    day. So, with this rapid generation of data, organizations are endeavoring to
    find the best tools to deal with this raw data and make sense out of it. The processing
    of data is central to any data-related problem. It is one of the most interesting,
    time consuming phase of an analytics project. Nearly 70–80% time of a data analyst/scientists
    is spent in cleaning and processing the data to make it usable for any kind of
    statistical modeling. In simple terms, data processing is basically the collection
    and manipulation of data to get useful information out of it, which then can be
    used for analytics, business intelligence, machine learning, deep learning and
    reporting purposes etc. The processing of data can incorporate anything from collection,
    reporting, aggregation, summarization, validation, structuring the unstructured
    data or vice versa etc. Data can be of any kind like time-series, images, videos,
    textual etc. Depending on the size of data, processing can be done on a single
    core machine to multi-core or on cloud and GPU servers [104]. The processing of
    big data can be broadly classified into three categories: • Batch processing–
    an efficient technique to process large amounts of data collected over a period
    of time from various IoT or edge devices. • Real time processing– deals with a
    continuous stream of data inputs and involves processing of data in near real
    time i.e. with minimal latency and maximum security (Blockchain). • Hybrid processing–
    takes the volume aspect of batch processing and velocity aspect of real time processing
    and it is useful in applications that require analysis of huge volumes of static
    along with streaming data. Apache Hadoop (a framework that allows distribution
    of large data processing across various connected computers using MapReduce programming
    model) [105] and Apache Spark (a unified analytics engine with in-memory data
    processing capabilities and having built-in modules for SQL, machine learning,
    streaming and graph processing) are the two main open source tools that are widely
    used across industry for the processing of big data [63,128]. A lot of other data
    processing tools for specific data types, tasks are also available in the market
    but these two precisely dominate the industry. With organizations investing heavily
    on Advanced Data Analytics and the growth of data in terms of volume, variety
    and velocity increasing, it is becoming expensive and demanding for organizations
    to scale on-premises infrastructure [57]. As a result of this, cloud is becoming
    a natural choice for these organizations for storage and processing of data. More
    and more companies are moving towards cloud services being offered by the big
    tech giants like AWS (Amazon Web Services) by Amazon, Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud,
    GCP (Google Cloud Platform) and Google for data processing [61]. These cloud providers
    have wide variety of tools to manage, compute and do analysis on data depending
    upon the volume, variety and velocity of data one has. So, these cost-effective
    cloud services are not only providing organizations with advanced tools for faster
    data processing but are also handling the agility and scalability aspects of big
    data and thus leading to revenue growth [66]. The management of data and extraction
    of knowledge are two important parts of grand organizations and business companies.
    The speed of generation of data at both user and system end leads to various research
    issues in both research community and industry [59]. The infrastructure uses to
    manage data is growing swiftly as collected from IoT or edge devices, which leads
    to formation of large cloud data centers (CDC) [58]. The various flexible data
    management models (NoSQL/relational) are using in CDCs to handle the current data
    requirements. Further, modern large CDCs are more susceptible to failures and
    needs effective fault tolerance technique for effective management of data within
    CDC [63]. Moreover, IoT and scientific applications are increasing which further
    needs effective data management mechanism within large scale distributed system.
    Big Data and Deep Mining models motivated from AI and machine learning techniques
    can be used for effective analysis of large-scale data. Open challenges and trends:
    The interested readers can further explore using extensive survey on Data Processing
    [170]. The open challenges and future research directions for Data Processing
    are summarized as follows: 1. IoT and scientific applications are increasing which
    further needs effective data management mechanism within large scale distributed
    system. 2. To ensure data is protected, Blockchain technology has been adopted
    in the IoT domain and other real time systems. 3. AI provides a lucrative avenue
    to optimize large systems with huge amounts of data with engineering simplicity
    and efficiency by allowing automated decision making instead of human encoded
    heuristics which provide more efficient decisions very quickly. 4.10. Application
    design It is estimated that 50 billion devices will be online and 40% of the world''s
    data will come from them with total expenditure of $1.7 trillion by 2020 [58].
    This exponential growth of Internet based smart devices and IoT applications such
    as healthcare services, real time traffic control systems, precision agriculture,
    smart cities etc. require faster processing, data storage and privacy along with
    secure and reliable communication [46,59,61]. Also, as the data generated by these
    devices are used to solve real time problems, integrity, consistency and availability
    of data must be guaranteed. Designing these complex applications for IoT devices
    is a challenge in itself. So, we need to come out with application designs/architectures
    that are not only scalable to handle humongous amount of data from these devices
    but also reliable and fast enough to give efficient performance [135]. So, following
    are the major concerns that need to be taken care of while designing these applications
    with cloud infrastructure. • Latency: Time taken by a data packet for a round
    trip from IoT devices to cloud and back. It is a big concern for time sensitive
    data as a millisecond can make a huge difference leading to unwanted results [46].
    For e.g., disaster sensing device fires alarm after the occurrence of a disaster
    would not solve the problem. Extremely time sensitive data should be analyzed
    very near to the data source to provide response in near real time. • Bandwidth:
    If all the data generated by these devices are sent to cloud for storage and analysis,
    then the traffic generated by these devices will be simply gigantic and will consume
    all the bandwidth, which is not desirable. Also, as the physical distance between
    the device and cloud increases, transmission latency increases with it, increasing
    response time and stressing out the user. So, some work needs to be offloaded
    from the cloud, which can be done by allowing some processing to be done on an
    edge server that is positioned between cloud and device and physically closer
    to the device. The fog computing allows IoT data storage and some processing locally
    at IoT devices and thus, avoids an excessive exploitation of Cloud resources [46].
    Also, the fog provides reliability to time-sensitive and data-intensive applications
    that are large-scale and geospatially distributed [6]. Subsequently, fog computing
    might be viewed as the best decision to empower the IoT to give reliable and secure
    services/resources to numerous IoT users. Big Data Analytics, IoT devices, fog
    and edge computing are becoming the driving forces for smart city initiatives
    throughout the world. Fog computing has great applicability in transportation
    such as vehicle to vehicle communications, managing smart sensor-based traffic
    control systems and also controlling autonomous vehicles, self-parking etc [46,128].
    It is also a more sustainable approach due to its low energy usage, small footprints
    and governments in various countries can use these applications to make the life
    of the citizens more secure and environment friendly. It can also be used in emergency
    services like fire, natural disasters by early notification of emergency situations
    to support smart decision making. Farming applications help to oversee agriculture
    data like precipitation, wind speed and temperature to improve the use of climate
    and land in a productive way, which can assist farmers to have a productive yield
    [59]. An IoT agriculture platform for cloud and fog computing is proposed in [101],
    which can be utilized for pest management image analysis and monitoring, agricultural
    monitoring automation etc. that can help farmers in better utilization of resources.
    In [102], authors have proposed a fog computing application for precision agriculture
    that can assist in agricultural land management using AI based intelligent systems.
    Also, it is progressively penetrating into the healthcare domain [61]. A lot of
    wearable gadgets like fit bit, blood pressure and heart rate monitoring cuffs,
    are being used to monitor different parts of human body and also collect information
    for diagnosis and interpretation. These devices have made remote healthcare monitoring
    feasible and hence doctors can monitor patients'' wellbeing remotely and for the
    most part has given patients more authority over their lives and treatment. Also,
    companies like Apple with CareKit, HealthKit, ResearchKit and Google with Google
    fit, Microsoft building their health data management on top of Azure are clear
    examples that tech giants are investing heavily into digital healthcare [6,7,11].
    Open challenges and trends: The interested readers can further explore using extensive
    survey on Application Design [135]. The open challenges and future research directions
    for Application Design are summarized as follows: 1. How to design a new application
    for smart cities to manage IoT based data effectively? 2. Storage capacity and
    scalability of applications are highly debated due to high cost and maintenance
    overheads while providing Blockchain based security. 3. Artificial Intelligence
    algorithms can be used for processing of application data collected from various
    IoT based applications such as healthcare, agriculture, smart home etc. 4.11.
    Serverless computing Cloud application is basically comprising of three components:
    application logic, business logic and database server [6]. To improve the design
    of existing cloud applications, serverless computing paradigm is emerged [135].
    In serverless application, database server and application logic located in the
    cloud while business logic is forwarded to the end user, which can be accessed
    by using web or mobile application for execution on provisioned resources without
    renting the resources (VMs). With the help of serverless computing, the different
    research challenges such fault tolerance, load balancing and under or over provisioning
    of resources are solved [58]. Further, serverless computing also decreases the
    coding part of developers and reduces the burden on cloud administrator for management
    of resources. Serverless provides two different kinds of service: (1) Function
    as a Service (FaaS) and Backend as a Service (BaaS) and these services are supported
    by Amazon AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure [128]. Cloud user only runs their
    application without knowing the internal details about servers, which are managed
    by cloud provider. Serverless computing comes with many challenges and issues.
    Most works do not consider various aspects important for scheduling tasks on such
    execution models. One such aspect is server start-up time for infrequently used
    applications where servers are spun-down when the application is not in use. This
    severely affects the performance of application and QoS. Recent works like [19]
    do focus on this aspect but from a limited perspective. Another aspect is bandwidth
    consumption in Bag-of-Tasks models where multiple tasks commonly share files.
    These files need not be uploaded to cloud nodes separately for each task and task
    placement can be more intelligent to maximize file sharing capability. Yet another
    aspect important in such models is the security and privacy of applications and
    critical data [20]. As mentioned in [21], most modern serverless computing models
    are being implemented by integrating the edge of the network. These edge devices
    are resource-constrained and cannot support the heavy security applications and
    firewalls developed for common personal computers. Special applications and algorithms
    need to be developed to allow more secure communication as well as ensure the
    privacy of data for modern computing platforms which include edge devices as part
    of the datacenters. Open challenges and trends: The interested readers can further
    explore using extensive survey on Serverless Computing [171]. The open challenges
    and future research directions for Serverless Computing are summarized as follows:
    1. New IoT based applications are required to be developed to allow more secure
    communication as well as ensure the privacy of data for modern computing platforms
    which include edge devices as part of the datacenters. 2. Edge devices of IoT
    application are resource-constrained and cannot support the heavy security applications
    and firewalls developed for common personal computers, so there is a need to implement
    Blockchain technology to improve security. 3. AI systems improve the design of
    application for serverless computing. 4.12. Deep learning Deep learning is a class
    of machine learning programming technology that is based around learning from
    large data sets [154,155]. The core of deep learning is to get high level interactive
    features from the raw data. Lately deep learning has been powering Reinforcement
    Learning to help realize the field of Deep Reinforcement Learning which is offering
    hope in crafting better models in the future [129]. The intersection of deep learning
    and cloud computing is creating interesting applications wherein both the fields
    are complementing each other. We would first discuss how cloud computing is supporting
    data scientists and later move on to how deep learning has been leveraging solutions
    to various traditional problems in cloud computing [49], [50], [51]. Teerapittayanon
    et al. [48] have demonstrated the use of edge and IoT end devices in realizing
    a distributed training of a deep neural network. Traditionally distributed learning
    has been avoided due to communication cost, however they propose joint training
    bringing this cost down by 20×. Cloud computing is also helping reduce the energy
    consumption of deep neural networks by reducing the feature size achieved through
    splitting the network architecture between mobile and cloud [54]. There are various
    other applications of cloud computing assisted deep learning leading to value
    addition in various fields including robotics, autonomous driving, healthcare,
    personal assistance and defense. The advances in deep learning have to be realized
    by performing continuous training on the real time data. Cloud Chaser [60] is
    a technique in which the computational load is borne by the cloud and the power
    of deep learning can be harnessed on low computing capacity devices. Big Data
    Analytics can be effectively performed by employing a hybrid “Machine Learning + Cloud
    Computing” approach [57]. Hence a cloud-based deep learning approach is becoming
    very popular. Recent advances in deep learning and its wide popularity has led
    to a demand for learning the models on devices presently accessible to the users.
    A privacy preserving approach wherein on-device deep learning can be realized
    using cloud has been developed by Wang et al. [62]. Similar work has been carried
    out by various other groups trying to make deep learning on mobile devices a reality
    [50]. Nguyen et al. [49] have developed a deep learning model to thwart cyber-attacks
    in the context of mobile cloud realm. A Hybrid approach of running deep neural
    network partially over an IoT device and the cloud can lead to preserving the
    privacy over mobile devices [51]. They show a high accuracy (95.84%) with robustness
    using variety of datasets. Security has traditionally been the reason hindering
    adoption of cloud computing by users which can be addressed using deep learning
    as shown by many authors recently A persisting problem with cloud computing is
    managing and monitoring of large cloud clusters. Stefanini et al. [70] have shown
    that deep learning (DeepConv and DeepFFT) can be used to classify clusters with
    similar behavior which may improve the scalability of managing a data center.
    QoS violations can be detected ahead in time by “Seer” which is a cloud-based
    debugging system using deep learning and spatial and temporal data of cloud systems
    [64]. The prediction of workload for VMs on cloud has been carried out by [65,68,69].
    Li et al. [71] have developed a system using cloud computing and deep learning
    with the aim of minimizing power consumption by cloud clusters. Open challenges
    and trends: The interested readers can further explore using extensive survey
    on Deep Learning [172]. The open challenges and future research directions for
    Deep Learning are summarized as follows: 1. An ensemble deep learning based smart
    healthcare system is required for automatic diagnosis of heart diseases in integrated
    IoT and Fog computing environments. 2. Deep learning-based techniques are required
    to improve the Blockchain structures. 3. How to enable deep learning on IoT devices
    to improve real world performance in Artificial Intelligence based intelligent
    systems? 4.13. Cloud containers Container technologies are quite popular in this
    cloud computing community with the origin of Dockers to execute the user workloads
    in an efficient manner. Container technology offers a lightweight cloud environment
    to deploy applications because containers are self-contained and stand-alone,
    which can reduce data dependency among various units during the execution of user
    workloads [130]. Container allows the resource sharing among various applications
    while running in an isolation manner. The various kernel features of Linux OSs
    such as libcontainer and control groups (cgroups) are considered in container
    technology. Namespaces and cgroups are used by Docker to execute self-dependent
    containers within a physical node and offer run resources (network, storage, memory
    and processor) in an isolated manner. Moreover, namespace separates the view of
    an application in running environment and simplifies the application deployment
    and increases the implementation efficiency. Further, container technology becomes
    a benchmark to develop, publish and execute applications in an isolated manner
    and denoted as a Container as a Service (CaaS) [130]. CaaS has three main advantages
    [63,47]: (1) container starts very rapidly and takes less than a second to launch,
    (2) it uses very less amount of resources as compared to VMs and (3) container
    technology allows to run more instances concurrently. Based on the current research
    in container technology, there are few research challenges are open which can
    be addressed in the future. Firstly, there is a weakness in security of containers
    due to the sharing of kernel as compared to VMs, which can be improved in the
    future by developing new security mechanisms by using Unikernel. Secondly, the
    performance improvement of containers is long task and there is a need to consider
    slack time to optimize the performance. Finally, there is a need to manage the
    user''s QoS based container clusters using emerging cloud computing technologies
    such as Swarm and Kubernetes. Open challenges and trends: The interested readers
    can further explore using extensive survey on Cloud Containers [173]. The open
    challenges and future research directions for Cloud Containers are summarized
    as follows: 1. Container technology can be utilized a cloud environment to deploy
    IoT applications to reduce data dependency among various units during the execution
    of user workloads. 2. There is a weakness in security of containers due to the
    sharing of kernel as compared to VMs, which can be improved in the future by adapting
    Blockchain technology. 3. There is a need to manage the user''s QoS based container
    clusters using emerging ensemble machine learning techniques such as Swarm and
    Kubernetes. 4.14. Quantum computing Quantum computing is branch of computing in
    which we harness and exploit the laws of quantum mechanics to process the data.
    Classical computers cannot solve problems of certain size and complexity. Quantum
    computers leverage the phenomena of superposition and entanglement to solve the
    hard problems [136]. Superposition is phenomena by which quantum computer can
    be in multiple states at the same time. While entanglement is the phenomena of
    having strong correlation between two or more quantum particles that they are
    inextricably linked, even if they are separated by large distance. Due to these
    two principles, a quantum computer can do large number calculations simultaneously
    [38]. Think of it this way: whereas a classical computer works with ones and zeros,
    a quantum computer will have the advantage of using ones, zeros and “superpositions”
    of ones and zeros [137]. Certain difficult tasks that have long been thought impossible
    (or “intractable”) for classical computers will be achieved quickly and efficiently
    by a quantum computer. The future directions [136], [137], [138],156] for this
    research area are: 1. Optimization: Consider an example of management company,
    which wants to invest in large cap value, medium cap value and blue-chip companies
    to generate large returns while rebalancing the asset classes to protect investments.
    By combining dynamic asset allocation through the use of quantum computers, they
    can solve this kind of hard problem optimally. These kinds of problems exist in
    various domains like airline traffic scheduling, financial analysis, system design
    etc. they are the one of the most complex problems [40] of the world with potential
    to transform the lives of the people. Quantum computers will be able to calculate
    the one-way functions, including Blockchains that are used to secure the Internet
    and financial transactions. 2. Machine learning and AI: Quantum computing can
    transform field of machine learning field too. Object detection in which it is
    very easy for humans to pick different objects from the photograph. But for traditional
    computers it is a difficult task. As the programmers do not know how to write
    code that can infer many objects by its own. Machine learning is one of the approaches
    to solve this problem in which algorithms recognize the objects by getting trained
    on large datasets [41]. As the amount of data and its combinations involved in
    this process are very large. So, it becomes a computationally expensive problem
    for the traditional systems to handle. Quantum computers make these types of problems
    easy as they can do enormous calculations simultaneously. 3. Material simulation:
    Quantum computers make simulating the materials feasible, the material simulation
    field can lead to development in various IoT based application in robotic, chemical
    and optical industry [39]. Open challenges and trends: The interested readers
    can further explore using extensive survey on Quantum Computing [174]. The open
    challenges and future research directions for Quantum Computing are summarized
    as follows: 1. Quantum computers make simulating the materials feasible, the material
    simulation field can lead to development in various IoT based application in robotic,
    chemical and optical industry. 2. Quantum computers will be able to calculate
    the one-way functions, including Blockchains that are used to secure the Internet
    and financial transactions. 3. Quantum computing can transform field of machine
    learning field too. Object detection in which it is very easy for humans to pick
    different objects from the photograph. As the programmers do not know how to write
    code that can infer many objects by its own. Machine learning is one of the approaches
    to solve this problem in which algorithms recognize the objects by getting trained
    on large datasets. 4.15. Bitcoin currency Blockchain was originally developed
    for digital currency Bitcoin and proposed as solution for settlement of transactions
    [106]. The Blockchain is an incorruptible chain of data blocks validated with
    PoW of economic transactions that can also be programmed to record not just for
    financial transactions but virtually everything of value [107]. Blockchains, like
    Bitcoins and Ethereum offer a new paradigm to run distributed applications. The
    developers define smart contracts for Bitcoin currency transactions, and the contracts
    are executed on the Blockchain virtual machines. Therefore, the Blockchain uses
    a distributed runtime environment with distributed consensus. The Bitcoin supporting
    network also allows block of data to be distributed across ledgers via peer to
    peer network without central management. Anyone can join the network, and the
    data in Blockchain is validated by the participants to make the data secure and
    open. This feature can be taken advantage by cloud computing, especially for the
    security of cloud storage. Cloud infrastructures provide computing power to run
    large applications and process huge amount of data. However, to manage the huge
    data storage, the centralized data centers connected with the Fog or IoT devices
    at the network edge cannot offer an efficient way to provide high availability,
    real-time and low latency services [108]. To address these issues, distributed
    cloud architecture rather than the traditional network architecture is needed.
    Blockchain offers some necessary features to build a distributed cloud [109],
    [110], [111], such as: (1) It can facilitate resource usage via distributed applications
    to enable fine-grained control on resources. (2) QoS can be improved as Blockchain
    can provide traceable resource usage, thus the user and service provider can verify
    whether the QoS is ensured. (3) A market place that everyone can advertise their
    computing resources and find the needed resources using AI based techniques or
    prediction models. Comparing to cloud computing, Blockchains only have limited
    computing resources to execute distributed applications, e.g. limited storage,
    inefficient virtual machines and protocol with high latency. Therefore, for the
    latency-aware applications and resource-intensive applications, these issues should
    be overcome. Combining Blockchain and cloud together to establish the Blockchain-based
    distributed cloud can bring new benefits and overcome existing limitations. The
    Blockchain-based distributed cloud allows on-demand resource, secure and low-cost
    access to infrastructure, the data is also brought to be closer to the owner and
    consumer [15]. Meanwhile, Blockchain-based distributed cloud is possible to overcome
    the expensive and high energy consumption features of clouds. Another future direction
    that Blockchain can benefit is improving the security of cloud storage. User data
    can be split into small blocks and added one more security layer, then the small
    blocks can be stored in distributed locations. The hacker can only get a chuck
    of the data rather than the whole file. The hackers who want to alter the data
    can also be removed from the network, and the altered data can be recovered from
    redundant copy. Open challenges and trends: The interested readers can further
    explore using extensive survey on Bitcoin Currency [175]. The open challenges
    and future research directions for Bitcoin Currency are summarized as follows:
    1. How IoT botnets affect the “Internet of money” cryptocurrency? 2. The Blockchain
    is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can also be programmed
    to record not just for financial transactions but virtually everything of value.
    Blockchains, like Bitcoins and Ethereum offer a new paradigm to run distributed
    applications. 3. There is a need to investigate how Machine Learning (ML) techniques
    perform in the prediction of cryptocurrency prices. 4.16. Software engineering
    Software Engineering (SE) and cloud computing are very close paradigms. For example
    – service-oriented SE combines the best features of the services and cloud computing
    and thus gives several benefits to software development process and applications.
    The only difference between Services oriented SE and cloud computing is that –
    the service-oriented SE focuses on architectural design (service discovery and
    composition) and cloud computing focuses on the effective delivery of services
    to users through flexible and scalable resource virtualization and load balancing
    [163]. Software Engineering not only evolves hardware technologies, but also involves
    customers and software developers [112]. Cloud computing and virtualization allow
    users to create VMs and cloud services for projects and software''s with automatic
    management [113]. With cloud services, the software development teams can combine
    development, test and delivery processes seamlessly. Cloud computing can enhance
    the software engineering process in the following ways: 1. The development process
    can be speed up. Cloud computing and virtualization offer sufficient computing
    resources, so that developers can use multiple virtual machines rather than stick
    to a single physical machine. 2. Cloud computing enables the development activity
    into a more parallel way, as the time to install the necessary applications can
    be reduced by fetching cloud services, which can lead to a more efficient development
    process. 3. Cloud instances and virtualization can greatly enhance the integration
    and delivery process. With adequate virtualization resources from their own cloud
    or public cloud, development can make the build and test process faster, which
    are quite time-consuming. 4. Code versions management becomes easier. Code branching
    is necessary in the code refactoring or function increment in software development.
    Cloud computing relieves the efforts to buy or rent physical machines for storing
    the codes. 5. Cloud environment provide interfaces to facilitate users’ access
    to applications and can improve service QoS via dynamic resource provisioning.
    In conclusion, cloud computing removes the heavy dependencies of development servers
    on fixed physical machines and makes the development process in software engineering
    more efficiently [114]. Cloud computing makes the software development process
    to be more efficiently. However, some challenges exist in combining software engineering
    and cloud computing, and these challenges should be addressed. Data migration
    is one of the challenges. Since cloud providers offer different APIs for offering
    cloud services, if the software''s and data need to be migrated to another cloud,
    software''s may need to be reimplemented and some software''s can be the legacy
    system [115]. To address this issue, when developing and deploying software''s
    in clouds, unnecessary dependencies on specific APIs should be avoided. Another
    challenge is the reliability and availability. If all the data are migrated to
    clouds from local, when the cloud is attacked by hackers or influenced by unpredicted
    disaster, the data is hard to recover. This requires the developers to prepare
    local backup. Cloud computing provides new possibilities for software engineering
    researchers to explore multilateral software development [2]. Several researchers
    attempted to use cloud computing for reducing the cost of operation, delivery
    and software development [164]. In [164] authors explored how to replace Learning
    Management Systems (LMS) services with a cloud platform for sharing the knowledge
    and collaboration among university students. Software systems are being replaced
    by cloud-based systems to save the cost and maximum utilization of resources.
    In recent years when data is increasing on exponential rate then it is not easy
    to use the old traditional way of handling the data. The emerging technologies
    based on IoT, Blockchain, machine learning, and Artificial Intelligence are opening
    a new area of research in software engineering and the major issue in these technologies
    are handling the huge amount and variety of data. These researches also giving
    the opportunity to new researches and the new ways of handling the data in the
    cloud and this results for starting of upgraded technologies like – Fog Computing
    – first used by Cisco in order to extend the current cloud computing infrastructure
    [165]. Software companies working for building enterprise software are building
    an abstraction layer and offering it as a service, called Blockchain-as-a-Service
    [165]. All these emerging areas are new but heavily depend on software engineering.
    Open challenges and trends: The interested readers can further explore using extensive
    survey on Software Engineering [176]. The open challenges and future research
    directions for Software Engineering are summarized as follows: 1. To investigates
    the feasibility of IoT based Software engineering solutions on how organizations
    can deliver high business value through technology and operations strategy engagements
    at the same time can generate Return On Investment (ROI) by effectively utilizing
    the possibilities of IoT in business. 2. There is a need for software engineers
    to devise specialized tools and techniques for Blockchain-oriented software development.
    3. How to program the system “automatically” using Artificial Intelligence instead
    of writing the software code manually? 4.17. 5G and beyond Next generation networks
    promise not only extremely high data rates and low latency, but also ubiquitous
    coverage and massive IoT. Today, dense network deployment is one of the effective
    strategies to meet the capacity and connectivity demands of the fifth-generation
    (5G) cellular system [117]. 5G is the fifth generation of cellular mobile communications,
    preceded by 4G (LTE/WiMax), 3G (UMTS), and 2G (GSM) systems. 5G are expected to
    provide high-speed data rates, reduced latency, reduced energy consumption, effective
    cost, enhanced system capacity, and massive simultaneous device connectivity [118].
    One of the main objectives of 5G networks is to support applications that involve
    a high density of devices. In this regard, the concepts of massive Machine-Type
    Communications (mMTC), enhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB) and Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency
    Communications (URLLC) are being developed to support such applications [119].
    5G will bring major advances in the network and communications systems by providing
    ultra-high-speed data transmission that can be 100 times faster than the existing
    4G [120]. Edge computing as an evolution of cloud computing shifts the application
    hosting paradigm from the centralized data centers to the network edge, closer
    to consumers and the data generated by applications [121]. Edge computing is considered
    one of the main enablers for satisfying the demanding Key Performance Indicators
    (KPIs) of 5G such as enhanced mobile broadband, low latency and massive connectivity.
    The boosting computation-intensive applications in the Internet of Things (IoT)
    era along with the growing number of mission-critical tasks in emerging networks
    is a main bottleneck in the design of the real-time communication systems [122,123].
    In order to tackle the massive computing demands and the scarcity of the resources
    (i.e., small size and low power) available at the mobile device, Mobile Edge Computing
    (MEC) is considered as a promising solution to enhance mobile user''s computation
    capability and realize low-latency communications [124]. Cloud-like MEC server
    along with the Access Point (AP) at the edge of networks [125]. The advantage
    of MEC enables the resource-limited mobile users to offload tasks for remote execution
    at the more powerful MEC server in their proximity, which brings the benefit of
    improved computation capacity and reduced latency [126]. The advent of 5G and
    cloud computing will enhance the capacity, functionality, and flexibility of a
    network operators to offer new range of services [117]. Open challenges and trends:
    The interested readers can further explore using extensive survey on 5G and Beyond
    [177]. The open challenges and future research directions for 5G and Beyond are
    summarized as follows: 1. The boosting computation-intensive applications in the
    IoT era along with the growing number of mission-critical tasks in emerging 5G
    networks is a main bottleneck in the design of the real-time communication systems.
    2. 5G networks needs to use Blockchain technology to deliver secure communication.
    3. Data analytics on massive amount of data collected from the massive number
    of sensors in the Industrial IoT use cases can be managed in cost effective manner
    by using 5G based Artificial systems. 4.18. Autoscaling Elasticity feature of
    cloud computing has brought about the opportunity for utilizing self-adaptive
    solutions to minimize the cost of resources while preserving QoS. Self-additivity
    is realized through resource auto-scaling, aka planning, reconfiguration and provisioning.
    Auto-scaling, i.e. dynamically adjustment of computing resources like Virtual
    Machines (VMs), is a widely investigated mechanism [178], by which researchers
    mainly seek for (a) horizontal adjustments, i.e., adding/removing VMs; (b) vertical
    adjustments, i.e., adding/removing resources of VMs [158]; (c) decision-making
    methods, including analytical modeling, control theory, and machine learning [1];
    (d) leveraging varied pricing model, i.e., On-Demand, Reserved and Spot [159];
    and, (e) substituting light-weight container-based machines with hypervisors [160].
    Motivated by QoS requirements, particularly latency, auto-scaling mechanisms are
    always facing two main questions: how to reach a scaling decision timely? And,
    how to execute the decision timely? To reach timely decision, first and foremost
    is to use forecasting using AI. However, conventional machine learning might be
    inefficient when it comes to IoT applications requiring timely error correction,
    as they lack automotive correction without human-intervention. Besides, while
    the need for timely execution and provisioning of resources, in seconds, in cloud
    was about to be accomplished by utilizing container-based solution and by providing
    burstable performance resource [161], latency-critical IoT applications and microservices
    requiring responds in the scale of millisecond appeared—deteriorating the situation.
    A smart car, for instance, continuously senses the wheel speed, the pedestrians’
    movement, and vehicle surrounding; if tailgating is about to happen, for example,
    it must decide in milliseconds and activate the brake-by-wire system, otherwise
    a disaster might happen. This challenge requires auto-scaling mechanisms for IoT
    applications to be aware of mobility, geo-distribution, and location, for which
    cloud is unable to provide solutions lonely because of unstable and long-delay
    links between cloud and users [156]. In fact, cloud naturally conflicts with Industry
    4.0 (i.e. digitization of manufacturing) principles, e.g. real-time controlling
    and decentralized decision-making, hence auto-scaling needs extending. Filling
    such gaps requires two main actions: (a) collaboration between insular clouds
    and (b) bringing the computing close to users/IoT applications—Fog/Edge computing.
    However, such collaborative environments, firstly, raise serious monetization
    concerns for cloud providers [162]. Secondly, although Fog/Edge can extend auto-scaling
    mechanisms execution so that they can be performed by devices in the close proximity
    to users or in fog nodes at the edge of network, as well as cloud, such decentralized
    environments demands the actual realization of 5G networks which is still in the
    infant stages of development. Further, effort could be intelligent prediction
    and decision-making which is becoming the first-class citizens of every optimization
    problem; however, tradition machine learning models, for instance, return inaccurate
    predictions in some cases which require to be fixed by the programmers, conflicting
    with latency requirements of applications. Open challenges and trends: The interested
    readers can further explore using extensive survey on Autoscaling [178]. The open
    challenges and future research directions for Autoscaling are summarized as follows:
    1. Extending auto-scaling across the compute continuum from IoT devices to cloud
    in order for timely execution/processing of scaling decisions is a challenging
    problem that needs to be addressed. 2. Blockchain-enabled auto-scaling utilizing
    Blockchain capabilities such as Smart SCs in order for addressing first security
    concerns and second unsolved monetization problem in federated cloud for services
    provided in collaborative computing is a new challenge. 3. Self-correction prediction
    and multi-objective auto-scaling using AI for the trade-off between performance
    and cost can be accomplished using Deep Learning. Recently, deep learning, i.e.
    automation of predictive analytics—a subset of AI—has gain more attention for
    solving the problems which have not been yet solved. 5. Insights of triumvirate
    to the cloud computing evolution: A vision The purpose of the study would be to
    see how the three new technologies (Blockchain, IoT and Artificial Intelligence)
    will influence the evolution of cloud computing. We reviewed 140 research papers
    in this systematic review and presented them in a categorized manner and it comprises
    of most recent research work related to cloud computing paradigms and technologies.
    We discussed the research issues addressed and open challenges that need more
    attention in future to conduct next level research. Fig. 3 shows the insights
    of the triumvirate (Blockchain, IoT and Artificial Intelligence) to the evolution
    of cloud computing. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Insights of triumvirate
    to the cloud computing evolution. 6. A conceptual model for cloud futurology:
    Holistic view To resolve the above-mentioned challenges, there is a requirement
    of conceptual model to explore the influence of three emerging paradigms (Blockchain,
    IoT and Artificial Intelligence) on evolution of cloud computing. Fig. 4 shows
    the conceptual model, which describes the transformation effects of paradigms
    and technologies on cloud computing evolution. The model integrates the three
    paradigms: IoT, Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence to provide a holistic view
    of an abstract design encompassing multiple domains in computer science. Various
    components of IoT including sensors and actuators communicate with the gateway,
    all connected through 5G technology. The user interacts with the model using app
    interface on the gateway device with compute costing through Bitcoin (or related
    cryptocurrency) technology. The gateway layer also contains basic pre-processing
    data engine and various IoT applications for task generation and result collection
    in seamless fashion. The tasks are sent to and managed by the Broker nodes which
    authenticate payments and other transactions with sophisticated energy and resource
    management modules, backed with fault tolerance and security systems. These nodes
    are also connected to the database and external controllers through SDN. The computation
    tasks are executed on fog or cloud machines (physical or virtual) having robust
    data analytics, deep learning and Blockchain mining capabilities. Software engineering
    and autoscaling allow end-to-end integration with cloud allowing resource availability
    from server-based deployments to serverless frameworks. The model is enhanced
    by quantum computing technologies. Overall, the model integrates and enables computation
    using a plethora of technological advancements and provides an enhanced and holistic
    setup for next generation computing environments. Download : Download full-size

    Cloud computing is an emerging paradigm, enabling on demand, metered access to
    compute resources (Process, Memory, Storage, etc.) driving technological innovation
    and enabling geographically distributed applications. In this review paper, we
    have presented the systematic review of computing paradigms and technologies and
    the influence of triumvirate (Blockchain, IoT and Artificial Intelligence) to
    the evolution of cloud computing. The history and background of computing paradigms
    and technologies has been presented and designed its evolution. Further, the research
    areas related to cloud computing have been identified, discussed and the research
    issues and challenges are highlighted. We have proposed a conceptual model to
    explore the influence of three emerging paradigms (Blockchain, IoT and Artificial
    Intelligence) on evolution of cloud computing. We hope that this systemic review
    will be beneficial for researchers who want to do research in any area concerning
    to cloud computing. Declaration of Competing Interest We do not have any conflicts

    Outline Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: With the
    deep combination of both modern information technology and traditional agriculture,
    the era of agriculture 4.0, which takes the form of smart agriculture, has come.
    Smart agriculture provides solutions for agricultural intelligence and automation.
    However, information security issues cannot be ignored with the development of
    agriculture brought by modern information technology. In this paper, three typical
    development modes of smart agriculture (precision agriculture, facility agriculture,
    and order agriculture) are presented. Then, 7 key technologies and 11 key applications
    are derived from the above modes. Based on the above technologies and applications,
    6 security and privacy countermeasures (authentication and access control, privacy-preserving,
    blockchain-based solutions for data integrity, cryptography and key management,
    physical countermeasures, and intrusion detection systems) are summarized and
    discussed. Moreover, the security challenges of smart agriculture are analyzed
    and organized into two aspects: 1) agricultural production, and 2) information
    technology. Most current research projects have not taken agricultural equipment
    as potential security threats. Therefore, we did some additional experiments based
    on solar insecticidal lamps Internet of Things, and the results indicate that
    agricultural equipment has an impact on agricultural security. Finally, more technologies
    (5 G communication, fog computing, Internet of Everything, renewable energy management
    system, software defined network, virtual reality, augmented reality, and cyber
    security datasets for smart agriculture) are described as the future research
    directions of smart agriculture. Published in: IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica

    Funding Agency: I. Introduction Agriculture is the primary industry in the world,
    and it plays an important role in social stability and economic development [1].
    Overcoming the contradiction between the population explosion and the limited
    grain yield is a challenge that motivates an increasing number of studies on smart
    agriculture. The development of agriculture is based on both the improvement in
    productivity and the restrictions of the era, and the progress of science and
    technology drives the revolution of agriculture [2]. Fig. 1 is used to help readers
    understand the characteristics and confronted issues of agriculture development
    (from Agriculture 1.0 to Agriculture 4.0). • Agriculture 1.0: the traditional
    agricultural era (between 1784 and around 1870) dominated by human and animal
    resources, the main issue of agriculture was the low efficiency of operation.
    • Agriculture 2.0: the era of mechanized agriculture (in the 20th century), the
    main issue was the inefficient use of resources. • Agriculture 3.0: the era of
    high-speed development of automatic agriculture (between 1992 to 2017), the main

    • The role of Internet of Things in arable farming is reviewed. • Internet of
    Things is leading arable farming to become data-driven. • Implementation and application
    are described in depth. • Challenges, corresponding solutions and potentials are
    discussed thoroughly. The Internet of Things is allowing agriculture, here specifically
    arable farming, to become data-driven, leading to more timely and cost-effective
    production and management of farms, and at the same time reducing their environmental
    impact. This review is addressing an analytical survey of the current and potential
    application of Internet of Things in arable farming, where spatial data, highly
    varying environments, task diversity and mobile devices pose unique challenges
    to be overcome compared to other agricultural systems. The review contributes
    an overview of the state of the art of technologies deployed. It provides an outline
    of the current and potential applications, and discusses the challenges and possible
    solutions and implementations. Lastly, it presents some future directions for
    the Internet of Things in arable farming. Current issues such as smart phones,
    intelligent management of Wireless Sensor Networks, middleware platforms, integrated
    Farm Management Information Systems across the supply chain, or autonomous vehicles
    and robotics stand out because of their potential to lead arable farming to smart
    arable farming. During the implementation, different challenges are encountered,
    and here interoperability is a key major hurdle throughout all the layers in the
    architecture of an Internet of Things system, which can be addressed by shared
    standards and protocols. Challenges such as affordability, device power consumption,
    network latency, Big Data analysis, data privacy and security, among others, have
    been identified by the articles reviewed and are discussed in detail. Different
    solutions to all identified challenges are presented addressing technologies such
    as machine learning, middleware platforms, or intelligent data management. Previous

    The global population and its food consumption are growing alarmingly quickly,
    while climate change effects are simultaneously complicating the challenge of
    ensuring food security in a sustainable manner (Godfray et al., 2010, Tilman et
    al., 2011). Data-driven agriculture is one of the main strategies and concepts
    proposed to increase production efficiently while decreasing its environmental
    impact (Foley et al., 2011). Data-driven technologies in general are quickly advancing
    with the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), and may become an important
    part of the future of farming (Brewster et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2016,
    Verdouw, 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Smart Farming, also called Agriculture 4.0
    or digital farming (CEMA, 2017), is developing beyond the modern concept of precision
    agriculture, which bases its management practices on spatial measurements largely
    thanks to Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Smart farming bases its management
    tasks also on spatial data but is enhanced with context-awareness and is activated
    by real-time events, improving the performance of hitherto precision agriculture
    solutions (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Additionally, Smart
    Farming usually incorporates intelligent services for applying and managing Information
    and Communication Technologies (ICT) in farming, and allows transverse integration
    throughout the whole agri-food chain in regards to food safety and traceability
    (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). IoT is therefore a key technology in smart farming
    since it ensures data flow between sensors and other devices, making it possible
    to add value to the obtained data by automatic processing, analysis and access,
    and this leads to more timely and cost-effective production and management effort
    on farms. Simultaneously, IoT enables the reduction of the inherent environmental
    impact by real-time reaction to alert events such as weed, pest or disease detection,
    weather or soil monitoring warnings, which allow for a reduction and adequate
    use of inputs such as agrochemicals or water. IoT eases documentation and supervision
    of different activities as well as the traceability of products, improving the
    environmental surveying and control in farms by the appropriate authorities. The
    IoT concept was introduced by Kevin Ashton in 1999 in relation to linking Radio-Frequency
    Identification (RFID) for supply chains to the internet (Ashton, 2009), but has
    no official definition. It implies, however, the connection of a network of “things”
    to or through the internet without direct human intervention. “Things” can be
    any object with sensors and/or actuators that is uniquely addressable, interconnected
    and accessible through the world-wide computer network, i.e. the Internet. The
    application of IoT in agriculture is advantageous because of the possibility to
    monitor and control many different parameters in an interoperable, scalable and
    open context with an increasing use of heterogeneous automated components (Kamilaris,
    Gao, Prenafeta-Boldu, & Ali, 2016), in addition to the inevitable requirement
    for traceability. As a result of IoT, agriculture is becoming data-driven, i.e.
    making informed real-time decisions for managing the farm, reducing uncertainties
    and inefficiencies, and as a consequence reducing its environmental impact. The
    application of IoT in agriculture, also called Ag-IoT (Zhai, 2017), AIoT (Zou
    & Quan, 2017), or IoF meaning Internet of Farming (Alahmadi, Alwajeeh, Mohanan,
    & Budiarto, 2017) or Internet of Food and Farm (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), has received exponentially increasing attention in the scientific
    community (Fig. 1). Even though the publications are mainly dominated by Asian
    scientists (Talavera et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016), in Europe several large scale
    international pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019), are aiming to implement IoT technologies in the agricultural
    industry in Europe. Similar projects elsewhere include the Accelerating Precision
    Agriculture to Decision Agriculture (P2D) project in Australia (Zhang, Baker,
    Jakku, & Llewellyn, 2017), which complement additional major investments with
    the aim to help farmers convert to smart farming (Higgins et al., 2017, Pham and
    Stack, 2018). Download : Download high-res image (95KB) Download : Download full-size

    searching criteria: (Internet of things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    Several reviews have been done on IoT in agriculture in the relatively short time
    period in which publications about the subject have emerged (Ray, 2017, Stočes
    et al., 2016, Talavera et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). In
    addition, review papers have been published with a focus on specific subjects
    related to IoT applied in agriculture, such as Big Data (Kamilaris et al., 2017,
    Wolfert et al., 2017), modelling (O''Grady & O''Hare, 2017), Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) (Jawad, Nordin, Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, 2017), food supply chain (Ramundo,
    Taisch, & Terzi, 2016), Internet of Underground Things (Vuran, Salam, Wong, &
    Irmak, 2018), chemical wireless sensors (Kassal, Steinberg, & Murkovi, 2018),
    or Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015;
    Kaloxylos et al., 2012). However, to the authors'' knowledge, no existing review
    has focused on arable farming, which has specific characteristics and challenges
    that differ from those in a controlled environment, i.e. greenhouses, or permanent
    crops such as fruit orchards. Arable farming poses particular challenges due to:
    • much larger farm sizes, which affect the design of the sensor networks, the
    data processing, analysis and extrapolation of limited stationary sensor data,
    and the consequent decision making with regards to actuators, vehicle logistics,
    etc.; • the larger farm sizes also imply that spatial data has a central role
    in arable farming, affecting the data processing, decision making and precision
    machinery employed to address in-field variability not at plant level as in most
    permanent crops, but at subfield level with automatic recognition and actuation
    (Zude-Sasse, Fountas, Gemtos, & Abu-Khalaf, 2016); • greater use of mobile sensors
    and other devices on vehicles, which have specific challenges. While other cropping
    systems may also use sensors and devices on operating machinery, arable farming
    often requires a fleet of vehicles to operate in a co-ordinated fashion. This
    creates issues particularly regarding network infrastructure (Martínez, Pastor,
    Álvarez, & Iborra, 2016), e.g. connectivity to the cloud of moving things that
    rely mainly on mobile networks, or vehicle to implement communication, which implies
    real-time interoperability between machines and devices from different manufacturers
    (Peets, Mouazen, Blackburn, Kuang, & Wiebensohn, 2012); • larger amounts of heterogeneous
    spatial data generated at different rates and from very disparate sources: stationary
    sensors, moving vehicles and implements, satellites, data from web services, etc.,
    which need to be intelligently integrated; • highly varying and uncertain environmental
    conditions, as annual crops are more susceptible to weather changes and other
    external factors than permanent crops, which are more resilient mainly due to
    their deeper roots (Zude-Sasse et al., 2016), or crops in controlled environments.
    This obligates the IoT system to handle both spatial and temporal data, increasing
    the complexity of the data processing as well as the decisions based on the data
    collected. • more diverse types of field tasks per growing season in arable farming,
    from soil preparation and crop establishment, through highly varying plant nursing
    tasks, to coordinated harvest, which increase the complexity and also the risks.
    The IoT in agriculture is a fast-developing field, which can make reviews obsolete
    quickly. This challenge can be overcome by focussing a critical view on the general
    principles, main application areas and identify the limitations and challenges.
    Summarising, the aim of the paper is to provide an up to date novel analytical
    review of the role of IoT in arable farming, with the following specific objectives:
    • Provide an overview of the current situation of IoT technologies deployed in
    arable farming. Focussing on the current use of communication technologies and
    protocols, the generation and analysis of data, and IoT architectures. • Outline
    the different applications and capabilities of IoT in arable farming. • Investigate
    the main challenges encountered by IoT enabling technologies applied to arable
    farming. • Present key potential fields of application where IoT could be employed,
    as well as future directions of the current trends. The remaining part of this
    paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the methodology used in this
    review paper. Section 3 provides an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies
    used in arable farming; Section 4 presents an outline of the current and potential
    IoT-based applications in arable farming; Section 5 discusses the challenges and
    solutions found in its implementation; and lastly, the review closes with Section
    6 in which future directions are summarised. 2. Review methodology In order to
    address the specific objectives identified above, the literature listing from
    the SCOPUS database of the last 11 years has been reviewed. More precisely, the
    timeframe investigated was from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2018, selected as
    the whole period in which any literature about the subject turned up in the studied
    database. SCOPUS was selected as the primary literature source as it is a key
    peer-reviewed research literature database. The specific keywords used in the
    search criteria where: (Internet of Things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    To ease the searching process, the keywords needed to be present in at least the
    title, abstract, highlights or keywords. Additionally, the articles had to be
    published in English. Articles concerning greenhouse, livestock or permanent crops
    were excluded from the survey, as were supply chain related articles. However,
    issues concerning traceability at farm level were included. The survey was performed
    in a systematic manner following three steps (see Fig. 2): • Firstly, a list of
    1193 articles meeting the search criteria mentioned above was retrieved from the
    database. • In the second step, by reading the titles, any article that was clearly
    not related to arable farming was excluded, leaving a list of 293 articles. •
    In the last step, a second screening was made by reading the abstracts, where
    articles outside the focus of this review were omitted. After this step, 167 articles
    were studied in detail, from which 69 articles were considered relevant, 27 as
    partially relevant, while the rest were considered of little relevance. Relevance
    concerned mainly the connection of the article to the subject studied. The content
    of a relevant article directly addresses the application of an IoT technology
    in an arable farming scenario. A partially relevant article studies a certain
    IoT technology in agriculture in a broader sense. In the distinction made regarding
    little relevant articles included off-topic, lack of novelty, as well as non-peer-reviewed
    articles that lacked scientific rigour, e.g. ambiguous information or absence
    of materials or methods description. Download : Download high-res image (208KB)

    The final 167 articles studied included: 77 journal papers, 88 conference papers
    and 4 book chapters, of which 19 were review papers. The final list of articles
    was complemented with other publications that expanded on some of the IoT related
    subjects and technologies mentioned in the studied articles, and did not contain
    the specified keywords. These were found by a targeted search for specific subjects.
    Lastly, in each article from the final list a special focus was made on the IoT
    technologies employed, the applications, the challenges encountered and, finally,
    on potential future perspectives. 3. IoT implementation in arable farming IoT
    has recently been gaining momentum in the farming industry as it can fulfil the
    urgent necessity for interoperability across brands, scalability and traceability
    (Kamilaris et al., 2016). Different technologies are implemented as IoT is still
    evolving, adapting to a great diversity of uses. To cover the range of technologies,
    protocols, standards, etc. employed, this review is addressing the layers in the
    IoT architecture. Three layers normally describe the architecture of the IoT in
    the literature reviewed (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Khattab et al., 2016,
    Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Na and Isaac, 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw,
    2016), though some authors divide it into more layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Ramundo et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Talavera et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2014),
    depending on their definitions. More than three layers can especially be relevant
    in IoT systems with edge or fog computing, where an edge/fog computing layer can
    be considered in between the device and network layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016). Even though the naming of the layers also varies depending on the author,
    there is nonetheless a general trend to divide the layers into device, network
    and application layers (Fig. 3). Thus, this has been the adapted structure in
    this review. The device layer consists of the physical objects (things) that are
    capable of automatic identification, sensing or actuation, and connection to the
    internet. The network layer communicates the data to a gateway (or proxy server)
    to the internet (cloud) by the use of communication protocols. And the application
    layer typically stores and facilitates access for the end-user to the processed/analysed
    information. Download : Download high-res image (222KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. IoT architecture represented by device, network and application
    layer, in which the middleware platform is not always present. The collected data
    experience diverse stages during their transition from sensors to cloud, interfaces,
    and occasionally actuators, and these stages have considerable influence on the
    technologies applied in an IoT context. Six main stages regarding data flow have
    been identified in the literature reviewed: sensing/perception, communication/transport/transfer,
    storage, processing, analytics, and actuation and display (Fig. 4). The order
    of the stages is different depending on the IoT setup employed and the computing
    techniques used, e.g. fog and edge computing processes the data before communicating
    it to the cloud, an example of its application in precision farming is given by
    Ferrández-Pastor et al. (2016); while cloud computing processes the data in the
    cloud, examples of this are given by Hernandez-Rojas, Mazon-Olivo, Novillo-Vicuña,
    and Belduma-Vacacela (2018) and Na and Isaac (2016). Nonetheless, sensing/perception
    is normally the first stage, where data are captured by sensors, then the data
    can follow different paths and does not necessarily go through all the steps listed.
    In summary, IoT data is identified to be gathered or generated through three main
    processes: machine generated, which come from sensing devices; process-mediated,
    i.e. commercial data coming from business processes; and human-sourced, recorded
    by humans and digitalised later on (Balducci, Impedovo, Informatica, & Moro, 2018).
    These different sources have an influence on how to process, analyse and use the
    data in IoT solutions, and this needs to be taken into account in the overall
    data acquisition planning process. Download : Download high-res image (171KB)

    in arable farming. 3.1. Device layer As mentioned above, the device layer consists
    of the physical objects (things) that are capable of automatic identification,
    sensing or actuating, and providing connection to the internet. Sensor devices
    measure and collect one or more parameters automatically and transmit the data
    wirelessly to the cloud. And, when the devices become actuators, they generally,
    in turn, receive data from the cloud in order to activate or deactivate some mechanical
    component, e.g. a valve in an irrigation system. The device layer is also often
    called perception layer (Tzounis et al., 2017, Zou and Quan, 2017), sensing layer
    (Na and Isaac, 2016, Wang et al., 2014), or physical layer (Ramundo et al., 2016,
    Talavera et al., 2017). The devices are constituted of a transceiver, a microcontroller,
    an interfacing circuit and one or more sensors and/or actuators. The sensor measures
    a physical parameter, e.g. air temperature that is interpreted and transformed
    into an equivalent analogue signal, i.e. electric voltage or current, which is
    then converted by the interfacing circuit, i.e. Analogue-to-Digital Converter
    (ADC), into a corresponding digital format. Afterwards, the microcontroller, sometimes
    also in the form of microprocessors or single-board computers (Talavera et al.,
    2017), collects the data in digital format from one or more sensors through the
    ADC, and sends them to the transceiver, i.e. a wireless communication module,
    which communicates the data to a gateway. A comparison of microcontrollers and
    single-board computers used in IoT in agriculture has been made by Ray (2017).
    In the case of edge computing, the microcontroller or single-board computer processes
    the data from one or more sensors before communicating them, with the intention
    of, for example, reducing the amount of data to be transferred to the cloud and
    accelerating the data processing (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et
    al., 2016). In fog computing the data are processed in the local area network
    level, i.e. in a fog node or IoT gateway (Ahmed, Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed,
    De et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018). When employing an actuator, the
    signal is received by the transceiver, communicated to the microcontroller, where
    it is then converted to analogue signal by a Digital-to-Analogue Converter (DAC),
    i.e. the interfacing circuit, or to a digital signal by a Digital-to-Digital Converter,
    and finally interpreted by the actuator, which acts in accordance to the signal
    received. In arable farming, when agricultural machinery data are used, i.e. data
    from sensors and devices mounted on tractors or other agricultural machinery,
    the data in digital format is normally collected and accessible through the Controller
    Area Network (CAN) bus in the machine, although in some cases some data are accessible
    through other ports (Oksanen et al., 2016, Peets et al., 2012). Machine and operator
    performance information is accessible through the Machine and Implement Control
    System (MICS) of the machine, which can also be accessed through the CAN bus data.
    MICS data are used to allow machinery operators and farm managers to monitor and
    potentially improve the efficiency of their machines, by employing e.g. smart
    alerts or recommendation systems (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015). Global Navigation Satellite
    System (GNSS) data, e.g. Real Time Kinematics GPS (RTK-GPS), are often also available
    through the CAN bus port, which allows, among others, vehicle monitoring and dynamic
    optimised route planning Edwards et al., 2017, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018. Many
    different sensors and actuators are employed in arable farming. The type of device
    used depends on the purpose of the system in addition to the technologies implemented
    in the system. And the number of devices is steadily increasing. The number of
    IoT device installations in farms is expected to increase globally from 30 million
    installations in 2015 to 75 million in 2020. Furthermore, data points generated
    per day and farm are expected to increase from 190000 in 2014 to over half a million
    by 2020 (Meola, 2016). It was also estimated that by 2018 there would be 10 billion
    IoT devices employed in agriculture. However, the great amount of data generated
    is often unused or underutilised (Bennett, 2015), e.g. in countries like Denmark
    with a relative high ICT adoption in farms, in 2016 only 2–5% of farmers worked
    actively with the data generated (SEGES, 2016). Even if data usage is still relatively
    low, it is expected to increase rapidly (Bennett, 2015, Wolfert et al., 2017,
    World Bank, 2017) An overview about how they are implemented for different purposes
    is presented in the Applications section. 3.2. Network layer The network layer
    communicates the data initially to an intermediary platform and eventually to
    the internet (cloud), and from there to, for example, employed actuators. When
    the data are transferred to the intermediary platform, it typically uses wireless
    communication technologies, for instance RFID, WSN with Zigbee, LoRa (Long Range),
    etc., and more recently Near-Field Communication (NFC) (Kassal et al., 2018, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). The intermediary platform
    is normally an internet gateway located in the vicinity of the connected devices,
    also including sometimes a proxy server, where the data are collected and occasionally
    processed in order to send the information further to the end user through the
    internet by the use of e.g. MQTT standards, or HTML or XMPP protocols. The use
    of Android smart devices or other operating systems is also increasing in popularity
    among agricultural applications, as they can be employed as a gateway for 3G and
    4G networks, and they frequently include other wireless communication technologies,
    e.g. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPRS and NFC. They also automatically conform to communication
    standards and protocols, in which way interoperability is increased (Balmos et
    al., 2016, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Gao and Yao, 2016, Hernandez-Rojas et
    al., 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). In addition, Android and other smart
    devices can include GNSS and RGB camera sensors, and can relatively easily be
    programmed for computing data and displaying Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications
    being able to straightforwardly update the software if necessary. In that manner,
    Android and similar smart devices are represented in all three IoT layers, i.e.
    sensing in the device layer, node or gateway in the network layer, and computing
    data and displaying GUI in the application layer. Furthermore, the automatic software
    updating possibilities of smart devices allow remote installation of updates with
    new functionalities, bug fixes, etc. and easily improve the interoperability of
    the system (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). Many different wireless technologies
    have been applied for diverse purposes in agriculture, depending on economic,
    accessibility and capability factors. Jawad et al., 2017, Ray, 2017 and Tzounis
    et al. (2017) have presented good overviews of the specifications of wireless
    communication technologies implemented in IoT in an agricultural context, which
    have been here collected in Table 1 and complemented with information from other
    relevant articles (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Elijah et al., 2018, Kassal et al.,
    2018, Sinha et al., 2017, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). The great variety of technologies,
    standards and frequency bands used exposes the relevant interoperability and application
    challenges found when applying IoT technologies. Potential communication standards
    for smart farming can be classified into short-range and long-range according
    to their communication distance, which determines their specific usability in
    different requirement settings. This is particularly the case in arable farming,
    where mobile network accessibility can be an issue in many rural areas, and where
    large farm sizes limit the use of some wireless technologies due to their reduced
    communication distance and due to the necessity to replace/recharge device batteries
    on nodes over large areas. These issues are addressed in the challenges section
    later. Table 1. Wireless communication technologies (adapted from Jawad et al.,

    m 1 mW a Not yet publicly available. A WSN is formed by pervasive devices called
    motes or sensor nodes, which integrate sensors and actuators that communicate
    wirelessly forming a spatial network (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). In a WSN, base stations act as gateways forwarding
    the data to the cloud. Different communication technologies support different
    network node architectures, e.g. star, tree or mesh. Depending on the application,
    different wireless communication technologies are employed in a WSN as each has
    different node architecture possibilities, data rates, ranges, standards, among
    others, with the use of ZigBee, LoRa, Bluetooth/BLE, WiFi and SigFox being relatively
    common in agriculture. In arable farming, BLE has for example been employed for
    soil and air monitoring and irrigation control (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018);
    ZigBee was used in a WSN for monitoring soil conditions and actuating an irrigation
    system (Mafuta et al., 2012) and crop monitoring (Zhai, 2017); and LoRa for air
    and water temperature of rice paddy fields (Tanaka, 2018) and smart irrigation
    control (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018). In order to cover
    larger distances, GPRS is appropriate and has been used for irrigation control
    (López-Riquelme et al., 2017), and for remote maintenance of machinery (Miettinen,
    Oksanen, Suomi, & Visala, 2006). GPRS, or other technologies, such as LTE, or
    3G/4G, are also commonly used at the gateway to transmit data to the cloud. Regarding
    other less common communication technologies used in WSNs, RFID can be integrated
    into a WSN too by connecting the RFID tag readers to a radio-frequency transceiver
    (Costa et al., 2013). Passive and active RFID technologies are used to a great
    extent in agricultural research and industry (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), especially
    for animal production (e.g. Kamilaris et al., 2016), as well as vegetable or fruit
    product traceability (e.g. Kodali, Jain, & Karagwal, 2017); however, in arable
    farming only few examples have been found: e.g. RFID tags used for irrigation
    scheduling (Vellidis, Tucker, Perry, Kvien, & Bednarz, 2008), for agrochemical
    traceability (Peets, Gasparin, Blackburn, & Godwin, 2009), for vehicle monitoring
    (Sjolander, Thomasson, Sui, & Ge, 2011), and even on a prototype for soil temperature
    monitoring (Hamrita & Hoffacker, 2005). Regarding NFC, no concrete examples of
    NFC used in arable farming have been found in the literature reviewed. Finally,
    the latest generation of mobile communications, i.e. 5G, has higher data rates,
    large coverage areas, higher peak throughput, and also improved flexibility, which
    can open new possibilities and may solve some of the challenges encountered by
    many IoT solutions (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Marsch et al., 2016). 5G allows new
    options for monitoring rural areas with no previous infrastructure for Internet
    connection (Faraci, Raciti, Rizzo, & Schembra, 2018). 5G can also improve vehicle-to-vehicle
    or vehicle-to-anything communication in e.g. logistics solutions, due to its low
    latency and new frequency bands (Marsch et al., 2016). A challenge for the 5G
    networks will be the great increase in devices to support once IoT becomes a standard
    solution not only in agriculture, but also in any sphere of everyday life. 3.3.
    Application layer The application layer is crucial in an IoT context as it is
    this layer that actually adds value to the sensed and communicated data through
    directly controlling devices, supporting farmers'' decision making, etc. In this
    layer, several important services occur such as data storage, data analytics,
    data access through an appropriate Application Programming Interface (API), as
    well as possibly a user interfaced software application. The layer may also include
    middleware platforms that aid handling the heterogeneous cloud data improving
    interoperability. Data storage can be cloud based, i.e. on multiple servers, or
    more local based, where data are stored in different types of databases, depending
    on the application and design. Even if relational databases, such as Structured
    Query Language (SQL) databases (Gao and Yao, 2016, Goap et al., 2018, Ray, 2017,
    Wang et al., 2014), MySQL (Kaloxylos et al., 2014), or PostgreSQL (Mazon-Olivo,
    Hernández-Rojas, Maza-Salinas, & Pan, 2018) are employed in some of the reported
    applications in the reviewed articles, non-relational databases, such as Not only
    SQL (NoSQL), or also SPARQL, a semantic query language based database, are gaining
    attention due to their flexibility and scalability, especially when dealing with
    Big Data. Their ability to store and manage large amounts of heterogeneous data
    makes them suitable in many IoT agricultural contexts (Huang and Zhang, 2017,
    Kamilaris et al., 2017). Examples of NoSQL employed in agriculture are Cassandra
    (Huang & Zhang, 2017), Dynamo (Xian, 2017), HBase (Ray, 2017, Wang et al., 2014)
    and MongoDB (Martínez et al., 2016). An example of SPARQL has been given by Jayaraman
    et al. (2016). Data analytics can be achieved by cloud computing, where computer
    resources are managed remotely to analyse data, often Big Data, or by distributed
    computing, e.g. edge and fog computing. Cloud computing has the advantage that
    it provides high quality services that allow independent execution of multiple
    applications as if they were isolated, even if they are on the same platform,
    e.g. in data centres, which is especially relevant when dealing with Big Data
    (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Martínez et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017). However,
    cloud computing techniques mostly rely on general purpose cloud providers that
    do not comply with specific agricultural service requirements (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017) and can experience latency issues, which are not acceptable in IoT
    solutions where monitoring, control and analysis require fast performance (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2018). Examples of application of cloud computing related to arable farming
    are given by Khattab et al., 2016, Na and Isaac, 2016 and López-Riquelme et al.
    (2017). Khattab et al. (2016) present an IoT architecture with a cloud-based back-end
    where weather and soil data are processed and analysed for automatic activation
    of irrigation and spraying actions. Na and Isaac (2016) describe a human-centric
    IoT architecture with a list of cloud services, such as language translation,
    data simplification or updated market price information. And López-Riquelme et
    al. (2017) use FIWARE components for a cloud service for smart irrigation tasks,
    focussing on the benefits of using FIWARE as cloud provider. Regarding Big Data
    analysis and Big Data in general in an agricultural context, Kamilaris et al.
    (2017) and Wolfert et al. (2017) respectively have performed exhaustive reviews
    on the subject. The use of IoT middleware platforms is gaining interest due to
    its potential for solving different challenges found in the application of IoT,
    especially interoperability. IoT middleware platforms try to simplify the complex
    communication through the cloud due to heterogeneity of devices, communications
    and networks, by using enablers like standardised APIs and protocols (Jayaraman
    et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017). Examples of
    these are HYDRA, UBIWARE, UBIROAD, UBIDOTS, SMEPP, SIXTH, Think Speak, SensorCloud,
    Amazon IoT and IBM IoT, with focus on context aware functionality; SOCRADES, GSN
    and SIRENA, with more focus on security and privacy; Aneka, WSO2, PubNub, SmartFarmNet
    and FIWARE, with a wider services-oriented approach; and projects like IoT-A,
    OpenIoT, or ArrowHead (Gill et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2015, Jayaraman et
    al., 2016, Kamilaris et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016). Even if all these and more solutions are found in the IoT market,
    an intelligent middleware solution that addresses most issues observed in smart
    farming successfully is yet to be implemented (Jayaraman et al., 2016, Martínez
    et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). However, FIWARE (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    López-Riquelme et al., 2017, Martínez et al., 2016, Rodriguez et al., 2018) and
    SmartFarmNet (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Jayaraman et al., 2016) have been
    implemented effectively for precision and smart farming applications. In order
    to communicate data across platforms and IoT devices, ensuring interoperability,
    APIs are essential. These should adapt to evolving or new standards in order to
    ensure a longer life span, which may become a limitation if the APIs are not updated.
    It is through the APIs that data are made available for the IoT applications (e.g.
    Goap et al., 2018, Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018). These services may include tracing,
    monitoring, event management, forecasting or optimisation for agricultural activities
    and products. These applications related to arable farming are described in the
    next section. 4. Current and potential applications Multiple applications can
    be derived from the implementation of IoT in arable farming. These applications
    can always be conceptualised into the three IoT layers described previously, and
    are not to be confused with the application layer. Elaborations of the reviewed
    articles show that the applications have been differentiated and categorised as
    follows: monitoring, documentation, forecasting and controlling. Monitoring refers
    to timely sensing of very diverse parameters and is mostly the initial point of
    entry for other applications. Documentation covers the storing of sampled data
    for later use in e.g. farm management or traceability of produce. Forecasting
    employs different sources of data through precisely designed analytic methods
    for predicting concrete events. And controlling is the result of active monitoring,
    where processed data are used to automatically activate and control actuators
    in a predefined manner. A summarising table collects all the IoT applications
    in arable farming described in this chapter (Table 2). Most IoT-based systems
    include at least two of these applications and isolated applications are seldom
    seen. In addition, special attention has been paid to FMIS and associated decision
    support to improve operations and production processes involving vehicle positioning
    analytics, optimisation and logistics, which are key elements in arable farming
    (Bochtis et al., 2011, Bochtis et al., 2014) and have consequently got a section
    of their own. Table 2. IoT applications in arable farming. Applications Examples

    Automatic monitoring is the obvious first step in IoT applied to agriculture.
    Strategically placed sensors can automatically sense and transmit data to the
    cloud for further documentation, forecasting or controlling applications. Sensors
    are used to monitor crop parameters such as leaf area index (e.g. Bauer & Aschenbruck,
    2018), plant height and leaf colour, size and shape (e.g. Okayasu et al., 2017);
    soil parameters such as soil moisture (e.g. Brinkhoff et al., 2017, Kodali and
    Sahu, 2016) or soil chemistry (e.g. Kassal et al., 2018); irrigation water parameters
    such as pH and salinity (e.g. Popović et al., 2017); or weather parameters such
    as air temperature, air pressure, air relative humidity, rainfall, radiation,
    wind speed and wind direction (e.g. Yan et al., 2018). In addition, remote sensing
    can also be employed, i.e. instead of sensors placed in the field they are installed
    on satellites or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). However, these measurements mostly
    require some form of processing and interpretation as the values sampled are not
    directly related to the targeted parameters. An example of monitoring through
    remote sensing is the estimation of crop biomass and nitrogen content by the use
    of hyper- and multispectral images (Näsi et al., 2018), or the use of thermal
    remote sensing, which has been applied for e.g. irrigation scheduling or plant
    disease detection (Khanal, Fulton, & Shearer, 2017). Furthermore, agricultural
    machinery can also be remotely monitored, e.g. vehicle position and yield data
    (Oksanen et al., 2016), or machine performance (Miettinen et al., 2006). This
    is especially relevant with the increasing appearance of autonomous vehicles and
    robots in agriculture (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). Finally, at farm level the storage
    of crops can also be monitored to ensure the correct control of, for example,
    temperature and moisture, and avoid losses due to damage (Green et al., 2009,
    Juul et al., 2015). Environmental impact indicators should be integrated into
    farm monitoring applications, so that leaching (Burton, Dave, Fernandez, Jayachandran,
    & Bhansali, 2018), contaminants (Severino, D’Urso, Scarfato, & Toraldo, 2018)
    or emissions (Manap & Najib, 2014) are addressed too. 4.2. Documentation and traceability
    Collected operations and process data once stored can be used for documentation.
    Documentation is usually the natural application of monitored data but it must
    be noted that it can also include other types of sampled data, such as manually
    input or documentation of performed control actions (Sørensen, Pesonen, Bochtis,
    Vougioukas, & Suomi, 2011). The data are stored as raw data or as processed data
    at different levels. Documentation is essential for decision-making, controlling
    or analytics, and is an indispensable element in FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    Mapping is also a form of documentation where data are spatially projected onto
    a map. On-the-go sensors installed on vehicles and implements can be used for
    automated field mapping (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015), e.g. yield mapping used
    for later fertilisation planning (Lyle, Bryan, & Ostendorf, 2014), or soil mapping
    for site-specific amendment measures (Godwin and Miller, 2003, McBratney et al.,
    2003). Remote sensing can also be used for mapping crop development (Khanal et
    al., 2017, Näsi et al., 2018, Viljanen et al., 2018), or soil texture and residue
    coverage (Khanal et al., 2017). Remote sensing is becoming a popular tool for
    monitoring and mapping, but is yet to be proven feasible for all its potential
    applications. When documentation data sets extend beyond the farm level so that
    they can be traced throughout the supply chain, it is often referred as traceability
    and this notion is a key element in agri-food supply chain management as a measure
    to satisfy, for example, consumer demands (Bochtis and Sørensen, 2014, Pesonen
    et al., 2014). 4.3. Forecasting Forecasting is one of the fundamental functions
    for decision making that IoT brings to agriculture. Access to “real-time” data
    and historical data is used for forecasting events that require some form of action
    for managing successfully the crop or field operation. Therefore, both monitoring
    and documentation are important prerequisites for enabling forecasting. Forecasting
    is employed as preventive measures that require some action due to a predicted
    event, e.g. weeding, irrigating or harvesting. Machine learning and scientific
    modelling are examples of tools employed for forecasting. Different machine learning
    models have been employed, e.g. Artificial Neural Networks for forecasting maximum
    and minimum temperatures at field level (Aliev, 2018) or for estimating levels
    of phosphorus (P) in the soil (Estrada-López, Castillo-Atoche, Vázquez-castillo,
    & Sánchez-Sinencio, 2018); support vector regression method for forecasting soil
    moisture (Goap et al., 2018) or plant disease detection (Aasha Nandhini, Hemalatha,
    Radha, & Indumathi, 2017); gradient boosting for predicting irrigation recommendations
    (Goldstein, Fink, & Meitin, 2018); Bayesian networks and random forest for frost
    prediction (Diedrichs, Bromberg, Dujovne, Brun-laguna, & Watteyne, 2018); multiple
    linear regression and random forest in estimating yield and fertilisation requirements
    for forecasting harvest and fertilisation dates (Viljanen et al., 2018); or also
    for frost prediction using four different machine learning algorithms: decision
    tree, boosted tree, random forest, and regression (Moon, Kim, Zhang, & Woo, 2018).
    A rather different forecasting approach was employed by Jain, Sarangi, Bhatt,
    and Pappula (2018), where three different models, i.e. random forest, support
    vector machine and artificial neural network were used for forecasting diseases
    and at the same time for adaptive data collection from the network of nodes in
    order to reduce data traffic and energy consumption of the network. Summarising,
    IoT is allowing the sampling of large amounts of data, which can be employed as
    training data by the machine learning algorithms to build predictive mathematical
    models. Machine learning is opening new possibilities for effectively forecasting
    events in arable farming, which might change the very nature of decision making
    in agriculture. Scientific modelling has also been employed for forecasting in
    an IoT context, e.g. soil moisture dynamics and contaminant migration forecasting
    using soil sensor data and precipitation forecasts for irrigation scheduling (Severino
    et al., 2018); fungal disease forecast in winter wheat (El Jarroudi et al., 2017)
    and barley (Mäyrä, Ruusunen, Jalli, Jauhiainen, & Leiviskä, 2018); or forecasting
    field trafficability and workability for field operations (Edwards, White, Munkholm,
    Sørensen, & Lamandé, 2016). These modelling tools have an important role in agriculture
    as they are conscientiously developed and validated by the scientific community,
    and can forecast events for which machine learning models are very limited. There
    is also considerable potential for integrating existing and acknowledged modelling
    tools such as the soil-crop-atmosphere system model DAISY (Abrahamsen & Hansen,
    2000) or the soil erosion model RUSLE (Renard, Foster, Weesies, & Porter, 1991)
    into an IoT solution. Many of these solutions can make agriculture in general,
    and arable farming in particular, more resource efficient, e.g. through smart
    irrigation, as well as environmentally friendly, e.g. by smart pest and disease
    management. 4.4. Controlling In IoT, controlling is the result of active monitoring
    in an automated system, where the monitored variables are automatically adjusted
    to, for example, predefined thresholds. Forecasting can also play an important
    role in controlling. This is, for example, the case in smart irrigation systems,
    where irrigation is activated before drought damage in the crop is recognised,
    thus reducing yield losses. Goap et al. (2018) employed real-time sensing of soil
    moisture and soil temperature in combination with weather forecasts to control
    a fully autonomous irrigation scheme. Sensors on-the-go installed in tractors
    and implements can also be used to control e.g. variable rate fertilisation (Peets
    et al., 2012), site-specific weed control technologies (Christensen et al., 2009),
    or in-row cultivation controlled by plant patterns in precision seeding (Midtiby,
    Steen, & Green, 2018). Controlling is crucial in smart farming as it allows the
    automation of systems, especially considering the operations of autonomous vehicles
    and robots in the fields (Bechar & Vigneault, 2016), where site-specific actions
    and sensing-based safety systems will play an important role, e.g. for in-field
    obstacle detection for autonomous vehicles (Christiansen, Nielsen, Steen, Jørgensen,
    & Karstoft, 2016). 4.5. FMIS FMIS can be defined as systems that store and process
    farm-related collected data and provide decision supporting tools for farm management
    (Paraforos et al., 2016). FMIS assist farmers in the execution and documentation
    of farm activities, their evaluation and optimisation, as well as in strategic,
    tactical and operational planning of the farm operations (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    FMIS are consequently systems that can encapsulate all the applications previously
    described, and are vital elements in smart farm management. However, the adoption
    of FMIS targeted to the new IoT technologies is slow. A study published in 2015
    showed that most FMIS architectures used at that time had been designed in the
    1980s by researchers. This may explain why most FMIS currently have a structure
    and an architecture that is not suitable for distributed and service oriented
    decision support required for supporting precision agriculture and smart farming
    solutions, e.g. 75% of FMIS are still PC-based, and functionalities regarding
    traceability, quality assurance and agronomic best practice estimate are still
    missing or in their initial development stages in most commercial FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al., 2015). FMIS are key in smart farming and they should support
    automatic data acquisition, monitoring, documenting, planning and decision making
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). The latest research on IoT-based FMIS is expected
    to become part of the commercial FMIS available in the near future and will cover
    different needs across the supply chain and needs of IoT-based agriculture as
    a whole, as well as complying with standards ensuring interoperability between
    systems. In addition, decision support systems (DSS) are essential in dealing
    with Big Data and assisting the farm manager in management and decision making
    in tasks such as farm financial analysis, business processes or supply chain functions
    (Fountas, Carli et al., 2015, Kaloxylos et al., 2012). In order to design an up-to-date
    FMIS, it is beneficial to make preliminary use of dedicated system analysis methodologies,
    such as soft system methodologies (SSM), for identifying required changes and
    constraints and proposing solutions, followed by a later hard system modelling
    for designing the required specifications and components of the system (Sørensen
    et al., 2010, Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015). It is also necessary to base FMIS
    on the cloud as it allows interconnection with diverse additional services (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). This development points out the inevitable need for standardisation
    of APIs in order to achieve interoperability among applications and services as
    part of the FMIS. New technologies such as distributed management systems can
    also enhance the capabilities of FMIS to a great extent (Fountas, Sørensen et
    al., 2015). Furthermore, the introduction of agricultural moving robots in the
    near future, as well as the wireless and automatic control and monitoring of agricultural
    machinery, also needs to be considered in the design and development of FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al, 2015, Paraforos et al., 2016). The future FMIS will also be capable
    of emulating farmers different work habits, as the system will automate certain
    tasks previously performed by farmers, which will require additional training
    (Sørensen et al., 2011). Consequently, it is important to provide supportive adoption
    and transition strategies for conventional farming to convert into smart farming
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). Examples of current FMIS employed in arable farming
    are offered by different technology providers: machine manufacturers, institutions
    or targeted private companies. Some manufacturers provide their own farm management
    tools, such as Agricultural Management Solutions (AMS) from John Deere, or Precision
    Land Management (PLM) from New Holland. Across brands some FMIS have a more local
    approach, e.g. the Dutch Akkerweb developed by Wageningen University and Research,
    while other commercial solutions have a global approach, e.g. 365FarmNet, Agworld
    or FarmWorks. 4.6. Vehicle navigation, optimisation and logistics Navigation systems
    are widely used in arable farming with the successful implementation of auto-steering
    systems in tractors and harvesters. However, IoT-based solutions are still in
    their early stages. IoT-based field operation monitoring (Oksanen et al., 2016)
    or monitoring of motor and machine performance (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015) have been
    effectively implemented on harvesting operations. Commercial examples of agricultural
    telematics are Trimble''s Connected Farm, AGCO''s AgCommand, John Deer JDLink,
    New Holland''s PLM Connect or CLAAS’ telematics; however, they are all closed
    systems, which limits greatly the possibilities of the IoT technologies, especially
    interoperability (Oksanen, Piirainen, & Seilonen, 2015). Regarding optimised route
    planning, pre-planning harvest operations based on field data using simulation
    models can improve the harvest capacity of the vehicle or fleet saving working
    hours as well as fuel consumption (Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Bochtis and Sørensen,
    2009, Busato et al., 2007, Jensen et al., 2012, Zhou et al., 2014). However, field
    complexity and vehicle fleet size can become major hurdles for the algorithms
    employed (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019, Skou-Nielsen et al., 2017). The accessibility
    of field and harvest data can be eased by IoT technologies that allow automated
    data collection and sharing via common communication protocols and standards,
    in interoperable data formats, with compatible data model hierarchies; however,
    this is not always the case (Tzounis et al., 2017). IoT also allows cloud or fog
    computing to be employed to solve the high computational requirements of these
    route planning models (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019), even though the computing can
    also be achieved at the edge (Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Data communication
    costs, latency problems and unstable mobile connectivity may pose important challenges
    for route planning applications that rely only on cloud computing, making mobile
    edge computing more adequate and robust for these systems. Nevertheless, true
    IoT-based dynamic route planning is still in its infancy but gaining increasing
    attention, especially with the arrival of agricultural robots (Bechar and Vigneault,
    2016, Kayacan et al., 2015). Concerning its application, until recently, harvest
    logistics has employed field sampled data, i.e. boundaries, obstacles, gates,
    etc., to optimise the route of the vehicles involved in the operation statically
    (e.g. Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Jensen et al., 2012), where the complete routes
    of all vehicles are planned a priori. Nevertheless, these plans often do not comply
    with real-world challenges as they do not adapt to variating inputs, e.g. vehicle
    speed changes or in-field yield variations, or to unforeseen situations, e.g.
    machine breakdowns, eventual out of field delays, non-trafficable wet spots, undefined
    obstacles, etc. There is consequently the need to integrate route optimisation
    and operation logistics in IoT systems, where the optimisation can adapt dynamically
    to varying input and unforeseen events. It is only in the last few years that
    harvest logistics really started adapting dynamically to parameters such as vehicles''
    behaviour or in-field yield variations (Edwards et al., 2017, Seyyedhasani and
    Dvorak, 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Today, new possibilities for optimising
    infield operations arrive with the large amount of data available via internet,
    e.g. remote sensing data or other collected spatial data. These could be adaptive
    planning based on trafficability maps for reducing soil compaction or avoiding
    vehicles getting stuck in wet spots; or selective harvesting based on predicted
    grain quality maps, which is expected to increase the value of the crop harvested.
    5. Challenges and solutions When implementing IoT in arable farming, as well as
    in other contexts, diverse challenges limit or affect the performance of the systems
    employed. The challenges identified in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5) can indicate
    which areas need to be taken into account when designing an IoT-based system or
    point out areas that require further research. However, the results presented
    in the figure are indicative and do not necessarily describe the importance of
    the challenges included, especially because of the multiple applications and implementation
    designs that are conceivable in arable farming. Any of the challenges can become
    crucial in different setups, and are therefore described. In addition, all challenges
    can be related to or have consequences for other challenges. Download : Download

    of challenges mentioned by the literature reviewed, divided by time periods and
    grouped in IoT layers. Interoperability, in general, is a major hurdle in the
    application of IoT. There are different dimensions related to it: technical, syntactical,
    semantic and organisational (Serrano et al., 2015, Veer and Wiles, 2008). Technical
    interoperability refers mostly to the communication protocols which affect the
    hardware and software components implemented. Syntactical interoperability is
    usually related to data formats, their syntax and encoding. Semantic interoperability
    concerns the interpretation of data contents, i.e. the meaning of the information
    exchanged. And organisational interoperability involves intercommunication of
    meaningful information across organisations regardless of information systems
    and infrastructures in a world-wide scale. As interoperability is such a generic
    term, in this section, technical interoperability has been addressed as part of
    the communication protocol challenge, syntactical and semantic interoperability
    have been included under the data heterogeneity challenge, and organisational
    interoperability have been described under the scalability challenge. 5.1. General
    challenges 5.1.1. Revenue and affordability Often the investment for establishing
    an IoT-based solution is high and as such challenging for small-scale farmers,
    while larger farms can more easily acquire IoT-based technologies when investing
    in new equipment (Brewster et al., 2017). The uncertainty regarding required costs,
    e.g. fuel or water allocations, and selling prices of the product give little
    margin for many farmers for investing in new technologies (Higgins et al., 2017).
    Trust plays an important role when investing in IoT systems, and relieving the
    perceived risks by demonstrating the revenues from their adoption is essential
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Jayashankar et al., 2018). For example, in Europe
    70% of all fertilising and spraying machinery is equipped with at least one precision
    agriculture technology, but only 25% of farmers actually use precision agriculture
    components on their farms (Say, Keskin, Sehri, & Sekerli, 2017). Technology providers
    need to increase the perceived value by demonstrating the financial return from
    IoT in order to diminish the perceived risk of adoption many farmers have. Technology
    providers need also to provide robust tools that are aligned with farmer needs
    and practices in order to gain acceptance and trust of IoT technologies. These
    technologies need to reduce the workload, assist in decision making and improve
    the efficiency of the targeted practice. Additionally, technology providers need
    to develop interoperable and flexible solutions that can easily be integrated
    and comply with accepted standards. Governments can also incentivise IoT adoption
    by policies and regulations, especially regarding documentation and traceability
    as ICT eases paperwork and bureaucracy. A reduction in the percentage of mentions
    regarding this challenge (see Fig. 5) could indicate that IoT is being more adopted
    in arable farming. In addition, IoT is likely to reshape the arable farming business.
    The implementation of monitoring and control of farming operations are generating
    substantial amounts of valuable data that are essential for the business of technology
    providers. The way farmers will dive into the data economy, i.e. connecting their
    data to work in vertical and horizontal networks beyond the farm, will have an
    effect on their business models, as well as on the business models of technology
    providers. The point of view of the farmer''s business regarding IoT has not been
    fully addressed in the literature reviewed and will require further investigation.
    5.1.2. Data heterogeneity The diverse data sources and sensor manufacturers imply
    use of different unit systems, data structures and nomenclatures in different
    data formats, which result in reduced syntactical and semantic interoperability
    among IoT environments. Sensor data can be encoded in binary, or represented in
    formats such as json, xml, text (e.g. csv), shapefile, or even proprietary formats.
    The heterogeneity of data types and formats can also affect the performance of
    a protocol employed for communicating the information. Furthermore, this challenge
    becomes critical in situations such as system integration or sharing data with
    other systems (e.g. FMIS), which could imply developing data conversion tools
    or even redesign of the IoT setup. The use of standardised formats can help with
    this challenge. Some attempts have been made at producing standards or standardised
    formats that cover the great heterogeneity of agricultural data, e.g. ISO 11783
    (ISOBUS) developed by the Agricultural Industry Electronics Foundation (AEF) for
    tractors and agricultural machinery, which is very relevant in arable farming
    (Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015, Miettinen et al., 2006, Oksanen et al., 2015,
    Peets et al., 2012) or AgroXML developed by the Association for Technologies and
    Structures in Agriculture (KTBL) mainly for FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014, Köksal
    and Tekinerdogan, 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Peets et al., 2012). These
    are now being integrated by the non-profit organisation AgGateway through the
    ADAPT framework and SPADE project for seamlessly communicating agricultural machinery
    data to FMIS, trying to enhance the existing standards and as a consequence improve
    interoperability (Brewster et al., 2017). A drawback of comprehensive data models,
    which try to describe all attributes of agricultural data, is that they become
    too cumbersome to handle in many applications. Finally, the use of middleware
    platforms applicable in smart farming, e.g. FIWARE or SmartFarmNet, can also reduce
    the problems caused by data heterogeneity (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Ferreira
    et al., 2017, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). 5.1.3. Scalability
    and flexibility Organisational interoperability is a key element concerning scalability
    and flexibility (Serrano et al., 2015, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). Many
    of the systems described in the literature reviewed are centralised, closed, difficult
    to integrate in other existing platforms or difficult to implement on larger scales,
    different farming systems or geographical areas. They are also challenging to
    integrate beyond the farm level and across the supply chain in order to provide
    agri-food safety and traceability. The use of standardised dynamic protocols,
    such as SOAP protocol (cloud-based infrastructures with extensible ontologies
    that cover the broad and diverse agricultural production systems and environments),
    fast and reliable APIs (e.g. RESTful) and middleware platforms applicable for
    smart agriculture, such as FIWARE with its generic enablers, are tools that are
    employed to achieve organisational interoperability and make the system developed
    more scalable and flexible (Ferreira et al., 2017, López-Riquelme et al., 2017,
    O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). Service-Oriented Architectures
    (SOA) also bring possibilities to effectively integrate ecosystems through open
    and standardised interfaces, increasing organisational interoperability (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014, Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Kruize et al., 2016, Pesonen et al.,
    2014, Sørensen and Bochtis, 2010). Scalability and flexibility may also refer
    to WSNs in the literature, to their capacity to support an increasing number of
    devices/nodes, with the network architecture, the gateway and protocols used being
    the main constrains (Elijah et al., 2018). This challenge has been considered
    under the network size challenge. 5.1.4. Robustness and fault tolerance Many different
    factors can affect the overall robustness and fault tolerance of a system. Robust
    wireless connectivity is an important limitation in many setups (Oksanen et al.,
    2016, Vuran et al., 2018). In the design of an IoT-based solution dealing with
    faults, errors and unforeseen events need to be taken into account in order to
    ensure the reliability of the system. Many of these issues are related to the
    other challenges presented here and can be handled at the device level, but also
    need to be thought of in the overall IoT system design (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    Ray, 2017). 5.1.5. Complexity The agricultural system is complex and can be challenging
    to work with. It is complex not only because of the multifaceted nature of the
    physical, chemical and/or biological processes in the soil-crop-air system, but
    also because of the technical complexity of hardware and software interacting
    with it. Depending on the novelty of the IoT technology implemented and the background
    of the developer and user, the systems can become more or less complex. For example,
    software and hardware incompatibilities can challenge its implementation and integration
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016), as well as many other challenges, e.g. the great
    field task diversity in arable farming, that can add complexity to the system.
    Technical knowledge can become a major hurdle for the implementation of IoT in
    farms, and it is therefore important that user-friendliness and plug-and-play
    basis have a high priority for the technology providers (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Zou and Quan, 2017). Complexity should be an issue for the technology provider
    and not for the customer. In addition, the co-created development and implementation
    of IoT systems in agriculture by a multi-actor approach is needed to overcome
    the complexity at different levels of integrating IoT in agriculture. Good examples
    of this are the European Union supported research and development efforts through
    multi-actor large-scale pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Verdouw et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019). 5.1.6. Lack of products In the early stages of precision
    agriculture and IoT in agriculture, products that integrated agronomy and ICT
    engineering were lacking, which hindered their adoption (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Kitchen and Roger, 2007). The large scales and diversity of environments
    in arable farming can challenge the products used even more than in controlled
    environments, as they are to be modelled to describe larger areas, send information
    through larger distances and be exposed to harsher environments. Even if Figure
    5 shows lack of references in the last couple of years, it is still relevant for
    some applications, e.g. for in-situ real-time soil nutrient sensing is still a
    real challenge, especially regarding calibration (Bünemann et al., 2018, Marín-González
    et al., 2013). 5.2. Device layer challenges 5.2.1. Power consumption The use of
    wireless devices has major advantages over wired systems, as they are more economical
    to establish and can cover much wider areas. However, their power consumption,
    with limited battery life, is a major drawback of many wireless systems, and needs
    to be accounted for. This issue is so important that it is the main identified
    challenge in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5), especially for WSNs (Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tan and Panda, 2010). The large distances to cover in arable farming make
    wireless devices indispensable, and solutions to reduce their power consumption
    and/or extend their battery life are required. These solutions can include energy
    harvesting, low power consumption sensors and communication technologies or power
    efficient management. Energy harvesting techniques can include solar cells, micro
    wind turbines or other interesting solutions which have been well described by
    Tuna and Gungor (2016) and Jawad et al. (2017). The power consumption of the communication
    technologies and sensors employed are also to be considered in the design of the
    IoT solution as there are big differences between devices (Balmos et al., 2016,
    Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). Choosing low power sensors
    and communication devices needs to be taken into account when designing the IoT
    system (Estrada-López et al., 2018). Low power wireless technologies, such as
    BLE, have low power consumption but also low communication range, while Wi-Fi
    has somewhat higher communication range, but much higher power consumption (Table
    1), however data rates and other parameters are important factors to consider
    too. ZigBee and LoRa have been identified as appropriate candidates for many farming
    applications (Jawad et al., 2017). Power efficient management techniques of WSNs
    include sleep/active schemes, e.g. duty-cycling algorithms (Ahmed, Abdalla et
    al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Alahmadi et al., 2017, Balmos et al., 2016,
    Dhall and Agrawal, 2018, Temprilho et al., 2018); data mitigation schemes, e.g.
    data aggregation (Abdel-basset, Shawky, & Eldrandaly, 2018) or data compression
    (Moon et al., 2018); energy-efficient routing schemes, e.g. mobile sinks by the
    use of UAVs (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018,
    Uddin et al., 2018); and other combined solutions, e.g. LEACH, a cluster architecture
    with Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based MAC protocol and data aggregation
    scheme (Kamarudin, Ahmad, & Ndzi, 2016), or dynamic power management by combining
    sleep/active states with dynamic data rates schemes (Estrada-López et al., 2018).
    Jawad et al. (2017) have provided a good overview and description of WSN power
    efficient management techniques. Lastly, techniques such as edge computing may
    have higher power requirements on the device, making cloud computing more desirable
    if power consumption is a constraint in the projected IoT solution. On the other
    hand, mounting sensors and devices on agricultural vehicles and implements allows
    connection to the power supply of the vehicle and as a consequence eliminate power
    consumption as a limiting factor. The type of sensors that are mounted on vehicles
    and their implements is quite limited, being currently mainly camera-based (e.g.
    Midtiby et al., 2018, Steen et al., 2012). Nevertheless, there is for example
    potential in employing sensors on the coulters of seed-drills for mapping soil
    properties (Nielsen et al., 2017), or other on-the-go sensors for mapping soil
    or crop variations (Peets et al., 2012). 5.2.2. Harsh device environment The natural
    environment in which sensors and other devices are placed can greatly challenge
    their functionality and longevity. Harsh weather conditions, e.g. large temperature
    variations, intense rainfall or prolonged high humidity can cause water condensation
    inside devices and consequently provoke corrosion and short circuits (Bauer &
    Aschenbruck, 2018). Sensors and other devices situated close to the ground experience
    exposure to dust, mud, or even corrosive chemicals, e.g. agro-chemicals, which
    can seriously damage the performance of the device or cause its total failure
    (Aliev, 2018, Bauer and Aschenbruck, 2018). Underground chemical sensors are also
    exposed to soil chemical and biological processes that deteriorate the sensors
    and can mislead the measurements, requiring unfeasible maintenance and re-calibrations
    (Burton et al., 2018, Kassal et al., 2018). Choosing adequate casing that does
    not interfere with the functionality of the device and also tolerates the environment
    they are located in is essential in the design of the IoT system. Sensors are
    also developed for different conditions, and need to match the system''s minimum
    requirements. RFID tags have been reported to perform flawlessly under extreme
    conditions and environments (Costa et al., 2013, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011);
    however, RFID technology is quite limited in its applications in arable farming,
    and suitable sensors and communication devices are therefore primarily dependent
    on the application and design of the IoT system. 5.3. Network layer challenges
    5.3.1. Latency, throughput and rate The large amounts of data generated in IoT
    applications do not only cause problems regarding data storage or handling, but
    also latency problems that reduce the throughput of the network employed. In arable
    farming, latency problems can be of great importance in some IoT solutions, e.g.
    in WSNs where high latency implies higher power consumption of a node (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017), or in dynamic optimised route planning in vehicle logistics, which
    requires rapid responses to deviations in the route plan (Villa-Henriksen et al.,
    2018). For reducing latency problems, fog and edge computing can be employed,
    as these computing techniques decrease latency and network congestion (Elijah
    et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018), e.g. data compression at the edge
    reduces the large volumes of data communicated through the network (Moon et al.,
    2018). In addition, the use of lightweight protocols can also reduce latency problems,
    e.g. LP4S for sensors (Hernández-rojas, Fernández-Caramés, Fraga-Lamas, & Escudero,
    2018), or MQTT messaging protocol, which has a faster throughput than HTTP and
    works well for bandwidth limited networks (Estrada-López et al., 2018). The communication
    rate is important to have in mind when planning the wireless communication technology
    to implement, e.g. 5G can handle high-rates, while SigFox or IEEE 802.15.4-based
    protocols are for low-rates (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton,
    Gotta et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). The throughput of the network affects
    the communication rate, and the communication rate also influences the power consumption,
    which equally has to be carefully considered. Fast response to events is achieved
    by data processing techniques such as data merging (Tanaka, 2018), data compression
    (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018), or dynamic and complex event
    processing rules for conditioning input data and immediately acting accordingly
    (Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018). These processes can be on the cloud or at the edge,
    i.e. devices. Finally, test-bed analysis prior to implementation of the network
    can simulate communication rates and possible latency and throughput issues (Stewart,
    Stewart, & Kennedy, 2017). 5.3.2. Wireless link quality A low wireless link quality
    affects greatly the QoS of an IoT system as it ends in unreliable communication
    between nodes (Klaina, Alejos, Aghzout, & Falcone, 2018). This can be caused by
    multipath propagation (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), background noise (Mazon-Olivo
    et al., 2018), routing problems, e.g. packet collision or limited band width (Jawad
    et al., 2017), or even by harsh environmental conditions, which affect the transceivers
    and the quality of the data transmitted (Elijah et al., 2018). Adequate design
    and testing of the network are crucial for avoiding or reducing this challenge.
    However, techniques such as channel access methods, e.g. TDMA, can improve the
    link quality by reducing packet collisions (Temprilho et al., 2018). Regarding
    testing, the calculation of signal strengths in real-time on the base station
    helps estimating the wireless link quality of a WSN when establishing the system
    (Klaina et al., 2018). Packet loss characterisation can also be used to assess
    the wireless link quality of a connection (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018,
    Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018). Additionally, blind entity identification
    can also help estimating the wireless link quality of a network (Mukherjee, Misra,
    Raghuwanshi, & Mitra, 2018). 5.3.3. Communication range The different wireless
    communication technologies have very diverse ranges, which need to be accounted
    for when designing the IoT solution, together with other factors such as data
    rate, power consumption, communication protocols or costs (Table 1). In arable
    farming, due to the larger farm sizes and because of the employment of mobile
    sensors and devices on vehicles, this challenge becomes even more critical. Furthermore,
    relying on the approximate communication range of a wireless technology can be
    misleading, e.g. WiFi is often described to have 100 m range, but a test analysing
    the packet delivery ratio with respect to distance to gateway shows packet losses
    at ≥ 60 m (Giordano, Seitanidis, Ojo, Adami, & Vignoli, 2018), while in another
    test using WiField devices, 2.6 km range was claimed to be reached still having
    reliable internet connection (Brinkhoff et al., 2017). Testing the communication
    range is therefore important for some settings. In addition to the choice of wireless
    technology, network topology in WSNs, such as mesh topologies can also increase
    the communication range by using nodes to communicate with the central node (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018). Reduced range due to obstacles
    or topography is addressed in the propagation losses challenge later. 5.3.4. Communication
    protocols Differences in communication protocols can cause technical interoperability
    issues, which can lead to connectivity and compatibility issues among the hardware
    and software employed (Stočes et al., 2016). Network protocols are separated into
    diverse layers forming a protocol stack, where tasks are divided into smaller
    steps (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). In the infrastructure
    layer, some wireless standards that define communication protocols are commonly
    used by different wireless technologies, e.g. IEEE 802.15.4, which is used by
    ZigBee or 6LowPAN among others, or 3GPP, which is used by GPRS, LTE or 5G among
    others (see Table 1). In the application layer, standards such as HTTP (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Kaloxylos et al., 2014), MQTT (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016, Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018) or XMPP (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018)
    are commonly used in IoT applications in arable farming. Adequate protocols are
    especially relevant and challenging in vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and crucial
    in arable farming. Different standards in different layers require careful planning
    of the whole IoT solution, as they are not always compatible and can also have
    an effect on the data formats used, or sensors and gateways employed (Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018). Middleware platforms can ease the integration of diverse protocols
    and standards by offering enough abstraction levels so that this diversity is
    effectively managed (O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Tuna et al., 2017). Edge computing
    can also ease technical interoperability issues as a local computing layer is
    created to process data and create control rules before sending the data to the
    cloud (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). 5.3.5. Network management Managing a WSN
    can imply battery change, software updates, calibration of sensors, replacement
    of devices and similar maintenance activities that can be very time-consuming.
    Smart mobile devices, e.g. smart phones, can make remote software updating possible,
    and can sometimes even be used for updating some other IoT devices (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016). Using energy efficient devices and communication techniques can
    also be employed to extend the battery life of devices (Jawad et al., 2017). Some
    sensors may require recalibrations with a certain periodicity, which has to be
    accounted for in the projected IoT solution (Kassal et al., 2018). Nonetheless,
    the management of the network is always to be considered when implementing IoT
    solutions in arable farming, where distances and number of devices/nodes can be
    vast. 5.3.6. Network size WSN configuration schemes have a maximum number of sensor
    nodes per gateway that the network can handle, i.e. the network size. According
    to the analysis of the reviewed literature, network size is being identified more
    often in the last two years (see Fig. 5), which seems to indicate new possibilities
    for exploiting the capabilities of WSNs. Network size depends on the wireless
    communication technology employed and can affect other parameters, such as data
    latency or scalability of the network (Balmos et al., 2016). Network topologies
    can also influence the network size and vary from simple star network (e.g. Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018) to more advanced multi-hop mesh networks (Ahmed, Abdalla et al.,
    2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Langendoen et al., 2006) that can increase the network
    size by using network nodes as relays to reach a central node and gateway. Optimisation
    algorithms have been used to find the best spatial distribution of WSN nodes,
    and therefore to assist in the optimisation of its network size (Abdel-basset
    et al., 2018). 5.3.7. Propagation losses Even though propagation losses can become
    a big problem for WSNs in application areas like fruit orchards and tree plantations,
    in arable farming hedges, trees, big rocks or sheds, as well as pronounced topography,
    like hills and valleys, can also block, diffract or scatter the signal reducing
    the communication range and causing data packet losses. Additionally, weather
    conditions can also degrade the wireless connectivity propagation of signals (Jawad
    et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Stewart et al., 2017). To avoid or reduce
    these problems, adequate planning of the location of the sensor nodes, the antenna
    height, the communication protocols and the network topology is necessary. Regarding
    network topologies, mesh networks compared to star networks can reduce propagation
    losses as well as increase communication range (Kamarudin et al., 2016, Ruiz-Garcia
    and Lunadei, 2011). Moreover, propagation modelling can help planning, reduce
    communication tests and ensure Quality of Service (QoS) for heterogeneous wireless
    networks (Jawad et al., 2017, Stewart et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Klaina
    et al., 2018, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011). 5.4. Application layer challenges
    5.4.1. Data analysis Data analysis can in some cases become an important challenge,
    especially when dealing with Big Data, which is data in such amounts, heterogeneity
    and complexity that they need new data management techniques for analysis (Wolfert
    et al., 2017). Agricultural Big Data are worthless unless analysed; however, analysis
    can be very challenging because of the volume, diversity, and quality (e.g. errors
    and duplications). This is especially challenging in arable farming, where larger
    amounts of heterogeneous data are generated at diverse rates and from very different
    sources. The literature reviewed show an increased identification of this challenge
    in the last two years compared with the previous 6 years (see Fig. 5). This evolution
    might be caused by increased access and use of agricultural Big Data in recent
    times (Kamilaris et al., 2017, Pham and Stack, 2018). Techniques for lowering
    data dimensionality can ease the analysis by applying feature reduction models,
    which reduce data size by eliminating unnecessary data dimensions (Sabarina &
    Priya, 2015). Cloud computing provides the flexibility and scalability necessary
    for Big Data analysis, where numerous users operate simultaneously with the large
    and complex datasets (Gill et al., 2017). Likewise, cloud platforms are perfect
    for storing such large amounts of data, where NoSQL databases can store and manage
    these large unstructured datasets (Kamilaris et al., 2017). The analysis of Big
    Data can potentially be used, for example, for policy-making, reducing environmental
    negative impact, improve food-safety, as well as improved farm management and
    production, benefiting the different stakeholders involved (Kamilaris et al.,
    2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). Another facet to data analysis is the growing use
    of machine learning techniques, which are being used for exploring Big Data and
    identifying important factors and their interrelationship that affect agricultural
    production systems like, for example, identifying diverse patterns (e.g. crop
    development stages, weeds or diseases) as part of machine vision systems (Bacco,
    Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018, Reshma and Pillai,
    2018). In these cases, the model is built upon a sample of data, often called
    training data, whose size and quality directly affects the final model. Choosing
    the adequate approach for building the model with the available data is also essential
    for the success of the IoT solution. 5.4.2. Data security and privacy Even though
    data security and privacy do not constitute a high challenge in the literature
    reviewed, they are certainly major concerns for the farmers, i.e. the suppliers
    of data and also end-users of the technology developed, who have little trust
    in service providers'' use of data (Jayashankar et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2017).
    Also, data ownership needs to be taken into consideration as raw data and processed
    data in IoT systems have different ownership and are accessible by different actors,
    affecting the necessary requirements for data security and privacy (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). Research and development focus has been on sensing, processing,
    controlling and computing, while less effort has been devoted to solving security
    threats, risks and privacy (Tuna et al., 2017). Other issues like cost effectiveness
    in, for example, cloud services are also affecting the security of the data, which
    eventually affects the whole privacy and security of the IoT solution, as low-cost
    services have lower security (Dhinari, Newe, Lewis, & Nizamani, 2017). Technology
    providers should prioritise data security and privacy in their business models.
    The availability of privacy and security technologies that are dynamic enough
    to support the vast numbers and variety of stakeholders, as well as the complexity
    of the network, is still a major challenge that needs to be overcome (Verdouw,
    2016). Many solutions are being employed to reduce data security and privacy issues
    in each of the IoT layers of the system, e.g. encryption algorithms, intrusion
    detection mechanisms, authentication, secure routing protocols, anonymisation,
    etc. (Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Middleware platforms are employed
    to add a security layer between network and applications, which can include confidentiality,
    anonymity and security to the system (Rodriguez et al., 2018, Serrano et al.,
    2015, Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Additionally, newer technologies
    such as blockchain are aiming to solve many of the challenges related to privacy
    and security as well as transparency of the IoT. In agriculture, it is mainly
    being applied in the food supply chain (Bermeo-Almeida et al., 2018). Blockchain
    make sense for IoT platforms where large amounts of confidential data are handled.
    5.4.3. Data quality and availability Some of the challenges previously described
    have a direct influence on data quality, e.g. propagation losses, wireless link
    quality, robustness and fault tolerance. Anomaly detection and similar methods
    have been employed to identify faulty data before analysis (Cadavid et al., 2018,
    Lyle et al., 2014). The poor quality of data or its limited availability can limit
    many applications that involve Big Data analytics, modelling and machine learning,
    which can affect or even compromise the success of some IoT solutions (Balducci
    et al., 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). In these setups,
    and specifically in arable farming, many datasets are integrated from different
    sources and sensors, and the quality or scarcity of some data can become a major
    hurdle to overcome. Ensuring quality and availability of the data before starting
    such a project is required. Even if it is not always possible to gather all the
    data necessary to develop models, perform correct analytics or train machine learning
    algorithms, scientific assumptions (Severino et al., 2018), data augmentation
    (Diedrichs et al., 2018) or simulated data (Wolanin et al., 2019) are used to
    help or solve the encountered challenge. 5.4.4. Context-awareness (metadata) Context-awareness
    is an important and distinctive feature of Smart Farming as compared to Precision
    Farming, because it automatically includes descriptive data from e.g. fields,
    sensors, machines, i.e. metadata. Metadata can include information about the date
    and time, node identification number, data of calibration, height and position
    information, or even descriptive data about an experiment objective, field, machinery,
    crop genotype or soil information at the sensor placement (Jayaraman et al., 2015).
    Metadata about sensor nodes in the system are crucial for providing contextual
    information so that correct data analysis can be performed (Jayaraman et al.,
    2016, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness helps computing techniques to decide what
    data is to be analysed, and consequently easing the computations, and the lack
    of this data complicate data analysis substantially. This is especially relevant
    in arable farming, where the system has to handle both spatial and temporal data
    and make decisions based on the data collected. The use of standards, formats
    and middleware that support metadata is therefore important to have in mind during
    the planning of an IoT solution (Peets et al., 2009, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness
    facilitates new business models and strategies for data analytics and DSS software
    providers. 6. Conclusions and future perspectives A literature review of current
    and foreseeable IoT technologies and systems in arable farming was carried out.
    This has included an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies, an
    outline of the current and potential applications, and a thorough description
    of the challenges and solutions. From this survey, the role smart mobile phones
    play is highlighted, especially Android devices, which are employed in different
    ways for a wide diversity of applications, due to their availability, connectivity,
    interoperability, programmable ease and computational power. The introduction
    of 5G networks in the near future will enhance the capabilities of smart mobile
    devices due to their enhanced performance. The intelligent management of WSN as
    well as the capabilities of improved communication technologies can also solve
    some of the challenges IoT-based solutions are experiencing. The role of middleware
    platforms and generic enablers are expected to gain acceptance and importance,
    as they can solve system integration issues and interoperability challenges. In
    general, regarding challenges, interoperability is a main challenge throughout
    the whole IoT architecture, where development and/or acceptance of standards and
    protocols is required to ease the issues encountered by many IoT implementations.
    Furthermore, challenges such as revenue and affordability of IoT systems, the
    power consumption of wireless devices, latency and throughput problems during
    data transfer, as well as the complexity of data analysis, and data privacy and
    security have been identified in the reviewed literature as of high importance,
    and academic research should direct their resources toward solving or reducing
    these issues. Technology developers need to ensure that the solutions create a
    real benefit for farmers and are available and applicable for both large and small
    producers. How IoT generated farm data will affect the business models of farmers
    requires further investigation as it is not fully addressed in the literature
    reviewed. The combination of intelligent power efficient systems with power harvesting
    technologies should guarantee longer battery-life of wireless devices. Computing
    data at the edge, i.e. on the devices, as well as lightweight protocols can reduce
    network latency and capacity/throughput problems. The emergence of Big Data is
    posing significant challenges for data analysis, as the complexity and heterogeneity
    of the huge data sets require the application of new analysis techniques beyond
    those traditionally used. Techniques such as lowering data dimensionality, cloud
    platforms and cloud computing, including machine learning algorithms, can help
    in this area and new innovative solutions are expected to be developed. Finally,
    technology producers have to guarantee privacy and security of the data handled
    throughout all the layers by employing different secure methods without compromising
    the user-friendliness of the solutions employed. Middleware platforms can help
    improving the privacy and security of IoT solutions, and techniques such as blockchain
    can assist with privacy and security problems of IoT platforms when dealing with
    Big Data. In the near future, interoperable and service-oriented FMIS that are
    integrated in the supply chain with intelligent analytic tools will take over
    some of the management and decision-making tasks of farmers and advisors, which
    will require training for farmers to adapt to this type of FMIS. Key decision
    support functions include farm financial analysis, business processes, or supply
    chain functions, which will gain importance with Big Data analytics. In addition,
    DSS for vehicle logistics will grow in importance as a way to optimise field operations
    using route planning and sensor-based site-specific applications. Finally, the
    introduction of autonomous vehicles and robotics in arable farming in the near
    future is expected to completely change arable farming operations and production
    praxes requiring fully adopted IoT capabilities. Acknowledgements This work was

    \ has opened productive ways to cultivate soil with the use\nof low-cost hardware\
    \ (sensors/actuators) and communication (Internet) technologies. Remote\nequipment\
    \ and crop monitoring, predictive analytic, weather forecasting for crops or smart\
    \ logistics\nand warehousing are some examples of these new opportunities.\nNevertheless,\
    \ farmers are\nagriculture experts but, usually, do not have experience in IoT\
    \ applications. Users who use IoT\napplications must participate in its design,\
    \ improving the integration and use. In this work, different\nindustrial agricultural\
    \ facilities are analysed with farmers and growers to design new functionalities\n\
    based on IoT paradigms deployment. User-centred design model is used to obtain\
    \ knowledge and\nexperience in the process of introducing technology in agricultural\
    \ applications. Internet of things\nparadigms are used as resources to facilitate\
    \ the decision making. IoT architecture, operating rules\nand smart processes\
    \ are implemented using a distributed model based on edge and fog computing\n\
    paradigms. A communication architecture is proposed using these technologies.\
    \ The aim is to help\nfarmers to develop smart systems both, in current and new\
    \ facilities. Different decision trees to\nautomate the installation, designed\
    \ by the farmer, can be easily deployed using the method proposed\nin this document.\n\

    1. Introduction\nPrecision Agriculture (PA) is a whole-farm management approach\
    \ using information technology,\nremote sensing and proximal data gathering. These\
    \ technologies have the goal of optimising returns\non inputs while potentially\
    \ reducing environmental impacts. Farmers and agronomists have already\nbegun\
    \ employing technologies in order to improve the efﬁciency of their work. Sensors\
    \ placed\nin greenhouses allow farmers to obtain detailed data on real-time as\
    \ variables such as soil and\nambient temperature, irrigation water and soil conductivity,\
    \ soil and irrigation water PH, nutrient\ncomposition data, irrigation water properties,\
    \ etc. These data can be transmitted and analysed using\ncommunication technologies\
    \ and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) paradigms could be applied. Farmers use\ntheir\
    \ smartphones to remotely monitor their crops and equipments and to run some statistical\
    \ data.\nAll of these techniques help make up PA. Nowadays, the farmers are using\
    \ resources developed by\ninformation and communication technologies. These ﬁrst\
    \ resources are easy to use but they are general\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731; doi:10.3390/s18061731\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n2 of 21\npurpose and, therefore,\
    \ not adapted to the speciﬁc needs of each farmer. In this work an user-centred\n\
    method is proposed to design intelligent and adapted services where each farmer\
    \ decides its own\ninstallation using edge and fog paradigms (distributed computing)\
    \ on Internet of Things technologies\n(Figure 1). This method is designed on different\
    \ use cases and tested in an automated greenhouse as\nan example of utility. The\
    \ work is an expanded version presented in [1]. This paper is organized as\nfollows:\
    \ Section 2 reviews precision agriculture scenarios, how to use centred design\
    \ methodologies,\nIoT technologies and their deployment, the capabilities and\
    \ potential of edge and fog computing\nparadigms in these scenarios. Different\
    \ greenhouses are analysed and farmers are consulted. Section 3\nproposes a method\
    \ to deploy distributed IoT architecture using edge and fog nodes that offer a\
    \ set\nof new resources that can be used in any type of installation which facilitates\
    \ the involvement of\nthe farmer. In Section 4, experiments including services\
    \ on edge and fog nodes, connected by IoT\ncommunication protocols, are performed.\
    \ Finally, Section 5 provides conclusions and future works.\nFigure 1. Agricultural\
    \ System.\n2. Related Works\nAlthough more complex deﬁnitions exist, the simple\
    \ description of the PA is a way to “apply the\nright treatment in the right place\
    \ at the right time” [2].\nPrecision agriculture comprises a set\nof technologies\
    \ that combine sensors, information systems, enhanced machinery and informed\n\
    management to optimize production by accounting for variability and uncertainties\
    \ within agricultural\nsystems. It is a farming management concept based upon\
    \ observing, measuring and responding to\ninter and intra-ﬁeld variability in\
    \ crops [3]. Methods and technologies to decide how, where and when\nto use sensors\
    \ and machinery should involve all the main actors: that is, farmers and information\n\
    and communication technicians. User-centred methods and IoT communication technologies\
    \ applied\non precision agriculture are revised in this section. Finally, different\
    \ greenhouses are analysed and\nfarmers are consulted.\n2.1. User-Centred Design\
    \ Models\nIn PA context, User-Centred Design (UCD) describe a design process where\
    \ farmers inﬂuence the\nprocess of how the design takes shape. There are several\
    \ ways in which the user (agricultural specialist)\ncan be involved in the process.\
    \ This term describes a set of methods to create models on which\ndesign adapted\
    \ solutions. The user-centred design process works against subjective assumptions\n\
    about user behaviour. It requires proof that the design decisions are effective.\
    \ If user-centred design is\nproperly done, applications becomes an outcome of\
    \ actively engaging users. Therefore, any design\ndecisions that were made by\
    \ observing and listening to them will not be based on personal preferences.\n\
    User experience (UX) is one of the many focuses of UCD. It includes the user’s\
    \ entire experience with\nthe product, including physical and emotional reactions.\
    \ UCD is objective and often relies on data\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n3 of 21\n\
    to support design decisions [4]. According to [5], user centred design is a development\
    \ method that\nguarantees that product, software or web site will be easy to use.\
    \ The International Usability Standard\n(ISO 13407) [6], speciﬁes the principles\
    \ that underlie user centred design:\n•\nRequirements gathering, understanding\
    \ and specifying the context of use\n•\nRequirements speciﬁcation, specifying\
    \ the user and organisational requirements\n•\nDesign, producing designs and prototypes\n\
    •\nEvaluation, carrying out user-based assessment of the site\nThe design is based\
    \ upon an explicit understanding of users, tasks and environments. Users are\n\
    involved throughout design and development. The process is iterative. The design\
    \ is driven and\nreﬁned by user-centred evaluation. The design addresses the whole\
    \ user experience. The design team\nincludes multidisciplinary skills and perspectives.\n\
    2.2. Internet of Things: Architectures and Protocols\nIot is developed using architectures\
    \ based on layers capable of connecting a huge number of\ndevices with each other\
    \ and with the established services. The basic model of IoT has a 3 layer\narchitecture\
    \ which are of Perception, Network and Application Layers. IoT faces several challenges,\n\
    especially in the ﬁeld of privacy and security, so to overcome these issues new\
    \ standard architectures\nneed to be more focused on many essential factors like\
    \ Quality of Services (QoS), data integrity,\nsustainability, conﬁdentiality,\
    \ etc. The IAB (Internet Architecture Board) has published the RFC\n7452 document:\
    \ Architectural Considerations in Smart Object Networking. This document offers\n\
    guidance to engineers designing Internet-connected smart objects. A Request for\
    \ Comments (RFC),\nin the context of Internet governance, is a type of publication\
    \ from the Internet Engineering Task Force\n(IETF) and the Internet Society (ISOC),\
    \ the principal technical development and standards-setting\nbodies for the Internet.\n\
    Table 1 illustrates different works that apply the layer model in the\nIoT architecture.\n\
    Table 1. IoT architecture: Layers.\nLayers Proposed\nCharacteristics\n3\nPerception,\
    \ Network, Application [7,8]\n4\nThings, Edge, Network, Application [9]\n5\nBusiness,\
    \ Application, Service, Object abstration, Objects [10]\nIoT needs protocols adapted\
    \ to the new requirements. Traditional protocols are extended and\nnew protocols\
    \ are proposed offering different options on different contexts. IoT has now a\
    \ wide\nrange of applications. A smart devices can have wired or wireless connection.\
    \ As far as the wireless\nIoT is the main concern, many different wireless communication\
    \ technologies and protocols can be\nused to connect the smart device such as\
    \ Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6), over Low power Wireless\nPersonal Area Networks\
    \ (6LoWPAN), ZigBee, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Z-Wave and Near Field\nCommunication\
    \ (NFC). They are short range standard network protocols, while SigFox and Cellular\n\
    are Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN).standard protocols. In [11] a review and\
    \ comparison of\ndifferent communication protocols in IoT is realised. This comparison\
    \ aims at presenting guidelines\nfor the researchers to be able to select the\
    \ right protocol for different applications. Table 2 illustrates\ndifferent protocols\
    \ used in the architecture layers.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n4 of 21\nTable 2.\
    \ IoT protocols.\nLayer\nProtocols\nSession/Application\nMQTT, CoAP, AMQT, HTTP,\

    WiFi, Bluetooth Low Energy, Z-Wave, ZigBee, LoraWan, IEEE 802.15.4, LTE, ...\n\
    Choosing the most appropriate protocol depends on several facts of which most\
    \ important are:\nenvironmental conditions, network characteristics, the amount\
    \ of data to be transferred, security levels\nand quality of service requests\
    \ [12]. CoAP network is primarily a one-to-one protocol for transferring\nstate\
    \ information between client and server while MQTT is a many-to-many communication\n\
    protocol for exchanging messages between multiple clients. CoAP runs over UDP\
    \ which means\nthat communication overhead is signiﬁcantly reduced. If constrained\
    \ communication and battery\nconsumption is not an issue, RESTful services can\
    \ be easily implemented and interact with the Internet\nusing the worldwide HTTP\
    \ [13]. If the targeted ﬁnal applications require massive updates of the same\n\
    value, MQTT protocol is more suitable. In this work different protocols (MQTT,\
    \ HTTP, Bluetooth, WiFi,\nLTE, ...) can be used to develop proposed architecture.\n\
    2.3. Internet of Things Technologies Applied on PA Scenarios\nAdvance in electronics,\
    \ computing and telecommunications are allowing the development of\nnew devices\
    \ (sensors, actuators and computing nodes) with wireless communication capabilities,\n\
    installed at any location, smaller, energy efﬁcient, autonomous, more powerful\
    \ and low cost [14–18].\nIoT works using user-driven service modeling is proposed\
    \ in [19]. Low-cost IoT devices that need\nto gather and transmit sensor data\
    \ and receive remote commands is shown in [20–22]. IoT uses the\nconnection between\
    \ devices to improve their efﬁciency and user experience, being the communication\n\
    one of the main elements for a proper IoT network. A review of the most common\
    \ wired and wireless\ncommunication protocols, discussion of their characteristics,\
    \ advantages and disadvantages as well as\na comparison study to choose the best\
    \ bidirectional sensor network composed by low power devices is\nrealised in [23].\
    \ Previous works show the degree of development of IoT technology, which has also\n\
    been experienced in precision agriculture in recent years.\nIoT technologies are\
    \ proposed in PA scenarios. In [24] this paradigm is analysed as a solution in\n\
    precision farming. IoT Smart farming application include farm parameters tracking,\
    \ monitoring, ﬁeld\nobservation and storage monitoring. The work Internet of Things\
    \ Platform for Smart Farming [25]\npresents a platform based on IoT technologies\
    \ that can automate the collection of environmental, soil,\nfertilisation, and\
    \ irrigation data; automatically correlate such data and ﬁlter-out invalid data\
    \ from\nthe perspective of assessing crop performance; and compute crop forecasts\
    \ and personalised crop\nrecommendations for any particular farm. This platform\
    \ (SmartFarmNet) can integrate virtually any\nIoT device, including commercially\
    \ available sensors, cameras, weather stations, etc., and store their\ndata in\
    \ the cloud for performance analysis and recommendations. An evaluation of the\
    \ SmartFarmNet\nplatform and the experiences and lessons learnt in developing\
    \ this system concludes the paper.\nSmartFarmNet is the ﬁrst and currently largest\
    \ system in the world (in terms of the number of\nsensors attached, crops assessed,\
    \ and users it supports) that provides crop performance analysis\nand recommendations.\n\
    In [9] a greenhouse with hydroponic crop production was designed, developed and\
    \ tested using\nUbiquitous Sensor Network monitoring and control on Internet of\
    \ Things paradigm. The experimental\nresults showed that the Internet technologies\
    \ and Smart Object Communication Patterns can be\ncombined to encourage development\
    \ of Precision Agriculture. They demonstrated added beneﬁts\n(cost, energy, smart\
    \ developing, acceptance by agricultural specialists) when a project is launched.\n\
    Other related work is shown in [26] with Zig Bee technology: Artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ and decision\nsupport approaches have been developed. This work develop technology\
    \ for real-time monitoring\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n5 of 21\nof citrus soil moisture\
    \ and nutrients and the research on the integration of fertilization and irrigation\n\
    decision support system. The results showed that the system could help the grower\
    \ to scientiﬁcally\nfertilize or irrigate, improve the precision operation level\
    \ of citrus production, reduce the cost and\nreduce the pollution caused by chemical\
    \ fertilizer. A review into the state-of-the-art of Big Data\napplications in\
    \ Smart Farming is performed in [27]. Malche et al. [28] proposed a prototype\
    \ IoT system\nfor water level monitoring which can be implemented in future smart\
    \ villages in India. Manufacturers\nof the agricultural sector highlights the\
    \ importance of IoT in [29–32]. PA is effectively a suite of\nmethods, approaches\
    \ and instrumentation that farmers should examine in detail to decide which is\n\
    the most suitable for their business.\n2.4. Internet of Things, Cloud and Machine\
    \ Learning Evolution: Edge and Fog Computing Paradigms\nInternet of Things (IoT)\
    \ aims to bring every object (e.g. smart cameras, environmental sensors,\ncontrol\
    \ appliances, machine learning analysis) on line, hence generating massive amounts\
    \ of data that\ncan overwhelm storage systems and data analytic applications.\
    \ Cloud computing offers services at\nthe infrastructure level that can scale\
    \ to IoT storage and processing requirements. However, there are\napplications\
    \ such as sensor monitoring, control and analysis response that require low latency\
    \ therefore,\ndelay caused by transferring data to the cloud and then back to\
    \ the application can seriously impact\ntheir performances. To overcome this limitation,\
    \ Fog and Edge computing paradigms have been\nproposed, where cloud services are\
    \ extended to the edge of the network to decrease the latency and\nnetwork congestion\
    \ [33]. Both fog computing and edge computing involve pushing intelligence and\n\
    processing capabilities down closer to where the data originates from pumps, motors,\
    \ sensors, relays,\netc. The key difference between the two architectures is exactly\
    \ where that intelligence and computing\npower is placed:\n•\nFog computing pushes\
    \ intelligence down to the local area network level, processing data in a fog\n\
    node or IoT gateway\n•\nEdge computing pushes the intelligence, processing power\
    \ and communication capabilities of an\nedge gateway or appliance directly into\
    \ devices like programmable automation controllers (PACs)\nWith IoT implementation\
    \ now becoming more widespread, devices will generate a lot of data at\nthe end\
    \ of the network and many applications will be deployed at the edge to process\
    \ the information.\nCisco Systems predicts that an estimated 50 billion devices\
    \ will connect to the Internet by 2020 [34–36].\nSome of the applications they\
    \ run might require very short response times, some might involve private\ndata,\
    \ and some might produce huge quantities of data. Cloud computing cannot support\
    \ these IoT\napplications. Edge and Fog computing paradigms, on the other hand,\
    \ can do so and will promote\nmany new IoT applications.\nThe work done in [37]\
    \ concludes that the wireless sensor and actuator networks based on Edge\ncomputing\
    \ are experiencing fast development and opportunities in the post-Cloud era, and\
    \ are used\nin more and more applications. In [38] a Fog Computing Based on radio\
    \ access networks is proposed\nfor smart-cities services.\n2.5. Automated Technologies\
    \ in Greenhouses\nDifferent greenhouses in the south east of Spain have been visited\
    \ to analyse the type of installation\nand to ask expert users. The greenhouse\
    \ with the highest level of automation showed a complete\nnumber of sensors and\
    \ actuators; however, not all the sensors could be related. There are two large\n\
    subsystems in self-assembled greenhouses that are not interoperable. These subsystems\
    \ install different\ntypes of control and technologies:\n•\nIrrigation and nutrition\n\
    •\nAir conditioning and ventilation.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n6 of 21\nIn these\
    \ facilities, an ambient temperature sensor of the air conditioning system is\
    \ not related to\nan irrigation water temperature sensor of the irrigation system.\
    \ Figure 2 shows different automated\ngreenhouses where main subsystems are listed.\n\
    Figure 2. Automated greenhouses: main subsystems in current facilities.\n3. User\
    \ Centred and Computing Method Model: Distributed Computing Architecture Based\
    \ on\nEdge and Fog Nodes\nThe current agricultural facilities are divided in subsystems\
    \ (irrigation, light, climate, soil, crop\nand energy) that are not interconnected.\
    \ Industrial logic programmable controllers and specialised\nsensors give basic\
    \ automation services in each subsystem. Internet and electronic devices (smartphones)\n\
    provide new functionalities based on information access, control and monitoring.\
    \ Human interfaces\non smartphones connected to web servers are examples of new\
    \ services developed over the past years.\nAgricultural technician and farmers\
    \ have knowledge that can be converted on expert rules for device\ncontrol. These\
    \ rules are programmed and implemented on actual programmable devices; however,\n\
    they are static rules which means that do not evolve when new conditions occur,\
    \ neither do they\nadapt to the singularities of each installation. The farmer\
    \ has to decide how to set the rules: what pH\nthe irrigation water must have,\
    \ how much water should be programmed in irrigation process, etc.\nAlso, each\
    \ rule only has effects in a subsystem (irrigation, climate), there is no interoperability.\n\
    Considering this context, new facilities design and development method are proposed\
    \ in this\nwork. The aim is that the farmer participates in the automated activities\
    \ and that the subsystems\nbecome interoperable. A method that implement automatic\
    \ rules and automate the decision making\nconsidering the behaviour of the installation\
    \ itself are also proposed. The phases of the proposed\nmodel are shown in Figure\
    \ 3.\n•\nAnalysis: two kind of users are identiﬁed in this phase (agriculture\
    \ user expert and ICT technician).\nExpert users in agriculture are interviewed\
    \ to deﬁne main processes to control. All these issues are\nrelated with ICT expert\
    \ in a participatory design. The results of this ﬁrst approach are the things\n\
    required to design services and control. In this phase an user-centred methodology\
    \ captures the\nfarmer requirements.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n7 of 21\n•\nDesign:\
    \ the model is based on an architecture with three levels: edge, fog and cloud\
    \ services.\nIn this phase an adapted architecture using these levels is designed.\
    \ The adapted architecture is\nshown in Figure 4.\n•\nIntegration and data analysis:\
    \ Installation and Integration subsystems are developed in this phase.\nData analysis\
    \ is proposed to design machine learning services based on expert rules with farmer.\n\
    •\nStart up, measure and feedback: Test and feedback are launched.\nThe ﬁrst expert\
    \ rules\nare integrated with farmer supervision.\nNew rules are designed with\
    \ feedback processes.\nAutomatic and adapted rules are developed using artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence systems with machine\nlearning platforms.\nFigure 3. User centred\
    \ model based on design and integration of edge and fog communication levels.\n\
    Cloud services and machine learning processes are integrated using this method.\n\
    Figure 4. Architecture: communication levels with different functionality.\nSensors\
    \ 2018, 18, 1731\n8 of 21\n3.1. User-Centred Analysis and Design\nThere are two\
    \ cases treated:\n•\nAgricultural installation with some automated facilities\
    \ already installed\n•\nNew agricultural installation\nThe method is the same\
    \ for both. Expert users in agriculture are interviewed to deﬁne new\nprocesses\
    \ to control. In this ﬁrst approach, the things (objects) required, their relationships\
    \ and the\npotential services are detected. Once objects and services have been\
    \ detected, they must be related\nto the necessary communication and control technologies\
    \ (IoT protocols). Human Interfacing are\nadjusted. Expert rules and intelligent\
    \ services are analysed (Edge and Fog computing proposal). Finally,\nthe installation,\
    \ maintenance and operation methods are designed. All this is designed between\
    \ user\nagricultural technician and information technologies expert.\nThe results\
    \ of this ﬁrst approach are the things required to design services and control.\
    \ A ﬁrst set\nof sensors, actuators, variables, processes and controllers are\
    \ designed considering production facility.\nThis set of objects will be considers\
    \ like things in the next stage.\nIn this description, a thing is formed by an\
    \ object/entity and a context with data associated.\nEach thing has a n-tuple\
    \ data structure (ID, time, date, location, relations, state) where ID, data,\n\
    location, relations with other things and states are deﬁned. Table 3 represents\
    \ different things.\nExpert users design control rules using the things deﬁned.\
    \ These control rules are part of control\nprocesses (climate, soil, irrigation,\
    \ crop, energy or image) that are distributed in different embedded\nsystems connected\
    \ to the network (intranet/internet). Things are a virtual representation of all\n\
    available resources that can be deployed in the different subsystems of the installation.\n\
    At this level all objects/things are recognized by designers. Basic control algorithms\
    \ of all\nsubsystems are designed.\nTable 3. Things context designed in smart\

    \ and their relationship with basic algorithms has been designed.\nAn architecture\
    \ adapted to the facility available is developed in this phase. Requirements are:\n\
    1.\nInterconnection and data access of all subsystems data\n2.\nFacilities and\
    \ resources to implement expert rules\n3.\nConﬁguration, operation and modiﬁcation\
    \ processes\nIoT and AI paradigms provide resources to propose an innovative architecture\
    \ that can be used in\nnew smart precision agriculture services. Edge computing\
    \ used on control devices and fog computing\nnodes installed on local network\
    \ provide powerful technologies to implement conﬁguration, operation\nand improvement\
    \ processes.\nIoT protocols provide resources to capture and communique all subsystems\
    \ data. Each subsystem\nis composed by objects/things (sensor/actuator) that can\
    \ be connected and processed using nodes on\nsensor networks with IoT protocols.\
    \ The requirements established for PA scenarios are:\n•\nStandard and interoperable\
    \ communication protocols to develop open and reusable applications.\nSensors\
    \ 2018, 18, 1731\n9 of 21\n•\nLow-power consumption of all devices installed improve\
    \ the establishment and development.\n•\nEasy access and maintenance. Users are\
    \ not specialized in information technologies. It is important\nto improve its\
    \ acceptability.\n•\nSupport the integration of new smart modules (modularity\
    \ and scalability software and hardware).\n•\nNon-proprietary hardware-software\
    \ to reduce dependencies.\n•\nLow cost devices selection increases the level of\
    \ penetration.\nIoT protocols are designed to work on communication scenarios\
    \ and requirements established.\nThey are optimised for control and two-way open\
    \ communication channels. In these works [39–41]\nMessage Queuing Telemetry Transport\
    \ (MQTT) protocol is proposed as communication paradigm\nbetween sensors, actuators,\
    \ communication nodes, devices and subsystems. Some of the features that\nmakes\
    \ it especially suitable for this project are:\n•\nMQTT is a publish-subscribe\
    \ messaging protocol developed for resource-constrained devices [42],\na model\
    \ already in use by enterprises worldwide, and can work with legacy systems.\n\
    •\nAll messages have a topic path composed of words separated by slashes. A common\
    \ form is\n/place/device-type/device-id/measurement-type/status. The subscribers\
    \ may use wild-cards to\nsubscribe to all measurements coming from a speciﬁc class\
    \ of device.\n•\nThe bandwidth requirements are extremely low, and the nature\
    \ of the protocol makes it\nvery energy-efﬁcient.\n•\nThe programming interface\
    \ is very simple, and the client memory footprint is small, making it\nespecially\
    \ suitable for embedded devices.\n•\nThree Quality of Service (QoS) levels provide\
    \ reliable operations [43].\nUbiquitous networks allow an n-to-m nodes communication\
    \ model. Any node is able to query\nand be queried by other nodes. In addition,\
    \ any node may play the role of a base station (skin node)\ncapable of transmitting\
    \ its information to remote processing places using a gateway device. USN local\n\
    nodes can use and process local data, with a gateway these nodes have a global\
    \ accessibility and\nthey offer extended services on an IoT scenario.\nLocal and\
    \ global access over the same node\n(sensor/device/actuator) has different possibilities\
    \ and beneﬁts. Whereas a local data processing\nis necessary in basic process\
    \ control (security, system start-stop, etc.), global processing (analytic)\n\
    can be used in pattern detection and information generation. In this sense, the\
    \ proposed platform\nuses both technologies combined: different USN over a local\
    \ network area (intranet) connected to\ncloud-IoT services (internet). A computing\
    \ layer in local area, called edge computing, will serve as\ninterface between\
    \ control processes and cloud-services. This layer will be able to process data\
    \ before\ncommunicating to cloud.\n3.3. Data Analysis: Edge and Fog Computing\
    \ Conﬁguration\nThe development of edge and fog computing can be understood in\
    \ three phases:\n•\nConnection: Numerous heterogeneous, real time connections\
    \ between terminals and devices\nwill serve edge computing, as will automatic\
    \ network deployment and operation. Additionally,\nsecurity, reliability, and\
    \ interoperability of connections should be guaranteed. An application of\nthis\
    \ phase is remote automatic soil parameters and ambient conditions data reading\n\
    •\nData treatment on edge computing devices: In this phase, data analysis and\
    \ automatic services\ndevelop new capabilities that are implemented on the new\
    \ edge nodes. Applications of this\nphase can be data ﬁltering, predictive calculation\
    \ of climatic data, classiﬁcation services or\ndetection events\n•\nServices on\
    \ fog computing nodes: Enabled by technologies such as AI and IoT communication\n\
    protocols. Fog computing nodes carries out smart analysis and computing, as well\
    \ as implementing\ndynamic, real-time self-optimization, and executing policy\
    \ adjustments. Applications of this phase\nare prediction of water consumption,\
    \ smart detection or unattended production\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n10 of 21\n\
    Figure 5 shows the architecture implemented using edge and fog nodes. When automated\n\
    subsystems are already installed it is necessary to interleaved embedded devices\
    \ (edge-nodes) between\ncontrollers and sensors/actuators. This devices maintain\
    \ the initial services and allow to initiate\na supervised learning process. New\
    \ algorithms are tested and approved on edge and fog nodes.\nIn Figure 6 different\
    \ services are proposed on each node.\nFigure 5. Architecture proposed on facilities\
    \ already automated: edge nodes interleaved between\ndevices already installed\
    \ and fog nodes that interconnect all subsystems.\nFigure 6. Architecture implemented:\
    \ services proposed.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n11 of 21\n3.4. Test and Feedback\
    \ Developing\nIn machine learning systems the output is not ﬁxed. It will change\
    \ over time as the solution\nknows more and as the model on which the machine\
    \ learning system is built evolves as it is fed more\ndata. This forces the testing\
    \ professional to think differently and adopt test strategies that are very\n\
    different from traditional testing techniques. To test machine learning systems\
    \ is essential:\n1.\nObtaining data sets: This refers to a data set with main\
    \ variables captured and stored to analyse\nand design the model. In irrigation\
    \ process data set are: irrigation programming used (time and\nﬂow), ambient conditions\
    \ (humidity, temperature) and soil conditions (humidity, temperature,\npH and\
    \ conductivity) captured by sensors. All this data are monitored and stored.\n\
    2.\nTraining data sets: This refers to a data set used for training the model.\
    \ It is a subset of the\nprevious dataset. In irrigation process training data\
    \ set are: irrigation programming automated\nby the model (time and ﬂow decision)\
    \ considering ambient conditions (soil, ambient and crop).\nThis data is usually\
    \ prepared by collecting data in a semi-automated way. The results of this\nprocess\
    \ are validated with agronomists.\n3.\nTesting data sets: It is a dataset used\
    \ to to measure the model quality.\n4.\nValidation test suites on real scenarios.\
    \ Taking the irrigation example, test scenarios include\ncategorizing needs of\
    \ water for a kind of crop considering climatic conditions and its growth\nphase.\
    \ Automated irrigation decisions by the model are analysed in this phase.\n5.\n\
    Building validation suites. It is necessary to understand the algorithm. The model\
    \ has algorithm\nthat analyse the data provided, looks for speciﬁc patterns, and\
    \ uses the results of this analysis\nto develop optimal parameters for creating\
    \ the model. The model is reﬁned as the number of\niterations and the richness\
    \ of the data increase.\n6.\nCommunicating test results in statistical terms.\
    \ Models based on machine learning algorithms\nwill produce approximations and\
    \ not exact results. Quality of results must be analysed in the\nsame context.\
    \ The testing community will need to determine the level of conﬁdence within a\n\
    certain range.\n7.\nModel evolution. Support to develop new AI services or modiﬁcations\
    \ on algorithms\nimplemented. Supervised and automatic changes are processes to\
    \ maintain the operating models.\n3.5. Comparison with Industrial Facilities.\
    \ Novelty Elements Proposed\nCurrently, industrial facilities that use PA technologies\
    \ are based on integration of internet and web\nservices with automation and control\
    \ using industrial technology. Proprietary systems are designed for\nmonitoring\
    \ large production plants. Related work analysed show that the Agriculture Control\
    \ system\nfor production, irrigation, or climate proposes different monitoring\
    \ and control technologies, based on\nwireless sensor network and industrial control.\
    \ Monitoring systems analyse crop environment and the\nmethod to improve the decision\
    \ making by analysing statistics and reactive algorithms. This work\nproposes\
    \ two main novelty elements: optimization of architecture levels integration of\
    \ edge and fog\nlayers and proposes the integration the farmer in the design of\
    \ new improvements using data analysis\nobtained with the new architecture developed.\n\
    4. Experimental Work\nDifferent agricultural facilities have been analysed to\
    \ introduce the method proposed. Three kind\nof installations summarize the different\
    \ types:\n•\nInstallation automated but subsystems not interoperable\n•\nPartial\
    \ automation without any interconnection and non-interoperable systems\n•\nManual\
    \ control\nIn all of them, the services based on AI are not yet installed. In\
    \ this context, the method proposed\nusing edge-computing on basic controllers\
    \ and fog-computing on gateway nodes can design common\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n\
    12 of 21\nservices for the three types of facilities cited. With this conﬁguration,\
    \ subsystems interoperability and\nAI support are achieved. Control signals of\
    \ already installed controllers in automated installations\nbecome inputs to edge\
    \ nodes and a fog node which acts as an interface for all facility nodes. In all\n\
    greenhouses, irrigation and internal environment control are basic processes.\
    \ Agronomist users know\nhow to program reactive controls and how to conﬁgure\
    \ automated devices. Optimization of these\nresources (water, energy) are two\
    \ potential services that agronomist perform through their experience.\nThis knowledge\
    \ can be transferred to intelligent systems that integrate it through techniques\
    \ based on\nAI paradigms. Interconnection of subsystems also are one of the proposed\
    \ improvement. A deployment\nfor an automated installation is designed and implemented.\
    \ This case shows how to implement\nwhen there are already automated installations.\
    \ This case also serves as a guide for other types of\ngreenhouse installations.\n\
    4.1. Analysis\nThe farmer, together with the technician in information technologies,\
    \ propose a set\nof improvements:\n•\nMonitoring and control interfaces on the\
    \ Internet (control and communication services)\n•\nEvent and change communication\
    \ service (communication services)\n•\nInterconnection of irrigation and air conditioning\
    \ subsystems (interoperability services)\n•\nIntegration of automation to optimize\
    \ water consumption (AI services)\nThe work carried out designs an installation\
    \ that deploy the necessary hardware and software\nresources using the proposed\
    \ method Figure (Figure 7) shows agricultural subsystems and model\ndeployed on\
    \ distributed nodes.\nFigure 7. Greenhouse design. Fog and edge nodes relations\
    \ on agriculture subsystems.\nIntelligent irrigation control is installed in an\
    \ experimental greenhouse based on tomato\nhydroponic cultivation (Table 4). Following\
    \ the proposed method, the experimental phases are:\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n\

    \ Communication and Context\nIrrigation process, soil parameters, environmental\
    \ conditions inside and outside the greenhouse\nand energy consumption deﬁne objects\
    \ and context. Sensors, actuators and processes and their\nrelationship (context)\
    \ are shown in Table 5. Context vector are (ID, time, date, GH1, relations, state)\
    \ for\neach object/thing, where GH1 is the location ID of greenhouse.\nAll objects\
    \ are interoperable using MQTT protocol. Publisher and subscriber communication\n\
    model that implement this protocol allows interconnect all devices and things.\
    \ Broker device are\ninstalled on fog node. Publishers and subscribers are implemented\
    \ on different nodes.\n4.3. Hardware Devices and Software Modules\nTwo edge nodes\
    \ and one fog node are proposed to control climate and irrigation processes.\n\
    Objects (things) and processes are deployed on all nodes. Irrigation and climate\
    \ control are installed\nin edge nodes, AI services are implemented in fog node.\
    \ Process control architecture is used in\nthe ﬁrst node type (edge) and data-centred\
    \ architecture is used in the second node type (fog) and\nin the cloud services\
    \ implemented. In edge node the ﬂow of data comes from a set of variables\n(things\
    \ and internal variables) which control the processes execution. Agronomist and\
    \ expert users\ndesigns basic control algorithms. After learning and training\
    \ process, these algorithms will be adjusted\nand modiﬁed following the results\
    \ of the expert system (machine learning). The aim is to optimize\nresources (water,\
    \ energy) without losing productivity. Two main control processes are executed\
    \ in\ntwo edge nodes and one machine learning process is implemented in a fog\
    \ node. Table 5 shows these\nprocesses and their relationship. Algorithms are\
    \ implemented in Python and developed using open\nsource criteria. Minimal hardware\
    \ embedded devices requirements are shown in Table 6.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n\

    \ and Testing\nIn facilities already automated, edge nodes are interleaved between\
    \ the installed controllers\nand actual sensors and actuators. Some new sensors\
    \ are installed to complete services designed\n(energy meter). In current facilities\
    \ edge nodes are deployed and allows:\n•\nWork in the same way as before (initial\
    \ learning stage, analysis and model selection).\n•\nChange to a new control using\
    \ new expert and automatic rules using AI processes (supervised stage\nand training)\n\
    •\nTest and reconﬁgure expert rules (testing and maintenance)\nFigure 8 shows\
    \ an edge node to irrigation control and how is deployed in the experimental\n\
    greenhouse built in this work, without previous installation. Agronomists and\
    \ farmers preferences are\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n15 of 21\nthose that drive\
    \ the design: interfaces, maintain and optimize control processes. In irrigation\
    \ process a\ntime schedule with the selected flow rate is programmed by the user\
    \ according to the period of crop\ngrowth. In learning stage, edge node captures\
    \ the data and sends it to the fog node. Fog node process\ndiary water uses, ambient\
    \ and soil conditions, type of crop and its growth. Using these data crop\ntype\
    \ is classified. Crop production results are added as data to analyse it together\
    \ with the stored ones.\nProduction, water consumption, crop growing stage, time,\
    \ date, soil parameters, current weather, forecast\nweather and ambient green\
    \ house conditions are captured as inputs to machine learning platform.\n(a) Hardware\
    \ device\n(b) Software processes\nFigure 8. Hardware and software deployed on\
    \ experimental greenhouse edge node.\nIn future crop productions the irrigation\
    \ schedule can be automated, first with human supervision\nand then automated.\
    \ Biophysical variables (plant, soil, canal flow, and weather conditions) that\
    \ are\nmeasured during the growing seasons are used as inputs to build the models.\
    \ Information about\ncrop phenology (growth stages), soil moisture, and weather\
    \ variables will be compiled. The analysis\nof irrigation decisions is important\
    \ because this can help in the estimation of short-term irrigation\ndemands. If\
    \ the automated process decisions are known, It can help canal operators to better\
    \ manage\nwater deliveries and avoid unexpected delays and operational conditions\
    \ that increase canal losses.\nInformation about these demands can also be helpful\
    \ for the evaluation of expected future agricultural\nsupplies. It can never be\
    \ possible to know the exact reasons why a farmer decided to irrigate, all farmers\n\
    are different and prefer their own decision processes. Data analysis with farmer\
    \ in in its own installation\ninfer automated farmer actions. This data is used\
    \ to build the models and these learnt frameworks will\nbe used to predict irrigation\
    \ decisions. The specific objectives planned with farmer are:\n1.\nIdentify the\
    \ main variables contributing to an irrigation behaviour by training the models\
    \ with\nrelevant data\n2.\nGroup the irrigation decisions into distinct classes\n\
    3.\nIdentify the decisions taken\n4.\nDetect the patterns in farmer decisions\n\

    only by a time schedule. Now, it takes into account data sensors to decide if\

    In this work the state-of-the-art of PA and IoT technologies in agricultural scenarios,\
    \ have been\nanalysed. PA presents difﬁculties to be implemented by farmers. These\
    \ include cultural perception,\nlack of local technical expertise, infrastructure\
    \ constraints, knowledge and technical gaps and high\nstart-up costs. Farmers\
    \ must be involved in the design and integration of these technologies in their\n\
    facilities. To carry out this solution there must be methods to facilitate such\
    \ integration. This work\nproposes a new method to integrate the farmer in the\
    \ development of new solutions using low cost\nsensing technologies and innovative\
    \ communication paradigms. An architecture based on two new\nlevels of communication\
    \ and processing nodes (edge and fog nodes) form the technological core\nof the\
    \ proposed method. Each level performs a set of interconnected functionalities.\
    \ The proposed\ninfrastructure can be installed either in already automated installations\
    \ or in the design of new facilities.\nIn the already automated installations,\
    \ the method introduces new possibilities for the development of\nintelligent\
    \ and interconnected control. An experimental work has been carried out in a greenhouse.\n\
    In this work, communication nodes have been installed and a new service based\
    \ on a decision tree\nparadigm has been designed by expert user. The facilities\
    \ that use the proposed model make the\nclimate control and irrigation subsystems\
    \ interoperable and allow the farmer to design new integrated\ncontrol rules.\
    \ The new distributed communication model allows the farmer to analyse changes\
    \ and\nimprovements. This experimental work initiates a new methodology of work\
    \ for the farmer who can\nuse these new technologies more easily. Future control\
    \ rules and services using a machine learning\nplatform and AI paradigms will\

    \ of Things (IoT)-based automation of agricultural events can change the agriculture\n\
    sector from being static and manual to dynamic and smart, leading to enhanced\
    \ production with\nreduced human efforts. Precision Agriculture (PA) along with\
    \ Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) are the\nmain drivers of automation in the agriculture\
    \ domain. PA uses speciﬁc sensors and software to ensure\nthat the crops receive\
    \ exactly what they need to optimize productivity and sustainability. PA includes\n\
    retrieving real data about the conditions of soil, crops and weather from the\
    \ sensors deployed in the\nﬁelds. High-resolution images of crops are obtained\
    \ from satellite or air-borne platforms (manned\nor unmanned), which are further\
    \ processed to extract information used to provide future decisions.\nIn this\
    \ paper, a review of near and remote sensor networks in the agriculture domain\
    \ is presented\nalong with several considerations and challenges. This survey\
    \ includes wireless communication\ntechnologies, sensors, and wireless nodes used\
    \ to assess the environmental behaviour, the platforms\nused to obtain spectral\
    \ images of crops, the common vegetation indices used to analyse spectral\nimages\
    \ and applications of WSN in agriculture. As a proof of concept, we present a\
    \ case study\nshowing how WSN-based PA system can be implemented. We propose an\
    \ IoT-based smart solution\nfor crop health monitoring, which is comprised of\
    \ two modules. The ﬁrst module is a wireless sensor\nnetwork-based system to monitor\
    \ real-time crop health status. The second module uses a low altitude\nremote\
    \ sensing platform to obtain multi-spectral imagery, which is further processed\
    \ to classify\nhealthy and unhealthy crops. We also highlight the results obtained\
    \ using a case study and list the\nchallenges and future directions based on our\
    \ work.\nKeywords: smart agriculture; precision agriculture; vegetation index;\
    \ Internet of Things\n1. Introduction\nThe rapidly-growing human population has\
    \ increased food demands for human survival on\nthe Earth. Meeting the food requirements\
    \ with limited resources of the planet is a big challenge [1].\nSeveral state-of-the-art\
    \ technologies are being incorporated in the agriculture domain to enhance\nthe\
    \ productivity to cope with this challenge. Precision Agriculture (PA) is comprised\
    \ of near and\nremote sensing techniques using IoT sensors, which help to monitor\
    \ crop states at multiple growth\nlevels. PA involves the acquisition and processing\
    \ of a large amount of data related to crop health.\nMultiple parameters are involved\
    \ in plants health, including water level, temperature and others.\nPA enables\
    \ a farmer to know precisely what parameters are needed for healthy crop, where\
    \ these\nparameters are needed and in what amount at a particular instance of\
    \ time. This requires collecting\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796; doi:10.3390/s19173796\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n2 of 25\nmassive information\
    \ from different sources and different parts of the ﬁeld such as soil nutrients,\
    \ the\npresence of pests and weeds, chlorophyll content in plants and some weather\
    \ conditions. All collected\ninformation needs to be analysed to produce agronomic\
    \ recommendations. For instance, given the\ndevelopmental stage of plants, their\
    \ level of greenness (chlorophyll content) reveals the nutrients\nneeded. This\
    \ information is combined with the characteristics of the soil where the plant\
    \ is located\nalong with weather forecast. All collected information is further\
    \ used to determine how much of a\ncertain fertilizer should be applied to that\
    \ plant on the next day. The delivery of agronomic information\non the right time\
    \ to farmer and ensuring that he/she applies these recommendations are key to\n\
    enhancing the yields.\nThe foremost driver of PA is a WSN, which is a network\
    \ of multiple wireless nodes connected\ntogether to monitor the physical parameters\
    \ of environment. Each wireless node is comprised of a\nradio transceiver, a micro-controller,\
    \ sensor(s), an antenna, along with other circuitry that enables it\nto communicate\
    \ with some gateway to transmit information collected by the sensor(s) [2]. Sensors\n\
    measure the physical parameters and send the collected information to the controller,\
    \ which further\ntransmits this information to the cloud or a portable device.\
    \ The agriculture sector has multiple\nrequirements comprised of soil statistics,\
    \ crops’ nature, weather conditions, fertilizer types and water\nrequirements.\
    \ Crops have diverse requirements depending on different crops on the same land\
    \ and the\nsame plant on different lands with different weather conditions. Sensors\
    \ monitor the varying behaviour\nof these crop parameters. Due to rapid advancement\
    \ in WSN technologies, the size and the cost of\nsensors have reduced, which make\
    \ it feasible to implement them in many sectors of life including\nagriculture.\
    \ The most common sensors used in the agriculture domain that capture environmental\n\
    parameters related to crops [3] are listed in Table 1.\nIn general, a WSN consists\
    \ of one or more wireless nodes that are further connected with sensors.\nThese\
    \ nodes are tiny devices that are responsible for collecting data. Nodes are divided\
    \ into two types,\na source node that collects the data, and the other is sink\
    \ or gateway node, which receives data from the\nsource nodes. A sink node has\
    \ more computational power compared to a source node. However, there\nare energy,\
    \ memory, power, size, data rate and price constraints when choosing wireless\
    \ nodes. Table 2\nshows a comparison of wireless nodes along with their common\
    \ speciﬁcations [3]. Among all wireless\nnodes presented in Table 2, MICA2 is\
    \ considered to be more suitable as compared to others because of\nits large number\
    \ of expansion connectors, which makes it suitable to connect with several sensors.\n\
    Many applications using WSN have been proposed since the last decade to monitor\
    \ crops’ health\nremotely. In [4], a cyber-physical system was presented for monitoring\
    \ of a potato crop. Cyber physical\nsystems can be expressed as smart systems\
    \ that are comprised of software, hardware and physical\ncomponents, integrated\
    \ together to sense the varying states of the real world. The proposed system\n\
    consists of three layers: the ﬁrst layer is the physical layer, in which all sensory\
    \ data are collected;\nthe second layer is the network layer in which data are\
    \ transmitted to the cloud; the third layer is\nthe decision layer in which the\
    \ data are analysed and processed to make decisions according to the\nobservations.\n\
    There are several challenges in IoT-based systems due to exponential increasing\
    \ devices. As in\na typical IoT network, every node transmits data to the remote\
    \ cloud, which results in cloud\ncongestion, and the main challenges underlying\
    \ the IOT-based system are latency with minimum\npower requirements, better usage\
    \ of bandwidth and intermittent Internet connectivity. Fog computing\nand edge\
    \ computing are the state-of-the-art techniques to overcome these issues; which\
    \ reduce the\ncomputational burden of cloud. The main goal of fog computing is\
    \ to conserve energy and bandwidth,\nwhich helps to increase the quality of service\
    \ to the end users. In [5], an energy-efﬁcient architecture of\nthe Fog of Everything\
    \ was presented, which was comprised of six layers. The ﬁrst layer was an Internet\n\
    Of Everything (IOE) layer, where things (could be ﬁxed, mobile or nomadic) functioned\
    \ under multiple\nspatially-distributed clusters. The second was a wireless access\
    \ network that supported Thing to Fog\n(T2F) and Fog to Thing (F2T) communication\
    \ over the wireless channel. In the third layer, the connected\nfog nodes behaved\
    \ such as a virtualized cluster. There was an inter-fog backbone in the fourth\
    \ layer,\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n3 of 25\nwhich was responsible for connectivity\
    \ among fog nodes. The next layer was the virtualization layer,\nwhich provided\
    \ each connected thing with the ability to augment its limited resource set, exploiting\n\
    the computation capability at the virtual clone. In the last layer, there was\
    \ an overlay inter-clone\nvirtual network that empowered Peer to Peer (P2P) communication.\
    \ Then, a protocol stack for FOE\nwas presented, which was further tested by creating\
    \ a small prototype named as V-FOE and simulated\non the iFogsim toolkit. The\
    \ results provided strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed\nframework\
    \ and more energy efﬁciency with reduced failure rate and delay.\nTable 1. Wireless\

    The energy efﬁciency is the most serious consideration while developing any fog\
    \ architecture.\nIn [6], an energy-efﬁcient protocol for a fog-supported wireless\
    \ sensor network was presented, which\nmaximized the lifetime of the network by\
    \ uniformly distributing the energy among connected nodes.\nThe performance of\
    \ the proposed algorithm was compared with the existing state-of-the-art algorithms\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 3796\n4 of 25\nin MATLAB. The results showed that the proposed\
    \ algorithm was highly energy efﬁcient with a\nprolonged network lifetime.\nRegardless\
    \ of all the advancements in the IoT domain, the adoption of PA has been limited\
    \ to\nsome developed countries. Because of the lack of resources, remote sensing-based\
    \ techniques to\nmonitor crop health are not common in under-developed countries\
    \ such as Pakistan, which results in\na loss of yield. Pakistan is an agricultural\
    \ country due to is large arable land and climatic variations,\nwhich make it\
    \ suitable to cultivate multiple types of crops. Despite all these natural resources,\
    \ Pakistan\nis still unable to produce massive yields [7]. The main reason behind\
    \ the low production is traditional\nfarming practices, which are used for crop\
    \ health monitoring and yield estimation. These techniques\nare completely based\
    \ on farmer’s intuition and experience. Farmers visit the ﬁelds in order to monitor\n\
    the crop, which is very laborious and quite challenging in the case of large arable\
    \ land. In this case, the\narea under insect/pest attack is inaccurately measured,\
    \ which can result in over spraying of insecticide\nand pesticide, which adversely\
    \ affects the nutrition in crops.\nKeeping in mind all these issues, our motivation\
    \ is to provide the industry and research\ncommunities with a survey of technologies,\
    \ metrics and current practices concerning communication\ndevices, sensors and\
    \ platforms used to monitor and analyse multiple sources of data (spectral images,\n\
    IoT, etc.) used in environmental and agriculture applications. As the main contribution,\
    \ we generated\na technological taxonomy for PA, which was driven by an IoT-based\
    \ architecture to monitor the crops’\nhealth. The developed system had two modules\
    \ including wireless sensor network-based crop heath\nmonitoring in which multiple\
    \ sensors were used to get the real-time heath status of crop; the other\none\
    \ was NDVI-based analysis of spectra images captured by a drone to assess the\
    \ chlorophyll content,\nwhich was further used to monitor the health of the crop.\n\

    \ wireless\ncommunication technologies used in the agriculture domain; Section\

    \ protocols have been introduced in the last few decades due to the rapid\nincrease\
    \ in IoT devices and WSN technologies. Each protocol has its own speciﬁcations\
    \ depending on\nthe bandwidth, number of free channels, data rate, battery timing,\
    \ price and other factors [8]. The most\ncommonly-used protocols for wireless\
    \ communication in IoT-based applications in agriculture are:\nSensors 2019, 19,\
    \ 3796\n5 of 25\n2.1. Cellular\nCellular technology is most suitable for applications\
    \ that require an extraordinary data rate.\nIt can utilize GSM, 3G and 4G cellular\
    \ communication capabilities by providing reliable high-speed\nconnectivity to\
    \ the Internet, requiring higher power consumption.\nIt requires infrastructure\
    \ to\nbe deployed and operation cost and back up staff for it with a centralized\
    \ managed authority.\n4G cellular technology requires more battery power, but\
    \ cellular technology is a good option in\nunderground wireless sensor networks,\
    \ such as security systems in smart home projects and agriculture\napplications\
    \ [9]. A smart irrigation systems was presented in [10], in which several soil\
    \ moisture\nsensors were deployed in the ﬁeld in the ZigBee mesh network. The\
    \ reading captured from the ﬁelds\nwere transmitted over the cloud using the cellular\
    \ 4G LTE network.\n2.2. 6LoWPAN\n6LoWPAN is an IP-based communication protocol,\
    \ which was the ﬁrst protocol used for IoT\ncommunication. 6LoWPAN is also low\
    \ cost because of the low bandwidth and low power consumption.\n6LoWPAN supports\
    \ multiple topologies such as star and mesh topologies. To handle interoperability\n\
    between IPv6 and IEEE 802.15.4, there is an adaptation layer between the network\
    \ layer and the\nMAC layer [8]. The applications for 6LoWPAN are monitoring the\
    \ health equipment, environment\nmonitoring and in security and home automation\
    \ systems. In [11], a 6LoWPAN-enabled wireless sensor\nnetwork was presented to\
    \ monitor the soil properties of crops. The 6LoWPAN system architecture\nfor precision\
    \ agriculture application was discussed in [12] where the performance evaluation\
    \ of this\nprotocol was discussed with several baud rates and power constraints.\n\
    2.3. ZigBee\nZigBee is a wireless communication protocol widely used in precision\
    \ agriculture to monitor\nenvironmental conditions related to crops’ health [13].\
    \ It is based on the wireless 802.15.4 standard.\nBasically, it was developed\
    \ for personal area networks by the ZigBee alliance [8]. It has a ﬂexible\nnetwork\
    \ structure, long battery life, supports mesh, star and tree topology with multi-hop\
    \ data\ntransmission, is easily installed and supports large nodes. It has a short\
    \ range with limited data speed\nand is less secure compared to Wi-Fi-based systems.\
    \ ZigBee is very common in smart agriculture\napplications such as smart green\
    \ houses and smart irrigation systems [14]. In [15], a smart irrigation\nsystem\
    \ was presented based on the ZigBee communication protocol. This system consisted\
    \ of two\nnodes, i.e., a sensor node and an actuator node. The sensor node was\
    \ comprised of soil moisture\nsensors, which monitored the water level in the\
    \ soil. The actuator module was responsible for taking\nactions according to the\
    \ water level of the soil. All communication was carried out by means of\nZigBee\
    \ protocol.\n2.4. BLE\nBLE is as famous as the Bluetooth smart technology, which\
    \ is a suitable protocol for IoT\napplications including agriculture [16]. It\
    \ is particularly designed for low bandwidth, low latency and\nshort range for\
    \ IoT applications. The main advantages of BLE over typical Bluetooth include\
    \ lower\nsetup time, lower power consumption and unlimited support for nodes in\
    \ a star topology. It has a\nvery limited range of 10 meters. However, the drawbacks\
    \ are that it can only provide communication\nbetween two devices, it presents\
    \ low security, and it can lose connection during communication. In [17],\na BLE-based\
    \ infrastructure was presented to collect the sensors’ data. The proposed system\
    \ utilized a\nsmart phone to collect the data of sensors using BLE, where sensors\
    \ were deployed in the plants, i.e.,\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature\
    \ sensor.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n6 of 25\n2.5. RFID\nRFID systems consist of\
    \ a reader and a transponder, which have a very small radio frequency,\ncalled\
    \ the RF tag. This tag is programmed electronically with distinctive information\
    \ that has a reading\ncharacteristic. RFID has two technologies for the tag system\
    \ the ﬁrst is the active reader tag system,\nand the other is the passive reader\
    \ tag. Active reader tag systems are more expensive, as they utilize\nmore battery\
    \ power and use high frequencies. However, passive reader tag systems are low\
    \ powered.\nSome IoT applications using RFID include smart shopping, healthcare,\
    \ national security and smart\nagriculture applications. An IoT-based smart irrigation\
    \ system based on RFID was presented in [18].\nThe system was comprised of soil\
    \ moisture and soil temperature sensors along with a water control\nsystem, so\
    \ it collected the reading of the sensors and sent these readings to the cloud\
    \ using RFID\ncommunication protocols, where the user controlled a water pump\
    \ based on the water level of the soil.\n2.6. Wi-Fi\nWi-Fi is the most common\
    \ communication protocol that enables devices to communicate over\na wireless\
    \ signal. Wi-Fi provides Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) connectivity to millions\
    \ of\nlocations, i.e., homes, ofﬁces and public locations such as cafes, hotels\
    \ and airports with high speed.\nThe Wi-Fi protocol supports IEEE 802.11, 802.11a,\
    \ 802.11b, 802.11g and 802.11n. Wi-Fi is widely used\nin IoT-based applications\
    \ including agriculture systems, i.e., smart irrigation, crop health monitoring\n\
    and greenhouses. In [19], an infrastructure was presented to monitor environmental\
    \ parameters\ninside the greenhouse such as temperature, light intensity and soil\
    \ moisture level. This platform\nwas comprised of sensors that collected the data\
    \ related to the environmental variation and sent to\nthe cloud using Wi-Fi. Similarly,\
    \ another smart agriculture system based on Wi-Fi communication\nprotocols was\
    \ presented in [20]. This last one consisted of a Raspberry Pi connected with\
    \ multiple\nsensors, which collected the data. The collected data were further\
    \ transmitted to the cloud using Wi-Fi\ncommunication protocols.\n2.7. LoRaWAN\n\
    LoRaWAN operates on the LoRa network. LoRaWAN deﬁnes the system architecture and\n\
    communication protocol of the network, while the physical layer of LoRa enables\
    \ the link for\nlong-range communication. LoRaWAN manages the frequencies in communication,\
    \ data rate and\npower consumption for all devices. LoRaWAN is common in agricultural\
    \ applications because of\nits large coverage area and low power consumption [21].\
    \ In [14], a smart irrigation system based on\nLoRaWAN was presented. Table 3\
    \ shows the comparison of all mentioned wireless communication\nprotocols [8].\
    \ Among all wireless communication technologies, 6LoWPAN and ZigBee are considered\n\
    to be more suitable for PA application because both are based on mesh networking,\
    \ which makes them\nsuitable to cover large area.\nTable 3. Wireless communication\

    \ Image-Based Remote Sensing\nRemote sensing has been widely used in PA to monitor\
    \ crops’ health for the last two decades.\nRemote sensing is a phenomenon in which\
    \ physical conditions of the Earth are observed remotely by\ncalculating the emitted\
    \ and reﬂected radiation from some distance. There are special cameras that\n\
    are used to capture images for further analysis to ﬁnd the characteristics of\
    \ a speciﬁc area. Multiple\nplatforms are used to mount these cameras that capture\
    \ images of the objects.\n3.1. Spectral Image Platforms\nRemote sensing platform\
    \ considerations for spectral images are airborne-based, satellite-based\nand\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based [22]. Each platform has its own coverage\
    \ range, which\nis determined by three factors: (i) Ground Sampling Distance (GSD),\
    \ which is computed in terms of\nspatial resolution, (ii) data collection rate\
    \ or frequency and (iii) average distance between the object\nand sensor. Apart\
    \ from coverage range, several factors [23] affect the performance of platforms,\n\
    as mentioned in Table 4.\nTable 4. Key differences between spectral image platforms.\n\

    \ are considered to be the most stable platforms among\nall others. These platforms\
    \ consist of satellites, rockets and space shuttles. Space borne platforms are\n\
    categorized based on the orbits and timing. The advantages of satellite-based\
    \ remote sensing include\nhigh spatial resolution, which makes it promising to\
    \ extract extensive time-series data. The images\nobtained by satellite platforms\
    \ cover large area and are stable without noise, which is normally induced\ndue\
    \ to interference while image capturing. However, the main problem with satellite-based\
    \ platforms\nis their high cost in the case of high spatial resolution images.\
    \ The second problem is their strictly ﬁxed\ntime schedule, so data cannot be\
    \ collected at critical timings. The re-visitation times vary from twice\nin one\
    \ day to 16 days, depending on the orbit of the satellite. The other big problem\
    \ is that satellite\nplatforms are highly sensitive to weather conditions, so\
    \ if the weather is cloudy, the captured image will\nhave less detailed information.\
    \ Table 5 shows the main types of satellites with their speciﬁcations [22].\n\
    Among all satellite platforms presented in Table 5, some satellite data are freely\
    \ available,\nwhile others provide a commercial solution. The commercial solutions\
    \ such as Pleiades-1 provide\nimages with a high resolution and a revisit time\
    \ of one day. QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel are\nfrequently-used satellite\
    \ platforms used to obtain hyperspectral imagery. QuickBird was launched\nin 2001\
    \ by USA. The Panchromatic (PAN) and four Multi-Spectral (MS) imagery sensors\
    \ are used in\nQuickBird with a GSD of 0.7 × 0.7–2.6 × 2.6 m with a revisit time\
    \ 1–3.5 days. QuickBird provides a\nsmall revisit time, but it is a commercial\
    \ solution. In contrast to QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel\nprovide free solutions.\
    \ Landsat-8 was launched in 2013 by the USA. Landsat-8 provides a GSD of\n16 days\
    \ with PAN and 11-MS imagery sensors. Though revisit time of Landsat-8 is much\
    \ higher\ncompared to QuickBird, but it provides images with 11 different multi-spectral\
    \ bands.\nSentinel is another broadly-used satellite launched by the EU. It currently\
    \ has three missions,\ni.e., Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3. These missions\
    \ provide images with 21 MS bands with\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n8 of 25\nrevisit\
    \ times of 5–10 days depending on which Sentinel mission is used. However, Sentinel-2\
    \ is a\ncommonly-used platform in precision agriculture as it provides data freely\
    \ at a 10-m spatial resolution\nand covers a swath width of 290 km. By combining\
    \ Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, the revisit time is\nfurther reduced to ﬁve days,\
    \ which helps in change detection. The complete details of all satellite\nplatforms\
    \ with their speciﬁcations are listed in Table 5, where other platforms such as\
    \ SAT, MODIS\nand WordView are also considered.\nTable 5. Satellite platforms\

    \ a vibrant alternative to satellite and airborne, which are quite ﬂexible and\
    \ cost\neffective. A typical UAV platform consists of a communication and navigation\
    \ system that incorporates\na set of sensors mounted on it. Among UAV platforms,\
    \ there are mainly ﬁxed-wing platforms. and\nmultirotor options are available.\
    \ The ﬂying time is based on the payload weight. In general, a longer\nﬂying time\
    \ is achieved by ﬁxed-wing systems, which demands lighter weight payloads. For\
    \ example,\nhigh-deﬁnition cameras weighing less than 300 grams as the payload\
    \ of a ﬁxed-wing UAV allow it to ﬂy\nfor around two hours using currently available\
    \ battery power [24]. On the contrary, battery-powered\nmultirotor UAV with higher\
    \ payload capacity have a reduced ﬂying time, i.e., around 15–25 min.\nTable 7\
    \ shows UAV platforms commonly used in the agriculture domain and concretely to\
    \ monitor\nthe health of crops remotely [22]. Among these platforms, DJI/Phantom-2\
    \ is a more suitable choice\nfor intermediate agricultural land because of its\
    \ low cost and ease of use. The other advantage of this\nplatform is that it provides\
    \ support for mounting multiple cameras, which helps to monitor the crop in\n\
    multiple electro-magnetic bands. The American Aerospace/RS-16 is also an option\
    \ because of its ﬂight\ntime and large are coverage, but due to its high cost,\
    \ this platform is not common.\nIn [25], the ESAFLY A2500_WH helicopter was used\
    \ to implement the platform of the UAV\nwith Tetra cam ADC Micro as the camera\
    \ to capture hyper-spectral images of two different types of\ncultivation, i.e.,\
    \ vineyard and tomato. The images captured by the UAV platform are very high in\n\
    resolution, so more information can be extracted as compared to satellite images.\
    \ To assess the health\nof a crop, three types of Vegetation Index (VI) maps have\
    \ been computed.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n10 of 25\nTable 7. UAV platforms for\

    \ described above, a series of Vegetation\nIndices (VIs) can be computed. Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) obtained from remote sensing-based canopies\nare effective algorithms\
    \ for quantitative and qualitative evaluations of vigour, vegetation cover and\n\
    growth dynamics, among other applications [26]. Hitherto, no uniﬁed mathematical\
    \ expression exists\nthat deﬁnes all VIs due to the complexity of the several\
    \ light spectra combinations, instrumentation,\nresolutions and platforms used.\
    \ In particular, this section focuses on vegetation indices NDVI, GDVI\nand SAVI,\
    \ as they are widely used in PA.\n3.2.1. NDVI\nThe Normalized Difference Vegetation\
    \ Index (NDVI) is the most popular VI that is extensively\nused to ﬁnd the content\
    \ of green in PA applications [27,28]. It uses Red (R) and Near Infrared (NIR)\n\
    channels to compute the NDVI index. More NIR light is absorbed by healthy vegetation;\
    \ however,\nabsorption ratio is very small for red light. NDVI is computed by\
    \ Equation (1) and returns a value\nbetween −1 and 1 [29].\nNDVI = NIR − R\nNIR\
    \ + R\n(1)\nHigher NDVI value indicate healthy vegetation, while smaller values\
    \ of NDVI show that vegetation is\nvery small at that speciﬁc region. There is\
    \ another form of NDVI, i.e., the Green Normalized Vegetation\nIndex (GNDVI),\
    \ which uses the green channel instead of red. GNDVI is computed by Equation (2):\n\
    GNDVI = NIR − G\nNIR + G\n(2)\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n11 of 25\n3.2.2. Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index\nThe DVI was proposed to reduce the effect of soil reﬂectance,\
    \ which is not covered by NDVI [30].\nDVI is different between the reﬂectance\
    \ of the NIR band to the reﬂectance of the red band. DVI is also\ncomputed with\
    \ the green band, i.e., GDVI. Both DVI and GDVI are computed by Equations (3)\
    \ and (4):\nDVI = NIR − R\n(3)\nGDVI = NIR − G\n(4)\n3.2.3. SAVI\nNDVI and DVI\
    \ do not compensate the background effect of soil. Therefore, many vegetation\n\
    indices were introduced to compensate the effect of soil reﬂectance. The Soil\
    \ Adjusted Vegetation Index\n(SAVI), the Green Soil Adjusted vegetation Index\
    \ (GSAVI), the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation\nIndex (OSAVI), the Green Optimized\
    \ Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OGSAVI) and the Modiﬁed\nSoil Adjusted Vegetation\
    \ Index (MSAVI) [31–33] are common among them, which are computed by\nEquations\
    \ (5)–(9):\nSAVI =\n1.5(NIR − R)\n(NIR + R + 0.5)\n(5)\nGSAVI = 1.5(NIR − G)\n\
    NIR + G + 0.5\n(6)\nOSAVI =\n(NIR − G)\nNIR + R + 0.16\n(7)\nGOSAVI =\n(NIR −\
    \ G)\nNIR + G + 0.16\n(8)\nMSAVI = 0.5[2(NIR + 1) −\nq\n(2NIR + 1)2 − 8(NIR −\
    \ R)]\n(9)\n3.2.4. NR and NG:\nNormalized Red (NR) and Normalized Green (NG) are\
    \ two other famous vegetation indices being\nused in PA [33]. NR focuses on the\
    \ part of spectrum where radiation is absorbed by chlorophyll, while\nNG focuses\
    \ on the part of the spectrum where radiation is absorbed by other pigments, excluding\n\
    chlorophyll. NR and NG are computed by Equations (10) and (11):\nNR =\nR\nNIR\
    \ + R + G\n(10)\nNG =\nG\nNIR + R + G\n(11)\n4. Wireless Sensor Network Applications\
    \ in Agriculture\nMultiple applications of wireless sensor networks are being\
    \ utilized today in the agriculture sector.\nSome very common applications are\
    \ smart irrigation, smart fertilization, smart pest control and green\nhouse monitoring.\n\
    4.1. Smart Irrigation Systems\nSmart irrigation is an artiﬁcial irrigation application\
    \ that controls the quantity of water by making\na decision about where water\
    \ is needed. It is the most signiﬁcant constituent in agriculture, which has\n\
    a great impact on crops’ health, cost and productivity. One major aspect of smart\
    \ irrigation is to avoid\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n12 of 25\nthe wastage of water\
    \ since most countries in the world are facing water scarcity problems. A smart\n\
    irrigation system was presented in [34] in which a Raspberry Pi was used along\
    \ with two sensors:\na soil moisture sensor was used to assess the water level\
    \ in the soil, while a temperature and humidity\nsensor was used to monitor the\
    \ environmental condition. The Raspberry Pi was connected to these\nsensors and\
    \ the water supply network. A mobile application was developed for remote monitoring\n\
    and remote water ﬂow control enabling both manual and automatic water ﬂow control.\
    \ In automatic\nmode, water ﬂow was automatically turned ON/OFF based on the water\
    \ level of the soil without\nhuman intervention. In manual mode, the user was\
    \ able to monitor the soil moisture level. An alert\nwas generated when the water\
    \ level of soil was getting below a speciﬁc threshold, and the user turned\nit\
    \ ON/OFF using a mobile application.\nPower is a big concern in IoT-based platforms,\
    \ so many researchers have developed power-\nefﬁcient systems. A power-efﬁcient\
    \ water irrigation system was presented using solar power [35]\nin which the controller\
    \ was connected to the soil sensor and water supply valve. The water valve\nwas\
    \ turned ON/OFF based on the water level monitored by the moisture sensor. The\
    \ power was\nsupplied by the solar panel, so the system was independent of any\
    \ external power module. Another\nsensor-based IoT system for water irrigation\
    \ was presented in [36] in which the controller controlled\nthe opening and closing\
    \ of a solenoid valve based on the water level of the soil. In addition, a series\
    \ of\nweather alerts were sent to the user via a mobile application to update\
    \ the temperature and humidity of\nthe environment, which had a direct inﬂuence\
    \ on the water level of the soil. In [37], an energy-efﬁcient\nirrigation system\
    \ for cultivated crops was presented using a wireless sensor network in which\
    \ water\nwas effectively controlled based on environmental conditions. This system\
    \ estimated the quantity of\nwater needed for normal irrigation based on the humidity,\
    \ temperature and wind speed collected by\nsensors along with historical data.\n\
    In [38], an IoT-based irrigation system was presented using soil moisture sensors\
    \ controlled by\nATMEGA 328P on an Arduino UNO board along with a GPRS module.\
    \ The data collected from the\nsensors were sent to the cloud, i.e., Things Speak,\
    \ where graphs were generated to visualize the data\ntrends. A web portal was\
    \ also designed where the farmer was able to check the status of water, if it\n\
    was ON/OFF. Similarly, a real-time prototype for an irrigation system was presented\
    \ in [39] in which\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature sensors were used\
    \ to assess the water status of the soil.\nRFID was used to transmit data to the\
    \ cloud for further data analysis. Using ATMEGA 328, a water\nsprinkler system\
    \ for smart irrigation was presented in [40] using temperature, humidity and soil\n\
    moisture sensors. The water sprinkler was controlled based on the soil moisture\
    \ level to save water\nand reduce human effort. In [41], a cost-effective drip\
    \ irrigation system for a home was proposed in\nwhich a Raspberry Pi, Arduino,\
    \ electronic water control valve and relay were used. ZigBee protocols\nwere used\
    \ for communication. The user turned ON/OFF the water valve by sending commands\
    \ to the\nRaspberry Pi, which further processed the commands through the Arduino.\n\
    The sensors placement is a big issue that affects the accuracy of sensors. A detailed\
    \ discussion of\nsoil moisture positioning in the ﬁeld and their accuracy was\
    \ presented in [42]. For real-time irrigation\nsystems, complete software and\
    \ hardware requirements, problems and challenges and advantages\nwere discussed\
    \ in [43] where a big picture of the complete system was provided.\n4.2. Smart\
    \ Fertilization System\nFertilizer is an artiﬁcial or natural substance having\
    \ some chemical elements used to enhance\nthe growth and productivity of plants.\
    \ Manual spraying is a common technique used for fertilization.\nHowever, the\
    \ optimal way of fertilization requires sensing capabilities to ﬁnd the exact\
    \ place where\nfertilizer is needed, which chemical components are missing and\
    \ the amount of fertilizer needed.\nIt is important to provide fertilizers in\
    \ a very precise amount in order to improve productivity [44].\nMultiple fertilization\
    \ techniques have been presented by researchers since the last decade using WSN\n\
    and IoT.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n13 of 25\nAn automated fertilization system\
    \ was presented in [45] using real-time sensors to measure the\nsoil fertility.\
    \ The system consisted of three modules including input, output and decision support.\n\
    The decision support module measured the optimal amount of fertilizers needed\
    \ for the growth of the\nplants based on the real-time sensory data captured by\
    \ the sensors. A mechanical sensor named the\n“Pendulum Meter” was introduced\
    \ in [46], which was used for optimal fertilization. This sensor was\nmounted\
    \ on the tractor to measure the density of the crop, so the corresponding fertilizer\
    \ spreader\nwas controlled based on the readings of this sensor. The IEEE 802.11\
    \ Wi-Fi module was used for\ncommunication along with GPS. Real-time data of soil\
    \ were collected by several sensors, i.e., soil\nmoisture, temperature, conductivity,\
    \ NO2, CO2, etc. A Geographical Information System (GIS) server\nwas used to interpolate\
    \ sensory data.\n4.3. Smart Pest Control and Early Disease Detection System\n\
    Pest attacks are the root cause of low productivity in the agriculture sector.\
    \ These pests result in\nseveral serious diseases in plants that affect the plant’s\
    \ growth. However, disease prediction provides\nearly warning to the farmers,\
    \ which enables them to make appropriate decisions to control the disease\non\
    \ time. Pest control systems are comprised of electronic devices that enable humans\
    \ to identify traps\nin a speciﬁc range of these electronic devices [47]. These\
    \ electronic devices are sensors capable of\ncalculating the environmental parameters\
    \ for further analysis.\nMuch research has been done in the agriculture sector\
    \ for early disease detection and pest control\nsystems using more advanced and\
    \ sophisticated technologies [48,49]. Multiple imagery sensors have\nbeen used\
    \ by different researchers to collect imagery data, such as: RGB sensors, ﬂuorescence\
    \ imagery\nsensors, spectral sensors and thermal sensors [50]. The thermal sensors\
    \ are used to measure the water\nstatus in the plant by measuring the temperature,\
    \ since this parameter has a direct inﬂuence on the\nwater level in the plants.\
    \ RGB images have three colour channels, i.e., red, green and blue, which\ncan\
    \ be used to perceive the biometric effect in the plants. Multi- and hyper-spectral\
    \ sensors capture\nimages containing the spatial information of objects in multiple\
    \ wavebands. The spatial resolution is\ndependent on the distance between the\
    \ object and the sensor. That is why satellite images contain less\nspatial resolution\
    \ as compared to low altitude platforms such as drones. The ﬂuorescence sensors\
    \ are\nused to distinguish the photosynthetic activities in the plants. Various\
    \ image processing techniques\nare applied to these imagery data to identify the\
    \ diseases in plants.\nIn [50], an IoT-based plants disease and pest prediction\
    \ system was presented to minimize the\nexcessive use of fungicides and insecticides.\
    \ Weather condition monitoring sensors, i.e., temperature,\ndew, humidity and\
    \ wind speed, are used to monitor weather parameters to ﬁnd a correlation between\n\
    pest growth with weather. The sensors have been deployed in orchards, and data\
    \ collected from these\nsensors are sent to the cloud. The farmer is informed\
    \ about the alarming condition of the pest attack\non the crops.\nFrom a different\
    \ point of view, hyper-spectral images are used to analyse crops’ health and pest\n\
    attack using manned or unmanned vehicles on which spectral cameras are mounted.\
    \ The captured\nimages are analysed in depth using machine learning techniques\
    \ to identify the disease in the plants.\nAdvance Neural Networks (ANNs) are more\
    \ common for processing imagery data due to their ability\nto learn complex structures\
    \ and patterns. Using hyper-spectral images, a system was presented [51] to\n\
    identify disease or pest attack in crops. The proposed system for disease detection\
    \ used an ANN with\nmultiple layers.\nEarly disease detection in sugar beet plants\
    \ was presented in [52]. For early detection, four\nsupervised classiﬁcation algorithms\
    \ were applied on spectral images. Spectral images were then\ncollected for each\
    \ image, and multiple vegetation indices were calculated to be used in predictive\n\
    and perspective analysis. The vegetation indices used were NVDI, SR, SIPI, PSSRaand\
    \ PSSRb, ARI,\nREP, mCAIand RRE. These vegetation indices values were used as\
    \ features in the dataset. Support\nVector Machine (SVM), ANN, and decision tree\
    \ were used for classiﬁcation. A comparative analysis\nwas performed which, showed\
    \ that SVM outperformed other classiﬁers for disease detection with an\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 3796\n14 of 25\naccuracy of 97.12%. In [53], a data mining technique\
    \ was applied on the already collected dataset of\ntwo types of crops, i.e., wheat\
    \ and paddy (rice), in India. For dimension reduction, Sammon’s mapping\nwas used\
    \ for multi-dimension scaling, i.e., to reduce the dimension also for unsupervised\
    \ learning.\nFor high dimensional data, dimension reduction is required prior\
    \ to performing further data analysis\nfor better data visualization and accuracy,\
    \ since redundant dimensions reduce the effectiveness of\nany data analysis algorithms.\
    \ Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is a very often-used technique\nalong with\
    \ Sammon’s mapping. Data from multi-dimensions were reduced to two or three dimensions.\n\
    Then, the Self-Organized Maps (SOM) algorithm for clustering was used to ﬁnd correlations\
    \ between\nthe data. The accuracy comparison of SOM and Sammon’s mapping was presented,\
    \ which showed\nthat SOM performed better on a large dataset, while Sammon’s mapping\
    \ was suitable for small ones.\nSmart phones played important role in data acquisition,\
    \ which were further used to monitor the crops’\nhealth. In [54], the health of\
    \ wheat crop was monitored using near surface imagery captured by a smart\nphone.\
    \ The crop was classiﬁed as healthy or unhealthy based on the green level by computing\
    \ Gcc.\nMost of the applications in PA have been either IoT-based in which multiple\
    \ sensors are used to\nassess the health of the crop or remote sensing-based in\
    \ which crop health is assessed by performing\nsome computation on spectral images.\
    \ We can compare crop health monitoring application based\non some attributes\
    \ such as which sensors are used in particular applications, whether web or mobile\n\
    services are provided or not, etc. The comparative analysis of some existing crop\
    \ health monitoring\napplications is presented in Table 8 based on some attributes.\n\
    To precisely monitor the crop health, both IoT-based techniques and remote sensing\
    \ techniques\nshould be used together to provide more reliable and accurate information\
    \ about the crop. As a\nproof of concept, we present a case study in which a crop\
    \ health monitoring system based on IoT and\nremote sensing techniques is proposed.\
    \ We provide a complete end-to-end solution in the agriculture\ndomain by facilitating\
    \ the agricultural user with web and mobile services so that he/she could be\n\
    informed about the latest condition of the crop in a timely manner. In this way,\
    \ remedy actions could\nbe performed in time, which will result in enhanced production.\n\

    \ Precision Agriculture\nWe developed a complete solution for crop health monitoring\
    \ based on IoT and remote sensing.\nIn the proposed system, crop health is monitored\
    \ using data collected from multiple IoT sensors,\nas well as NDVI mapping of\
    \ spectral images captured by a drone. The architecture of the proposed\nsystem\
    \ is shown in Figure 1, which was designed according to two main modules. The\
    \ ﬁrst module\nwas a wireless sensor network-based system in which multiple wireless\
    \ nodes were developed. Each\nwireless node was comprised of a soil moisture sensor\
    \ used to monitor the water level of the soil,\na soil temperature sensor used\
    \ to check the temperature of the soil and air temperature and humidity\nsensors.\
    \ These nodes were deployed across the ﬁeld in a star topology fashion where the\
    \ master node\ncollected readings from all slave nodes and transmitted the captured\
    \ reading to the back-end server for\nfurther processing. The master node acted\
    \ as a gateway node, which received data from all slave nodes\nusing NRF communication\
    \ module. After performing initial processing, the master node transmitted\nthe\
    \ data to the cloud using GSM communication technology. In the case of the unavailability\
    \ of the\nGSM network, this node stored the captured data and transmitted to the\
    \ cloud upon the availability\nof network.\nThe second module was used to monitor\
    \ crop health using multi-spectral imagery, which was\ncollected by a multi-spectral\
    \ camera mounted on a drone. The NDVI was computed using Equation (1)\nto classify\
    \ between healthy and unhealthy plants by measuring the chlorophyll content in\
    \ the crops,\nwhich was further used to localize the area under stress precisely.\n\
    All collected data were sent to the cloud where further analysis was performed.\
    \ The web portal\nwas designed to help the farmer monitor the crop proﬁle over\
    \ the whole life cycle. Currently, we are\nmonitoring soil moisture, soil temperature,\
    \ air moisture and air temperature readings in real time\nalong with NDVI mapping\
    \ of spectral imagery. Multiple web services were provided on the web\nportal\
    \ including historical/real data visualization using graphs, weather monitoring,\
    \ NDVI mapping\nand the correlation among measured parameters. Figure 2 shows\
    \ the snapshots of the web portal\nalong with different services.\nFigure 1. System\
    \ architecture.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n17 of 25\nFigure 2. User interface of\
    \ the web portal.\nFor portability and remote monitoring, a mobile application\
    \ was also developed to facilitate the\nfarmer/agronomist/landlord with all the\
    \ web services that are available on web portal. The alerts\nare generated when\
    \ an abnormal behaviour is observed in the crop, which help the farmer to take\n\
    remedy actions in a timely manner. The user interfaces of the mobile application\
    \ are shown in Figure 3.\nTherefore, the web portal along with mobile applications\
    \ provides a complete solution, which enables\nagricultural users monitor the\
    \ current status of the crop, as well as previous details.\nFigure 3. User interface\
    \ of the mobile application.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n18 of 25\n6. Results and\
    \ Discussion\n6.1. Analysis of the Data Collected by IoT Nodes\nThe developed\
    \ IoT nodes were deployed across the wheat ﬁelds of an area of 1.4375 hectare.\n\
    The selected area was located in Islamabad, Pakistan. The wheat ﬁelds are shown\
    \ in Figure 4 along\nwith the IoT node and sensors. We deployed the system across\
    \ the wheat ﬁeld in March 2019 when\nwheat was in the grain ﬁlling and grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 4. System deployed across the wheat ﬁelds.\nWe collected the\
    \ sensors’ readings such as air temperature, air humidity, soil temperature and\n\
    soil moisture. We compared the observed crop parameters with the ideal wheat temperature\
    \ proﬁle\nas shown in Figure 5. Extreme variation in the weather of Islamabad\
    \ was observed in that particular\ntime period, which can be seen by how the actual\
    \ temperature for wheat crop deviated from the ideal\ntemperature proﬁle of the\
    \ wheat crop.\nFigure 5. Deviation of observed temperature from the ideal temperature\
    \ proﬁle.\nAdditionally, we performed linear regression to ﬁnd the correlation\
    \ between observed parameters,\nwhich provided insight into how changes in one\
    \ parameter can effect the other parameter. The linear\nregression found a relation\
    \ between the two parameters by ﬁtting the equation of the line using the\nobserved\
    \ dataset [69]. Equation (12) represents an equation of the line where mrepresents\
    \ the slope of\nline, while c indicates the y-intercept. The variables m and c\
    \ were learned from the data.\ny = mx + c\n(12)\nFigure 6A shows the correlation\
    \ between the observed air temperature and air humidity, which showed\nthat both\
    \ were negatively correlated. The correlation between air temperature and soil\
    \ temperature is\nshown in Figure 6B, which shows that both were positively correlated.\n\

    \ and air humidity. (B) Correlation b/w air temperature\nand soil temperature.\n\
    The rise in air temperature caused the air humidity to reduce, while it resulted\
    \ in an increase in\nsoil temperature and vice versa.\n6.2. Analysis of Multi-spectral\
    \ Images Captured by Drone\nTo collect multi-spectral imagery, we used the DJI-Phantom\
    \ Pro Advanced drone with the Sentera\nMulti-spectral-imaging sensor. The drone\
    \ had its own optical camera, while the multi-spectral camera\nwas mounted on\
    \ it to obtain spectral images. Multiple ﬂights of the drone were carried out\
    \ at the\nspeciﬁc growing stages of the crop, i.e., grain ripening and grain ﬁlling\
    \ stage. After collecting these\nimages, they were transferred to the cloud for\
    \ NDVI mapping. Figure 7A shows the optical image\nthat was captured on 16 May\
    \ 2019 when wheat was in the harvesting stage, while Figure 7B is its\nspectral\
    \ image, and Figure 7C is the NDVI mapping. Since wheat was at a mature stage,\
    \ its NDVI\nshould be very small, i.e., ideally there should be no green region\
    \ in the ﬁeld. However, in NDVI\nmapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal\
    \ behaviour of the crop. The green region was\ndue to naturally growing plants.\
    \ This information can be visualized on the web portal.\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure\

    \ same process was performed in a maize ﬁeld when maize was in the grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 8A shows the optical image that was captured on 24 July 2019\
    \ when maize was in the grain\nripening stage, while Figure 8B is its spectral\
    \ image, and Figure 8C is the NDVI mapping. The same\nbehaviour can be observed\
    \ with the maize crop, i.e., there should be a minimal green region in the\nﬁeld.\
    \ However, in NDVI mapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal behaviour\
    \ of the crop.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n20 of 25\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure 8. Maize\
    \ crop. (A) Optical image; (B) spectral image; (C) NDVI mapping.\n7. Challenges\n\
    PA has been used since the last few decades to enhance crops’ yield with reduced\
    \ costs and\nhuman effort, although the adoption of these novel techniques by\
    \ farmers is still very limited owing to\nthe following reasons or challenges.\n\
    7.1. Hardware Cost\nPA relies mostly on hardware such as sensors, wireless nodes,\
    \ drones, spectral imaging sensors,\netc., which are used to assess multiple parameters\
    \ in real time. These sensors have multiple limitations\nincluding high development,\
    \ maintenance and deployment cost. Some systems in PA are cost effective\nand\
    \ are suitable for small arable land, i.e., smart irrigation systems that require\
    \ low-cost hardware\ncomponents and sensors. However, drone-based systems for\
    \ crops’ health monitoring are feasible for\nlarge arable land due to high installation\
    \ cost.\n7.2. Weather Variations\nEnvironmental variation is one of the major\
    \ challenges that affects the accuracy of data collected\nby sensors. Sensor nodes\
    \ deployed in the ﬁeld are sensitive to environmental variations, i.e., rain,\n\
    ﬂuctuation in temperature, wind speed, sun light, etc. Communication between wireless\
    \ nodes\nand the cloud can be interrupted due interference induced in wireless\
    \ communication channels by\natmospheric disturbance. The satellite, air borne\
    \ and drone platforms are also sensitive to weather\nvariations. Imagery acquired\
    \ by these platforms is affected by contamination of clouds and other\nnatural\
    \ aerosols. The development of advanced techniques for atmospheric correction,\
    \ cloud detection\nand noise interpolation is a current open challenge, which\
    \ requires hard efforts from the research\ncommunity.\n7.3. Data Management\n\
    The sensors in PA constantly generate data. To ensure the integrity of data, some\
    \ data security\nmeasures needs to be in place, which will in turn enhance the\
    \ cost of the system. The readings from\nthe sensors have to be accurate in order\
    \ to take appropriate actions precisely when and where required.\nAn intruder\
    \ can corrupt the readings, and false readings will adversely reduce the effectiveness\
    \ of\nthe system. PA systems generate immense amounts of data, which require enough\
    \ resources to\nperform data analysis. Real-time data collected from sensors deployed\
    \ across the ﬁelds after a few\nminutes and spectral imagery acquired from high-altitude\
    \ or low-altitude platforms produce the bulk\nof the data, which increase the\
    \ storage and processing requirements. New software platforms and\nfacilities\
    \ for scalable management of Big Data sources are demanded. In this regard, the\
    \ generation\nof software-as-a-service solutions is focused on merging data management\
    \ and IoT thorough cloud\ncomputing platforms.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n21 of\
    \ 25\n7.4. Literacy Rate\nLiteracy is an important factor that inﬂuences the adoption\
    \ ratio in PA. In developing countries\nwhere the illiteracy rate is high, farmers\
    \ grow crops based on their experience. They do not utilize the\nstate-of-the-art\
    \ technologies in agriculture, which results in loss of production. Farmers need\
    \ to be\neducated in order to understand the technology or they have to trust\
    \ a third party for technical support.\nTherefore, in underdeveloped areas where\
    \ the literacy rate is not high, PA is not very common due to\nthe limitations\
    \ of resources and education.\n7.5. Connectivity\nNext-generation 5G networks\
    \ can be 100-times faster than 4G ones, making communication\nbetween devices\
    \ and servers much quicker. 5G can also carry much more data than other networks,\n\
    which makes it an ideal technology for transmitting information from remote sensors\
    \ and drones, key\ntools that are being tested in PA environments. The adoption\
    \ of new communication networks based\non 5G is a must in current applications\
    \ where secure and rapid data transfer enables real-time data\nmanagement and\
    \ support for decision making.\n7.6. Interoperability\nOne of the biggest problems\
    \ PA faces is the interoperability of equipment due to different digital\nstandards.\
    \ This lack of interoperability is not only obstructing the adoption of new IoT\
    \ technologies\nand slowing down their growth, but it also inhibits the gain of\
    \ production efﬁciency through smart\nagriculture applications. New methods and\
    \ protocols to integrate different machine communication\nstandards to unlock\
    \ the potential of efﬁcient machine-to-machine communication and data sharing\n\
    between machines and management information systems are required in the current\
    \ scenario of PA.\n8. Conclusion and Future Directions\nPrecision agriculture\
    \ is a modern practice used to enhance crops’ productivity using latest\ntechnologies,\
    \ i.e., WSN, IoT, cloud computing, Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning\n\
    (ML). Most of the research done so far indicates that PA-based practices have\
    \ a great inﬂuence on\nsustainability and productivity. The objective of PA is\
    \ to provide decision support systems based\non multiple parameters of crops,\
    \ i.e., soil nutrients, water level of the soil, wind speed, intensity of\nsunlight,\
    \ temperature, humidity, chlorophyll content, etc. However, several challenges\
    \ are involved\nin the development and deployment phase of these systems. This\
    \ article was aimed at providing a\nsurvey of modern technologies involving current\
    \ PA platforms, with the goal of supporting industry\nand research communities\
    \ on the development of modern applications for smart agriculture. A case\nstudy\
    \ was presented to prove the effectiveness of the PA in the agriculture domain.\n\
    Since the main objective of precision agriculture is to produce surplus yield\
    \ by optimizing the\nresources such as water, pesticides, fertilizers, etc., for\
    \ resource optimization, prescription maps play\nan important role, which enables\
    \ farmers to quantify resources required for healthy crops at any\nparticular\
    \ growth stage. Most of the research accomplished in the agriculture domain focuses\
    \ on the\nremote sensing platforms to collect imagery, which reﬂects only Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) such as NDVI.\nThe prescription maps cannot be generated by only\
    \ using VIs; instead, multiple other factors need to\nbe considered such as soil\
    \ properties, soil moisture level, meteorological behaviour, etc.\nFunding: This\

    Introduction With the rapid development and widespread penetration of artificial
    intelligence technology, more and more novel intelligent Internet of Things (IoT)
    applications are emerging, such as deep-learning-driven smart video surveillance,
    flying ad hoc networks for precision agriculture, e-health, and smart homes [1].
    These kinds of intelligent IoT applications are typically resource-hungry, run
    computationally intensive machine learning algorithms (e.g., deep learning [2]),
    and demand real-time processing [3]. Nevertheless, due to the physical size constraint,
    IoT devices are in general constrained by limited computation resources, which
    make difficult to fulfill the quality of service (QoS) requirements of intelligent
    IoT applications [4]. Task offloading, a promising technology to augment device
    resources, has been widely considered in both academia and industry. In recent
    years, many researchers have focused on the mobile cloud computing solution in
    which mobile devices can offload computation-intensive data processing tasks to
    the resource-rich clouds for remote execution. However, this paradigm cannot support
    latency-sensitive IoT applications, due to the long network distance between IoT
    devices and clouds [5]. As an alternative, mobile edge computing (more generally
    fog computing) is an emerging paradigm that leverages a multitude of collaborative
    end-user and/or near-user devices to carry out a substantial amount of computation
    tasks from which they can each benefit [5]. As mobile edge computing is implemented
    at the network edge, it promises low latency as well as agile computation augmenting
    services for IoT device users [5], [6]. As illustrated in Fig. 1, mobile edge
    computing can enable a hybrid task offloading paradigm for intelligent IoT applications,
    where an IoT device is enabled to utilize its own local resource, nearby devices''
    resources via device-to-device (D2D) communication technology and the edge clouds''
    resources in proximity to the connected cellular base station. Figure 1. An illustration
    of mobile edge computing for intelligent IoT applications. Show All There have
    been many existing studies considering the computation offloading problems, in
    particular for mobile cloud computing (e.g., [7]–[11, references therein]). Nevertheless,
    most of these studies only focused on the computation offloading between the target
    device and the associated cloud server. How to efficiently offload computation-intensive
    and and latency-critical intelligent IoT application tasks across the target device,
    helper devices, and the edge cloud is less understood. Moreover, due to the massive
    nature of IoT devices and the limited capacity of the edge cloud, concurrent computation
    offloading across different devices is highly significant and necessary. Hence,
    computation offloading for each individual IoT device should be resource-efficient
    subject to the satisfied QoS requirement. More resource-efficient computation
    offloaing also implies less resource usage and hence a lower edge cloud service
    payment for the IoT device user. However, the resource efficiency of computation
    offloading is rarely explored in the existing studies. With this motivation, in
    this article we propose ThriftyEdge, a new paradigm of resource-efficient edge
    computing for intelligent IoT applications. In particular, we adopt a device-centric
    approach, and devise a resource-efficient computation offloading algorithm such
    that each individual intelligent IoT device user strives to minimize the cloud
    resource occupancy (usage) given that its QoS requirement is satisfied. The salient
    features of our resource-efficient computation offloading algorithm are as follows.
    On one hand, we adopt a hybrid approach to exploit the hierarchical resources
    across local devices, nearby helper devices, and the edge cloud in proximity.
    On the other hand, we propose an efficient topology-sorting-based task graph partition
    algorithm and the optimal virtual machine selection method in order to minimize
    an intelligent IoT device''s edge resource occupancy and meanwhile satisfy its
    QoS requirement. Related Work Many previous works in mobile cloud computing have
    focused on the computation offloading problem (e.g., [7]–[11, references therein]),
    Wen et al. in [7] presented an efficient offloading policy by jointly configuring
    the clock frequency in the mobile device and scheduling the data transmission
    to minimize the energy consumption. Yang et al. in [8] studied the scenario in
    which multiple users share the wireless network bandwidth, and solved the problem
    of minimizing the delay performance by a centralized heuristic genetic algorithm.
    Chen et al. in [9] proposed a game theoretic approach for designing decentralized
    multi-user computation offloading mechanisms for reducing the total task execution
    overhead. Pu et al. in [10] devised a mobile edge computing framework based on
    D2D collaboration with the objective of optimizing the system-wide energy efficiency.
    Note that the computation offloading scheme in our article is different from the
    studies above, since the existing works aim to optimize a device''s energy efficiency
    or delay performance, while our objective is to optimize a device''s offloading
    decision with respect to resource utilization efficiency (subject to completion
    time constraints). This is highly relevant to many IoT applications because the
    number of IoT devices is generally large, and it is desirable to support more
    concurrent IoT device users by minimizing each individual device''s resource occupation.
    Edge Computing Scenario We consider a scenario in which an intelligent IoT device
    (e.g., a smart video camera or a robot) is connected to a wireless base station
    that possesses an edge cloud in proximity. There are multiple virtual machine
    types available at the edge cloud, each of which has heterogenous computation
    capability. Note that our model can also be extended to the case with the remote
    public cloud by just taking into account the wide area network (WAN) transmission
    latency. The IoT device has a time-critical and computation-intensive task (e.g.,
    a machine learning task for intelligent IoT applications) to complete. Subject
    to the QoS requirement of the application, the task has the maximum allowable
    completion time. When there is also a helper device (e.g., a device in an idle
    status) available in proximity, the task device can also choose to establish a
    D2D connection with it (e.g., using cellular D2D [12] or WiFi-Direct [13]) for
    D2D-enabled computation offloading.1 This is motivated by the fact that the edge
    device types are in general heterogonous, and some devices (e.g., surveillance
    video camera and robots) have both sufficient battery power and computing capacity,
    and hence are capable of handling the offloaded tasks from a nearby device that
    is resource constrained. Note that when there is not such a helper device available,
    the task device only considers the choices of both local computing and offloaded
    edge cloud computing. We next introduce the task graph model to describe the processing
    procedure of the computational task. Similar to most existing studies (e.g., [7],
    [8], [14]), we describe the data processing computation task of the device by
    a directed acyclic graph. Specifically, in the task graph, the nodes represent
    the data processing task components, and the directed edges stand for the data
    dependencies. For a node in the task graph, we can define the node weight as the
    required computational resources (i.e., CPU cycles) for the corresponding data
    processing task component. For a subsequent node that invokes the output data
    from another node, we can also define the edge weight between these two nodes
    as the amount of data transferred between these two corresponding task components.
    For a given task component on the task graph, the task device can either execute
    it locally at its own device, or offload to the helper device in proximity or
    the edge cloud. Hence, we have the time for executing the given task component
    i at device m as T m i , which depends on the computation capability of the execution
    device. For the edge cloud computing approach, a virtual machine is associated
    with the task device user for its task execution in the edge cloud. Depending
    on the virtual machine type chosen by the device for executing its whole task,
    accordingly we can then compute the time by the cloud computing approach for executing
    the given task component i on the virtual machine as T c i . Now suppose that
    two task components i, j having data dependency are executed at different locations
    (e.g., one at a user''s device and the other at the edge cloud). Then a total
    amount of data needs to be transferred between these two components via wireless
    connections [12]. We denote the execution location of the task component i as
    y i , and the total data transmission time for computation offloading between
    data processing task components i and j is represented as T e ij ( y i , y j )
    . Resource-Efficient Computation Offloading In this section, we discuss the key
    idea of ThriftyEdge. We first consider the resource-efficient computation offloading
    problem to determine the optimal task component execution locations and the virtual
    machine selection in order to minimize the resource occupancy and meanwhile satisfy
    the QoS requirements. Delay-Aware Task Graph Partition We first consider the delay-aware
    task graph partition problem for a fixed edge cloud resource size. That is, given
    that the user''s virtual machine type selection for cloud computation is fixed,
    we aim to determine the optimal execution location (i.e., target device n , helper
    device m , or edge cloud c) for each task component in its task graph in order
    to minimize the total delay of executing the whole task. First of all, we leverage
    the structural property of the task graph. Since the graph is directed acyclic,
    it is known that we can carry out a topological sorting of the graph (Fig. 2 illustrates
    this), that is, ordering of the nodes such that for every directed edge from node
    i to node j, i comes before j in the ordering. Figure 2. An illustration of task
    graph topological sorting and partitioning for mobile edge computation offloading.
    Show All We introduce the classic Kahn Algorithm for the topological sorting of
    the task graph, which has a low polynomial computational complexity. After the
    topological sorting, we then obtain an ordering of the nodes. We also denote the
    set of nodes to which there is an edge directed from node i as Δ(i) . According
    to the definition of topology sorting, we know that if j∈Δ(i), i comes before
    j in the node ordering. Note that since no edge is directed from the end node
    (i.e., the output component) and for any other node there always exists some edge
    directed from it (otherwise the corresponding task component is useless since
    it does not provide any input to either other intermediate components or the output
    component), the last node in the ordering after topology sorting must be the output
    component. Based on the node ordering by topological sorting, we then solve the
    delay-aware task graph partition problem by the principle of backward induction.
    That is, we first determine the optimal execution location for the last node in
    the ordering after topology sorting, based on which we can determine the optimal
    location for the nodes by moving backward. Moreover, we denote the minimum delay
    starting from executing the task component i until the end of the whole task as
    Z(i) . The proposed algorithm consists of both a delay-aware task graph partition
    algorithm and the optimal virtual machine selection method, aiming at minimizing
    an intelligent IoT device''s edge resource occupancy while satisfying the QoS
    requirement. For the last node k (i.e., the output component) in the ordering,
    we have Z(k) equals the execution time t n k at the local task device n , since
    in general the final result will be returned to the task device n . Then we move
    backward to consider the remaining nodes in the ordering in a recursive manner.
    Obviously, the delay starting from executing the task component i until the end
    of the whole task depends on that of the bottleneck node j∈Δ(i) with maximum delay
    that requires the input data from node i . Thus, we have Z(i)= min y∈{n,m,c} max
    j∈Δ(i) { T y i + T e ij (y, y j )+Z(j)} . Intuitively, this means that the minimum
    delay starting from executing the task component i until the end of the whole
    task equals minimizing the total delay of both executing the current task component
    (including the data transmission delay if any) and the minimum executing delay
    for the remaining task components afterward. Then the optimal execution location
    for a node is the best choice for achieving the minimum delay. By the back induction,
    for all the remaining nodes, we can recursively compute the minimum delays and
    the optimal execution locations. Optimal Virtual Machine Selection We aim to devise
    a resource-efficient computation offloading strategy in order to determine the
    optimal edge cloud resource profile for the device, with minimum edge cloud resource
    occupation while satisfying its QoS constraint. The key motivation is two-fold.
    On one hand, from the system point of view, minimizing cloud resource occupation
    helps to increase the resource utilization efficiency and can support more concurrent
    IoT devices in the mobile edge system. On the other hand, from the user perspective,
    in general the cloud resource occupancy serves as an important indicator for determining
    user payment for edge computing service. Thus, a smaller cloud resource occupancy
    implies a lower service payment for the user as well. Formally, we define the
    resource-efficient offloading problem (i.e., the core problem for ThriftyEdge)
    as selecting the proper virtual machine type that minimizes the edge cloud resource
    occupancy, subject to the constraint that the completion time of the task is within
    the deadline. As illustrated in Fig. 3, building upon the delay-aware task graph
    partition algorithm above, this problem can easily be solved as follows. First,
    we rank all virtual machine types provisioned by the edge cloud according to the
    corresponding computation resource capacity. Then, according to the ranking, we
    sequentially select a virtual machine choice and utilize the delay-aware task
    graph partition algorithm to compute the minimum delay for the first node in the
    ordering after the topology sorting. Once the execution time is less than the
    deadline, we stop and find the optimal virtual machine choice having the minimum
    resource occupation. Note that for simplicity in this article we only consider
    the delay as the constraint. Our method can also apply if we consider the energy
    overhead. This can be done by accounting for the accumulated energy cost in the
    back induction procedure in the delay-aware task graph partition algorithm. Figure
    3. Flow chart of computing resource-efficient computation offloading profile Show
    All We further evaluate the performance of the proposed ThriftyEdge scheme (i.e.,
    the resource-efficient offloading algorithm) in terms of the resource occupancy.
    Upon comparison, we also implement the Odessa computation offloading scheme [15]
    and the all offloading solution — all task components in the task graph will be
    offloaded. The Odessa computation offloading scheme adopts a greedy strategy to
    leverage the data and pipeline parallelism for computation offloading. The results
    are shown in Fig. 4 using object pose estimation application, wherein we use the
    all offloading solution as the baseline to normalize the resource occupancy performance
    by the other two schemes. We see that the proposed ThriftyEdge scheme can achieve
    superior performance of 19 percent resource occupancy reduction over the Odessa
    scheme. Figure 4. Resource occupancy by different computation offloading schemes.
    Show All Future Research Directions In this section, we discuss several important
    directions for further exploring resource-efficient edge computing for intelligent
    IoT applications. First of all, a very interesting and challenging direction for
    extending the current study is to consider multi-user resource-efficient edge
    computing. Different from the single-user case, for the multi-user case we need
    to carefully address the key contention issue in the computing resource sharing
    on both the same helper device and the edge cloud. Also, it is very useful to
    explore the reusability of the task components among multiple users that are running
    similar applications in order to further improve the resource efficiency. Second,
    it is also very promising to design a fine-grained computation offloading mechanism,
    such that different IoT devices can fine tune their computation demands tailored
    to the physical environment as well as the QoS requirements. Achieving fine-grained
    computation offloading can definitely help to improve the resource efficiency.
    Last but not least, in this article we consider a general computation model that
    is represented by a computational task graph. Since the IoT data analytics is
    of prime importance for many intelligent IoT applications, particular research
    attention can be paid to the area of edge data stream processing, which leverages
    both edge computing and machine learning techniques for achieving efficient real-time
    IoT data processing and analytics. Conclusion In this article we explore the resource-efficient
    edge computing issues for intelligent IoT applications. We devise a resource-efficient
    computation offloading algorithm to enable an IoT device to exploit resources
    across the local device, nearby helper devices, and the edge cloud in proximity.
    Specifically, the proposed algorithm consists of both a delay-aware task graph
    partition algorithm and the optimal virtual machine selection method, aiming to
    minimize an intelligent IoT device''s edge resource occupancy while satisfying
    the QoS requirement. Performance evaluation corroborates the superior performance
    of the proposed computation offloading algorithm in terms of the resource efficiency.

    Footnotes Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) and smart computing technologies
    have revolutionized every sphere of 21 st century humans. IoT technologies and
    the data driven services they offer were beyond imagination just a decade ago.
    Now, they surround us and influence a variety of domains such as automobile, smart
    home, healthcare, etc. In particular, the Agriculture and Farming industries have
    also embraced this technological intervention. Smart devices are widely used by
    a range of people from farmers to entrepreneurs. These technologies are used in
    a variety of ways, from finding real-time status of crops and soil moisture content
    to deploying drones to assist with tasks such as applying pesticide spray. However,
    the use of IoT and smart communication technologies introduce a vast exposure
    to cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities in smart farming environments. Such
    cyber attacks have the potential to disrupt the economies of countries that are
    widely dependent on agriculture. In this paper, we present a holistic study on
    security and privacy in a smart farming ecosystem. The paper outlines a multi
    layered architecture relevant to the precision agriculture domain and discusses
    the security and privacy issues in this dynamic and distributed cyber physical
    environment. Further more, the paper elaborates on potential cyber attack scenarios
    and highlights open research challenges and future directions. A Roadmap of Cybersecurity

    I. Introduction and Motivation According to the United Nations (UN), the world
    population is expected to exceed 9 billion people by 2050, growing by almost a
    third of the current population [1], [2]. Such an increase in the population demands
    a boost of almost 70 percent in the food production rate, according to the Food
    and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.1 This rapidly growing population
    also introduces a variety of other problems such as increasing competition and
    exploitation of land, water and other natural resources. These issues present
    an urgent need to reduce the dependence of food system on our environment. Consequently,
    the need for an evolutionary agricultural paradigm to keep up with growing demand
    of food and crop production is necessary to guarantee a sustainable development
    [3]. Smart farming technologies2 and precision agriculture3 [4] are gaining more
    attraction for their potential to fulfill such an increasing demand and meet global
    food supply needs. Smart farming technologies involve integration of technology
    and data driven agriculture applications to increase crop yield and quality of
    food products. There are numerous smart farming use cases [5]–[7] present globally
    indicating the impact of this new paradigm of practicing agriculture. As an example,
    the use of remote sensors placed in the soil for measuring blueberry irrigation
    in Chile has reduced the volume of water used in farming by 70 percent [8]. In
    India, farm data has been used to predict and prevent crop diseases, which reduced
    the risk associated with the failure of crop production [9]. Similar data driven
    approaches have helped fruit farmers in Slovenia effectively fight against pests.4
    Smart farming, however, goes beyond primary production. In fact, it has impacted
    the complete food supply chain, by employing big data analytics to provide useful
    insights about the entire farming process [10] by facilitating real-time operational
    decision making, and revolutionizing existing agriculture business models. Smart
    farming enhances conventional farming practices by introducing on-field smart
    sensors and devices. These sensors and devices work in a synergistic manner to
    provide efficient farming experiences, as well as, an improved crop yield. Although
    beneficial to the productivity of the industry, the use of heterogeneous, internet-connected
    devices has exposed potential cyber attacks and vulnerabilities in the agriculture
    sector. These attacks introduce the ability to remotely control and exploit on-field
    sensors and autonomous vehicles (tractors, aerial vehicles, etc). Potential agricultural
    attacks can create an unsafe and unproductive farming environment. For example,
    exploits that have the ability to destroy an entire field of standing grown crops,
    flood the farmlands, over spray pesticides using smart drones, etc. can cause
    unsafe consumption as well as economic deterioration. Such attacks in a large
    coordinated manner, also referred to as agro-terrorism [11], also have the potential
    of disrupting the economy of an agriculture-dependent nation. A report [12] released
    by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security extensively elaborates various cyber
    threat scenarios in precision agriculture, further emphasizing the need for research
    in this critical domain. The Agriculture industry adds 6.4 percent of the world’s
    economic production with a total of $5,084,800 million.5 Agriculture, food, and
    related industries contributed $1.053 trillion to U.S. gross domestic product
    (GDP) in 2017.6 At the same time, United State’s farms contributed $132.8 billion
    of this sum which is almost 1 percent of GDP. Agriculture contributed 1.2 % to
    the European Union’s (EU) GDP in 2017 whereas EU’s agricultural industry added
    gross value of EUR 188.5 billion in 20177 at a record high. Out of 226 countries,
    nine countries have agriculture sector as the dominant sector in their economy.
    The U.S. food and agriculture system has a total economic impact of $7.06 trillion8
    and one-fourth of the overall jobs in the country are connected to it. Most countries
    globally export agricultural products. As a result, cyber vulnerabilities can
    have a significant impact on global food security. A sophisticated agro-terrorism
    attack on a (large) exporting country like the U.S. could harm the health of millions
    of consumers world-wide. In addition, attacks could reduce confidence on domestic
    consumption and destroy the United State’s status as a trusted food exporter.
    A report released in 2018 by the Council of Economic Advisors,9 “The Cost of Malicious
    Cyber Activity to the U.S. Economy” suggests the agriculture sector as one of
    the 16 critical infrastructure sectors that are important to both the U.S. economy
    and national security for which cyber protection is particularly important. It
    also reported that the agriculture sector experienced 11 cyber incidents in 2016.
    According to the World Health Organization,10 420,000 people die every year from
    food-related illnesses and 600 million people fall ill as a result of food contaminated
    with bacteria, viruses, toxins or chemicals. A cyber attack on the food ecosystem
    targeted at farms, transportation system, or food processing industrial control
    systems (ICSs) may increase these numbers exponentially. Other important industries
    like energy, financial or healthcare have understood the need for resilient infrastructure
    and have hardened their defenses. However, the food and agriculture industry is
    still a low hanging fruit for threat actors. Food Protection and Defense Institute
    (FPDI) at the University of Minnesota has discovered that food industry ICSs may
    be distinctly vulnerable to cyberattacks.11 Food industry operations technology
    personnel, in particular, those responsible for operating and maintaining ICSs,
    are experts trained in food and production safety production and not in cybersecurity.
    This presents a huge gap between employing smart farm technology and securing
    it correctly and persistently. If not continuously monitored, cyber attacks on
    smart agriculture technologies can have grave implications on several stakeholders
    in the ecosystem. These groups include farmers, end consumers, food processing
    industries, agriculture co-operatives, livestock, government agencies and nations
    critically dependent on agriculture. Figure 1, shows an end to end interaction
    among various entities involved in smart farming ecosystem. Physical sensors and
    livestock in the field generate data and receive command operations via user applications.
    These on-farm devices are connected to gateway supported edge nodes, which help
    enable in-farm device communication, filter sensor data and real time agronomy
    analytics. At the same time, data lakes in the cloud hold a large amount of data
    and information including but not limited to, environmental information (e.g.
    soil moisture level and fertility status), monitoring information (e.g. sensors
    and smart machinery status), energy management data, and other sensitive information.
    In terms of security and data privacy, it is needless to say that manipulation
    and leakage of such data, as well as the impairment of physical equipment and
    software systems, can induce serious consequences. FIGURE 1. A model of end-to-end
    interaction between various stakeholders in smart farming. Show All Extensive
    research on secure IoT devices [13]–[15], smart vehicles [16]–[19], drones [20],
    [21], edge cloud [22]–[24], wireless communication [25]–[27] is already available
    and might be extended to the smart farming ecosystem. However, most of the time,
    research is conducted on these technologies without consideration of the environment
    they are used. The dynamic smart farming environment, has unique characteristics
    such as farm equipment, labor sharing, and operational decisions, influenced by
    environmental conditions. Domain specific issues such as like location, user skill
    set, insider threats, generated data, need smart-farming-specific security mechanisms.
    The development of smart farm technologies therefore, demands further research
    before wide adoption in the community. The current state of the art and our review
    (discussed in Section V) on smart farming, demands further research in security
    and privacy aspects of this evolving domain. As the research, on cybersecurity
    for smart farming is in its infancy, our objective in this review is to provide
    a holistic view of cybersecurity developments in smart farming. In this paper,
    we discuss current threats, analyze potential cybersecurity attacks, review the
    existing scattered security research, and summarize open research challenges in
    the smart farming field as illustrated in Figure 2. FIGURE 2. A roadmap of cybersecurity
    research and challenges in smart farming. Show All This paper has the following
    key contributions: It provides an overview of smart farming focused multi-layered
    architecture, highlighting multiple entry points and communication across layers.
    It identifies potential cybersecurity issues in smart farming and illustrates,
    scenario specific cyber attacks, which have been categorized into data, network,
    supply chain, and other common attacks. It presents an extensive evaluation of
    the current cybersecurity research, countermeasures in smart farming, and also
    enlists the focus, contributions and weaknesses of current research works. It
    provides a clear view of the open security research challenges in different areas
    including next generation network security, trustworthy supply chain and compliance,
    adversarial machine learning and AI, and access control, trust and information
    sharing. The remainder of this paper is as follows. Multi-layered architecture
    for smart farming is discussed in Section II. Section III elaborates security
    and privacy issues, whereas Section IV discusses different attacks on the smart
    farming ecosystem including the supply chain side. Existing research and state
    of the art in smart farming security is discussed in Section V. Section VI highlights
    open research challenges and possible approaches to solutions. Finally, Section
    VII draws conclusion to this research paper. SECTION II. Smart Farming Landscape
    & Architecture Figure 3, depicts a multi layer architecture for the smart farming
    ecosystem. The proposed architecture adapts and extends widely discussed IoT and
    Cyber Physical System (CPS) multi-layer architectures [28]–[31]. These architectures
    recognize the use of cloud and edge services, and the infinite capabilities provided
    by them to fully harness the data generated from smart devices at the physical
    layer [32]–[37]. Our smart farming architecture, also reflects different user
    applications which can be envisioned at various layers. It also considers, vast
    amounts of data collected at edge or cloud layers, and highlights the need for
    various multi-cloud or edge-cloud scenarios. Overall the architecture consists
    of four layers: Physical layer, Edge layer, Cloud layer, and Network Communication
    layer. The latter spans across all three previous layers and connect them. FIGURE
    3. Multi layer smart farming architecture. Show All A. Physical Layer The bottom
    layer in the architecture comprises of real physical sensors and gateway devices
    which are spread across agriculture farms or in greenhouse buildings. These devices
    include drones flying in the air, autonomous tractors, sensors embedded in livestock,
    or hub devices installed to provide communication among smart objects or with
    a central cloud. These devices are responsible for data sensing and based on the
    information gathered, help in actuating other devices to realise various smart
    farming use cases. They collect real time information about weather conditions,
    soil moisture level, or cattle’s body temperature, which can be sent to the edge
    or cloud supported intelligent decision making systems to provide recommendations
    and enable automation. For example, data gathered from soil moisture sensing device
    in the field, after getting processed in the edge or cloud, can help in determining
    the amount of water needed at the farm, optimize irrigation schedule and offers
    a convenient experience to the end farmers. B. Edge Layer This layer is near to
    the end-users and end-devices for local real-time computations and decisions.
    It reduces the computation load off the centralized cloud layer and also the network
    load. Edge computing layer consists of multiple edge nodes. Each node represents
    a gateway that include services such as: data capturing, security monitoring and
    detection, prediction and real-time decision support. Data capturing services
    include, data aggregation, filtering, encrypting and encoding of real-time data
    streams. Prediction services usually rely on machine learning models trained on
    the central cloud and deployed on the edge layer. They are used to predict and/or
    categorize certain events related to plant or livestock such as, prediction of
    crop yield, categorization of plants or livestock health, predictions about the
    amount of fertilizer and water needed for a patch of land, so as to maximize yield,
    or estimating soil erosion. Security monitoring and detection mechanisms can be
    deployed for real-time monitoring of anomalous events and classifying these events
    as malicious or benign. This includes services like, anomaly detection and device
    failures prediction. C. Cloud Layer Precision Agriculture (PA) and cloud computing
    paradigms offer advances to enhance PA connectivity. The cloud layer is generally
    virtualized in data centers and communicates with the other layers using the Internet.
    Generally, these cloud layer platforms follow the Platform as a Service (PaaS)
    architecture model where the users can focus on running applications and importing
    their data. The PaaS provider runs and maintains a data broker that collects data
    being pushed in from the edge layer and saves these records in a Distributed File
    System (DFS). This stored data is used by analytic software to mine knowledge.
    This data analytics component computes insights and these are pushed to the end
    user through a client application running on the users’ machine. Popular farm
    equipment manufacturers like, John Deere,12 Farmers Business Network,13 etc. have
    created several cloud based products that help users monitor various sensors and
    vehicles used on a farm. These PaaS systems generally run on popular cloud computing
    platforms like Amazon Web Services,14 Google Cloud,15 etc. The way these farming
    PaaS systems are built using these popular cloud computing platforms also introduce
    various security challenges in smart farming ecosystem. D. Network Communication
    Layer The common theme for most, if not all, current technologies is “connectivity”.
    With a growing need for a boundary-less Internet, the idea of a network of smart
    devices has become a reality. This concept, known as the Internet of Things (IoT),
    allows connected devices to be monitored, controlled, and shared data among each
    other. This data can be analyzed and used by multiple applications. In smart farming,
    as shown in Figure 3, the network layer not only facilitates edge and physical
    layer connectivity, but also provides an interface for them to interact with the
    cloud layer. From exchanging soil temperature through a peer-to-peer sensor communication
    system, to sending farm monitoring data to the cloud data stores through high
    speed mobile networks such as 5G [38], or updating the farmer about corp quality
    via a wireless adhoc topology [39], network layer offers a means of communication
    to bind all other layers. Network layer has two main responsibilities in a smart
    farming system. Firstly, there are diverse set of heterogeneous devices in every
    layers of a smart farming system. The network layer provides a secure and efficient
    network stack where, wire, wireless and mobile sub-networks can communicate in
    a compatible and cross-layer manner. The second responsibility of the layer is
    to preserve connectivity and therefore, increase availability. From bigdata processing
    systems used to analyze collected data to individual sensors that collect information
    from the field, this layer is needed for system-wide cyber communication. Real
    World Smart Farming Use Cases: The proposed smart farming architecture is constructed
    based on multiple literature and real world smart farming use cases. It can be
    viewed as a general smart farming architecture that satisfies most of the use
    cases. However, it should be noted that not all use cases will include all four
    layers as proposed in the architecture. Blackhills Farm in New Zealand, a 400-hectare
    property with over 2000 cattle and 800 sheep, has adopted the use of SCADAfarm16
    system which allows the owners to remotely monitor water and energy consumption,
    location of irrigators, soil moisture measurements and real-time weather information.
    The farm uses Schneider Electrics’s EcoStuxture IoT architecture17 which corresponds
    to our physical layer and sensors. It also utilizes Microsoft Azure18 IoT suite
    with communication provided by the Vodafone New Zealand cellular network which
    corresponds to the cloud and network layer in out framework. Similarly, a 7,000-acre
    farm at Beltsville Area Research Center, was developed by the United States Department
    of Agriculture (USDA) to act as a testbed for smart farming technologies. The
    farm was equipped with a physical layer including sensors, drones and IoT-enabled
    farm equipment for a public-private program called Farmbeats [5]. The farm adopts
    a two-layer hybrid network: a layer based on TV White Spaces [40] technology for
    connectivity over long range which connects the farmer’s home Internet connection
    to IoT base stations on the farm, and a layer based on Wi-Fi technology which
    connects smart sensors to the IoT base stations. Such IoT base stations (gateways)
    are equivalent to the edge cloud layer (Figure 3) in our proposed general architecture.
    Additionally, the data collected at the IoT stations are pushed to the cloud layer
    which employs AI algorithms for data analysis. Another usecase is a revolutionary
    step towards smart crop health monitoring. A group of researchers19 along with
    local farmers are developing a distributed airborne monitoring system to detect
    possible zones of crop damage or nutrient deficiency at a 492-acre farm in in
    North Carolina, United States. In order to accommodate rapidly-growing food demands
    and increase the quality and quantity of agricultural production, it is necessary
    to improve farming management practices and technological developments in agricultural
    fields. Accordingly, unlike traditional crop management methods that use farmers
    or ground vehicles for assessing crop health status, this collaborative smart
    farming project is using autonomous technology to perform aerial monitoring of
    agricultural fields to save time and money, while preventing damage to crops.
    In this project, a group of drones which monitor the field are working in the
    physical layer, as depicted in Figure 3. Drones communicate with each other through
    network layer, using which they also send collected data and images to land processing
    bases (i.e. the edge layer in our proposed architecture) for initial data cleaning
    and pre-processing. Finally, pre-processed data is sent to the cloud layer for
    storing and knowledge extraction functionalities. SECTION III. Security & Privacy
    Issues The adoption of sensor based technologies and cloud supported smart applications
    in agriculture has unleashed opportunities for adversaries to orchestrate cyber
    attacks. Therefore, it is important to first understand major security and privacy
    issues in smart farming domain before discussing specific cyber attacks. In this
    section, we will elaborate these issues in detail followed by attacks in the following
    section. A. Data Security & Privacy In a smart farm, an enormous amount of complex,
    dynamic and spatial data gets generated from many heterogeneous sensors, devices
    and equipment. Leakage of such information either through unauthorized access
    or by an insider can cause potential threats. For example, leakage of agriculture
    anti-jamming devices information can help an attacker bypass these security measures,
    while leakage of soil, crop, and agriculture purchase information can cause severe
    economic losses to farmers, if such information is used by competitors or hostile
    actors. On a larger scale, aggregating important agricultural information on a
    particular country is also a potential threat. As such data security and privacy
    is a very important requirement and one of the primary objectives to ensure the
    reliable operation in a smart farming ecosystem. Data on the Edge: Smart farms
    leverage Internet of Things (IoT), state-of-the-art communications (e.g., 5G),
    and artificial intelligence. Such systems mostly require fast response times,
    than those of a traditional model in which data is transmitted to a centralized
    data center (e.g., cloud) for processing and results are returned to a user. As
    such, the need of edge cloud is on the rise. Although moving data processing and
    analytics to the edge enhances agility and efficiency, to say the least, it also
    imposes huge security risks due to the increased attack surface primarily because
    of the highly diverse use of IoT devices which are usually not built with security
    in mind. This gives attackers an easy entry point to the network since remote
    access to the edge layer, in most cases, is essential. Additionally, finding the
    IP addresses of edge endpoints become an easy task especially when considering
    websites like Shodan,20 a search engine for all IoT connected devices. Beside
    directly compromising IoT devices or edge endpoints to gain access to the smart
    farm network, an indirect attack to compromise third parties is also a potential
    risk. As an example, smart farms often use third party agronomy analytics to analyze
    the collected data which can be used in many research areas such as plant biology
    and genetics, agriculture economy, supply forecasts, and disease predictions.
    Those parties might be given direct access to smart farm data on the edge for
    real-time analytics. An attacker might phish for such third parties, compromise
    their systems and inject malicious software to redirect the data sent to external
    servers for data theft. Such attacks are very hard to detect, since attackers
    are using legitimate stolen third party credentials. B. Authorization & Trust
    In smart farming applications, connected entities including autonomous tractors,
    flying drones, on field sensors etc. communicate and interact with each other,
    and issue command and control operations to provide automated and efficient experience.
    Such communication can be direct machine to machine or via a cloud or edge assisted
    network which can support Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT21), Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP22) or other IoT communication protocols. In either
    case, it is essential to ensure that the messages are sent from a trusted authorized
    entity, rather from a malicious adversary. This exchange of information, like
    moisture level of soil, information about crop yield, cost of fertilizer, or sensitive
    data about the livestock like health, current location, breeding decision information
    and other farm related private data sent to the cloud or to a third-party application
    must be authorized by the owner of the field or a concerned party. Livestock are
    important part of agriculture, and a big component of a farmer’s income. Sensors
    can be embedded in the cattle [41]–[43] which can monitor their health and can
    be used to remotely inject medicines or enable preventive actions from a doctor.
    Even in case of livestock purchase, buyer can be given temporary access to the
    data of an animal they are interested in, which can help them analyse it before
    purchase. As these animals are kept in monitored environments, remotely controlling
    the temperature or making adverse conditions in barn can affect the yield of animals,
    and can also result in epidemics and widespread disease. Over the air (OTA) updates
    for the equipment’s firmware must be from a trusted party, a bad software patch
    received for a critical agriculture equipment can curtail a farmer from using
    it at the needed time of harvesting and planting. Cross cloud and multi cloud
    trust models [44], [45] are needed when entities associated at different cloud
    providers interact and access data remotely. In case of a mechanic trying to diagnose
    an engine of an autonomous tractor, or a doctor trying to access data of a cattle
    located in a private cloud, trust levels need to be established so as to enable
    such access. Several access control models have been proposed for IoT [46]–[58]
    like systems, however their feasability in dynamic smart farming is still to be
    investigated. Proper authorization is needed for a farmer to issue a command,
    to a smart water sprinkler, or to fetch the latest readings from a soil moisture
    sensor. Farm rivalry can exploit such connectivity to the sensors, and may flood
    a farmer’s field, or make it parched. Usually in farms, labor is hired on a temporary
    basis mostly at the time of harvesting and sowing, therefore, temporary access
    to smart equipment can be delegated to on field workers for non-critical operations.
    It may be the case that a critical operation, like running an autonomous tractor
    on the field, or flying a drone over the field to spray pesticides may need multi
    level authorization. C. Authentication & Secure Communication One of the most
    important aspects of security and privacy in smart farming is authentication of
    connected devices. Devices need to be authenticated first in order to get connected
    to various services on a smart farming system. They are usually low power devices,
    with limited processing power, memory, and storage, so legacy public-key infrastructure
    (PKI) authentication mechanisms cannot be considered as feasible solutions. Alternatively,
    secure lightweight multi-factor authentication protocols which are offered as
    a service [13], [59] are more realistic solutions in a smart farming network environment.
    In fact, an intermediary Certifying Authority (CA) can facilitate the authentication
    of a connecting device [60]. Such authentication mechanisms do not consume devices’
    limited resources for authentication processing, but also unauthorized devices
    will be prevented from connecting and accessing the network in an efficient way
    [61]. Moreover, devices may sometime join or leave different layers of a smart
    farming ecosystem. This entails dynamic authenticated mechanisms that apply authentication
    on demand to ensure that only legitimate devices are allowed to have access to
    different services spanning over different layers. Providing end to end secure
    communication in a smart farming setting requires securing the communication between
    devices in a particular layer and also securing the inter-layer communication
    [62]. While cryptography-based solutions prove their effectiveness in securing
    both intra-layer and inter-layer communications, employing them on constrained
    IoT devices is a big concern. There are, however, limited attempts to apply lightweight
    cryptography solutions to a smart farming ecosystem [14]. Additionally, quantum-based
    cryptography for a secure end to end communication for IoT devices is under active
    investigation [63] as a futuristic solution. However, the feasibility of such
    solutions have not been evaluated in real world scenarios. D. Compliance and Regulations
    Smart farming and precision agriculture raises various legal issues, which remain
    partially unanswered. The following are some of the major issues in this area.
    1) Contracts and Agreements A smart farm involves different parties like the farmers,
    the cloud service providers, the networking infrastructure providers, to name
    a few (See Section II). These different parties need to negotiate and agree on
    various parts of contracts [12], [64]. These contracts include data privacy, security
    and intellectual property protection clauses. Data protection is essential for
    the development of smart farms and is a major part of these contracts. Such contracts
    between interested parties are crucial to protect the value and confidentiality
    of the data as an important asset. Farmers who use smart farming tools also need
    to negotiate in advance finer elements of these contracts. For example, which
    party shall be responsible in case data processing and analysis lead to wrong
    decisions affecting different downstream tasks in the pipeline. Another important
    contractual element example is the decision involving use of self-driving tractors,
    which are subject to the set of obligations applicable to self-driving cars. In
    this scenario, strong compensation and limitation of liability clauses may help
    the farmers. 2) Data Security and Privacy Farmers who deploy smart infrastructure
    fear that their data might be stolen by competitors or be publicly released. Hence,
    data security is crucial and agreements with technology providers should include
    specific clauses. Although most smart farming techniques process non-personal
    data, linking of such information to a particular personally identifiable information
    (PII) poses serious concerns [12], [64]. For example, data of livestock directly
    referring to their owner; crops conditions linked to farmers’ personal details.
    In this case, privacy clauses should be included to prohibit personal data processing
    to a certain degree. Further issues may arise when smart farming equipment, such
    as drones or tractors, have the functionality to monitor their users [12], [64].
    3) Intellectual Property (IP) An important question from a compliance perspective
    is who owns the data collected on a smart farm. This is specially important as
    data privacy laws cannot solve this issue. As per the current regulatory setup,
    data itself cannot be protected, however copyright provisions can be utilized
    to achieve high level of safeguards. Most farmers include IP protection clauses
    [64] in contracts that they create with smart farming technology providers [12].
    4) Regulatory Agriculture and livestock production is a highly regulated industry.
    Various countries across the globe have many laws, regulations, and supervisory
    authorities [65]–[67]. These touch upon specific compliance requirements for producing
    and selling of products. Such compliance can be achieved easier by using smart
    farming technology that help farmers and regulators track, audit, and inspect
    every step of the production pipeline. 5) Cyber Insurance Cyber Insurance allows
    victims to protect themselves from various cyber risks. However, cyber insurance
    policies in agriculture have lagged in the coverage of cyber incidents and events.
    Most of the current available agriculture based cyber insurances are very ambiguous
    and limited in their coverage [64]. SECTION IV. Smart Farming Ecosystem Cyber
    Attacks This section elaborates possible cyber attacks in smart farming ecosystem.
    We have categorized attacks into four different classes as shown in Figure 4.
    We have discussed data specific and network specific attacks orchestrated on smart
    farms including IoT based farming sensors. We have also explored cyber attacks
    from the supply chain side to highlight the vulnerabilities as more and more systems
    get connected to the internet and generating sensitive data. FIGURE 4. Smart farming
    ecosystem cyber attacks. Show All A. Data Attacks 1) Insider Data Leakage Farmers
    fear leakage of confidential data the most among other threats as it can be used
    against them in the commodity market. An insider (like a disgruntled employee)
    can leak such data to intentionally cause harm or sell data for money. For example,
    a former engineer at Allen and Hoshall was able to access the company’s data over
    a period of two years.23 Data this employee accessed included engineering schematic,
    project proposals, and marketing information which had an estimated value of $500,000.
    2) Cloud Data Leakage Smart farming data is very sensitive and can reveal a lot
    of confidential agriculture and economic information about the entire country.
    Cloud data centers are distributed across the world and, in some instances, virtual
    machines might be placed in data centers located in different countries. Data
    might be less secure if it is stored in data centers in other countries. These
    countries could place less strict security requirements on companies. Additionally,
    their governments might also intercept or collect that data stored on servers
    within their own jurisdictions. For these reasons, countries have started adding
    laws for sensitive data localization. For instance, China has placed a new cybersecurity
    law24 into effect in 2017 stating, among other things, that personal data must
    be stored on domestic servers. As such, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon
    started taking steps to transfer control of Chinese data to Chinese firms. 3)
    False Data Injection Attack In this attack, an attacker attempts to change/falsify
    data that contributes to important real-time decisions, with the assumption that
    adversary has the knowledge of the system and its configuration. For example,
    injecting false information about the soil moisture level will result in over
    watering and, in turn, damaging the crops. 4) Misinformation Attack In this attack,
    the aim is to endanger data integrity. An attacker may release false data about
    a smart farm claiming the outbreak of a disease in crops or livestock. Such false
    data reports mimic the form of an actual report released by the targeted smart
    farm. As a result, it will take a lot of time, effort and money to prove that
    the released report is false. B. Networking and Equipment Attacks 1) Radio Frequency
    (FR) Jamming Attack In many cases, smart farming equipment rely on radio frequency
    communication, like cellular or satellite networks. A smart farming equipment
    often use global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) to improve efficiency with
    products and techniques such as path planning, auto steering, seeding and spray
    rates. GNSS is achieved by combining GPS with real time kinematics (RTK) technology
    to enhance the precision of real-time position data. Attackers may jam GNSS for
    malicious purpose by deploying many distributed low power jammers to disrupt GNSS
    over wide areas and, in turn, prevent smart farming equipment from functioning
    properly. 2) Malware Injection Attack One of the most prevalent threats to smart
    farming is malware injection attack [68], where an attacker injects a malware
    into a connected smart device. Malware is a very common threat in large scale
    systems since, in most cases, it acts and propagates through the system automatically,
    hence making it a very attractive target to attackers. Precision agriculture is
    being adopted widely, meaning that more farms are connected to the internet. Typically,
    most of these farm deployments use similar software components (e.g., usage of
    LoRa25 and ZigBee26). As a result, a malware that infects a particular smart farm
    will most likely infect other farms with similar deployments. The damage caused
    by malware comes in many shapes and types. Malware can steal information about
    the consumption of agricultural materials, purchase information of fruits, vegetables
    and livestock, data about agricultural machinery etc. It can also recruit smart
    devices as part of a botnet which will be used for committing malicious acts controlled
    by an attacker. Further, malware can hinder the functions of physical smart equipment
    which, in turn, can have a devastating effect on a particular crop harvest or
    farm area. 3) Denial of Service Attack IoT devices used in smart farming environments
    can always be used to launch large scale denial of service (DoS) attacks [69]
    similar to what happened in 2016 using Mirai botnet [70]. In that occasion, an
    army of dummy CCTVs was exploited to launch one of the biggest DoS attacks that
    happened recently. There are usually a large number of inter-connected nodes and
    groups in a farm, and thus, similar type of attacks are possible in context of
    smart farming. These attacks not only can disrupt normal functions of different
    modules in an individual farm but also can be leveraged to interrupt legitimate
    cyber services in other domains. 4) Botnet With IoT everything is capable of getting
    connected to the internet. In smart farming ecosystem, there are many IoT related
    devices at each architectural layer. These devices are prone to attacks and can
    then be controlled by a central malicious system. This forms a so called ‘Botnet
    of Things’ [71]. A zombie army of infected farm IoT devices [72] can easily be
    used to infect many other networks through different mediums and hence a smart
    farm may turn out to be an internet of vulnerabilities for cyber criminals. Smart
    farm devices are not built with security as a concern and even if they do, users
    usually neglect the basic steps of setting adequate cybersecurity defense mechanisms.
    5) Side Channel Attack Attacks which have their roots in gaining information from
    how a system is implemented rather than what weakness exists in the system implementation
    are called side channel attacks. Smart farming is one of the IoT use case and
    hence it inherits some common IoT vulnerabilities including side channel attacks
    [73]. In such attacks, there are different channels which can be exploited by
    attackers. In timing channel attacks, for example, computation time along with
    cache miss and cache hit timing patterns are among those attacks vectors which
    can be exploited by adversaries. Hardware glitching in forms of voltage fluctuations
    and variances in system clock period during execution tasks are other possible
    attack channels. Other channels for launching a successful attack are power consumption
    patterns, possible electromagnetic leaks or even sound and acoustic channels.
    C. Supply Chain Attacks The entire agriculture ecosystem and the notion of ‘farm
    to plate’ involves several entities which work in tandem to provide quality food
    to the end consumer in a just-in time environment. This supply chain system [74]
    starts from the farm, which produces raw material that, in turn, is stored and
    processed by the food industry. The processed food is packed and sent to distribution
    retailer from where the end customer purchases processed goods. With IoT technology
    at each stage of the supply chain, it introduces potential cybersecurity threats
    since a security breach in just-in-time distribution system could also have a
    serious cascading effects on the entire supply chain. The massive scale of attacks
    like WannaCry27 ransomware, and the recent spate of ransomwares in cities28 across
    the US, suggest that even a breach or data freeze at a single inter-dependent
    entity will be enough to disrupt the whole chain and possibly the economy of a
    country. An attack on the agriculture equipment and fertilizer provider companies
    could potentially disable critical connected machinery needed at a prime time.
    It could manipulate the amount of nutrients in the fertilizers [64] which could
    seriously destroy the crops rather than nourishing them. The smart devices can
    be infected by malware which are controlled and commanded remotely. In such a
    scenario, large scale attacks can be orchestrated on all the smart farms utilizing
    those compromised machinery resulting in massive disruption in the sector. Needless
    to say that the suppliers of such machinery might loose trust and confidence of
    their customers. Such smart machinery needs dynamic calibration to determine the
    distance at which seeds need to be planted or the amount of fertilizers to be
    sprayed based on historical crop data. This calibration related information is
    uploaded in the machine software over-the-air (OTA), which suggests that deliberate
    uploading of false information to the machine software can have larger scale impact.
    US Foods29 has more than 250,000 customers which purchase supplies, will be affected
    badly if US Foods IT infrastructure is hit by a ransomware or a cyber attack disrupting
    its computer assisted facility and impacting critical processes. Temperature and
    conditions under which the produce is transferred is an important factor to maintain
    the freshness of the product. Smart monitors ensure that products are processed
    and packed at appropriate temperatures. Adversaries can manipulate these sensor
    readings or issue a command to change the temperature that could result in inappropriate
    temperature conditions for produce, which can impact the end consumers as well
    as the entire supply chain. These attacks are not limited to direct stakeholders,
    but for example, contaminated water from a compromised water treatment facility
    used in irrigation can destroy the whole crop field. Even attacks on smart grid
    due to sudden surge in demand and grid overloading can result in blackout which
    in-turn can spoil the stored produce in large storage houses, inducing huge losses
    to the supplier. Blockchain30 based solutions have been proposed to ensure the
    provenance of the food products in the chain, which offers transparency and assure
    quality of the food. However, the entire cost to use this system will not be clear
    unless widely adopted [75]. Smart farming goes beyond agriculture where livestock
    sector is also considered an important part. An attack on this sector can also
    have massive disruptions, where a malicious actor can publish false data about
    a disease outbreaks or unapproved genetic modifications of crops. Similarly, sensors
    and smart devices in the buildings where these livestock are kept can be attacked
    or altered to change the temperature, which can put to harm the entire livestock
    on the farm. Also, for livestock feed products, if an IT system monitoring the
    ingredients of the feed is compromised, it can potentially lead to wide-spread
    contamination in livestock which can easily reach humans as well. D. Other Relevant
    Attacks 1) Compliance and Regulation Food production and farming are a highly
    regulated industry with different countries having multiple national agencies
    monitoring food production. In the United States, Environment Protection Agency
    [65] and the Department of Agriculture [66] enforce various regulations and industry
    standards. In the European Union, Department of Agriculture and Rural Development
    [67] undertakes this responsibility with similar authorities in other countries.
    These federal authorities issue compliance directives to ensure quality food production.
    With the advent of smart farming technology these agencies are relying more and
    more on data produced by farm based sensors. An adversary attacking a smart farm
    can specifically inject false data that will then impact various compliance certification
    processes. This certification process if invalidated, can impact a nation’s food
    supply, affect crop price, etc. The complex smart farming ecosystem, creates a
    broad attack surface that needs to be protected to ensure data integrity. 2) Cyber
    Terrorism The increased use of digital interconnected system in agriculture sector
    brings new opportunities for terrorists to attack places that previously were
    too remote or difficult to strike. Cyber terrorism is a relatively low-cost venture
    with high payoff potential, making the risks of agro-terrorism too large to ignore.
    Therefore, it is important to find solutions that guarantee trust and transparency
    within smart farming concept, as well as protect critical resources. 3) Cloud
    Computing Attacks Cloud is a very diverse, decentralized, heterogeneous and powerful
    ecosystem. The enormous amount of distributed resources make the cloud a hard
    target. However, with the introduction of new cloud concepts (e.g., on-demand
    services, auto-scaling, and self provisioning), attackers have used such resources
    in their favor and, in turn, cloud has become one of the most desirable targets
    to attacker. For example, with the introduction of auto-scaling in cloud, a large
    part of the virtual machines hosted on cloud are similarly configured. If one
    of the virtual machines is vulnerable, it is highly likely that all auto-scaled
    virtual machines are vulnerable as well. As such, a malware that infected one
    virtual machine can propagate to other virtual machines quickly. The infected
    machines can be employed as a part of global botnets which, consequently, can
    be used to launch a large scale distribute DoS (DDoS) attacks enough to hinder
    the functionality of cloud. For example, in 2018, a large scale DDoS attack was
    launched on github resulting in a record-breaking sudden traffic increase to 1.35
    terabits per second. Inevitably, DDoS attacks are becoming more frequent, more
    powerful and more sophisticated. A large scale DDoS attack with an overwhelming
    number of requests, packets or messages can deny services to smart farms, thereby
    paralyzing the brain of smart farms. Further, DDoS attacks might not be specifically
    targeting smart farms’ virtual machines. Even though, an attack might be directed
    at a different target, if virtual machines used by smart farms are on the save
    physical server, it will naturally block off other’s traffic as well. SECTION
    V. Existing Research Table 1 summarizes state-of-the-art research, challenges
    and contributions with respect to security and privacy issues in smart farming.
    We have categorized the literature into different subsections based on the focus
    areas they address. TABLE 1 Projects and Research Addressing Cybersecurity in
    Smart Farming A. Cyber Attacks, Threats and Proposed Solutions Researchers and
    federal agencies have started gauging the impact cyber-attacks as more and more
    farmers and communities are adopting technologies in the farms. The U.S. Department
    for Homeland Security released a report [12] which emphasizes the importance of
    precision agriculture (PA) and associated cybersecurity threat and potential vulnerabilities.
    The report highlights the confidentiality, integrity, and availability model of
    information security in farming. It defines different technologies involved in
    PA including in-farm devices, location and remote sensing technologies, machine
    learning, etc. It briefly discusses the impacted groups by the misuse of technologies
    in farming including farmers, livestock producers, and also industries that support
    or rely on agriculture. This report also discusses hypothetical threat scenarios
    on real life examples. Another promising work [76] highlights the vulnerabilities
    and risks due to introduction of technologies in the field of precision agriculture.
    This thesis work illustrates data collection and related empirical study, however
    falls short of security solutions in the domain. The work from Jahn [64] discuss
    implications of using smart devices in the agriculture sector. The authors make
    strong argument about how the lack of a cyber insurance framework is going to
    have a big impact on various agribusinesses. They also highlight the fact that
    a regulatory response is needed to protect the interests of farmers who adopt
    the use of smart devices. Barreto and Amaral [77] use empirical methodology based
    on the analysis of information and experiences collected in the Internet Security
    Alliance,31 the European Cyber Security Organization32 and the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology33 to highlight security challenges in smart farming.
    Some major threats discussed include security and privacy issues, social engineering,
    denial of service, cyber-espionage agroterrorism, ransomware etc. The research
    also highlights a security framework to enable farmers to better understand security
    implications. However, the paper is unable to discuss open research issues, and
    challenges to secure the environment without evidence of how the discussed attacks
    are orchestrated in the domain. Peer to Peer (P2P) is a network paradigm which
    has use cases in smart farming communication. The device authentication methods
    in this type of communication, however, rely heavily on public key infrastructure.
    Although the system is trustworthy, it puts unnecessary computation load on resource
    constrained smart farm IoT devices participating in a secure P2P communication.
    Accordingly, authors in [78] proposed a lightweight device authentication solution
    in which session keys and public keys are combined to expedite the encryption/decryption
    tasks. It results in a fast and light-weight authentication solution which is
    a good fit for smart farming communication purposes. Additionally, West [79] introduced
    a framework to understand vulnerabilities in emerging technologies and the use
    of such technologies in a smart-farming-specific environment. The framework goal
    is to quantify the degree to which the use of smart farming new technologies are
    vulnerable to cyber-attacks. It uses the common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS)
    for the threat prediction model assessment. The work shows the trade-offs between
    technology maturity and adaptation in the smart farming environment which can
    lead to system compromise. The approach in the paper uses three parameters: basic
    parameters, temporal parameters and environmental parameters for constructing
    a CVSS score. Basic parameters indicate the intrinsic and severity of a vulnerability,
    whereas temporal parameters indicate how a vulnerability might change and affect
    the system over time due to technical changes. Environmental parameters reflect
    the specifications of a vulnerability present in a smart-farming-specific environment.
    Although CVSS score has become a standard in the industry for understanding the
    severity of vulnerabilities and prioritizing their patches, it has some shortcomings.
    Smart farming is a diverse environment with many connected devices and systems.
    CVSS score deals with individual vulnerabilities and fails to accurately capture
    impact of connections within the entire system. B. Blockchain Related Research
    Recently, the usefulness of blockchain in domains other than cryptocurrency and
    financial transactions has been acknowledged [93]–[95]. Agriculture and food supply
    chain is one of the domains in which blockchain technology has shown its capabilities.
    Accordingly, the authors in [81] study overall implications, challenges and potential
    of existing blockchain-based projects in the field. Besides, it critically reviews
    maturity of such projects and elaborates on possible barriers and challenges,
    which hinder acceptability of such projects among farmers and existing cyber farming
    systems. Lin et al. [80] also focused on the use of blockchain technology for
    food safety. Authors created a system that tracks and monitors food production
    cycle, including the processes of raw materials, cultivation/breeding, processing,
    transporting, warehousing, and selling. The system also uses various IoT based
    sensors to replace manual recording and verification with sensor based verification.
    Other works [82], [84], [96] focused on providing case studies of using blockchain
    and smart contracts in smart farming. Awan et al. [82] proposed a framework based
    on IoT and blockchain technology for agriculture product tracking life cycle.
    They used smart contracts to eliminate the involvement of middlemen or third-party
    intermediaries and as such increase credibility and trust. The authors implemented
    a use case based on their proposed framework which included 120 IoT nodes and
    20 blockchain producers. Further, they validated their system based on it’s throughput
    considering different block sizes. However, this work has several drawbacks. Very
    few related works are included and comparison to other works in the literature
    is lacking. Additionally, the authors didn’t include much details about the nature
    of workload used in their experiments and they failed to add a baseline benchmark
    for the validation results for a fair comparison. Patil et al. [84] proposed a
    light-weight security framework for smart greenhouse farms based on blockchain.
    Every IoT node can elect cluster head leader which helps preventing a single point
    of failure in case an attacker targets the leader node. Additionally, the authors
    provided discussion of the security threats on their proposed framework following
    the traditional confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA) triad model
    as well as their corresponding attacks. Although, this work is interesting, the
    framework is conceptual with no implementation or experiments. Further, the paper
    didn’t include related work nor a comparison to other proposed frameworks. Besides
    proposing blockchain-based frameworks and implementations [97], real world use
    cases of blockchain in smart farming are discussed in the blockchain research
    institute article [83]. In this work, authors explore applications of blockchain
    beyond the typical financial use cases in agriculture. Accordingly, they focused
    on three classes of applications: food safety, sustainable agriculture and the
    local economy and agriculture finance. The authors accompanied each class of applications
    with real world use cases. However, these use cases are discussed on a very high
    level aspect with no implementation details or results. C. AI and Machine Learning
    Assisted Work The advent of new age technologies such as artificial intelligence
    (AI) and machine learning (ML) not only facilitate the adaptation of advanced
    analytics in smart farming, but also create an ecosystem for improving the cybersecurity
    of services. Fusion of these technologies enable farmers to achieve higher average
    yield and better price control over their products in highly competitive markets.
    Design and implementation of a low cost IoT based security monitoring system have
    been proposed by Shabadi and Biradar [85]. The system focuses on physical layer
    of smart farming where it collects data from sensors. This data is sent to a controller
    where data is analyzed to make decisions like activating the actuators for water
    sprinkler in the farms. The proposed work is focused more on implementing the
    basic functionalities of smart farming than addressing security and privacy issues.
    It is very limited to simple threshold based decisions, like, if the soil temperature
    is above a certain threshold, then activate water sprinkler. Real time security
    monitoring for a remote farm is another current application of ML in smart farming.
    In scenarios where real time monitoring and notifications are paramount to farm
    and cybersecurity, the image(s) detected through a surveillance system can be
    processed by open-source computer vision programming supported by AI. For example,
    Abuan et al. [86] proposed a neural based face recognition system which is able
    to be invariant to changes in illumination for background and illumination conditions
    through a neural network training. The agricultural and farming industries have
    been widely influenced by the disruption of the IoT. However, the impact of the
    IoT is limited in countries with less penetration of mobile internet. The boom
    of low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN) in the last decade, with technologies
    such as LoRa or NB-IoT, has mitigated this by providing a relatively cheap infrastructure
    that enables low-power and long-range transmissions. Nonetheless, the benefits
    that LPWAN technologies have the disadvantage of low-bandwidth transmissions.
    Therefore, the integration of edge and fog computing, moving data analytics and
    compression near end devices, is key in order to extend functionality. By integrating
    AI at the local network layer, referred as edge AI, authors in [87] proposed a
    system architecture and implementation that expands the possibilities of smart
    agriculture and farming applications with edge and fog computing using LPWAN technology
    for large area coverage. In another research work [88], Support Vector Machines
    (SVM) along with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are used to create an integration
    platform for big data analysis for smart farming. Such a platform not only expedites
    processing huge amounts of data collected from farms and livestocks, but also
    gives smart farming stakeholders the ability to detect and respond against possible
    cyber attacks more efficiently. D. Other Relevant Literature Chi et al. [89] present
    a framework for cybersecurity approaches in precision agriculture and discussed
    challenges of using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) in digital virtual farms. They
    also present a framework for secure data capture. Security challenges in agrifood
    sector has been extensively discussed in [90]. The report provides an overview
    of emerging technologies in smart farming. Most smart farms are data-driven with
    respect to automating agriculture processes, decision making, and predictions.
    It also raises important questions of how important is data security? How risk
    assessment is done considering the entire supply chain? Who should take responsibility
    and who should be involved? The report serves to raise awareness addressing the
    importance of cybersecurity in agrifood sector. Authors in [98] provide an overview
    of cross-section of cybersecurity in food and agriculture sectors. They also discuss
    cyber-terrorism, policies, and plans. Spaulding and Wolf [99] detail the needs
    for educating farmers about various cybersecurity threats. Authors in [100] show
    the impact of cyber attacks on smart farming infrastructure via simulations using
    NETA with OMNET++ framework. Huning et al. [101] created a system to enable privacy
    preserving crowd sourcing techniques to estimate different smart farming parameters.
    Cybersecurity perception is also changing among farmers and agribusiness owners.
    Geil et al. [91] conducted an assessment of cybersecurity practices in the United
    States agriculture industry. Insights from their work reflect that over half of
    the respondents have been victims of a computer security incident, demonstrating
    that even individuals working in agriculture can be impacted by cybersecurity
    incidents. Cyberbiosecurity [92] is a multidisciplinary domain consists of cybersecurity,
    bio-security, and cyber-physical security. It discusses how current and emerging
    information technologies affect the cybersecurity of large portion of U.S. economy
    which is based on food and agriculture (i.e. Bio-economy). As Peccoud et al. [102]
    discuss, food and agricultural sectors are immensely diverse and require advanced
    technologies and efficiencies that rely on computer technologies, big data, cloud-based
    data storage, and internet accessibility, at the same time are vulnerable to cybersecurity
    incidents. Based on our literature review, it can be emphasised that, there is
    a dearth of security related research done in smart farming domain. There are
    numerous unanswered important security questions and open research challenges
    as discussed in the following section. SECTION VI. Open Challenges and Research
    Areas This section discusses open research challenges for improving security and
    privacy in smart farming ecosystem, as well illustrated in Figure 5. These open
    problems have been divided into four subsections as follows. FIGURE 5. Open research
    challenges and future directions for cybersecurity in smart farming. Show All
    A. Access Control, Trust & Privacy Perspective The multi-layered architecture
    discussed in section II recognizes possibilities of cyber threat challenges, which
    needs to be addressed by extending and adapting current access control foundational
    research, as well as developing sophisticated access control solutions to assist
    dynamic and agile environments in cyber-physical systems like smart farms. In-farm
    and cross farm operations need authorized interaction among sensors and labor/farmers
    working at multiple farms operating different sets of smart devices. What kind
    of operations they can do must be checked, which may require single level or multiple
    level access control depending on the risk factor associated with the operation?
    For example, consider sowing the field with autonomous tractor as compared to
    turning ON an irrigation system during the rainy season. Delegation and revocation
    of access rights to operate on a farm must be automatically performed based on
    the contract agreement, for example, in case temporary labor hired during harvesting
    season. Such access control requirements need further investigation to be adopted
    in such dynamic environment. The notion of trust can also be developed where labor
    who has worked earlier or an equipment borrowed from a ‘known’ old friend may
    have higher trust level as compared to machine and manpower hired from co-operative
    market. Self-configurable AI assisted smart access control policies need to be
    developed in a sharing-dominated CPS domain like smart farming. Cyber physical
    systems introduce the notion of virtual objects (which can be created in cloud
    or edge environment) corresponding to real physical sensors. An important challenge
    here is the location of cyber entities created as a part of connection with cloud
    or edge environments, for example, AWS device shadows34 or Microsoft Azure device
    twins.35 Research needs to determine: a) how cyber entity will move from one cloud
    (or edge) to another if the corresponding device is borrowed from one farmer to
    another? b) how the control of virtual entities will be delegated to the lending
    farmer, whether both the farmers need to use same application? c) how the applications
    will allow to delegate access for machine operation? d) Can the virtual objects
    or equipment across farms communicate with each other, whether at the physical
    level or using the virtual entities? If it is the virtual entity across different
    accounts in the same cloud provider, how such interaction will take place? In
    case it is across different cloud providers, how cross cloud and federated cloud
    environments will ensure such trust levels? Suppose in case a farmer has borrowed
    an equipment from a friend farmer, will the original owner be able to have access
    to it, or the access will be completely revoked? Is it possible to control a device
    through different remote clouds? All are relevant questions in smart farming domain.
    Further, how to establish trust mechanisms among different cloud service providers
    which the farmer is using for services and alerts? Manufacturer of the device
    may hold digital twin [103] and the cloud used by farmers will get data from on-field
    sensor and the cloud provider via pre-defined and signed negotiations. Such negotiations
    can also define what kind of data will be shared with required permissions of
    the owner farmer. Another important question is, how to establish trust between
    physical sensor objects? One approach is sensors at the same farm trust each other
    more for the shared information as compared to sensors across different farms.
    IoT and CPS specific cross cloud access controls and related security models are
    still in infancy stage and need more attention. Livestock and animals also have
    sensors embedded, which require appropriate authorized access. However, current
    literature does not provide strong access control mechanisms that can restrict
    such operations and secure critical data sharing from cattle and livestock at
    the farm. These wearable and health monitoring devices are attached to livestock
    and collect sensitive data, which can be used by adversaries to control the animal
    or even effect the sale/purchase of a cattle, for example, having the information
    about which cow is having low milk production. Efficient access controls [104]–[106]
    are needed to safeguard such sensitive data in cloud, which needs more research
    considering the spate of breaches heard every now and then. Usually in case of
    wearable IoT devices, a human which has the device controls what kind of data
    he/she wants to be shared. However, it is not in case of livestock which has a
    master (like the owner of the farm or caretaker) to decide control. Also, as a
    cattle is sold/purchased and moves from one owner to another, relevant data sharing
    security policies need to be specified and will require automatically configured
    information sharing. Studies [107], [108] have shown vulnerabilities in human
    used fitness devices, however, such studies and research are still an open challenge
    in case of livestock devices. Since data is collected from smart devices spread
    across farms, different applications require to access to this data. Consequentially,
    it is important to limit the sharing of data across applications and across nearby
    friend farmers, who may also get some value or receive alerts for their farms.
    How and when to share such information requires adaptive security policies to
    control and supervise data transferred by sensors to the cloud platform. Further,
    if data is sharing across multi cloud systems, cross cloud trust also needs to
    be addressed. Appropriate attribute based fine grained access controls [109],
    [110] and privacy preserving schemes need to be deployed to ensure confidentiality
    of the data. Evidently, farmers must decide the level and type of data sharing
    needed to ensure the privacy of critical information. B. Data Perspective The
    most noticeable feature of smart farming is its communication ability between
    the smart devices, resulting in an unprecedented amount of generated data [7],
    [111]. This provides many challenges as discussed in section III and open doors
    for several research opportunities. Machine learning is an attractive solution
    for processing big data, and implementing effective security solutions. Insider
    data leakage detection has always been a daunting task as users already have legitimate
    access to the system, making it hard to detect and predict such attacks. Several
    research works have been conducted on insider data leakage [22], [112], [113];
    however, none has been targeting smart farming settings. Further investigation
    is needed to understand the possibility of adopting insider data leakage defense
    mechanisms into smart farming and whether unique characteristics of smart farming
    can help to improve these mechanisms. Smart farms are highly connected systems,
    which allow malware to easily propagate through the network infecting all interconnected
    devices. An interesting question is how to detect malware in smart farming IoT
    environment, especially considering all heterogeneous devices in place. For instance,
    a malware detection technique that works against a malware that infects smart
    farming equipment might not work against malware that infects edge or cloud systems
    since the malware’s end goal is different. Many AI assisted malware detection
    techniques [114]–[120] are proposed and used in practice; however, there are no
    smart-farming-specific malware detection techniques that consider the context
    and environment in which smart farms reside. Smart farms generate diverse and
    vast amount of unstructured data. It is almost impossible for one party to analyze
    and make use of the entire datasets. For this reason, threat information sharing
    is a viable approach for data security. For instance, each smart farm can employ
    a malware detection technique; however, it is guaranteed that none of these employed
    techniques is comprehensive enough to catch all types of malware. Information
    sharing between smart farms can prove very useful. It can be used as an asset
    to share threat information about attack patterns or malware that was detected
    by collaborating smart farms. In a similar case, if a deployed detection technique
    in a farm detected supplied water with high toxin content, it is relevant to share
    that information with nearby farms who may also be impacted by similar issue.
    This can save analysis cost and money for every participating smart farm as it
    prevents doing work that someone else already did before. What kind of data, meta-data
    or analysis can be shared remains an open question and what kind of threat information
    sharing process can be used remain an open question for resource constrained farmers.
    Smart farming is an emerging field, so it is highly likely to encounter zero-day
    attacks which have not been detected before. Anomaly detection [121]–[125] is
    a very appealing solution against such attacks. Anomaly detection techniques look
    for any abnormal behavior that deviates from the pre-established database of normal
    behavior. These normal behaviour profiles are constructed based on collection
    of historical observations and patterns. Building smart farms behavior profiles
    is a challenging task since their behaviors are so dynamic in nature. External
    factors are a major reason for this dynamism. For example, less irrigation is
    needed during a rainy weather than dry weather which will cause a different behavior
    for irrigation systems. Can weather forecast information be used as an indication
    of such change of behavior? What kind of data contribute to building smart farms
    behavior profiles? Do some data fields weigh more than others? These are all open
    research questions that need to be investigated. Detection mechanisms are used
    to detect faulty and compromised sensors by monitoring the data sent for any tampered
    or abnormal values. Employing a simple threshold based mechanism can easily be
    bypassed by an attacker, so in most cases, more sophisticated machine learning
    based mechanisms need to be deployed. However, smart attackers can still bypass
    these models by (1) exploiting the sensors and a little tweaking of data sent
    by these sensors just to lead the machine learning model in place to misclassify/mispredict
    the outcome (such attack is called adversarial machine learning attack), and (2)
    poisoning the model during training phase by injecting bad data into the model’s
    training database, and in turn get it to learn something it shouldn’t. Some research
    addressed mitigation against adversarial attacks; however, it is not clear whether
    these technologies can be adopted to smart farming domain which is very dominant
    on changing environment conditions. Another open research challenge is to create
    various artificial intelligence systems that collect and parse Cyber Threat Intelligence
    (CTI36) about smart devices, software, cloud systems etc. used in the smart farming
    ecosystem. These systems have been developed to collect CTI in other areas [126]–[129]
    and need to be extended to ensure coverage of various smart farming devices, equipment
    and software. C. Network Perspective Cybersecurity threats to smart farming and
    its devices include a diverse range of security risks due to certain characteristics
    of the underlying networking and communication technologies which are used in
    the domain. First, both virtual and physical communication environments get connected.
    Many IoT devices in a smart farm system are capable of functioning on the data
    they receive from their respective environments which shortens the distance between
    virtual and physical systems. While convenient for the users, it allows cyber
    threats to convert to physical consequences more quickly, thereby having a bigger
    impact. Second, devices and layers involved in a smart farm system create a complex
    communication environment. Hyper connected farming environments exist due to the
    growing availability and diversity of IoT devices. ‘Complex’ in this context means
    that large number of devices are working in a single smart farm environment such
    that dynamic interactions between them are possible. This complexity expands the
    capabilities of an environment, but at the cost of a wider attack surface. Smart
    farming like other emerging technologies is embracing new networking paradigms
    to tackle today’s sophisticated attacks. Software defined network (SDN) [130]–[132]
    is one such promising networking revolution. Through decoupling control plane
    from data plane and giving credit to network programmable, it offers interesting
    technical capabilities to network providers. This causes an intense adaption of
    SDN in almost every fields of networking, from data center networks to WANs, wireless,
    5G and recently IoT. Using SDN in smart farm networking is attracting to both
    academia and industry for certain reasons. SDN supports both physical and virtual
    networking scenarios very well. It also offers a reliable way of practicing networking
    in highly diverse and naturally heterogeneous smart farms networking environment.
    Moreover, using SDN, smart farms are able to form a holistic view of all the connected
    devices along with how they interact in a near real time manner. Such a holistic
    view not only improves agility, scalability, and manageability of smart farm networking
    but also empowers a large smart farm network to enforce robust security counter
    measure against possible sophisticated cyber attacks. It is important to research
    further the adaptability of SDN and other 5G related next generation communication
    technologies in smart farming and precision agriculture domain. SDN can enable
    smart farms to get the most benefit out of complex machine learning and AI algorithms
    to automate network management of large number of sensors, wireless and wired
    networks used in a smart farming ecosystem. It also facilitates implementing advanced,
    cross-layer network security solutions which are very time and resource consuming,
    if not impossible, otherwise. Finally, SDN expedites edge networking and hence
    cloud-based security-as-a-service delivery model becomes a more approachable solution
    in large smart farming deployments. D. Compliance and Supply Chain Perspective
    With the ubiquitous use of sensors, automated drones, blockchain, artificial intelligence
    integration, different agricultural businesses are falling back on compliance,
    regulation and cyber insurance to protect themselves [64]. With the development
    of targeted malware and other cyber threats, the entire food supply chain is at
    risk [12], [64]. A hostile actor specifically interested in disrupting the supply
    chain can target various organizations and companies that supply raw material
    to farms or process food for the end user. A potential solution to this problem
    is to develop industry standards that enable trust between various raw material
    suppliers and downstream food processors [64]. The development of these standards
    enforced by national governments through regulation, has been slow. One example
    of such a shortcoming, is the existence of a few cybersecurity standards for the
    many smart devices used in the food supply chain. Various legislation are being
    introduced to set ‘minimal cybersecurity operational standards for internet connected
    devices’. In specific cases where various governments do not wish to regulate
    these interactions, it is up to various agriculture businesses to protect themselves
    by asking their supply chain to ‘self-regulate’ cybersecurity best practices [64].
    Such developments can be pushed through market demands, competitive pressure,
    etc. The food supply chain also lacks robust cyber insurance policies. With the
    constant development of smart applications, AI, smart farming equipment, etc.
    cyber insurance providers are unable to predict and quantify various cyber risks
    involved in these systems. Specific research needs to be done so as to develop
    standard legal jargon and metrics to quantify cyber risk in smart farming. These
    will help create robust cyber insurance markets for precision agriculture. Various
    systems [133]–[136] also need to be built to make it easier for the end users
    to understand and parse these complex legal documents, cyber insurance policies,
    agreements, contracts, etc. Research on these open challenges will help wide adoption
    of precision agriculture technologies. SECTION VII. Conclusion The proliferation
    of smart devices with communication and sensing capabilities have unleashed plethora
    of user services, and at the same time made tasks more convenient and efficient
    for humans. However, wide adoption of such internet connected devices and data
    driven applications across various domains have raised security and privacy issues,
    making these systems vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This paper discusses such cybersecurity
    challenges in smart farming and elaborates open research questions. The paper
    first outlines a multi-layer smart farming architecture illustrating different
    entities pertinent to real time use-cases supported by edge and cloud environments.
    Based on the architecture, the paper outlines security and privacy issues and
    highlights different attacks scenarios in smart farms as well as scenarios affecting
    the entire food supply chain. Thereafter, this article surveys the state-of-the-art
    research and acknowledges important works related to cybersecurity in the domain.
    Finally, the paper illustrates several open challenges and research problems pertinent
    to security and privacy aspects in precision agriculture. We envision this paper
    will simulate research to solve platitude of security and data privacy issues
    in fast growing and economically important smart farming sector. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    Abstract: The immense increase in multimedia-on-demand traffic that refers to
    audio, video, and images, has drastically shifted the vision of the Internet of
    Things (IoT) from scalar to Multimedia Internet of Things (M-IoT). IoT devices
    are constrained in terms of energy, computing, size, and storage memory. Delay-sensitive
    and bandwidth-hungry multimedia applications over constrained IoT networks require
    revision of IoT architecture for M-IoT. This paper provides a comprehensive survey
    of M-IoT with an emphasis on architecture, protocols, and applications. This article
    starts by providing a horizontal overview of the IoT. Then, we discuss the issues
    considering the characteristics of multimedia and provide a summary of related
    M-IoT architectures. Various multimedia applications supported by IoT are surveyed,
    and numerous use cases related to road traffic management, security, industry,
    and health are illustrated to show how different M-IoT applications are revolutionizing
    human life. We explore the importance of Quality-of-Experience (QoE) and Quality-of-Service
    (QoS) for multimedia transmission over IoT. Moreover, we explore the limitations
    of IoT for multimedia computing and present the relationship between the M-IoT
    and emerging technologies including event processing, feature extraction, cloud
    computing, Fog/Edge computing and Software-Defined-Networks (SDNs). We also present
    the need for better routing and Physical-Medium Access Control (PHY-MAC) protocols
    for M-IoT. Finally, we present a detailed discussion on the open research issues
    and several potential research areas related to emerging multimedia communication

    \ a high-performance,\nhigh-productivity, and sustainable agriculture, which implies\
    \ the introduction of new technologies\ninto monitoring activities related to\
    \ control and decision-making. In this regard, this paper presents\na hierarchical\

    \ at the network level for the transmission of the\nrelevant data. The experiments\
    \ were carried out at a Romanian research institute where diﬀerent\ncrops and\
    \ methods are developed. The results demonstrate that the collaborative UAV–WSN–IoT\n\
    approach increases the performances in both precision agriculture and ecological\
    \ agriculture.\nKeywords: unmanned aerial vehicles; wireless sensor networks;\
    \ intelligent data processing; trajectory\nplanning; relevant data extraction;\
    \ data consensus; Internet of Things; precision agriculture\n1. Introduction\n\
    The need for high-performance, high-productivity, and sustainable agriculture\
    \ results from the\nrapid growth of the human population. This requires permanent\
    \ monitoring and intelligent processing\nof the measured data collected from the\
    \ ﬁeld, correlated with the weather forecasts, to produce\nagronomic recommendations.\
    \ In the last few years, new technologies in agriculture, and especially in\n\
    precision agriculture (PA), have been leveraged for increased productivity and\
    \ eﬃcient input dosage [1].\nMost importantly, in PA, farmers need to know exact\
    \ and timely details about crop status. These details\nabout certain parameters,\
    \ obtained by measurements both from the ground and in the air, constitute\ninput\
    \ data to specialized systems of process management in the PA. Some relevant examples\
    \ might\ninclude for example, irrigation control, pesticide dosage, pest control,\
    \ etc. For acquisition and complex\nprocessing of the collected data, integration\
    \ of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) with wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSN) under\
    \ novel frameworks, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), has been shown to\n\
    contribute to increases in agricultural yields [2]. Such advanced systems are\
    \ modeled as well-speciﬁed\nSensors 2020, 20, 817; doi:10.3390/s20030817\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 817\n2 of 25\nagent-based solutions with sensors and UAVs. Although\
    \ the contributions of UAVs and WSNs, taken\nseparately, are well documented and\
    \ important in the sustainable growth of agricultural production,\nthe integration\
    \ of these components together within an IoT framework is expected to signiﬁcantly\n\
    improve the solutions for monitoring, production modeling, prediction, and decision-making.\n\
    Relevant applications of UAV–WSN systems are presented in Reference [3–6]. In\
    \ viticulture,\nas a special type of PA, the soil and air parameters modify grape\
    \ yield and quality. For this purpose,\na solution based on the collaborative\
    \ system mini UAV (quadrotor type)–WSNs to monitor parameters,\nlike temperature\
    \ and humidity, to prevent the frost in fragmented vineyards is proposed in Reference\
    \ [3].\nThe UAV is considered as communication relay between sensors and a base\
    \ station. A real application\nfor monitoring sensitive parameters in vineyards\
    \ with both agro-meteorological stations and UAV\nplatforms is presented in Reference\
    \ [4]. In order to obtain a precise monitoring of the speciﬁc indicators,\nthe\
    \ data from the ground are correlated with the data collected by a UAV platform\
    \ with 8 rotors\nprovided with a professional thermal camera. The study was conducted\
    \ over a period of two years.\nFor data acquisition on large areas, a ﬁxed wing\
    \ type UAV, used as data mule from the ground WSN,\nis proposed in Reference [5].\
    \ In addition, the UAV has attached an high deﬁnition (HD) camera for the\ndetection\
    \ of certain plant diseases. Experimentally, a small tank has been added to spray\
    \ diﬀerent\ninsecticides, fertilizers, herbicides, etc. Both UAV and WSN are low\
    \ cost and not robust for only\ndemonstration purposes. In addition, in Reference\
    \ [6], a low cost agro-meteorological monitoring\nsystem in a vineyard was designed\
    \ and developed. The optimal positioning of the sensors was made\nwith the help\
    \ of the multispectral image analysis, acquired by UAV.\nGiven recent evolutions\
    \ in UAV technologies, cost reduction, and new regulations of aviation\nauthorities\
    \ regarding the usage and deployment of such systems (e.g., European Aviation\
    \ Safety\nAgency (EASA) [7] and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) [8]), such\
    \ aerial robotic platforms\nare increasingly used in agriculture for diﬀerent\
    \ tasks, the most important being crop monitoring [9].\nAccording to EASA, the\
    \ UAVs should be safely integrated into the existing aviation context in a\nproportionate\
    \ way [7]. For large scale applications, in which UAVs are ﬂying beyond line-of-sight,\n\
    compliance with strict regulatory frameworks is essential.\nAdoption of a UAV-based\
    \ solution for image acquisition in agriculture applications is more\ncost eﬀective\
    \ and ﬂexible in comparison with satellite or manned aircraft alternatives [10].\
    \ Both\nﬁxed- wing [11,12] and rotary-wing type [3,13] UAVs are frequently used\
    \ in various applications in\nagriculture, while accounting for the risk of crashes\
    \ [9] and potential damages. Equipped with speciﬁc\nsensors in modular payloads\
    \ [14], such as high resolution RGB [15], infrared, multispectral [16,17],\nthermal\
    \ cameras [18,19], and also LIDAR [10], UAVs are able to create precise maps of\
    \ crop state or\nevolution [17], health plant assessment [20], diseases [21],\
    \ soil characteristics, evaluate losses caused\nby ﬂoods [11], etc. In the crop\
    \ monitoring, the following characteristics are analyzed from UAV\nimages [9]:\
    \ the crop water stress, deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the canopy and the air\
    \ temperature,\nthe photochemical reﬂectance index, and the vegetation indices.\n\
    Although UAVs with diﬀerent propulsion systems are now available, most applications\
    \ in PA\nuse UAVs driven by electric motors due to their compact size, reduced\
    \ maintenance and operational\ncosts and, not the least, their alignment with\
    \ the current regulatory context and tendencies towards the\nreduction of global\
    \ carbon emissions [22].\nThe small-scale data acquisition by the WSN helps farmers\
    \ to take actions like crop irrigation,\nfertilizer usages, deciding on the optimum\
    \ stages of sowing, and harvesting [23]. Moreover, WSNs\nemployed in PA lead to\
    \ large amounts of data. Thus, data collection by WSNs is an important\ncontribution\
    \ to the development of farm management information systems (FMIS) [24,25].\n\
    The WSN has multiple functions at the ﬁeld level: data acquisition of various\
    \ parameters\n(e.g., temperature in soil and air, humidity in soil and air, solar\
    \ radiance, soil nutrients, the presence of\npests and weeds, chlorophyll content\
    \ in plants, etc.), distributed processing of data by establishing\nconsensus—if\
    \ it is the case, establishing the relevant data and its storage, low level data\
    \ fusion, and\ndata transmission. New sensor node designs oﬀer reduced costs [26];\
    \ see, for example, the detailed list\nSensors 2020, 20, 817\n3 of 25\nof sensors\
    \ used in PA given in Reference [10]. As in many other large-area monitoring applications,\n\
    for communication or local processing reasons, the sensors are grouped into sensor\
    \ networks, the\ncommunication being made by radio. A WSN network will include\
    \ measurement nodes (sensory\nnodes) and data collection, processing, and transmission\
    \ nodes (sink or cluster head).\nRegarding PA, there is no rigorous theory of\
    \ sensor placement because it depends on the\nparticularities of the soil and\
    \ the weather. Sensor groups need to comply broadly with the need for\nsensory\
    \ and communication coverage. In Reference [27], two examples of sensor location\
    \ topologies\nare given: grid and random. From the point of view of communication\
    \ with the sink node, the most\nused are the star and mesh topologies. The wireless\
    \ communication protocols used in WSN for PA are\nthe following [10]: 6LoWPAN,\
    \ ZigBee (both being the most suitable for the mesh topology), LoRaWAN,\nGSM,\
    \ BLE, and Wi-Fi.\nIn PA, WSNs are used, most often, for parameter monitoring,\
    \ but they can also be integrated into\ncontrol systems as sensors. Direct speciﬁc\
    \ applications of WSN in control systems for PA are the energy\neﬃcient automated\
    \ control of irrigation [28] and smart automated fertilization [29].\nThe performance\
    \ of the crop monitoring can be improved by UAV–WSN collaboration [30].\nThe collaborative\
    \ aspects in an integrated UAV (aerial agents)–WSN (ground agents) architecture\
    \ for\ndiﬀerent applications was recently presented in a review paper [22], where\
    \ the diﬀerent functional\ncomponents of the system and how they collaborate with\
    \ each other was highlighted. In Reference [31],\nthe authors presented an integrated\
    \ UAV–WSN–IoT system, named FarmBeats, which is an end-to-end\nplatform for data\
    \ collection from various sensors, cameras, and drones in agricultural applications.\n\
    An unlicensed TV White Spaces is used to setup a high bandwidth link from the\
    \ farmer’s home to an\nIoT ground station at a distance for collecting data from\
    \ UAVs and WSNs.\nIn order to interconnect the UAVs and terrestrial WSNs into\
    \ hybrid networks and, at the same\ntime, to ensure a safe airspace sharing with\
    \ aircrafts, multiple organizations are contributing [22]:\nInternational Civil\
    \ Aviation Organization, EASA, Joint Authorities for Rulemaking on Unmanned\n\
    Systems, International Telecommunications Union, etc. Satellite connection is\
    \ required for two reasons.\nOne-way communication, such as obtaining the GPS\
    \ location of the UAVs or the sensory nodes (if any)\nis one reason. The second\
    \ reason is a possible data transmission or remote control (via two-way\nsatellite-intermediated\
    \ internet).\nIn Reference [32], the authors discuss the information system design\
    \ supporting agriculture\ndata management. Enabling advanced data processing in\
    \ the form of sensor fusion and clustering\nmechanisms for improved network topologies\
    \ in generic applications has been discussed [30]. Eﬀective\ndata gathering mechanisms\
    \ [33] and higher level IoT architectures [34] are key and current topics\nof\
    \ interest.\nWe believe that the challenges of UAV–WSN–IoT integrated systems\
    \ can come from several\ndirections: (a) precise localization of the ground sensors\
    \ with the aid of a preliminary ﬂight; (b) sensor\nstates periodically inspected\
    \ by UAV; (c) establishing of the WSNs as sensor clusters able to cover, both\n\
    from the sensorial and from the communication point of view the monitored area;\
    \ (d) establishing\nthe cluster heads (CH), named base stations, of the WSNs able\
    \ to communicate data to UAVs;\n(e) transmitting commands to change the strategy\
    \ and parameters of the sensor networks, (f) data\nacquisition from WSNs through\
    \ UAVs, (g) special trajectory planning and tracking, (h) the aggregation\nof\
    \ information collected by the UAV with the information collected by WSN for the\
    \ purpose of\nmeasuring and interpreting the parameters with increased accuracy,\
    \ (i) remote control via Internet,\nand (j) edge and cloud computing.\nIn a hierarchical\
    \ structure, the data processing architecture of the integrated system is based\
    \ on\nthree levels: consensus, edge computing [35], and cloud computing.\nFor\
    \ the main activity, the data collection from CH, UAV must have a predeﬁned trajectory,\
    \ properly\ndesigned, and accounting for the following limitations:\n•\nWaypoint\
    \ passing: a UAV has to pass above the CH to extract the relevant data from that\
    \ area\n(covered by the corresponding WSN sub-network);\nSensors 2020, 20, 817\n\
    4 of 25\n•\nObstacle avoidance: UAVs avoid obstructions or prohibited areas along\
    \ the ﬂight plan;\n•\nGuaranteed communication: to ensure that the data has been\
    \ fully collected, enough time has to\nbe spent in the CH neighborhood;\n•\nEﬃciency:\
    \ reduce at a minimum the energy consumption for that trajectory (consider the\
    \ length\nof the trajectory and its complexity).\nThe integration of UAV–WSN based\
    \ systems for PA in IoT is a mandatory step to create an\nadvanced FMIS [25].\n\
    Due to the integration, the system can become “smart” by using elements of artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence\nlike self-adaptation and decision, optimal trajectory, data transmission\
    \ of relevant parameter values,\nenergy eﬃciency, and neural networks for data\
    \ and image processing. Not in the least, the sensors must\nbe placed optimally,\
    \ considering the terrain characteristics. Battery life is an important design\
    \ point\nof the ground sensor algorithms by reducing to a minimum the number of\
    \ wireless communications\nneeded to transfer the information. The radio interface\
    \ is the critical factor in increasing battery life.\nBased on the frequency of\
    \ the data collection and radio transmissions the nodes can have a battery\nlifetime\
    \ ranging from several months up to one year. Therefore, the intelligent collaboration\
    \ between\nUAV and WSN can lead to optimization of parameters, such as energy\
    \ consumption, sensing coverage,\nrisk, data acquisition, and processing time\
    \ [36]. To this end, bio-inspired optimization heuristics and\ngenetic algorithms\
    \ were applied to the aforementioned agents.\nThe optimal WSN coverage by the\
    \ aid of UAV platforms is implemented in Reference [37] as an\noptimization problem,\
    \ formulated by means of the travelling salesman problem, in order to ﬁnd the\n\
    best path of the UAV for data collection with minimum energy consumption.\nUsing\
    \ UAV as data mule for multi WSNs is an energy-eﬃcient method to increase the\
    \ networks’\nlife. To this end, the authors in Reference [38] apply the successive\
    \ convex optimization technique.\nThe proposed system presents the following integration\
    \ aspects:\n-\nGroup the sensors in clusters and determine the cluster heads,\
    \ the methodology proposed by the\nauthors in Reference [30];\n-\nPath planning\
    \ based on speciﬁc conditions for eﬃcient data collection; and\n-\nIntelligent\
    \ data collection and processing.\nThe main contributions consist in the following:\
    \ (i) implementation of a multilevel, collaborative\nUAV–WSN system structure\
    \ for agriculture applications, (ii) a speciﬁc path planning for ﬁxed\nwing–type\
    \ UAV with the purpose of robust and eﬃcient data collection, (iii) obtaining\
    \ relevant data\nfrom sensors for the purpose of saving energy, and (iv) edge–fog–cloud\
    \ computing algorithms for\nsubsequent data processing. Thus, the main challenge\
    \ is related to improving data extraction and\ncommunication in large scale heterogeneous\
    \ monitoring system. The key problem is focused on\nimproving the performance\
    \ of such systems through better algorithms and synchronization among the\ntwo\
    \ subsystems: the ground sensor network and the robotic aerial platforms, implemented\
    \ as UAVs,\nfor data collection and relaying.\nThe rest of the paper is structured\
    \ as follows. Section 2 describes the concept, the methodology,\nand key aspects\
    \ that have been addressed for the proper design and implementation of the system.\n\
    Section 3 presents the experimental results and performances after implementing\
    \ the system on an\nexperimental farm. Section 4 highlights the conclusions, as\
    \ well as future work.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Requirements for Integrated\
    \ UAV-WSN-IoT Systems\nFor the design of reliable and robust large-scale monitoring\
    \ system the requirements have to\nﬁrst be validated. The main challenges for\
    \ such collaborative systems were considered to be: sensing\ncoverage in accordance\
    \ to mission objectives, communication coverage by the hybrid UAV–WSN\nsystem\
    \ using various types of radio links, from low-power, low-data rate to high throughput\
    \ long\nSensors 2020, 20, 817\n5 of 25\ndistance for streaming, energy eﬃciency,\
    \ and, not in the least, computing eﬃciency. The decentralized\narchitecture for\
    \ crop ﬁeld monitoring described in this paper is designed to overcome the challenges\n\
    mentioned above and to account for the data generation patterns at the ﬁeld level.\
    \ While the proposed\ndata fusion mechanisms and processing of centralized in-ﬁeld\
    \ data at CH level manage to reduce data\nvolume and ensure the ﬂow of information\
    \ up to the level of events, an additional intermediate level is\nappended to\
    \ the data stream, in order to reach the server. To this end, we consider both\
    \ mobile agents\n(UAV) and multiple ﬁxed agents (ground sensors (SNs)). The system\
    \ diagram is presented in Figure 1.\nThe mobile agent can perform the following\
    \ functions: data mulling, image acquisition, relay, and\nstate inspection of\
    \ WSNs. The ﬁxed agents acquire data from the ﬁeld (agricultural ﬁeld—soil and\
    \ air),\nprocess data locally (relevant data extraction, data consensus), and\
    \ ﬁnally transmit data to the UAV by\nmeans of CHs. The system is composed of\
    \ four main processing levels (Table 1): Sensor level, Fog\nComputing level, Internet/Cloud\
    \ Computing level, and Data Management and Interpretation level.\nThis is a multi-WSN–UAV\
    \ structure with higher level integration in internet-based systems for decision\n\
    support. The data from WSNs are collected by a UAV, transmitted at a ground control\
    \ station (GCS),\nand, from here via the internet, to the Data Interpretation\
    \ module. Analytics functionality ranges from\nbasic statistical indicators to\
    \ trend and event detectors and up to basic statistical learning models that\n\
    have the ability to anticipate evolutions in the monitored ground phenomena.\n\
    Another important requirement of the integrated system is the correlated or complementary\n\
    interpretation of the data from the sensory agents, either mobile or ﬁxed. For\
    \ example, when the soil\nmoisture is too high, the soil sensors show the maximum\
    \ value and cannot discern whether a ﬂood has\noccurred. This can be accurately\
    \ determined from aerial images taken by the UAV. In addition, the\ndegree of\
    \ humidity in plants and the degree of foliage development can be observed either\
    \ from the\nground or from the air (images), and a more precise determination\
    \ results from the fusion of the two\ndata sets.\nOther types of similar systems\
    \ were surveyed and can include the use of swarms of multi-copter\ntype UAVs,\
    \ which oﬀer better positioning accuracy for data collection while trading oﬀ\
    \ energy eﬃciency\nand autonomy. Ground sensor network implementation can also\
    \ be a diﬀerentiating factor with two\nmain approaches: random deployment of sensor\
    \ nodes in the area of interest, according to a minimum\nexpected sensing coverage\
    \ density, or deterministic, grid-like placement. Intermediate data processing\n\
    steps from the ﬁeld level to the decision level are commonly accepted as an important\
    \ mechanism to\nbalance network loads and improve communication latency.\nSensors\

    \ must be considered. The ﬁrst is the trajectory planning\nfor collecting data\
    \ from sensors (CHs), and it must take into account certain requirements, such\
    \ as\nthe complete and safe acquisition of data, on one hand, and minimize energy\
    \ and time consumption,\non the other hand [39].\nUnder certain reasonable assumptions\
    \ (known environment, known limitations), the UAV tasks\nreduce to computing a\
    \ trajectory which respects constraints and minimizes a cost (length, total energy\n\
    consumption, etc.), while simultaneously respecting various constraints (internal\
    \ dynamics, stall\nvelocity constraints or exogenous ones, those imposed by the\
    \ environment, such as obstacle avoidance\nand waypoint passing through).\nThe\
    \ particularity lies in the fact that many of the UAV-speciﬁc constraints are\
    \ non-convex [40],\ne.g., the variable of interest z (depending of time t) has\
    \ to stay outside some bound (e.g., outside of\nan interdicted region and/or maintain\
    \ a minimal velocity). If z(t) is the UAV position, the velocity\nrestrictions\
    \ are usually written as follows:\nv ≤\n\f\f\f\n\f\f\f\n.z(t)\n\f\f\f\n\f\f\f\
    \ ≤ v.\n(1)\nBoth bounds (lower—v and upper—v) may depend on a variety of factors.\
    \ Hard constraints are\nimposed by the UAV physics: upper bound given by the engine\
    \ characteristics and lower bound by\nthe requirement to avoid stall. Note that\
    \ this work neglects the inﬂuence of wind: velocity is usually\nmeasured against\
    \ the ground (e.g., through a GPS), but, in fact, the UAV “feels” the addition\
    \ of its own\nand of the wind velocities. This may lead to an unexpected stall\
    \ or, at least, improper behavior. Usual\ntechniques are to provide more conservative\
    \ bounds in Equation (1) and to restrict the ﬂight to normal\nweather conditions.\n\
    Waypoints are introduced, in a practical mission, because data has to be gathered\
    \ from a cluster\nnode. Thus, the question of minimum communication time arises\
    \ [41]: It is necessary to remain in a\nspeciﬁc neighborhood for a deﬁned time\
    \ interval ∆ti. To correctly describe such a constraint, we require\na tuple (ωi,\
    \ ∆ti, ri , Ri), where ωi is the corresponding cluster node position (the center\
    \ of the circle in\nFigure 2), and ri and Ri are, respectively, the minimum and\
    \ the maximum radius of the permitted\ncommunication area. Because there are perturbations\
    \ due to trajectory control errors or other causes,\nthe real trajectory is included\
    \ in a ﬂight lane (Figure 2a). The ﬂight lane was experimentally established\n\
    at 30 m, under reasonable assumptions about wind speed. The trajectory z(t) has\
    \ to stay near the\nwaypoint for a least amount of time ∆ti determined by the\
    \ quantity of data which has to be transferred:\nri ≤\n\f\f\f\n\f\f\fωi − z(t)\n\
    \f\f\f\n\f\f\f ≤ Ri, t ∈ [ti, ti + ∆ti].\n(2)\ncondition (2) is often impractical\
    \ to check due to the continuous nature of z(t) and because of the\nvarying time\
    \ interval [ti, ti + ∆ti]. The usual approach is to sample the constraint and\
    \ to estimate the\npath length by assuming the bounds (1) on the velocity. To\
    \ this end, we consider:\n\f\f\f\f\n\f\f\f\fz\n\x10\nti\n\x11\n− ωi\n\f\f\f\f\n\
    \f\f\f\f = ri,\n(3)\nwith ti given such that ti ∈ [ti, ti + ∆ti]) holds; it is\
    \ important that a waypoint is reached, not when.\nSensors 2020, 20, 817\n7 of\
    \ 25\nNote that the shortest distance for a trajectory checking (4) is the straight\
    \ line shown in Figure 2a,\nwhose length is 2\nq\nR2\ni − r2\ni . In other words,\
    \ a suﬃcient condition for guaranteeing that the minimal\ntime ∆ti has passed\
    \ is to ensure that\n∆ti ≥\n2\nq\nR2\ni − r2\ni\nv\n.\n(4)\nCondition (4) provides\
    \ a lower bound for the time the UAV stays between the inner and outer\ncircles\
    \ (i.e., how much time it spends inside waypoint’s ωi communication range). Then,\
    \ inserting (3) in\na trajectory design procedure implicitly guarantees enough\
    \ communication time. This approach may\nbe insuﬃcient for a couple of reasons.\
    \ First, the desired communication time may not be known at the\ntrajectory generation\
    \ time and thus could not be compared with ∆ti. Second, the communication time\n\
    is known to be larger than ∆ti and a “tangential” pass (like the one enforced\
    \ by (3)) does not suﬃce.\nThe method (detailed below) is to enter a loitering\
    \ mode to increase arbitrarily the data-gathering\ntime [42]. Making the reasonable\
    \ assumption that the loitering rl\ni radius respects the condition\nri < rl\n\
    i < Ri, means that the UAV can orbit the waypoint ωi for an indeﬁnite period of\
    \ time [43]. From\nthe viewpoint of trajectory generation, the only relevant question\
    \ remains the places at which the\nUAV inserts/dislodges onto/from the loitering\
    \ circle. Both of these points are decided by the relative\nposition of the current\
    \ waypoint with respect to the previous and next waypoints in the sequence\n(such\
    \ as to reduce unnecessary inﬂexions in the trajectory). The switch between normal\
    \ and loitering\nmodes will be done at pre-determined points: the trajectory enters\
    \ loitering mode at a point ω−\ni and\ndislodges from it at a point ω+\ni (which\
    \ lie on the loitering circle and are from/towards the direction\nof the previous/next\
    \ waypoint). Thus, when the UAV decides to ﬁnish the communication, it will\n\
    continue to orbit the loitering circle until it reaches the dislodging point ω+\n\
    i . Here, it will switch back\nto the normal trajectory mode.\nThe inner (dotted\

    \ circle, tracking an arc of\nit, and, lastly, dislodging from the circle to re-enter\
    \ its normal mode (line tracking). The UAV could\nhave orbited the loitering circle\
    \ repeatedly and dislodged from it at ω+\ni when desired. As is mentioned\nabove,\
    \ the trajectory describes a corridor (we account for the inherent tracking error\
    \ appearing under\nrealistic conditions).\nSensors 2020, 20, x FOR PEER REVIEW\

    \ of the algorithm are:\n▶\nThe UAV has two modes of functioning, loiter mode\
    \ and segment tracking mode, which are\ndecided by the supervisor (in the sense\
    \ that within the collection of waypoints a priori computed,\nsome of them are\
    \ labeled as loiter points).\n▶\nIn both cases, the algorithm provides a heading\
    \ which is the reference to be tracked by the\nUAV. This is in line with standard\
    \ practices, where the heading is decided through some design\nprocedure and the\
    \ velocity and pitch and roll angles are decided at the auto-pilot level (usually\n\
    the velocity is maintained constant and the roll and pitch are taken as needed\
    \ between admissible\nbounds).\n▶\nThe decisions taken by the algorithm and supervisor\
    \ are, ultimately, related to the distance\nbetween the current position and some\
    \ point of interest. To do so, we consider some circles of\ninterest, deﬁned as\
    \ follows:\n#\nCommunication circle: the UAV communicates with the ground-based\
    \ cluster head only\nwhen it is within the communication radius.\n#\nWaypoint\
    \ update circle: it is impractical to assume that the UAV passes through the exact\n\
    coordinates of the current waypoint. Thus, we update the active segment (by advancing\n\
    through the list of waypoints) whenever we are close enough to the end-point of\
    \ the\ncurrent segment.\n#\nLoitering circle: whenever the UAV is required to\
    \ spend a signiﬁcant time in communication\nwith the current cluster head, the\
    \ decision to start loitering is taken. The loitering radius is\nrestricted to\
    \ be less than the communication radius and larger than the physical limitations\n\
    imposed by the roll angle bounds (a tighter circle means a larger roll angle).\n\
    #\nProximity circle: the procedure employed in the algorithm takes (whenever there\
    \ is\nintersection between the circle and the current segment) the heading angle\
    \ in the direction\nof the intersection point (the one closest to the end-point\
    \ of the segment).\n▶\nWhen the last waypoint is covered, the UAV returns to base\
    \ (by default, we consider this to be\nthe initial point on the trajectory).\n\
    Without being exhaustive, some of the most relevant updates in the algorithm are:\n\
    In segment tracking mode:\n1.\nAt the current time, we consider the UAV position\
    \ (x,y), the segment determined by the current\n(CP) and next waypoint (CP + 1):\n\
    \x10\nwi\nx, wi\ny\n\x11\n,\n\x10\nwi+1\nx\n, wi+1\ny\n\x11\n.\n2.\nWe compute\
    \ the projection of the current point onto the current segment (PP). We identify\
    \ three\npossible cases by checking the relative position of the projection wrt\
    \ the segment’s end points\n(described by W): inside the segment (0 ≤ W ≤ 1)),\
    \ outside and located before the initial segment\nend (W < 0); outside and located\
    \ after the initial segment end (W > 1);\n3.\nWe compute the distance (D) from\
    \ the current point to the segment and the circle of radius L\n(proportional with\
    \ the UAV velocity) and further used to compute the heading vector.\n4.\nWe consider\
    \ the following cases:\ni.\nThe UAV is too far away, and the projection point\
    \ lies before the segment start point. Then,\nthe heading angle points towards\
    \ the projection point.\nii.\nThe UAV is suﬃciently close, and the projection\
    \ point lies before the segment start point.\nThen, the heading angle points towards\
    \ the start point.\niii.\nThe UAV is suﬃciently close to the segment end point,\
    \ or its projection onto the segment\nlies after the end point. Then, the current\
    \ segment is updated, and the procedure jumps to\nstep 4i.\nSensors 2020, 20,\
    \ 817\n10 of 25\niv.\nThe UAV is too far away, and its projection lies onto the\
    \ interior of the segment. Then,\nthe heading vector points towards the projection.\n\
    v.\nThe UAV is suﬃciently close, and its projection lies onto the interior of\
    \ the segment.\nThe heading angle is taken as the vector of length L in which\
    \ the tip lies on the segment\n(there are two possible tips; the one closer to\
    \ the segment end point is considered).\n5.\nGo to step 1.\nIn the loitering mode:\n\
    1.\nSelect the loitering center as the current waypoint.\n2.\nConstruct the circle\
    \ of radius L and centered in the current position of the UAV.\n3.\nIf the circle\
    \ does not intersect the loitering circle, move towards the projection point situated\
    \ on\nthe loitering circle.\n4.\nIf the proximity circle intersects the loitering\
    \ circle, take the heading vector along the tangent at\nthe intersection point\
    \ between loitering circle and proximity circle (there are two solutions, we\n\
    selected depending on the desired loitering rotation—clockwise or counterclockwise).\n\
    Note that all steps where a decision regarding the trajectory update is taken\
    \ consist in fact in a\ndecision about the UAV’s heading. Thus, for trajectory\
    \ tracking, only the heading angle is used as\ncontrol input. This suﬃces for\
    \ relatively simple trajectories and is robust against wind disturbances\n(as\
    \ later shown in the simulations).\n2.3. Relevant Data Extraction\nThe collected\
    \ data is hierarchically processed from the ground level, cluster head level,\
    \ UAV level\nup to the cloud. Alongside these steps, information is gradually\
    \ extracted through various methods\nthat enable local decisions based on the\
    \ conﬁguration of the system (thresholding, consensus, symbolic\naggregate approximation,\
    \ etc.).\nIn-ﬁeld data processing is ensured both at local level (independent\
    \ data ﬁltering) and decentralized\nat network level (through data exchange between\
    \ neighbor sensory nodes). The proposed data\nprocessing mechanisms, tailored\
    \ for in-ﬁeld level, are designed in order to ensure a substantial\nweighted average.\
    \ This step is found as ‘Enable consensus dialog’. Once the convergence is reached,\n\
    each node performs a routine for results analysis basically seeking to discover\
    \ and mark nodes with\ndivergent values. This information remains available alongside\
    \ the consensus value so that it can be\ninterrogated by the higher level of data\
    \ processing if needed. This is found in Figure 4 as ‘Analyze\nresults step’.\n\
    Aggregated data sets are achieved through diﬀerent methods. All seek for relevant\
    \ data points,\naiming to a reduced size set and providing at the same time a\
    \ satisfying reconstruction of the initial\ndata. The proposed method for data\
    \ aggregation is based on the minimum and maximum values\nextraction, computed\
    \ as global extremes for a predeﬁned period of time (e.g., a day). It is obvious\
    \ that\nthis method is suitable only for measurements that have a periodic behavior,\
    \ with smooth variations\nduring the day. A measurement for which this method\
    \ is suitable is the soil temperature. Conversely,\nchange detection is commonly\
    \ used for irregularly-shaped data sets. This method follows extraction of\nlocal\
    \ extreme points where trend changes occur.\nGiven a set of data points (xi, yi),\
    \ i = 1, . . . , n, trend ti is computed for each sequence\nmeasurements such\
    \ that for a measure m, (5),(6),(7) has to be true. If ti , ti+1, then it means\
    \ that a trend\nchange has occurred, and the data point (xi, yi) is added to the\
    \ relevant data set.\nxm\ni+1 − xm\ni > δm ⇒ tm\ni = 1,\n(5)\nxm\ni+1 − xm\ni\

    3.3. Data Processing Results \nAs previously discussed, the primary local distributed agreement is based on consensus among \n\
    the  clustered  sensing  nodes.  This  allows  the  nodes  to  have  a  unitary \
    \ representation  of  the \nmeasurements, under the assumption of limited variance in the geographical sensing area for one \n\
    cluster. The parameters that are sampled by the nodes include: air temperature, relative humidity, \n\
    soil temperature, soil moisture, and solar radiation.   \nFigure 18 illustrates the consensus results for two parameters: soil moisture and air temperature \n\
    in a cluster of five TelosB sensor nodes. These are obtained through simulation in a Contiki/COOJA \n\
    network environment starting from ground‐collected values. The main insight provided by this result \n\
    is  in  the  analysis  of  the  convergence  time  and  convergence  values  in \
    \ conjunction  with  fixed  or \ndynamic  tuning  parameters.  More  specifically, \
    \ by  adjusting  the  communication  frequency  and \nweighting the consensus algorithm based on the sensor location and confidence levels, we can guide \n\
    the algorithm with expert knowledge. This can result in acceleration of the process or in more reliable \n\
    consensus values. \n \n \n(a) \n(b) \nFigure 18. Consensus results for: (a) soil moisture and (b) air temperature. \n\
    Once local agreement has been established, relevant data extraction is performed at the cluster \n\
    head by means of the SAX method. In this case, we present the outcome for running the algorithm \n\
    on a data sample of around 10 days, with the consensus values stored at 30‐min intervals at one \n\
    Figure 18. Consensus results for: (a) soil moisture and (b) air temperature.\n\
    Once local agreement has been established, relevant data extraction is performed\
    \ at the cluster\nhead by means of the SAX method. In this case, we present the\
    \ outcome for running the algorithm on a\nSensors 2020, 20, 817\n21 of 25\ndata\
    \ sample of around 10 days, with the consensus values stored at 30-min intervals\
    \ at one cluster head\n(Table 2). The variations in the SAX string length correspond\
    \ to the parameterization of the method in\nterms of the number of segments to\
    \ divide the input time series into (nseg) and the alphabet size, i.e.,\nthe discrete\
    \ threshold levels numbers for classifying the processed values (alphabet_size).\
    \ The number\nof samples of the input data is 490, for nseg = 20, corresponding\
    \ to half daily patterns this is truncated\nto 480 as the total length of the\
    \ time series must be divisible with the number of segments. Inputs are\nz-normalized\
    \ for the computation of the assigned label. Data were collected in mid-July 2018.\n\

    \ erroneous sensor readings. \nThe second stage aims to optimize the data collection\
    \ time at the interface between the cluster head \nand the UAV acting as a data\
    \ mule. Based on the compressed representation of SAX segments, the \nresults\
    \ can be expanded and further processed at the decision level, in the cloud. At\
    \ the higher \nabstract layer in the cloud, the results presented in Table 2 can\
    \ be interpreted using state-of-the-art \ntext analytics tools. This is useful\

    and citations Figures and tables Abstract The Internet of Robotic Things is an
    emerging vision that brings together pervasive sensors and objects with robotic
    and autonomous systems. This survey examines how the merger of robotic and Internet
    of Things technologies will advance the abilities of both the current Internet
    of Things and the current robotic systems, thus enabling the creation of new,
    potentially disruptive services. We discuss some of the new technological challenges
    created by this merger and conclude that a truly holistic view is needed but currently
    lacking. Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) and robotics communities have
    so far been driven by different yet highly complementary objectives, the first
    focused on supporting information services for pervasive sensing, tracking and
    monitoring; the latter on producing action, interaction and autonomous behaviour.
    For this reason, it is increasingly claimed that the creation of an internet of
    robotic things (IoRT) combining the results from the two communities will bring
    a strong added value.1–3 Early signs of the IoT-robotics convergence can be seen
    in distributed, heterogeneous robot control paradigms like network robot systems4
    or robot ecologies,5 or in approaches such as ubiquitous robotics6–8 and cloud
    robotics9–12 that place resource-intensive features on the server side.13,14 The
    term ‘Internet of robotic things’ itself was coined in a report of ABI research1
    to denote a concept where sensor data from a variety of sources are fused, processed
    using local and distributed intelligence and used to control and manipulate objects
    in the physical world. In this cyber-physical perspective of the IoRT, sensor
    and data analytics technologies from the IoT are used to give robots a wider situational
    awareness that leads to better task execution. use cases include intelligent transportation15
    and companion robots.16 Later uses of the term IoRT in literature adopted alternative
    perspectives of this term: for example, one that focuses on the robust team communication,17–19
    and a ‘robot-aided IoT’ view where robots are just additional sensors.20,21 Cloud
    computing and the IoT are two non-robotic enablers in creating distributed robotic
    systems (see Figure 1). IoT technologies have three tenets22: (i) sensors proliferated
    in the environment and on our bodies; (ii) smart connected objects using machine-to-machine
    (M2M) communication; and (iii) data analytics and semantic technologies transforming
    raw sensor data. Cloud computing provides on-demand, networked access to a pool
    of virtualized hardware resources (processing, storage) or higher level services.
    Cloud infrastructure has been used by the IoT community to deploy scalable IoT
    platform services that govern access to (raw, processed or fused) sensor data.
    Processing the data streams generated by billions of IoT devices in a handful
    of centralized data centres brings concerns on response time latency, massive
    ingress bandwidth needs and data privacy. Edge computing (also referred to as
    fog computing, cloudlets) brings on-demand and elastic computational resources
    to the edge of the network, closer to the producers of data23. The cloud paradigm
    was also adopted by the robotics community, called cloud robotics9–12 for offloading
    resource-intensive tasks,13,14 for the sharing of data and knowledge between robots24
    and for reconfiguration of robots following an app-store model.25 Although there
    is an overlap between cloud robotics and IoRT, the former paradigm is more oriented
    towards providing network-accessible infrastructure for computational power and
    storage of data and knowledge, while the latter is more focused on M2M communication
    and intelligent data processing. The focus of this survey is on the latter, discussing
    the potential added value of the IoT-robotics crossover in terms of improved system
    abilities, as well as the new technological challenges posed by the crossover.
    Figure 1. The scope of this review paper is the IoT as enabler in distributed
    robotic systems. IoT: Internet of Things. As one of the goals of this survey is
    to inspire researchers on the potential of introducing IoT technologies in robotic
    systems and vice versa, we structure our discussion along the system abilities
    commonly found in robotic systems, regardless of specific robot embodiment or
    application domains. Finding a suitable taxonomy of abilities is a delicate task.
    In this work, we build upon an existing community effort and adopt the taxonomy
    of nine system abilities, defined in the euRobotics roadmap,26 which shapes the
    robotic research agenda of the European Commission. Interestingly, these abilities
    are closely related to the research challenges identified in the US Robotics roadmap27
    (see Figure 2). Figure 2. Mapping between the system abilities defined in the
    multi-annual roadmap of euRobotics26 – along which this review is structured –
    and the research challenges identified in the roadmap for US Robotics.27 Basic
    abilities Perception ability The sensor and data analytics technologies from the
    IoT can clearly give robots a wider horizon compared to local, on-board sensing,
    in terms of space, time and type of information. Conversely, placing sensors on-board
    mobile robots allows to position them in a flexible and dynamic way and enables
    sophisticated active sensing strategies. A key challenge of perception in an IoRT
    environment is that the environmental observations of the IoRT entities are spatially
    and temporally distributed.28 Some techniques must be put in place to allow robots
    to query these distributed data. Dietrich et al.29 propose to use local databases,
    one in each entity, where data are organized in a spatial hierarchy, for example,
    an object has a position relative to a robot, the robot is positioned in a room
    and so on. Other authors30,31 propose that robots send specific observation requests
    to the distributed entities, for example, a region and objects of interest: this
    may speed up otherwise intractable sensor processing problems (see Figure 3).
    Figure 3. Distributed cameras assist the robot in locating a charging station
    in an environment. The charging station was placed between a green and yellow
    visual marker (location A). Visual markers of the same colours were placed elsewhere
    in the environment to simulate distractors. Visual processing is performed on-demand
    on the camera nodes to inform the robot that the charging station is at location
    A and not at the distracting location B (Image from Chamberlain et al.30) (c)
    2016 IEEE. A key component of robots’ perception ability is getting knowledge
    of their own location, which includes the ability to build or update models of
    the environment.32 Despite great progress in this domain, self-localization may
    still be challenging in crowded and/or Global Positioning System (GPS)-denied
    indoor environments, especially if high reliability is demanded. Simple IoT-based
    infrastructures such as an radio frequency identification (RFID)-enhanced floor
    have been used to provide reliable location information to domestic robots.33
    Other approaches use range-based techniques on signals emitted by off-board infrastructure,
    such as Wi-Fi access points34 and visible light,35 or by IoT devices using protocols
    such as Ultra-Wideband (UWB),36 Zigbee37 or Bluetooth lowenergy.38,39 Motion ability
    The ability to move is one of the fundamental added values of robotic systems.
    While mechanical design is the key factor in determining the intrinsic effectiveness
    of robot mobility, IoT connectivity can assist mobile robots by helping them to
    control automatic doors and elevators, for example in assistive robotics40 and
    in logistic applications.41 IoT platform services and M2M and networking protocols
    can facilitate distributed robot control architectures in large-scale applications,
    such as last mile delivery, precision agriculture, and environmental monitoring.
    FIROS42 is a recent tool to connect mobile robots to IoT services by translating
    Robot Operating System (ROS)43 messages into messages grounded in Open Mobile
    Alliance APIs?. Such an interface is suited for robots to act as a mobile sensor
    that publishes its observations and makes them available to any interested IoT
    service. In application scenarios such as search and rescue, where communication
    infrastructure may be absent or damaged, mobile robots may need to set up ad hoc
    networks and use each other as forwarding nodes to maintain communication. While
    the routing protocols developed for mobile ad hoc networks can be readily applied
    in such scenarios, lower overhead and increased energy efficiency can be obtained
    when such protocols explicitly take into account the knowledge of robot’s planned
    movements and activities.44 Sliwa et al.45 propose a similar approach to minimize
    path losses in robot swarms. Manipulation ability While the core motivation of
    the IoT is to sense the environment, the one of robotics is to modify it. Robots
    can grasp, lift, hold and move objects via their end effectors. Once the robot
    has acquired the relevant features of an object, like its position and contours,
    the sequence of torques to be applied on the joints can be calculated via inverse
    kinematics. The added value of IoT is in the acquisition of the object’s features,
    including those that are not observable with the robot’s sensors but have an impact
    on the grasping procedure, such as the distribution of mass, for example, in a
    filled versus an empty cup. Some researchers attached RFID tags to objects that
    contain information about their size, shape and grasping points5. Deyle et al.46
    embedded RFID reader antennas in the finger of a gripper: Differences in the signal
    strength across antennas were used to more accurately position the hand before
    touching the object. Longer range RFID tags were used to locate objects in a kitchen47
    or in smart factories,48,49 as well as to locate the robots themselves.50 Higher
    level abilities Decisional autonomy Decisional autonomy refers to the ability
    of the system to determine the best course of action to fulfil its tasks and missions.26
    This is mostly not considered in IoT middleware:51–53 applications just call an
    actuation API of so-called smart objects that hide the internal complexity.28
    Roboticists often rely on Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning techniques54,55
    based on predictive models of the environment and of the possible actions. The
    quality of the plans critically depends on the quality of these models and of
    the estimate of the initial state. In this respect, the improved situational awareness
    that can be provided by an IoT environment (see “Perception ability” section)
    can lead to better plans. Human-aware task planners56 use knowledge of the intentions
    of the humans inferred through an IoT environment to generate plans that respect
    constraints on human interaction (see Figure 4). Figure 4. The vacuum cleaning
    robot adapts its plan to avoid interference in the kitchen (Figure from Cirillo
    et al.56) (c) 2010 ACM. IoT also widens the scope of decisional autonomy by making
    more actors and actions available, such as controllable elevators and doors.40,57
    However, IoT devices may dynamically become available or unavailable,58 which
    challenges classical multi-agent planning approaches. A solution is to do planning
    in terms of abstract services, which are mapped to actual devices at runtime.59
    Interaction ability This is the ability of a robot to interact physically, cognitively
    and socially either with users, operators or other systems around it.26 While
    M2M protocols60 can be directly adopted in robotic software, we focus here on
    how IoT technologies can facilitate human–robot interaction at functional (commanding
    and programming) and social levels, as well as a means for tele-interaction. Functional
    pervasive IoT sensors can make the functional means of human–robot interaction
    more robust. Natural language instructions are a desirable way to instruct robots,
    especially for non-expert users, but they are often vague or contain implicit
    assumptions.61,62 The IoT can provide information on the position and state of
    objects to disambiguate these instructions (see Figure 5). Gestures are another
    intuitive way to command robots, for instance, by pointing to objects. Recognition
    of pointing gestures from sensors on-board the robot only works within a limited
    field of view.63 External cameras provide a broader scene perspective that can
    improve gesture recognition.64 Wearable sensors have also been used, for example,
    Wolf et al.65 demonstrated a sleeve that measures forearm muscle movements to
    command robot motion and manipulation. Figure 5. Depending on the state of the
    environment, a natural language instructions results in different actions to be
    performed (Image from Misra et al.62) (c) 2016 SAGE. Social body cues like gestures,
    voice or face expression can be used to estimate the user’s emotional state66
    and make the robot respond to it.67,68 The integration with body-worn IoT sensors
    can improve this estimate by measuring physiological signals: Leite et al.69 measured
    heart rate and skin conductance to estimate engagement, motivation and attention
    during human–robot interaction. Others have used these estimates to adapt the
    robot’s interaction strategy, for example, in the context of autism therapy70
    or for stress relievement.71 Tele-interaction robots have also been used besides
    IoT technologies for remote interaction, especially in healthcare. Chan et al.72
    communicate hugs and manipulations between persons via sensorized robots. Al-Taee
    et al.73 use robots to improve the tele-monitoring of diabetes patients by reading
    out the glucose sensor and vocalizing the feedback from the carer (see Figure
    6). Finally, in the GiraffPlus project?, a tele-presence robot was combined with
    environmental sensors to provide health-related data to a remote therapist. Figure
    6. The robot acts as a master Bluetooth device that reads out glucose sensors
    and transfers them to the caregivers. The robot is then used to provide verbal
    information concerning the patient’s diet, insulin bolus/intake, and so on (Image
    from Al-Taee et al.73) (c) 2017 IEEE. Cognitive ability By reasoning on and inferring
    knowledge from experience, cognitive robots are able to understand the relationship
    between themselves and the environment, between objects, and to assess the possible
    impact of their actions. Some aspects of cognition were already discussed in the
    previous sections, for example, multi-modal perception, deliberation and social
    intelligence. In this section, we focus on the cognitive tasks of reasoning and
    learning in an IoRT multi-actor setting. Knowledge models are important components
    of cognitive architectures.74,75 Ontologies are a popular technique in both IoT
    and robotics for structured knowledge. Example ontologies describing the relationship
    between an agent and its physical environment are the Semantic Sensor Network,76
    IoT-A77 and the IEEE Ontologies for Robotics and Automation78 (ORA). For example,
    Jorge et al.79 use the ORA ontology for spatial reasoning between two robots that
    must coordinate in providing a missing tool to a human. Recent works??? harness
    the power of the cloud to derive knowledge from multi-modal data sources, such
    as human demonstrations, natural language or raw sensor data observations?, and
    to provide a virtual environment for simulating robot control policies. In an
    IoRT environment, these knowledge engines will be able to incorporate even more
    sources of data. In the IoT domain, cognitive techniques were recently proposed
    for the management of distributed architectures.80,81 Here, the system self-organizes
    a pipeline of data analytics modules on a distributed set of sensor nodes, edge
    cloud and so on. To our knowledge, the inclusion of robots in these pipelines
    has not yet been considered. If robots subscribe themselves as additional actors
    in the environment, then this gives rise to a new strand of problems in distributed
    consensus and collaboration for the IoT, because robots typically have a larger
    degree of autonomy than traditional IoT ‘smart’ objects, and because they are
    able to modify the physical environment leading to complex dependencies and interactions.
    System level abilities Configurability This is the ability of a robotic system
    to be configured to perform a given task or reconfigured to perform different
    tasks.26 IoT is mainly instrumental in supporting software configurability, in
    particular to orchestrate the concerted configuration of multiple devices, each
    contributing different capabilities and cooperating to the achievement of complex
    objectives. However, work in IoT does not explicitly address the requirement of
    IoRT systems to exchange continuous streams of data while interacting with the
    physical world. This requirement is most prominent in the domains of logistic
    and of advanced manufacturing, where a fast reaction to disruptions is needed,
    together with flexible adaptation to varying production objectives. Kousi et al.82
    developed a service-oriented architecture to support autonomous, mobile production
    units which can fuse data from a peripheral sensing network to detect disturbances.
    Michalos et al.83 developed a distributed system for data sharing and coordination
    of human–robot collaborative operations, connected to a centralized task planner.
    Production lines have also been framed as multi-agent systems84,85 equipped with
    self-descriptive capabilities to reduce set-up and changeover times. General purpose
    middlewares have also been developed to support distributed task coordination
    and control in IoRT environments. The Ubiquitous Network Robot Platform86 is a
    general purpose middleware for IoRT environments (see Figure 7). It manages the
    handover of functionality for services using real and virtual robots, for example
    reserving a real assistant robot using a virtual robot on the smartphone. Figure
    7. The Ubiquitous Network Robot Platform is a two-layered platform. The LPF configures
    a robotic system in a single area. The GPF is a middle-layer between the LPFs
    of different areas and the service applications (Image from Nishio et al.86).
    LPF: local platform; GPF: global platform (c) 2013 Springer-Verlag. Configurability
    can be coupled with decision ability to lead to the ability of a system to self-configure.
    Self-configuration is especially challenging in an IoRT system since the configuration
    algorithms must take into account both the digital interactions between the actors
    and their physical interactions through the real world. The ‘PEIS Ecology’ framework5
    includes algorithms for the self-configuration of a robot ecology: complex functionality
    is achieved by composing a set of devices with sensing, acting and/or computational
    capabilities, including robots. A shared tuple-space blackboard allows for high
    level collaboration and dynamic reconfiguration.87 Adaptability This is the ability
    of the system to adapt to different work scenarios, environments and conditions.26
    This includes the ability to adapt to unforeseen events, faults, changing tasks
    and environments and unexpected human behaviour. The key enablers for adaptability
    are the perception, decisional and configuration abilities as described above.
    Hence, we will now discuss relevant application domains and supporting platforms.
    Mobile robots are used in precision agriculture for the deployment of herbicide,
    fertilizer or irrigation.88 These robots need to adapt to spatio-temporal variations
    of crop and field patterns, crop sizes, light and weather conditions, soil quality,
    and so on.89 Wireless Sensor Network (WSNs) can provide the necessary information,90,91
    for example, knowledge of soil moisture may be used to ensure accurate path tracking.92,93
    Gealy et al.94 use a robot to adjust the drip rate of individual water emitters
    to allow for plant-level control of irrigation. This is a notable example of how
    robots are used to adjust IoT devices. Some platforms supporting adaptation of
    IoRT have also been showcased in the context of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL).
    Building on OSGi, a platform for IoT home automation, AIOLOS exposes robots and
    IoT devices as reusable and shareable services, and automatically optimizes the
    runtime deployment across distributed infrastructure, for example, by placing
    a shared data processing service closer to the source sensor.95,96 Bacciu et al.97,98
    deploy recurrent neural networks on distributed infrastructure to automatically
    learn user preferences, and to detect disruptive environmental changes like the
    addition of a mirror.99 Dependability Dependability is a multifaceted attribute,
    covering the reliability of hardware and software robotic components, safety guarantees
    when cooperating with humans and the degree to which systems can continue their
    missions when failures or other unforeseen circumstances occur. In this section,
    we follow the classification of means of dependability identified by Crestani
    et al.100 A first means of dependability is to forecast faults or conflicts. For
    instance, robots in a manufacturing plant must stop if an operator comes too near.
    IoT technology can provide useful tools to realize this. Rampa et al.101 mounted
    a network of small tranceivers in a robotic cell and estimated the user position
    from the perturbations of the radio field. Other researchers embedded sensors
    in clothing and on the helmet. Qian et al.102 developed a probabilistic framework
    to avoid conflicts of robot and human motion, by combining observations from fixed
    cameras and on-board sensors with historical knowledge on human trajectories (see
    Figure 8). Figure 8. Sensory data from laser and global cameras are fed to the
    perception module, together with human motion patterns learned by the modelling
    module. Then three types of abstracted observations are inputted to the controller:
    PAO, PRO and RSO. Using a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process, a suitable
    navigational policy is generated (Image from Qian et al.102). PAO: people’s action
    observation; PRO: people-robot relation observation; RSO: robot state observation
    (c) 2013 SAGE. In a marine context, acoustic sensor networks have been used to
    provide information on water current and ship positions to a path planner for
    underwater gliders, to avoid collisions when they come to the surface103 or to
    preserve energy.104 A second means of dependability is robust system engineering.
    This can take new forms in an IoRT system. For instance, mobile wireless communication
    is a key enabler for industry 4.0, where both field devices, fixed machines and
    mobile AGV are connected. IoT protocols such as WirelessHart or Zigbee Pro were
    designed to address the industry concerns on reliability, security and cost.105
    When mobility is involved, however, these protocols must be complemented by meshing
    technologies to cope with handovers and with the massive presence of metal.106,107
    The last means is fault tolerance, which allows the system to keep working even
    when components fail. Redundancy is key to fault tolerance, and the IoRT enables
    redundancy of sensors, information and actuation. Data fusion from both on-board
    and environment sensors, however, requires a good understanding of the spatial
    and temporal relationship between the observations from different sensors. Such
    relationships have been explicitly modelled, for example, in the Positioning Ontology79
    (POS), or implicitly learned as part of modular deep neural network controller.108
    Conclusion Robotics and IoT are two terms each covering a myriad of technologies
    and concepts. In this review, we have unravelled the added value of the crossover
    of both technology domains into nine system abilities. The IoT advantages exploited
    by roboticists are mostly distributed perception and M2M protocols. Conversely,
    the IoT has so far mostly exploited robots for active sensing strategies. Current
    IoRT incarnations are almost uniquely found in vertical application domains, notably
    AAL, precision agriculture and Industry 4.0. Domain-agnostic solutions, for example,
    to integrate robots in IoT middleware platforms, are only emerging. It is our
    conviction that the IoRT should go beyond the readings of ‘IoT-aided robots’ or
    ‘Robot-enhanced IoT’. We hope that this survey may stimulate researchers from
    both disciplines to start work towards an ecosystem of IoT agents, robots and
    the cloud that combines both the above readings in a holistic way. Declaration

    of Things (IoT) is an emerging technology that makes people''s lives smart by
    conquering a plethora of diverse application and service areas. In near future,
    the fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks provide the connectivity for this
    IoT ecosystem. It has been carefully designed to facilitate the exponential growth
    in the IoT field. Network slicing is one of the key technologies in the 5G architecture
    that has the ability to divide the physical network into multiple logical networks
    (i.e., slices) with different network characteristics. Therefore, network slicing
    is also a key enabler of realisation of IoT in 5G. Network slicing can satisfy
    the various networking demands by heterogeneous IoT applications via dedicated
    slices. In this survey, we present a comprehensive analysis of the exploitation
    of network slicing in IoT realisation. We discuss network slicing utilisation
    in different IoT application scenarios, along with the technical challenges that
    can be solved via network slicing. Furthermore, integration challenges and open
    research problems related to the network slicing in the IoT realisation are also
    discussed in this paper. Finally, we discuss the role of other emerging technologies
    and concepts, such as blockchain and Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning
    (AI/ML) in network slicing and IoT integration. Published in: IEEE Communications

    Internet has evolved over the last four decades, from simple peer-to-peer networks
    to an advance IoT ecosystem (Figure 1). With the ubiquitous utilisation of IoTs,
    everything around us is becoming smart. It is possible to connect people and things
    at any time from any place with network access, to receive information of the
    thing, to operate the thing or even both, to make the life of the mankind easier
    [1]. The number of connected devices proliferates exponentially. According to
    Machina research, it is expected that the number of connected devices will be
    27 billion by 2024 [2]. Diversity of these IoT applications will also expand from
    simple smart home solutions to mission-critical health care systems [3]. These
    application scenarios demand various performance requirements such as low latency,
    ultra-reliability, high security and high data rates. Fig. 1. Evolution of the
    Internet. Show All Most of these connected devices will use the wireless infrastructure
    to communicate. However, the existing wireless infrastructure is not able to handle
    the rapid growth of IoT connections along with typical mobile connections. Moreover,
    such networks are incapable of satisfying the heterogeneous QoS requirements for
    different IoT application scenarios. As a solution, the 5G architecture is designed
    with the aid of various new technologies to handle these requirements. Software
    Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), Multi-access
    Edge Computing (MEC) and network slicing are some of the predominant technologies
    in 5G architecture [4]–[7]. SDN offers the ability to control the network traffic
    routing centrally and intelligently, using software applications [8]. Centralised
    control, network programmability and abstraction are the key benefits of SDN.
    NFV is a concept which is used to package network functions such routing, load
    balancing and firewalls as software applications, so that they can run on commodity
    and general hardware devices [9]. Tight coupling between network functions and
    specific hardware units was a huge bottleneck to the evolution of such network
    functions. This can be eliminated by using NFV. Providing cloud computing capabilities
    to the edge network is the main purpose of MEC technology [10]. It will minimise
    the network congestion on backhaul and improve the resource optimisation, user
    experience and the overall performance of the network [11]. Dividing the physical
    network into separate logical networks known as slices is called network slicing.
    Each slice can be configured to offer specific network capabilities and network
    characteristics [12]. Thus, the End-to-End (E2E) network slicing can help to deploy
    various 5G based services [13]–[18]. SDN and NFV can be identified as key enabling
    technologies for network slicing realisation in 5G networks [19]. A. Role of Network
    Slicing for IoT In a nutshell, 5G network architecture is designed to support
    three main fundamental service classes: enhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB), massive
    Machine Type Communications (mMTC) and Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications
    (URLLC) [12]. Each service class has a diverse set of network requirements. Therefore,
    the creation of an E2E network slice for each service scenario is needed, to allocate
    required resources to fulfill the such requirements. Similarly, different IoT
    applications demand different networking requirements. For instance, more than
    99.99% reliability level and less than 1 ms E2E latency are required for mission-critical
    communication IoT use cases. 10−9 packet loss rate and E2E latency range of 250
    μs to 10 ms are required factory automation applications [20]. Such diverse requirements
    of different IoT applications can be fulfilled by allocating a dedicated E2E network
    slice for each application (Figure 2). Fig. 2. E2E Network Slicing. Show All The
    Network Slice as a Service (NSlaaS) concept allows operators to create customised
    network slices for their customers as a service. This generates a new business
    model for Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) [31], [32]. Moreover, an E2E network
    slicing framework that has the ability to horizontally slice computation and communication
    resources was proposed in [33] for supporting vertical industry applications.
    Network slicing improves the efficiency of resource utilisation by dynamically
    adjusting network resources between the slices. It is possible to implement autonomous
    systems for such resource allocations and dynamic adjustment of resources [34].
    This method can be used to improve the scalability of future IoT applications.
    High security and privacy for sensitive IoT applications, such as healthcare,
    can be achieved through the slice isolation. For instance, a secure service-oriented
    authentication framework has been proposed by Ni et al. for the realisation of
    IoT services in 5G networks through fog computing and network slicing [35]. Since
    IoT devices are generally resource-constraint, they are highly vulnerable to attacks.
    The rapid growth in the number of IoT devices and pervasiveness are also attracting
    many attackers to the IoT ecosystem [36]. An adversary can easily dominate IoT
    devices and can lead them to generate Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks
    to the network. The severity of these kinds of attacks can be minimised through
    isolating IoT applications using network slicing. Also, dynamic allocation of
    idle resources to the victimised network slice is possible to keep the service
    without any degradation during an attack. B. Paper Motivation IoT expands its
    roots over each and every field by permuting unintelligible dumb items into smart
    things over the last few years. A large number of vertical industries are engaged
    in developing smart solutions at a very high speed and the community rapidly adopts
    these into their lifestyle. Multiple surveys related to IoT have been conducted
    during the past few years over several subareas. Standardisation, security, architecture,
    privacy, trust, visions, challenges and future research directions are some key
    areas that are exploited in existing surveys and researches. Network slicing is
    a neoteric technology and numerous network slicing-related areas have to be investigated.
    The standardisation of network slicing is still ongoing by telecommunication organisations.
    Though it is possible to find surveys and researches associated with network slicing
    within the past few years, most of them tend to be conceptual rather than technical.
    Table II consists of a summary of existing surveys related to network slicing.
    Slicing architecture, technologies that support network slicing realisation, standards,
    security and use cases are the areas that are covered by most surveys. TABLE I
    Summary of Acronyms TABLE II Summary of Important Surveys on Network Slicing In
    [21], they have carried out a comprehensive review of network slicing with enabling
    technologies, standardisation efforts, industrial projects that accelerate network-slicing
    usage and future research directions. The latest status of 3GPP standardisation,
    solutions to reduce the complexity introduced by network slicing and future research
    areas discussed in [22]. Network slicing architecture and some particular technologies
    that can be used with network slicing are discussed in [23]. Reference [24] discussed
    a significant use case in future IoT: smart grid, E2E network slicing with concepts,
    technologies, solutions and use cases are considered in [19]. The network slicing
    concept with aspects that support network slicing realisation is discussed in
    [25]. In [26], Foukas et al. reviewed state-of-the-art network slicing and they
    have presented a framework and evaluated it under the maturity of current proposals.
    Resource allocation algorithms are analysed in [27]. Issues in allocation, isolation,
    guaranteeing the inter-operability of the resources between slices discussed in
    [28]. Enabling smart services in future networks with network slicing and different
    parameters in network slicing are discussed in [29]. Future research areas of
    network slicing with open research problems are highlighted in [19], [21], [22],
    [25], [26], [28], [29]. As with the references that we could find, there is no
    single survey that specifically analyses the contribution of network slicing to
    the IoT realisation. Since network slicing is the prominent technology that reinforces
    IoT realisation in 5G networks, it is pertinent to analyse the associativity between
    network slicing and IoT, in terms of technical aspects, applications and challenges.
    C. Our Contribution In our survey, we broadly investigate how network slicing
    will overcome the challenges of IoT technologies and their related applications
    in future networks. Since there are enough surveys related to network slicing
    integration technologies, such as SDN and NFV, they will not be covered in this
    survey. A comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art technical aspects that
    can be used to IoT realisation via network slicing will be provided through the
    survey. The impact of the emerging technologies and concepts, such as blockchain
    and AI/ML, in network slicing and different IoT applications will be discussed
    in here. Our contribution to the IoT realisation via network slicing through this
    paper is enumerated as follows. Technical aspects that can be improved via network
    slicing in the IoT realisation. Detailed discussion on the utilisation of network
    slicing for the realisation of divergent IoT use cases with different network
    requirements. A comprehensive analysis of the technical challenges of network
    slicing that will rise due to the advancement of the IoT. A concise summary of

    the impact of the emerging technologies in network slicing and IoT. A pool of
    future research directions in applying network slicing on several IoT applications
    and technical aspects. D. Paper Organization The paper consists of nine sections
    and the organisation is as follows. Section II provides the background knowledge
    of network slicing in order to understand the concept. Section III focuses on
    improving the technical aspects related to IoT via network slicing. Scalability,
    dynamicity, security, privacy, QoS, E2E orchestration and resource allocation
    and prioritisation are discussed in here. Network slicing utilisation, in several

    Section IX concludes the paper. Graphical representation of the paper organisation
    is shown in Figure 3. We included the definitions of the frequently used acronyms
    in Table I. Fig. 3. Paper Organization. Show All SECTION II. Network Slicing A.
    What Is Network Slicing? Future mobile networks will have heterogeneous service
    requirements due to the wide set of new networking services. Thus, the ‘one size
    fits all’ networking concept is not applicable for 5G and beyond. Next Generation
    Mobile Network(NGMN) Alliance first introduced the network slicing concept in
    2015 to address the above issue. Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) considers
    network slicing as a key feature in 5G networks [11]. The concept of dividing
    the physical network into multiple logical networks (network slices) so that each
    logical network can be specialised to provide specific network capabilities and
    characteristics for a particular use case can be identified as network slicing
    [18]. 3GPP defines network slicing as a “technology that enables the operator
    to create networks, customised to provide optimised solutions for different market
    scenarios which demand diverse requirements (e.g., in terms of functionality,
    performance and isolation)” [37]. According to [19], network slicing is built
    upon seven main principles: isolation, elasticity, automation, programmability,
    customisation, E2E and hierarchical abstraction. B. Network Slicing Architecture
    As stated by NGMN, network slicing architecture consists of three layers: infrastructure
    layer, network slice instance layer and service instance layer [38]. Infrastructure
    layer is responsible for providing physical or virtual resources such as storage,
    computing resource and connectivity. Network slice instance layer which runs over
    the infrastructure layer, consists of NSIs which form E2E logical network slices.
    Service instance layer which runs over all other layers, represents end user and
    business services. These services will be provided via service instances by the
    network operator or by a third party. A functional network slice basically consists
    of two subslices: the RAN subslice, specific to Next-Generation Radio Access Network
    (NG RAN) and the core subslice, specific to core network. An overview of the network
    slicing architecture is shown in Figure 4 and it mainly consists of four segments:
    RAN subslice, slice-paring functions, core subslice and the NSM. Fully data flow
    of some particular applications throughout the network is shown in the Figure
    4. A fully functional network slice is able to route and control a particular
    packet over the network without influencing other slices. Fig. 4. Overall Network
    Slicing Architecture. Show All Multiple types of User Equipment (UE) can be connected
    through air interface or fixed-line interface. Thus, RAN is sliced according to
    different tenant requirements of each application. Radio resource management,
    slice specific admission control policies, the configuration rules for Control
    Plane (CP) and User Plane (UP) functions and UE awareness on the RAN configuration
    for the different services are the key design aspects for RAN slicing [39]. Separation
    of RAN resources can be achieved through frequency, time, code, hardware equipment,
    software and other dimensions [12]. RAN subslice and core subslice will be connected
    through slice-paring functions. Paring among RAN/core slices can be 1:1 or 1:N,
    e.g., a RAN slice could be connected with multiple core slices [33]. Core network-related
    functionalities related to a particular application will be provided via a core
    slice. Core network resources can be sliced over servers, virtual machines or
    containers or hardware elements. Logical separation between CP and UP functions
    and the corresponding implemented VNFs should be considered while designing CN
    slices. All the operational and management tasks related to NSIs will be facilitated
    via the NSM. NSM plays a key role in network slicing architecture and provides
    ample services. Composition and deployment of new Network Slice Templates (NSTs)
    is a significant service provided by NSM. NST is the blueprint of the NSIs and
    it is fabricated according to the particular requirements of the tenants using
    the network capabilities in each technical domain. NSI-related activities such
    as status monitoring, scale in/out and destruction are some other functionalities
    provided by the NSM. A network slice consists of network functions and those network
    functions can be categorised as slice-specific network functions and slice-independent
    network functions. Since there is no consensus on selecting slice-independent
    network functions, this categorisation is considered as an unresolved design issue
    in network slicing realisation in 5G networks [40]. Due to the relative ease of
    implementing core NFs as software applications, core slicing is a less complex
    task than RAN slicing. C. Different Types of Network Slices Network slices can
    be categorised using several models: vertical and horizontal, static and dynamic
    and RAN and core. RAN and core slicing have been discussed earlier. Vertical network
    slicing: This can be defined as partitioning the network according to the use
    cases, whilst simplifying the traditional QoS problem. Here, each network domain
    will be sliced and then those slices will be paired using the slice paring functions
    to create the complete slice. With the advent of 5G, several new applications,
    such as smart wearables, Augmented Reality (AR)/ Virtual Reality (VR) and UHD
    video, became increasingly popular among the community and for each application,
    a vertical network slice can be allocated. Few vertical network slices can be
    identified in 4G LTE either: NB-IoT slice and MTC slice [33]. Horizontal network
    slicing: A large amount of traffic is generated at the very edge of the network.
    Through edge computing and computation offloading, the generated traffic flow
    can be made non-uniform. This scenario can be identified as horizontal network
    slicing. It removes the need of high-resource requirements like computation, communication
    and storage in a device itself. Complex tasks that required high computation power
    can be handed over to the next higher layer. As an example, AR and VR devices
    need a very high computation capability, which cannot be provided through existing
    hardware that can be realised through edge computing technologies. Vertical and
    horizontal network slicing is possible with static and dynamic network slicing.
    Static network slicing: In here, network slices will be pre-instantiated and devices
    need to select the slice which it is going to have the connection. Dynamic network
    slicing: Operators are able to dynamically design, deploy, customise and optimise
    the slices according to the service requirements or conditions in the network
    [41]. It encourages the emergence of the novel concept known as Network Slice
    as a Service(NSaaS). D. Network Slice Life Cycle NSI life cycle can be divided
    into four phases: preparation, commissioning, operation and decommissioning (Figure
    5). Preparation phase Life cycle starts from the preparation phase and NSI does
    not exist in this phase. Tasks in this phase are as follows. NST creation and
    verification. Preparation of necessary network environment which is used to facilitate
    the NSI life cycle. Capacity planning of the network slice. Onboarding NSTs. Evaluation
    of the network slice requirements. Preparation of any other requirements in the
    network. Commissioning phase: In this phase, NSI will be created from the NST.
    Tasks in here: Allocating the required network resources. Performing the necessary
    configurations to facilitate the slice requirements. Network slice will be ready
    for the operation phase after this phase. Operation phase: This phase consists
    of multiple subtasks related to network slice instance: Activation: Activating
    the NSI is done in here through the processes, such as diverting traffic to the
    slice and provisioning databases. Supervision: NSI will be continuously supervised.
    Key Performance Indicator (KPI) monitoring: NSI will be continuously monitored.
    Modification: Upgrading NSI, reconfiguration, changes in NSI topology, association
    and disassociation of network functions with NSI, NSI scaling and altering NSI
    capacity will be handled under here. Deactivation: Taking the NSI out of the active
    duty is done in here. Decommissioning phase: Reclamation of dedicated resources.
    Reclamation of configurations from the shared/dependent resources. After this
    phase, the NSI does not exist anymore. Fig. 5. Network Slicing Life Cycle. Show
    All SECTION III. The Role of Network Slicing in IoT Realization This section focuses
    on the technical aspects that can be improved for the IoT realisation via network
    slicing. Improving scalability, dynamicity, security, privacy, QoS, and E2E orchestration,
    through network slicing, are discussed here. A. Improving Scalability Scalability,
    often a sign of stability and competitiveness, is an attribute that is used to
    describe the ability of a process, software, organisation, or network, to grow
    and manage increased demand [42]. A proper scalable network should be able to
    handle the influx of traffic while utilising a limited number of resources. Network
    slicing has been identified by 3GPP as a technology to improve the flexibility
    and scalability in networking systems including IoT networks [43]. Software-based
    network functions in network slices allow deploying network functions according
    to the network traffic to achieve scalability. 1) Description of the Limitation:
    The number of connected IoT devices will be exponentially increasing in modern
    telecommunication networks with heterogeneous network requirements. According
    to the statistics, the number of IoT devices in 2020 which is 31 billion devices,
    will increase to 75 billion IoT devices by 2025, and 127 new IoT connections will
    be established at every second [44]. This growth of IoT devices will be under
    myriads of new IoT based applications such as smart healthcare, smart grid, autonomous
    vehicles, industrial automation and AR/VR technologies. Frequent connections and
    disconnections of nodes of various applications with the network are possible.
    It might pave the way to cause performance degradation, as well as the inability
    to fulfill the network requirements of a diverse set of applications. To handle
    these recurring changes in the IoT traffic flow, the network should be scalable.
    2) Benefits of Using Network Slicing: The amount of the IoT traffic flow through
    the network is not always the same. Due to the energy saving communication links,
    IoT devices operate in sleep and wake cycles. This causes network resources to
    be idle or over-utilised from time to time. Network slicing facilitates the dynamic
    allocation of idle network resources of a particular network slice to another
    slice that demands high resource requirements. This process improves the scalability
    of the IoT network and finally, it leads to enhance the network performance, increase
    the efficiency of resource utilisation and reduce the infrastructure cost [38].
    3) Existing Slicing Based Solutions: According to the proposed existing solutions,
    network slicing is identified as a solution to improve the scalability of the
    5G based IoT networks. In [45], they concluded that the network slicing has the
    potential to address diverse requirements of 5G IoT networks that finally lead
    to improve the scalability of future IoT applications. Their solution is more
    conceptual and implementations have not been provided. The presented dynamic network
    slicing framework to improve the scalability of fog networks in [46] needs to
    extend to 5G core network. Furthermore, AI/ML-based prediction algorithms can
    be developed to enhance resource allocation that supports improving scalability
    of the IoT networks. B. Improving Dynamicity Dynamicity describes the continuously
    changing nature of something. Introduction of IoT and IoT application will change
    the fixed nature of the traditional telecommunication networks. Dynamicity should
    be a key requirement for 5G and beyond network to facilitate heterogeneous IoT
    ecosystem and also to optimise resource utilisation. 1) Description of the Limitation:
    IoT requires to accomplish dynamicity of its network facilities in two main scenarios:
    dynamic network resource requirements of IoT applications, and rapid temporary
    network deployments for emergency IoT applications. The quantity of resource is
    approximately remains constant for a long period in most telecommunication networks.
    Such limited and constant resources have to be optimally utilised among heterogeneous
    networking applications including IoT applications. The amount of resource utilization
    dynamically varies according to the traffic demand which leads to resources been
    under-utilised or over-utilised time to time. By nature, IoT applications are
    extremely dynamic and their traffic patters are fluctuating constantly. Not only
    allocation of dedicated portions of the physical network for different IoT applications,
    but also dynamically change of the resource quantity of those portions according
    to traffic flow, are a vital requirement to operate an efficient IoT services.
    Moreover, IoT uses in applications such as emergency situations (floods, earthquakes)
    and military scenarios. Hence, rapid deployment of temporary IoT networks is required
    to facilitate communication requirements of such IoT applications. The solution
    should be fast and effortlessly deployable, and cost-effective. 2) Benefits of
    Using Network Slicing: Network slicing can support to eliminate the static nature
    of the networks to make them dynamic. Dynamic slice allocation for heterogeneous
    IoT applications and dynamic resource allocation between slices are two ways of
    improving dynamicity of the networks via network slicing. Learning theory schemes
    such as deep learning and reinforcement learning, support to predict user demands
    and change the resource allocation of slices dynamically according to the predictions
    [29]. Moreover, network slicing can be used for the realization of IoT applications
    in critical situations. Network slicing allows rapid deployment of dedicated network
    slices with relatively effortless configurations over the public network. Thus,
    the slicing based approach is cost-effective and faster than deploying whole new
    networks for each IoT application. In this way, network slicing provides the required
    dynamicity for IoT applications. 3) Existing Slicing Based Solutions: Improving
    dynamicity in the 5G network through network slicing is a favoured area among
    researchers. Two areas of enabling dynamicity in network slicing, i.e., dynamic
    resource allocation [47], [48] and dynamic slice creations for different applications
    [49], that finally improve dynamicity of IoT networks have been addressed in existing
    solutions. Moreover, efficient resource allocation algorithms needs to be formulated
    to improve dynamicity. C. Improving Security Security is a fundamental requirement
    in IoT systems. Billions of resource-constrained devices in heterogeneous IoT
    applications are now connected into people’s day-to-day lives. Because they share
    sensitive information or are involved in safety-critical operations [57], attackers
    tend to move towards IoT applications. 1) Description of the Limitation: Most
    of the IoT devices are resource constraints in design. Thus, it is difficult to
    implement security solutions on IoT devices. Device vendors tend to use common
    credentials for IoT devices and most of device consumers do not care to change
    these default credentials. This increases the vulnerability of the IoT devices
    to dictionary attacks, while being used by consumers [58]. This will help adversaries
    gain control of the IoT devices. Such potential reasons may result in a series
    of different types of attacks in IoT, such as Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS),
    Man In The Middle (MITM), Zero-day, IoT botnets and ransomware [59]–[62]. Network-level
    security solutions are vital requisites to mitigate these attacks. Security requirements
    are diverse in various IoT applications. For instance, security requirements in
    smart healthcare applications are completely different from that of a smart grid
    scenario. Therefore, different IoT security mechanisms are needed to fulfill these
    diverse security requirements [63] of each IoT application in a telecommunication
    network. 2) Benefits of Using Network Slicing: Network slicing can be used to
    implement various security solutions for the plethora of IoT applications. Slice
    isolation facilitates reducing the impact of the security attacks, as well as
    protecting sensitive information collected via IoT devices. Dynamic deployment
    of security NFs in the slices allows to tackle the attacks in run-time, without
    affecting other IoT applications. The ability to create quarantine slices to isolate
    devices that have suspicious behaviours facilitates to operate those devices under
    tighter restrictions, until taking necessary actions. In this way, network slicing
    can be beneficial in improving security of IoT applications. Table III summarises
    the possible attacks in the IoT applications, along with the possible solutions
    that can be provided via network slicing to mitigate those. TABLE III Key IoT
    Security Attacks 3) Existing Slicing Based Solutions: According to the existing
    research work, network slicing is identified as a way of improving security of
    5G IoT applications. In [50] and [64], they have proposed methods to mitigate
    IoT based DDoS attacks through slice isolation and edge computing respectively.
    While secure keying scheme for network slicing was presented in [56], service-oriented
    authentication framework was presented in [35]. However, new scientific investigations
    have to be conducted in mitigating other types of security attacks by using network
    slicing. D. Improving Privacy Along with the expansion of IoT systems worldwide,
    the necessity of schemes for protecting the privacy of exchanged IoT data has
    increased. Preserving data privacy plays an ever-increasing role in the IoT applications,
    which collect sensitive measurements [65]. 1) Description of the Limitation: The
    worldwide spreading of IoT devices results in the need for transmitting collected
    data to remote data centres that requires to be further processed. This has to
    follow several data privacy standards and regulations, which may be international
    or specialised for a particular geographical region, such as General Data Protection
    Regulation (GDPR) [66]. Implementing this diverse set of standards and regulations,
    corresponding to the geographical specifications is a vital requirement. Privacy
    requirements are drastically difference in different IoT applications. For instance,
    the privacy requirements in a smart healthcare application are crucial than the
    requirements in an environmental monitoring application. Facilitating such diverse
    privacy requirements of IoT applications over traditional telecommunication networks
    is a burdensome task. 2) Benefits of Using Network Slicing: Allocation of separate
    slices with proper slice isolation mechanisms for each IoT application, along
    with required privacy-preserving network functions, helps to satisfy the diverse
    privacy requirements of IoT applications. Robust authentication mechanisms and
    strong slice isolation techniques deny the access to a particular slice from other
    slices to protect the confidentiality of the IoT application data. The ability
    to changing the VNF structure of the slices dynamically enhances the difficulty
    of breaking privacy preserving mechanisms. In this way, network slicing can improve
    the privacy of IoT applications. Table [IV] describes the privacy issues in different
    IoT scenarios, along with possible solutions that can be provided through network
    slicing for ensuring privacy. TABLE IV Key IoT Privacy Issues 3) Existing Slicing
    Based Solutions: Network slicing can be used to ensure the privacy of IoT applications,
    but scientific investigations that are directly addressing this area are quite
    limited. Moreover, some of the existing work can be further extended. An IoT user
    case-specific privacy-preserving communication scheme presented in [67] can be
    extended to general applications. In [35], Ni et al. proposed an efficient and
    secure service-oriented authentication framework supporting network slicing 5G-enabled
    IoT services. E. Improving Quality of Service (QoS) QoS can be defined as a form
    of traffic control mechanism that guarantees the ability to run high-priority
    applications and traffic under limited network capacity. The measurements of concern
    in QoS are bandwidth (throughput), delay (latency), jitter (variance in latency)
    and error rate. Different combinations of these properties are essential in increasing
    the quality of IoT applications. 1) Description of the Limitation: The IoT has
    proliferated within massive application areas that need diverse QoS requirements
    for their optimal behavior. As an example, QoS requirements in autonomous vehicle
    applications, such as very low latency and ultra-reliability, are completely different
    from the requirements in environmental monitoring applications. Facilitating all
    these heterogeneous QoS requirements of different IoT applications through the
    same infrastructure entails a revolutionising re-engineering of the network architecture
    [68]. Even in congestion situations, QoS control allows us to fulfill sufficient
    service quality requirements of the IoT applications with high priority classification.
    Table V illustrates the requirement of different QoS for different IoT applications
    [69]. TABLE V QoS Requirements of Different IoT Applications 2) Benefits of Using
    Network Slicing: Network slicing ensures facilitating QoS requirements of different
    IoT applications, through allocating dedicated slices for each use case. Dynamic
    resource allocation between slices allows us to accomplish QoS requirements in
    congestion situations [70]. 3) Existing Slicing Based Solutions: Based on the
    existing related works, QoS requirements of different IoT applications can be
    facilitated through network slicing. In [68], Yousaf et al. presented an architecture
    to provide QoS requirements of the slices. In [71], Höyhtyä et al. used network
    slicing as an enabling technology in providing QoS requirements in critical scenarios
    over the public networks. Automated slice resource allocation frameworks can be
    utilized to maintain the QoS level of highly dynamic IoT applications. F. Providing
    End-to-End Orchestration Whenever a service enabled in a network, the life time
    of that service has to be managed for proper operation. The service End-to-End
    orchestrator is responsible for provision, management and optimization of resources
    for that particular network service. 1) Description of the Limitation: Rapid expansion
    of IoT within a plethora of applications, increases the number of tenants and
    different stakeholders who involve in managing the ecosystem. As an example, in
    a smart transportation application, road authorities, manufacturing companies,
    maintenance teams, need to cooperate for the well-being of the application. Cooperation
    these multiple parties is a challenging task. With the augmentation of IoT services,
    the amount of control channel data related to IoT flown through the network increases.
    Hence, a proper mechanism is required to mitigate the challenge of managing the
    amount of IoT control data. 2) Benefits of Using Network Slicing: Network slicing
    provides a solution for this matter through reducing the network complexity, by
    dividing the network into small manageable parts. It supports a wide range of
    customers’ and operators’ requirements by allowing them to execute required configuration
    changes at run time to their slices [72]. Increased operational complexity due
    to a large number of created customised networks can be resolved by an end-to-end
    network slice orchestrator. The IoT world can be envisioned as the most suitable
    exploitation for a self-managed and isolated slice of network resources [73].
    3) Existing Slicing Based Solutions: E2E orchestration of divergent applications
    is identified as a critical requirement in modern networks and have been proposed
    several architectures facilitating this requirement. Network slicing management
    and orchestration architectures [72], [74] and such an architecture with federated
    slicing [75] were proposed to serve this requirement. Slice orchestration over
    multi-domains is discussed as a novel scope in E2E orchestration and it can be
    further investigated. G. Better Resource Allocation and Prioritization IoT networks
    uses several types of network resources such as computing, storage and networking
    resources. It is required the allocate these resource efficiently to optimized
    the resource utilization. 1) Description of the Limitation: IoT networks are consists
    billions of connected devices which support different use cases with heterogeneous
    network requirements. The allocation of physical network resources for such vast
    amount of IoT devices is a complex task. Specially, the dynamic nature of IoT
    services will leads to constant fluctuation in resource utilization. Moreover,
    the amount of available network resources is always limited in SP networks. Thus,
    it is essential to manage these limited resources efficiently. However, most of
    the time, SPs struggle to utilise the available resources efficiently. Moreover,
    some of the mission critical and delay sensitive IoT applications such as autonomous
    vehicles, robotics and AR applications might need prioritization of allocated
    resources over other IoT applications [76]. 2) Benefits of Using Network Slicing:
    Network slicing, that implies the allocation of resources [28], can be considered
    as the optimal technology to satisfy diverse network requirements of 5G IoT applications.
    The primary idea of network slicing is analogous to the concept of Infrastructure
    as a Service (IaaS) in cloud computing, that shares computing, storage and networking
    resources among tenants [27]. Moreover, the challenge of varying nature of amount
    of required resources for a particular IoT use case can be overcome by dynamic
    adjustment of allocated resources for each slice via automated slice manager functions
    [77]. Moreover, network programmability is a basic element of network slicing
    that allows us to alter the network resource utilisation dynamically among IoT
    applications. Network slicing allows us to prioritize traffic in two techniques:
    user/traffic prioritization via simultaneous management of the priority among
    different slices, and prioritization users belong to same slice [47]. 3) Existing
    Slicing Based Solutions: Network slicing is recognised as a superlative technology
    for allocating required network resources to miscellaneous applications in current
    related works. Radio resource allocation frameworks [78], [79] and a hierarchical
    resource allocation framework [80] for network slicing have been presented for
    this. Mathematical models for resource allocation between slices were developed
    in [27]. Since most of the proposed resource allocation algorithms are specific
    to single domain, E2E resource allocation algorithms can be identified as a possible
    future research direction in this aspect [27]. SECTION IV. Network Slicing Based
    IoT Applications IoT has been used in many application domains. These IoT applications
    can be categorised into four key areas according to their requirements (Figure
    6). This section focuses on discussing key use cases/applications of IoT and how
    network slicing can be used to overcome the challenges in these applications.
    Table VI describes a concise summary of possible slicing solutions for each IoT
    application scenarios with required technical aspects. TABLE VI Role of Slicing
    for IoT and its Pertinent Deployment Challenges Fig. 6. IoT application scenarios.
    Show All A. Smart Transportation With the mass evolution of the transportation
    system, IoT has tightly coupled with several areas in transportation, along with
    vehicle-to-vehicle communication, vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, autonomous
    or semi-autonomous driving and in-car infotainment systems. Ultrareliability and
    very low latency are critical communication requirements in Vehicle-to-Everything
    (V2X) applications [111]. Four different types of communication modes of V2X are
    identified by 3GPP: vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I),
    vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) and vehicle-to-network (V2N). 1) The Role of Network
    Slicing in Smart Transportation: V2X covers multiple use cases, such as V2V, V2P,
    V2I and V2N. Each use case has heterogeneous service and connectivity requirements
    that cannot be facilitated through a single network infrastructure. Network slicing
    is the optimal solution to fulfill these requirements in a cost-effective manner.
    New players such as road authorities, vehicle manufacturers and municipalities
    that provide multiple services will participate in the V2X scenario, rather than
    the traditional network provider. It is difficult to support these multiple tenants
    via infrastructure owned by different operators. A proper set of slice templates
    can be developed to consummate the requirements of multiple tenants. To manage
    the high density of moving vehicles, deployment of network functions in the network
    should be changed dynamically. Also, variations of resource utilisation in network
    resources by other use cases should not violate the resource requirements of the
    V2X use cases. Network slicing can provide guaranteed level of network resources
    for V2X use cases via isolating V2X resources from other application specific
    slices. Dynamic deployment of network functions according to the time of the day
    (peak and off-peak) or type of area (rural or urban) increases the efficiency
    of the network resource utilisation. Moreover, strong security mechanisms can
    be provided to the communication of different V2X applications through dedicated
    security network slicing. Figure 7 shows a brief overview of the network slicing
    utilisation in smart transportation use case. Four different slices (autonomous
    vehicles, teleoperated vehicles, remote diagnostic and management and vehicle
    infotainment systems with diverse network requirements) are depicted here. A slice
    for autonomous vehicles can be used to facilitate communication requirements of
    self-driving cars. Another slice for teleoperated vehicles can be utilised to
    manage vehicles remotely in environments that are either dangerous or unfavourable
    for humans. Communication between car manufacturers or diagnostic centres and
    vehicles can be facilitated via a slice dedicated for this specific purpose. To
    provide infotainment services such as Web browsing, HD video streaming and social
    media access for passengers, a separate slice can be allocated. Fig. 7. Network
    Slicing & Smart Transportation. Show All 2) Related Works: Facilitating communication
    requirements of smart transportation applications through network slicing have
    been comprehensively discussed in existing solutions. In [81], Campolo et al.
    stated that heterogeneous requirements of V2X services cannot be mapped into reference
    slices in 5G: eMBB, mMTC, URLCC or into a single V2X slice. Besides that, they
    propose a set of slices for identified V2X use cases that may be consumed by a
    single vehicle simultaneously: slice for autonomous driving and other safety-critical
    services, slice supporting teleoperated driving, slice for vehicular infotainment
    and slice for vehicle remote diagnostic and management. A reference network-slicing
    architecture for V2X services is proposed in [82], based on a three-layer model
    [112]: infrastructure layer, service layer, business layer and Management and
    Orchestration (MANO). In [83], Khan et al. have analysed the performance of network
    slicing in a vehicular network, using a multi-lane highway scenario with two logical
    slices (the infotainment slice and the autonomous driving slice). They showed
    that their network slicing approach outperforms the direct Road Side Unit (RSU)
    method, while attaining high reliability and throughput. Air-Ground Integrated
    VEhicular Network (AGIVEN) architecture is proposed in [113], to provide high
    capacity with seamless coverage. The proposed architecture is divided into multiple
    slices to support a specific application while guaranteeing QoS requirements.
    However, improving security and privacy of V2X network slices and efficient resource
    allocation algorithms for ensuring network requirements can be further investigated
    in transportation applications. B. Industrial Automation/ Industrial IoT (IIoT)
    Fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) [114], the novel enhancement in the
    industrial automation systems, introduces modern communication and computation
    technologies such as cloud computing and IoT to industrial manufacturing systems
    [115]. As a result, a large number of IoT devices, machines and applications with
    heterogeneous network requirements will connect with each other through the network
    for the realisation of industry 4.0 [116]. Utilising connected IoT based machines
    rather than human labor with remote monitoring and supervision in a production
    line will increase the efficiency of the system while reducing the cost. Different
    types of IoT based sensors can be distributed throughout the factory to monitor
    the environmental conditions and status of the machines for reducing unplanned
    downtime. 1) The Role of Network Slicing in Industrial Automation: Existing traditional
    networks are not capable of fulfilling the diverse communication requirements,
    like high reliability, low latency and high data rates, of Industrial IoT (IIoT)
    applications. Network slicing is a viable option for supporting the diverse set
    of network requirements using the same physical network infrastructure cost-effectively.
    Changing the NFs, in terms of location and structuring of the slices, achieves
    various combinations of the properties, such as security, mobility, latency and
    bandwidth. It is possible to allocate a dedicated slice with guaranteed network
    resources for a particularly large-scale factory line to accomplish their communication
    requirements. Possible use of network slices in a factory environment are shown
    in the Figure 8. Factory environment management, remote operation of the machines
    and remote diagnostic and maintenance are the probable scenarios that require
    separate slices. Thousands of sensors and actuators in the factory can be connected
    together via a dedicated slice, for managing the factory environment effectively.
    Workers and machines in the factory can be connected together through a separate
    slice for remote operation. Machine manufacturers or diagnose centres and the
    machines can be coupled securely through a dedicated slice to optimize the machines
    maintenance process. Fig. 8. Network Slicing & Industrial automation. Show All
    2) Related Works: Several slicing-based implementations can be found in Industrial
    automation domain. In [84] and [117], Wu et al. demonstrated a practical scenario
    in conditional monitoring to achieve self-organisation and flexibility, with optimal
    utilisation of network resources in IIoT networks via network slicing. One of
    the challenges in IIoT networks that they addressed in their demonstration was
    the requirement of a quickly accessible and self-organising network. Another challenge
    they addressed was the necessity for a flexible network to achieve diverse QoS
    requirements from various services, as well as on-demand optimisation of the network
    efficiency. Results from their demonstration show the usefulness of network slicing
    in IIoT systems. In [85], Kalør, et al. discussed how network slicing can be used
    to overcome the challenges in traditional telecommunication systems, by introducing
    programmability and flexibility to IIoT networks. They have used Industry 4.0
    use case to show the network slicing usage to achieve a diverse set of requirements.
    In [86], Theodorou et al. presented a cross-domain network slicing solution developed
    for EU-funded research project VirtuWind, for an industrial wind park scenario.
    A two-level hierarchical structure had been proposed to management and control
    of the network resources. The network slicing process also depends on this two-level
    hierarchical structure. In [118], Baddeley et al. proposed initial efforts to
    create dedicated SDN control slices in IIoT networks. They have demonstrated the
    task using IETF 6TiSCH tracks. Moreover, federated slicing and hierarchical slicing
    can be considered as novel research directions related to network slicing in industrial
    networks. C. Smart Healthcare Similar to the other application areas, IoT is heavily
    used in the healthcare system under various use cases [119]. Recent advances in
    IoT are identified as a potential solution to alleviate the pressures on the healthcare
    systems, such as medical staff shortage and high healthcare costs, while maintaining
    quality care to patients [120]. Remote surgery is one of the mission-critical
    IoT healthcare applications that enables patients to get the service of a set
    of consultants who are in different places around the world. Remote monitoring
    of elders and patients who needs continuous monitoring, is an IoT application
    that requires communication services with ultra-reliability and low latency [121],
    [122]. As with the prodigious development in the robotic field, employment of
    humanoid robots near elderly people will support them to live independently at
    home. Wearable IoT devices is becoming popular in multiple remote monitoring scenarios,
    such as glucose, ECG, blood pressure and heart rate, for the purpose of avoiding
    preventable deaths [123]. 1) The Role of Network Slicing in Smart Healthcare:
    Heterogeneous communication service requirements in the diverse set of IoT use
    cases in the modern healthcare system cannot be accomplished through the traditional
    telecommunication network. Higher data capacity and extremely fast response time,
    received through novel 5G technologies, support faster and more accurate results
    needed for patients’ remote monitoring and examination in the healthcare domain
    [87]. Since the lion’s share of the healthcare applications directly deal with
    the patients’ lives, communication services used in the healthcare applications
    such as remote surgeries should have supreme reliability. While maintaining the
    promising network resource allocation for these critical healthcare applications,
    disturbances that will generate through the variation of resource utilisation
    from other applications should be minimised. Network slicing is the propitious
    technology that allows achieving this requirement via slice isolation. The ability
    to allocate resources dynamically to healthcare slices alleviates the resource
    consumption surges generated through the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices.
    Security and privacy are primary concerns in the healthcare industry, since it
    deals with sensitive data of the people. Additional security and privacy can be
    provided by deploying more security and privacy related network functions in healthcare
    slices. Slice isolation removes the visibility of healthcare traffic flow to other
    application slices. Figure 9 explains how different network slices can be used
    in the smart health applications. For this sector, separate slices for remote
    surgeries, remote health monitoring and smart hospitals are identified as required.
    Applications involving remote surgeries that demand network requirements, such
    as very high throughput, ultra-reliability and very low latency, can be included
    into a separate slice. Remote health monitoring applications and wearable devices
    can be connected to a dedicated slice to provide a secure communication. Medical
    appliances in a hospital can be networked to a centralised location via a dedicated
    slice. Fig. 9. Network Slicing & Smart Healthcare. Show All 2) Related Works:
    In terms of providing required security, latency and reliability requirements
    of healthcare-related IoT applications, network slicing is recognised as a dominant
    solution in existing related works. In [87], Mavrogiorgou et al. proposed a platform
    to manage healthcare data efficiently with the use of the latest techniques in
    network slicing, data acquisition and data operability. Through the developed
    platform, they were able to identify unknown devices and collect their data to
    assign that into a particular slice to inter-operate with other IoMT devices.
    In [88], Celdrán et al. proposed an architecture to manage the life cycle of network
    slicing, while addressing resource orchestration problems, in terms of what, when
    and how. A policy-based system with two types of policies, intra-slice policies
    and inter-slice policies, is defined to control the network slices, as well as
    to change the resource allocation to the slices dynamically. They have thoroughly
    examined the remote care use case for highlighting the necessity of managing network
    slices through defining the remote healthcare slice for various requirements of
    dynamic healthcare environments. In [124], Pries et al. demonstrated allocating
    a network slice for a smart health use case, that connects a smart wearable device
    with a specific traffic pattern to the cloud efficiently. Innovative eHealth system,
    powered by 5G network slicing, was proposed in [89]. In there, they have studied
    the health data collection and analysis from various IoT medical devices via 5G
    networks. Dynamic provisioning of 5G slices according to the medical devices with
    diverse requirements was considered in their proposed architecture. D. Smart Home
    and City The smart home concept is extended up to smart offices, smart buildings
    and finally, to smart cities. Making people’s lives smarter through automating
    day-to-day activities, cost reduction and energy preservation are major advantages
    of IoT utilisation in smart home and city applications. Smart home applications
    are ranging from a simple temperature sensing system that automates the functionality
    of the air conditioner, to an advanced image processing system that identifies
    intruders, to increase the protection. Despite the advantages of IoT from a smart
    home perspective, the rate of adoption of IoT devices to their homes by users
    depends on their desire to buy those devices. Security and convenience have been
    identified as the key factors that influence their decision [125]. Rapid population
    growth and urbanisation around cities tend to utilise most of the resources around
    the earth in a very limited space. This dramatic expansion of cities should be
    addressed sustainability while increasing the quality of life. The IoT has been
    made use of to tackle these issues with the smart city concept [91]. 1) The Role
    of Network Slicing in Smart Home and City: Heterogeneity of IoT devices in homes
    is varied from very primitive devices with very limited energy, to very powerful
    devices that need a continuous power supply and from insecure devices, to devices
    with very high-security mechanisms [92]. Since security devices like door locks,
    surveillance cameras, lights, sirens, smoke detectors and garage door openers
    deal directly with the security of homes, intruders who take control of those
    devices are able to create negative effects to the homeowners. Network slicing
    is a way to eliminate such negative effects to some extent through slice isolation
    and implementing various security functions in the smart home slice. Smart city
    applications such as waste-management systems, automated-road-lamp systems, connected-traffic-control
    systems and smart-parking systems will be connected together to facilitate centralised
    management. Since a majority of these IoT devices are very simple and use batteries,
    energy-efficient communication services is a vital requirement with very high
    security, as it deals directly with the daily living styles of the people who
    live in the city. Network slicing is the prominent technology to fulfill the communication
    requirements of such devices. This can be done via allocating a separate slice
    with lightweight network functions and isolating this traffic stream from other
    traffic. Some of the possible network slices with their network capabilities in
    a smart home and city environment is depicted in Figure 10. Though a large number
    of slices is realisable in a smart home and city environment, five key scenarios
    among them are shown in the figure: eMBB services, home management, waste-management
    system, traffic-management system and energy-management system. Since eMBB devices
    are distributed over smart homes and smart cities, they can be connected to a
    single dedicated slice. Smart devices in a home can be connected to a distinct
    slice to assure secure communication. Fig. 10. Network Slicing & Smart City &
    Home. Show All 2) Related Works: In [92], Dzogovic et al. proposed a network slicing-based
    smart home system, using three different end-to-end slices. Slice dedicated to
    the home security system, eMBB slice to devices that demand high data rates and
    massive IoT network slice to provide low-data rates for low-power devices are
    proposed in the paper. In [93], Chaabnia and Meddeb presented a model for smart
    home, using network slicing. In their scheme, smart home applications are sliced
    into four different classes according to their usage, bandwidth requirements and
    traffic type. In [126], Boussard et al. presented an end-to-end research solution,
    called Future Spaces, based on SDN and NFV, to dynamically control people’s digital
    assets. They have used network slices to provide secure access to devices. E.
    AR, VR and Gaming Augmented Reality (AR), which brings digital elements to live
    view, and Virtual Reality (VR), which completely replaces the live view with a
    digital view, are the novel technologies that have the ability to join the physical
    world and digital world. AR, one of the disruptive technologies developed under
    the expansion of IoT, is used to improve the interaction between human and computer
    in a more entertaining manner within smart environments [94]. Mobile phones can
    be used as AR visors at the early stage, to evaluate the effectiveness of AR in
    IoT. After this, the transition can be done to multiple alternative options, such
    as head-mounted displays like Google Glass, Magic Leap Lightwear and Microsoft
    Hololons, and other wearables that allow users hands-free interaction with IoT
    services and objects [95]. VR with IoT provides a huge contribution to facilitate
    indispensable services like remote surgeries, tourism industry, remote meetings,
    retail, marketing and smart education, as well as entertainment activities. In
    [96], Alam et al. proposed a monitoring and safety system using AR/VR technologies
    and various IoT devices. Remote monitoring and supervision are possible with the
    proposed solution. The traditional gaming industry has faced a massive transformation
    along with AR/VR technologies with IoT devices. It is viable to connect multiple
    players around the world to the gaming environment and enhance the gaming experience,
    rather than playing in a isolated environment. A rapid growth of the VR-based
    gaming market was achieved over the past few years, due to the development of
    innovative accessories and wearables. The majority of startups who enter the electronic
    games industry tend to engage with VR technology to develop their games [127].
    1) The Role of Network Slicing in AR, VR, and Gaming: More latency causes experiencing
    disorientation and dizziness (cyber-sickness) to users while consuming AR/VR devices.
    Hence, the Motion-To-Photon (MTP) latency is required to keep less than 20ms.
    Accordingly, considerable range for network-side latency must be 5 to 9ms [128]–[130].
    Existing traditional networks are not capable to facilitate this requirement.
    In the cases of remote surgeries and virtual meetings, security and privacy are
    critical requirements, since they are directly dealing with the sensitive information
    of mankind. AR and VR-related applications need very high data rates. For a low
    resolution, 360 degree AR/VR video requires bandwidth around 25Mbits/s, and according
    to the quality of the video, the required bandwidth ramps up significantly [128],
    [129]. These heterogeneous network requirements can be facilitated through network
    slicing. The standard eMBB service scenario in the novel 5G architecture is designed
    to facilitate these kinds of applications. Customised network slices can be used
    to provide specific network characteristics of the AR/VR applications that cannot
    be facilitated through the standard eMBB slice. Figure 11 shows the allocation
    of different network slices in the AR/VR/gaming applications. Since AR/VR entered
    a plethora of application scenarios, it is feasible to categorise those scenarios
    within three slices, according to the network requirements as depicted in the
    figure: slice for AR/VR in entertainment that includes real-time games, slice
    for AR/VR in healthcare and slice for AR/VR in general applications such as education,
    business, and tourism. Fig. 11. Network Slicing & AR/VR/Gaming. Show All 2) Related
    Works: In [131], Esteves et al. proposed a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) to use the user’s
    location to the placement of a network slice. They considered an interactive-gaming
    event that has multiple players who access the gaming application simultaneously,
    in implementing their PoC. A dedicated network slice is used to facilitate the
    QoS/QoE requirements of the gaming service provider to users. In [132], SK Telecom
    and Ericsson reported that their ability to create different virtual network slices
    optimised for AR services. Since AR/VR is relatively a recent application area,
    network slicing utilisation is not much covered in existing scientific investigations.
    However, AR/VR realisation via network slicing has been proved only by some companies
    through demonstrations [132]. F. Military Applications IoT integration with technologies,
    such as wireless sensor networks, embedded systems, M2M communications, cloud
    computing and mobile applications, has the potential to serve mission-critical
    military applications. IoT deployment in military applications has primarily focused
    on battlefield applications. Millions of sensors deployed on multiple applications
    are used to serve the systems of Command, Control, Communications, Computers,
    Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR). The situational awareness
    gained through those sensors helps senior commanders to steer the battalion and
    helps warfighters to combat strategically [97]. In [98], Wrona discuss some important
    use cases for IoT deployment in military applications, such as smart equipment,
    situational awareness, logistics and medical care. Military IoT (MIoT) supports
    to realise the concept of “anytime, anyplace connectivity for anything, ubiquitous
    network with ubiquitous computing” in the military domain. It increases the efficiency
    of the utilisation of military resources via implementing and managing military
    diversification affairs more accurately and dynamically [99]. Use of IoT-aided
    robotics in military applications are discussed in [100] within the following
    activities: detection of hazardous chemicals and biological weapons, autonomous
    vehicles in battlefields, support on civil operations in war fields, deactivation
    of nuclear weapons and access control of people in restricted areas. 1) The Role
    of Network Slicing in Military Applications: End-to-end secured communication
    is a crucial requirement in the battlefields for scenarios like communication
    between soldiers and the control centre and transmission of the information gathered
    by the IoT devices. Using an existing public network infrastructure with large
    coverage is a cost-effective solution. Without specifying a separate slice in
    the physical network with appropriate security functions and strong slice isolation
    mechanisms, security requirements can’t be accomplished. In the applications such
    as IoT-aided robotics and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), very low latency, ultra-reliability,
    and high bandwidth are critical network requirements. Traditional telecommunication
    networks are not capable to facilitate these requirements along with the required
    security in military use cases. In [71], Höyhtyä et al. discuss how to implement
    critical communication services over a commercial 5G mobile network. They also
    talked about creating rapidly deployable networks for emergency and tactical operations,
    using techniques such as network slicing and licensed shared access. Figure 12
    explains how network slicing facilitates network requirements in the military
    IoT. Two important cases for allocating slices have been identified and they are
    shown in the figure: slice for a battlefield and slice for general defense communication.
    Fast temporary deployments of slices dedicated to a battlefield can facilitate
    communication requirements of drones, smart weapons and soldiers. A portion of
    the public network with high security mechanisms can be permanently allocated
    to general-defense communications. Fig. 12. Network Slicing & Military applications.
    Show All 2) Related Works: In [133], Grønsund et al. discussed the implementation
    of military communication services over the 5G network via network slicing. They
    proposed two network slices for military mobile users: military slice for military
    services which requires more restricted access and security and commercial slice
    for traditional services. The methodology of providing the basic service requirements
    of military communications such as isolation, security, high availability, QoS,
    and performance, via network slicing has been discussed. Moreover, they described
    the basic implementation of the military slice based on the 5G URLCC slice. G.
    Smart Energy The smart grid can be identified as an electrical system that consists
    of operations such as electricity generation, transmission, distribution, control
    and consumption. It uses two-way flows of electricity and information, along with
    computational and communication technologies to achieve an automated and distributed
    energy-delivery network, with properties such as clean, safe, secure, efficient,
    sustainable, reliable and resilient [101]. The overall efficiency of the integrated
    power grid can be improved by using the IoT to form an interactive real-time network
    connection between the users and power equipment [102]. All kinds of components
    such as transformers, breakers, meters and capacitors in the grid can be made
    intelligible through IoT. It facilitates the advantages such as enhancing customer
    engagement, optimisation of renewable energy and reducing maintenance costs. In
    [103], Sarwat et al. divide the smart grid into three main logical entities: Functional
    Entity (FE), Operational Entity (OE) and IoT Entity (IE). The IE entity is responsible
    for making the smart grid intelligent by constantly sensing accurate measurements
    from FE and reporting them to OE. A shift into more renewable and distributed
    energy generation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, generates instability in
    the power grid. IoT helps to remove the instability in the grid through continuous
    real-time monitoring. 1) The Role of Network Slicing in Smart Energy: Typically,
    a smart grid consists of a massive number of connected components, distributed
    across a very large geographical area [103]. These smart components have diverse
    network requirements [45] across multiple application areas, such as online monitoring
    for the power transmission line, smart homes and smart vehicles [134]. Some of
    the complications in the existing network infrastructure include providing a good
    network connectivity, handling the massive amount of data generated through those
    components, and facilitating diverse network requirements. Allocation of separate
    slices for smart grid-based applications in the 5G network can mitigate these
    complications cost-effectively. The smart grid applications are more attractive
    to cyber-attacks [135], since a successful attack on a grid can cause a bad impact
    to the whole country, through creating disturbances in the daily routine of the
    people, as well as damaging the electric assets. Communication through public
    networks increases the vulnerability for attacks and proper security mechanisms
    should be implemented to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Network slicing is a
    prominent way to implement security functions for grid systems. Slice isolation
    is a potential solution for segregating the grid-based traffic over the public
    network. Different application areas in the smart energy service sector, along
    with allocating separate slices for each application, are shown in Figure 13.
    Four different feasible slices have been identified in the smart-grid use case:
    firstly, for UAV-based-grid inspection, secondly, for distribution automation,
    thirdly, for smart metering and lastly, for load control. Slices have been allocated
    according to the network requirements in each use case. Fig. 13. Network Slicing
    & Smart Energy. Show All 2) Related Works: Allocation of separate slices for identified
    smart grid applications [24], [136] and increasing the revenue of MNOs through
    network slicing [137] have been covered in current related works. In [24], Zhang
    et al. thoroughly examined network slicing in smart grid applications. They have
    identified four use cases in smart grids, along with different network requirements:
    Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), Distribution Automation, UAV-based grid
    Inspection and Millisecond-level precise load control and they proposed separate
    slices for each use case. The Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and Return On Investment
    (ROI) of network slicing in smart grids have been analysed from the operator’s
    perspective. In [137], Dorsch et al. discussed the economic advantages that can
    be achieved through SDN and network slicing when transmitting critical measurements
    and control commands that required ultra-reliability and low latency in smart
    grids. They have proposed a techno-economic evaluation approach that consists
    of smart-grid-traffic modelling, network dimensioning, operator modelling and
    cost modelling. In [136], Kurtz et al. proposed an SDN and NFV based network slicing
    solution for critical communications in 5G shared infrastructure. They have evaluated
    the solution using a testing setup for two real-world scenarios - smart grid and
    Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) - allocating separate slices for each
    scenario under three cases: performance study, scalability analysis and critical-infrastructure
    communication. They have achieved higher scalability and low end-to-end delay
    via their proposed solution. H. UAVs and Drones The popularity of Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, increased over the past few years in a
    wide range of areas related to civilian, military, commercial and governmental
    sectors. Drones have the ability to facilitate multiple IoT services from great
    heights, forming the airborne IoT through sensors, cameras and GPS modules fixed
    into drones and emerging telecommunication technologies such as 5G [104]. Surveillance
    scenarios (e.g., traffic, power line, agriculture and environment) are one of
    the key aspects in IoT. UAVs can be used to facilitate the requirements of these
    applications [138], [139]. In [140], Motlagh et al. presented an integrative IoT
    platform operational in the sky, using UAVs equipped with diverse IoT devices.
    They have implemented UAV-based crowd surveillance applications through the proposed
    platform. Using drones as aerial base stations is a novel approach in wireless
    networks to enhance coverage, capacity, energy efficiency and reliability. Attributes
    of UAVs such as mobility, adaptive altitude and flexibility support some potential
    applications in wireless systems [105]. This helps to improve the network coverage
    in remote areas to facilitate remote IoT applications, such as wildlife monitoring
    and IoT devices that have small transmit power. In addition to supporting IoT
    applications, UAVs are considered part of the IoT, since their functionality depends
    on a combination of sensors, antennas and embedded software [106]. 1) The Role
    of Network Slicing and UAVs: There are two main kinds of data that need to be
    communicated with UAVs, one being control data that needs to handle the UAV. The
    other is payload data collected from cameras and sensors that needs to be sent
    to another location for further processing. These data types have diverse network
    requirements. It needs to facilitate these requirements cost-effectively. High
    reliability and low latency are key QoS requirements in control data. In payload
    data, a massive amount of data may need to be transmitted. Along with existing
    technologies, it is not possible to separate UAV-related traffic from other traffic,
    as well as control traffic from payload traffic. Network slicing in 5G networks
    is a noteworthy technology to facilitate this requirement via slice isolation,
    while facilitating heterogeneous network requirements in UAV-related traffic.
    Figure 14 shows how network slicing can be used in UAV service areas with diverse
    network requirements. Three possible use cases of drones that required separate
    slices are shown in the figure: UAVs in emergency situations, UAVs as floating
    base stations and UAVs in commercial activities like delivery services and photography.
    Each drone use case can be further sliced to communicate control signals and payload
    data respectively. Fig. 14. Network Slicing & Drones. Show All 2) Related Works:
    Accomplishing communication requirements of UAVs and drones, in terms of controlling
    and other operations such as video streaming, through dedicated network slices,
    is discussed in current related works. Further investigations should be conducted
    in the realisation of other UAV use cases, such as aerial base stations and military
    operations, through network slicing. In [107], Garcia et al. discussed the performance
    impact of using network slicing in aerial vehicle communications. They have allocated
    separate network slices to control data and payload data, referred to as control
    slice and payload slice. The experiment has been done under three trials. In the
    first trial, they have measured Ipref values in control slice and payload slice
    in Down Link (DL). The second trial had the same principle with Up Link (UP) and
    DL. In the final trial, they have checked whether the delay of the control slice
    is affected by the payload use of the network. They have shown that required throughput
    of the control slice can be maintained while allocating remaining capacity to
    payload slice during the flight, via first and second trials. Using the results
    in the third trial, they have shown that the Round Trip Time (RTT) of control
    slice is not influenced by the varied payload throughput. They have concluded
    that slicing performs effectively in facilitating network resources for control
    communication in aerial vehicle communications. Reference [141] demonstrated how
    5G, along with network slicing, can be used in disaster and emergency situations
    using drones. The demo is executed under two scenarios (delivering supplies and
    video streaming) in given situations and a dedicated slice is used to provide
    network connectivity to the drone with required QoS requirements. They have shown
    how networks can be deployed in disaster situations using network slicing. I.
    Massive IoT (Farming, Agriculture and Environment) The concept of Massive IoT
    lies on transmitting and consuming a small amount of data from a massive number
    of IoT devices. Agriculture and environment-monitoring applications are an example
    for such context, where scale becomes the critical factor, rather than speed [142].
    Traditional farms that used to be small units distributed over small land areas
    have now evolved into massive farms that have thousands of animals over large
    geographic areas, armed with heterogeneous sensors and actuators. These highly
    accurate embedded sensors enable precision agriculture by measuring the environmental
    context inside farms [143], [144]. Improving productivity and maximising yields
    and profitability, and reducing the environmental footprint, are resulted by the
    optimal usage of fertilizers, pesticides and efficient irrigation mechanisms [108].
    The smart farming concept that includes real-time data gathering and processing,
    along with automating necessary actions over farming procedures, is realised by
    precision agriculture. In [109], Ruan et al. divided IoT techniques in agriculture
    into four categories: controlled equipment farming, livestock breeding, aquaculture
    and aquaponics and open-field planting. They discussed challenges in exploitation
    of IoT into agriculture. IoT enables environmental monitoring with an assemblage
    of connected sensors to monitor environmental parameters such as temperature,
    humidity, wind speed, gases and pressure. It provides advantages such as maintaining
    healthy growth of crops and ensuring safe working environments in industries [110].
    1) The Role of Network Slicing and Massive IoT: International standard organisations
    identified the massive IoT as one of the main service areas in the novel 5G architecture,
    which is referred as mMTTC. Network slicing is a promising technology to facilitate
    network requirements in massive IoT applications that have billions of low power
    devices with a small amount of data. Narrow Band (NB) IoT is a kind of network
    slicing technology in Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, which runs over the
    same physical network infrastructure. It is designed to facilitate low-cost devices,
    high coverage, long device battery life and massive capacity [145]. Power consumption
    of the IoT devices can be optimised via allocating a separate E2E network slice
    with optimised NFs. Normally, in smart farming and environmental monitoring applications,
    IoT devices will be distributed in rural areas that do not have a proper network
    coverage. These devices connect to the network intermittently to transmit collected
    information, in order to optimise the battery life. Just like NB-IoT, allocating
    a separate slice facilitates network requirements of these devices over common
    infrastructure with cost optimisation. Two application areas, farming and environmental
    monitoring, in massive IoT are shown in Figure 15 and it describes how network
    slicing can be used to facilitate network requirements of those applications.
    Furthermore, dedicated slices with different NFs can be created to other massive
    IoT applications. Fig. 15. Network Slicing & Massive IoT. Show All 2) Related
    Works: In [146], Popovski et al. discussed heterogeneous non-orthogonal sharing
    (H-NOMA) of RAN resources in uplink communications of a set of eMBB, mMTC and
    URLLC devices, which connects to a common base station in RAN slicing. They have
    analysed slicing of resources between eMBB and URLCC and between eMBB and mMTC,
    with illustrations of tradeoffs between H-OMA and H-NOMA. In both cases, they
    have shown that non-orthogonal solutions must be guided by reliability diversity
    to achieve more efficiency. J. Other Applications In addition to the discussed
    IoT application areas, there are several other applications that can lay hold
    of network slicing for their realisation. Typically, these applications have less
    impact from network slicing rather than discussed applications, but have specific
    advantages. Smart retail is an application that IoT has dominated in many segments,
    including supply-chain management, smart vending machines and digital signage.
    Smart retail is identified as the second-largest MEC use case [147]. Technologies
    such as AR/VR that require network slicing for its realisation have the ability
    to influence the customer’s decision, finally impacting smart retail [148]. The
    smart wearable is another application domain that is comprised with several discussed
    applications, such as smart healthcare, smart city and AR/VR/gaming. Networking
    slicing with MEC is recognised as a solution to overcome the critical concerns
    in wearable communications, such as short battery life and limited computing capability
    [149], [150]. Smart supply chain is listed in the top ten IoT applications in
    [151]. Tracking goods while they are on the roads and exchanging inventory information,
    are some possible use cases in the smart supply chain that can be facilitated
    through mMTC slice over 5G networks. Table VII summarises the potential network
    slices and the technical requirements of each proposed slice in each discussed
    IoT application. TABLE VII Summary of Expected Performance in the IoT Applications
    With Possible Slices TABLE VIII Summary of Related Works SECTION V. Technical
    Challenges Related to Network Slicing in IoT Realization This section is allocated
    to describe the technical challenges related to the network slicing, due to the
    IoT realisation. The state of the art of each challenge in network slicing will
    be discussed in detail here. A. Scalability 1) Requirements: Along with the exponentially
    rising number of different IoT applications, the number of slices in the network
    will also increase. Furthermore, service area of a network slice that offer critical
    services with ultra-low latency requirements will also shrink due to high number
    of IoT devices. This might finally increase the required number of slices, thus
    increasing the slice orchestration requests [169]. Thus, the network slice management
    function should scale correspondingly to mitigate management and orchestration
    difficulties evolved through the massive number of slices due to the rapid expansion
    of IoT. 2) Existing Solutions: In [170], Kukliński and Tomaszewski proposed a
    scalable approach to mitigate difficulties (i.e., massive increment in the number
    of network slices and involvement of third parties to have slices for their needs)
    in network slicing management and orchestration. They have introduced a concept
    called DASMO (Distributed and Autonomic Slice Management and Orchestration), which
    reduces the management delays and management related traffic, along with enabling
    the formation of distributed and automated network slicing management solutions.
    However, the proposed solution is only conceptual and not implemented. In [169],
    Afolabi et al. proposed a novel E2E Network Slicing Orchestration System (NSOS)
    and a Dynamic Auto-Scaling Algorithm (DASA) for it. Their auto-scaling algorithm
    scales the resources of their proposed multi-domain orchestration system by handling
    the large number of slice creation requests to maintain system-wide stability.
    Furthermore, efficient algorithms for resource sharing can be investigated to
    improve the scalability of network slices. B. Recursion The ability to create
    larger functional blocks by aggregating multiple numbers of smaller functional
    blocks can be defined as recursion [171]. Applying recursion property in network
    slicing means the creation of new network slices using existing slices [172].
    In other terms, network slicing recursion can be defined as methods for network
    slice segmentation, allowing a slicing hierarchy with parent-child relationships
    [173]. 1) Requirements: IoT applications can span across multiple tenets and network
    domains. Therefore, creation a completely new slice is a complex task when comparing
    with using existing slices. Due the dynamicity of IoT use cases, the creation
    of new slices is a frequent operation which has to accommodate in many networks.
    Most of the time, there is no be significant differences between the use cases
    and hence the characteristics of the requested slices. Therefore, it is beneficial
    for most of the IoT applications to create new slices by inheriting properties
    from parent slices. This will optimise the slice creation operation in IoT context.
    2) Existing Solutions: In [174], Héno et al. presented a recursive network slicing
    model. The proposed model is based on a parallel analysis between IT virtualisation
    and network virtualisation, using virtualisation theory introduced by Popek and
    Goldberg. Isolation, recursiveness and independence are considered in their model.
    They showed how to enable new Business-to-Business-to-Consumer (B2B2C) business
    models through network slicing by re-renting rented resources achieved by recursive
    building of network slices layered and nested within each other. C. Adaptive Service
    Function Chaining The network softwarization concepts, especially NFV proposed
    to used virtualized network functions or services than hardware based network
    services such as firewalls, Network Address Translation (NAT) and intrusion protection.
    These vitalized networks services have to execute in certain order to satisfy
    a particular business need and facilitate the service policy and operational requirements.
    Linkage of these network functions to form service can be defined as Service Function
    Chaining (SFC) [175]. Improved operational efficiency and automated handling of
    traffic flows with advance features (i.e., more security, lower latency or overall
    high QoS for connected services) can be achieved through SFC [176]. A network
    slice can be also identified as a collection of connected VNFs. According the
    nature of supported applications, it is necessary to dynamically change the structure
    of the slices. This can be realized via by implementing adaptive service function
    chaining. 1) Requirements: IoT applications are highly dynamic and the network
    requirements, such as security, latency and QoS are always changing. Using dynamic
    service chaining, network operators will be able to create, scale, modify and
    remove network functions of a network slice according to the such changing demand,
    networks and cloud context information [177]. Recurring changes of network requirements
    of IoT applications entails continuous updates of SFCs of network slices to reduce
    the network cost. Hence, adaptive SFC in network slicing is a challenge that has
    to address due to the evolution of IoT applications. 2) Existing Solutions: In
    [178], Li et al. introduced a novel concept of an elastic service function chain.
    They addressed network slicing with such chaining constraints as a Software Defined
    Topology (SDT) (performs slice framing) problem. They formulated the SDT problem
    (when VF sharing across services, node overlapping may appear between logical
    topologies) with elastic SFC as a combinatorial optimisation problem. Then they
    devised a fast multi-stage heuristic algorithm to tackle it. D. Security 1) Requirements:
    Several security vulnerabilities can be identified within the network slicing
    ecosystem. The proliferation of IoT and network slicing exploitation of different
    IoT applications, intensify the effect of these vulnerabilities. Such issues can
    be categorized in to three different areas [179]. Life cycle security aspects
    for security-related in different phases of the network slice life cycle Intra-slice
    security for security aspects in slice itself and Inter-slice security for security
    aspects between slices Proper slice isolation is a critical security requirement
    in network slicing. Since end-device can access more than one slice at once, if
    there are no strong isolation mechanisms, attackers can launch attacks to other
    slices relatively easily. Due to the use of lightweight and less complex security
    mechanisms, IoT devices become attractive for many attackers to perform such attacks.
    Involvement of third parties increases due to the IoT expansion. Specially, new
    set of attackers such as cyber criminals and terrorist will also target IoT application
    when they are used in Critical National Infrastructures (CNIs). In such scenarios,
    slice-related configuration and management operations are given to third parties
    via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). These APIs are an entry point for
    intruders to enter and perform unauthorised activities. 2) Existing Solutions:
    Exploitation of IoT in a plethora of applications increases the security challenges
    of network slicing and several mechanisms have been proposed to mitigate these
    challenges. In [180], Khettab et al. proposed and evaluated a novel Security as
    a Service (SECaaS) architecture that leveraged SDN and NFV to secure a network
    slice. This ensured an optimal resource allocation that efficiently manages the
    slice-security strategy. Their proposed architecture consists of four main parts:
    cloud network, each managed by a Virtual Infrastructure Manager (VIM), VNF managers
    to monitor a set of VNFs in a slice, an NFV orchestrator responsible for life
    cycle managing of VNFs and an SDN controller to monitor and control traffic flows.
    Along with deploying and managing security VNFs (including Intrusion Detection/Prevention
    System [IDS/IPS] and Deep Packet Inspection [DPI]), the capabilities in their
    proposed architecture include monitoring their performance and predictive auto-scaling
    based on pre-defined policies, to ensure the elasticity. In [65], Cunha et al.
    presented a detailed discussion on security challenges of network slicing at the
    packet core. Applying AI techniques in achieving security in network slices is
    discussed in [181]. They have discussed various security challenges with possible
    AI mechanisms, in order to mitigate those attacks in network slicing. Reference
    [182] discusses implementation of a quarantine slice to isolate devices that were
    subjected to a security attack to perform security-related operations for those
    devices and to minimise the effect of the attack on the other systems. E. Privacy
    1) Requirements: Network slicing has its own set of privacy issues and integration
    of IoT will further increase the impact of it. Information leakages between slices
    expose the sensitive data to third parties, endangering the privacy. Strong slice
    isolation techniques with secure inter-slice communication via secure channels
    are a critical requirement in using network slicing for communications in order
    to preserve the privacy of the users. Also, slice isolation mechanisms should
    be implemented in customer-end devices to assure the privacy of the data from
    the customer end intruders. Some of the end IoT devices can access more than one
    slice simultaneously may also be a cause for information leakages between slices.
    In [65], Cunha et al. discussed the probable security and privacy breaches in
    network slicing descriptively. Network functions that may be shared between slices
    are allowing unauthorised inter-slice communication, challenging the confidentiality
    and the integrity of the data communicated through slices. IoT tenet might ask
    to use such third party network functions in their slices which might jeopardize
    the whole slicing system. Successful impersonation of the NSM allows subverting
    slice isolation, resulting in unauthorised access to all the slices that could
    be resulted in a breach of system confidentiality and integrity. The ability to
    change the management and configuration via APIs for third party tenants allows
    them to impersonate the host platform and run as an authorised platform. By exposing
    the network and private services to an attacker, confidentiality and the integrity
    of the system can be endangered. The mentioned privacy issues can become more
    challenging along with the rapid exploitation of IoT with network slicing. 2)
    Existing Solutions: Based on the existing solutions, slice isolation [183] and
    securing inter-slice communication [184], [185] have been identified as solutions
    to address privacy challenges related to network slicing. Furthermore, investigations
    can be conducted in preserving privacy in communications when sharing network
    resources between slices. In [184], Liu et al. proposed two heterogeneous signcryption
    schemes to accomplish mutual communications between the Public Key Infrastructure
    (PKI) and the CertificateLess public key Cryptography (CLC) environment, in order
    to ensure secure communication between network slices. PKI-CLC Heterogeneous Signcryption
    (PCHS) and CLC-PKI Heterogeneous Signcryption (CPHS) are the proposed schemes
    in there. They presented how to secure communication between a mobile Internet
    slice and a vehicle Internet slice using proposed schemes. In [183], Kotulski
    et al. presented a detailed discussion on slice isolation, along with types of
    isolation, isolation parameters and dynamic slice isolation. These address inter-slice
    communication to accomplish security perspectives. In [185], Suárez et al. presented
    a mathematical model based on the concept of network slice chains, to manage the
    inter-slice communication securely when there are different security requirements
    and attributes between slices. Their proposed model is extensible for application
    in any service and it complies with any access control model. F. E2E Management
    and Orchestration 1) Requirements: The proliferation of the IoT applications increases
    the need for dedicated slices in the network for their optimal behavior, finally
    causing the rise of the number of slices that have to be managed. Resource allocation
    between slices, changing configurations, facilitating QoS requirements and managing
    the security and privacy aspects for this massive number of slices, are complex
    tasks that need to be handled efficiently. An abundance of third-party tenants
    due to IoT collaboration within diverse fields will involve managing and configuring
    the slices. Managing the involvement of third parties is a challenging task. Temporary
    usage of slices in emergency situations such as earthquakes, floods and fires
    make the need for rapid deployment of slices. In addition to the conventional
    IoT security attacks that are potential to harm telecommunication networks, IoT
    intensifies the severity of the security threats in the network slicing ecosystem.
    More robust network slicing management facilities are required to overcome these
    security challenges. Utilization of a centralised approach for slice orchestration
    and management will increase the scalability and reliability issues, along with
    the escalated network slices. According to these facts, IoT systems originate
    several challenges to the network slice management and orchestration. 2) Existing
    Solutions: According to the existing solutions, slice management and orchestration
    can become a complex activity, along with the rapid increment of the number of
    slices. A couple of MANO frameworks [186], [187] and the MANOaaS concept [188]
    have been identified as solutions that address this challenge. Future researches
    can be directed on developing more efficient slice management and orchestration
    frameworks. [186], Meneses et al. proposed the SliMANO framework for slice management
    and orchestration with an implemented and experimentally evaluated prototype.
    The proposed framework consists of three parts: SliMANO core for coordinating
    SliMANO functionalities, SliMANO-plugin framework for facilitating the continuous
    deployment of new plugins and respective agents and SliMANO-agent framework for
    performing the actions requested by plugins to external network entities. In [188],
    Yousaf et al. shed the light on the concept of MANO-as-a-service (MANOaaS) to
    customise and distribute the MANO instances between different network tenants
    for improving the control of network slices. In [187], Abbas et al. presented
    different aspects of slice management for 5G networks. They proposed a framework
    that exploited Mobile-Central Office Re-Architected as Datacentre (M-CORD) for
    introducing a slicing mechanism for transport network. It enables slices to be
    available every time a UE requests them. G. Other Technical Challenges Apart from
    the technical challenges above discussed, a few other technical challenges can
    be found due to the rise of the IoT realisation. The impact of these challenges
    is far away from the above-discussed challenges, by reason of lack of large scale
    network slicing implementations. Limited nature of the RAN resources such as frequency
    and time than network resources in the core network such as servers and databases,
    causes difficulties in RAN slicing. It affects negatively for the E2E implementation
    and the rapid deployment of the application specific slices. In mobility management
    and handling roaming scenarios, the same serving slice needs to exist in different
    operators [189]. IoT devices should be able to cross these boundaries without
    experiencing any disturbances in communications. Secure and efficient slice information
    (slice configuration information and user-specific information) transmission between
    MNOs is required in accomplishing this challenge. SECTION VI. Projects This section
    is allocated to discuss some important projects that explicitly work with IoT
    and network slicing technologies. Most of the projects are based on the Europe
    region and the recent Horizon 2020 (H2020) funding scheme has fueled for most
    ongoing projects. Discussed projects along with their technical aspects and the
    focused research areas, are summarized in the Table IX. TABLE IX Contribution

    is for design, development and orchestration phases of the 5G-ready applications
    and the network services. One of the main objectives of this project is facilitating
    vertical industries by enabling the development, deployment and orchestration
    of network-aware applications via dynamically created application-aware network
    slices in the 5G ecosystem. It incorporated technological and business requirements
    that rose from various parties, such as industry, service providers, application
    users and the research community. The project consisted of four IoT use cases:

    intelligent-lighting system, remote control and monitoring of automobile electrical
    systems and an Industry 4.0 smart factory. F. 5G!Drones H2020 research and innovation

    The objectives of this project are validating 5G KPIs and evaluating and validating
    the performance of different UAV applications. This project covers four use cases:
    UAV traffic management, public safety/ saving lives, situation awareness and connectivity
    during crowded events. Network slicing is featured as the key component in this
    project, to run UAV services across the network using the same 5G infrastructure.
    It demonstrates that each UAV application runs independently without affecting
    the performance of other applications. The results obtained through this project
    will be used by the UAV association to make further recommendations. G. MonB5G
    MonB5G [197] (November 2019 – November 2022) was funded by the European Union’s
    Horizon 2020 research and innovation program. It is aiming a novel zero-touch-management
    and orchestration framework for network slicing, to increase the scalability massively
    for 5G LTE and beyond. This will leverage distribution of operations, together
    with AI-based mechanisms. Security and energy efficiency are considered key features
    in their conceptual, hierarchical, fault-tolerant, data-driven network management
    system, in order to orchestrate a plethora of parallel network slices specific
    for diverse services. This project consists of two PoCs: zero-touch network and
    service management with end-to-end SLAs and AI-assisted policy-driven security
    monitoring and enforcement. The architecture of this project is about splitting
    the centralised management system into multiple management subsystems that contain
    one or more distributed management elements. It has the purpose of distributing
    intelligence and design making across various components. H. 5Gmobix 5GMobix [198]
    (November 2018 – October 2021) is funded via H2020 program and this project is
    examining the implications of 5G and its role in future autonomous driving. They
    will develop and test the functionalities of automated vehicles using 5G technology
    in various environments, such as city and urban. This will be under several conditions
    like vehicular traffic and network coverage and service demand, considering social
    and business aspects. Network slicing will be used to facilitate Corporative,
    Connected and Automated Mobility (CCAM) trial activities in this project. I. Primo-5G
    The goal of the Primo-5G [199] (July 2018 – June 2021) project, funded by H2020
    program, is to demonstrate an end-to-end 5G system providing immersive video services
    for moving objects. The project consists of three objectives, one being demonstrating
    a 5G system to provide video services to moving objects. The second is developing
    technologies related to mmWave access and 5G core networks. Finally, the third
    objective is AI-assisted communications to support objective 1, 5G standardisation
    and spectrum regulation activities. The main envisaged scenario of this project
    is the firefighting scenario that is a part of the Public Protection and Disaster
    Relief (PPDR). Drones with cameras will be used by the crew to get real-time situation
    awareness of the fire scene prior to when they reach to the location, through
    AR/VR technologies. Network slicing will be used to provide network services for
    drones and other moving objects in this project. J. 5G-Monarch 5G MObile Network
    ARCHitecture (5G-MONARCH) [200] (1st July 2017 – 30th June 2019) is a project
    that was aiming to build a flexible, adaptable and programmable architecture for
    5G. Network slicing utilization is the specific technical goal of this project.
    The project consists of two phases. In phase 1, they designed such an architecture
    at a conceptual level with three enabling innovations. In phase 2, the addressed
    architecture was brought into practice. The three enabling innovations in this
    project are inter-slice control and cross-domain management, experiment-driven
    optimisation and cloud-enabled protocol stack. The developed architecture deployed
    in two testbeds: the smart sea port related to vertical industry use case and
    the tourist city related to media and entertainment use case. Resilience, security
    and resource elasticity are the functional innovations of the instantiated slices
    in use cases respectively. K. 5GCity 5GCity [201] (June 2017 – June 2019) is funded
    by the H2020 research and innovation program. The vision is designing, developing,
    deploying and demonstrating a distributed cloud and radio platform for 5G neutral
    hosts. This project was focused on bringing benefits of smart city infrastructure
    based on resource sharing and end-to-end virtualisation to 5G neutral hosts. The
    project targeted three different cities (Barcelona, Bristol and Lucca) under three
    use cases: media, neutral host and unauthorised-waste-dumping prevention. This
    was to enable the creation of dynamic E2E slices with virtualised edge and network
    resources to lease to third-party operators. Under the media use case, they will
    consider three different scenarios: mobile real-time transmission, UHD video distribution
    and real-time video acquisition and production in edge. For dumping use case,
    they would use surveillance cameras to monitor and detect unauthorised dumping.
    L. Inspire-5Gplus INtelligent Security and PervasIve tRust for 5G and Beyond (INSPIRE-5Gplus)
    [202] (November 2019 – November 2022) which is a Horizon 2020 project, aims to
    address the cybersecurity risks of 5G and beyond networks, and vertical applications,
    ranging from connected cars to industry 4.0, through an innovative security management
    concept. The project will improve security in several dimensions including, vision,
    use cases, integration and management, architecture, models, and assets. Ensuring
    the expected Security SLAs (SSLAs) and the regulation requirements via a fully
    automated E2E smart network and security management framework, is another objective
    of this project. M. Hexa-X Hexa-X [203] (January 2021 – June 2023) is the European
    Commission’s 6G flagship initiative project which aims to develop and define the
    architecture, technologies and vision for next generation 6G wireless networks.
    The research areas of Hexa-X project is focusing on six key topics, i.e., connected
    intelligence, networks of networks, sustainability, global service coverage, extreme
    experience, and trustworthiness. SECTION VII. Lessons Learned and Future Directions
    This section focuses on the lessons learned and the future research directions
    with respect to network slicing and IoT integration. Network slicing in different
    IoT applications, and technical aspects and challenges related to IoT realisation
    via network slicing will be discussed in here. Figure 16 shows a summary of the
    discussed future research directions. Fig. 16. Future research directions. Show
    All A. Smart Transportation 1) Lessons Learned: We explored how IoT can be engaged
    in different smart transportation applications with diverse network requirements.
    Autonomous vehicles play a key role in smart transportation. Several pieces of
    research have been conducted to discuss the realisation of autonomous vehicles,
    including fulfilling network requirements. We identified that network slicing
    can be used to facilitate diverse network requirements of different applications
    in smart transportation. Moreover, MEC helps to fulfill latency requirements in
    smart transportation applications. Slice isolation is lucrative in implementing
    security and privacy requirements of transportation communications. Dynamic allocation
    of network resources with enhanced scalability might be required in slices allocated
    to transportation due to sudden traffic surges induced from irregular patterns
    of using vehicles. 2) Future Directions: Though some researches can be found regarding
    network slicing and smart transportation, most of them are conceptual. Researches
    with actual slicing implementations can be considered as a valuable movement in
    the realisation of smart transportation. Since security and privacy are extremely
    important aspects of autonomous vehicles, the implementation of those aspects
    using network slicing can be identified as a future research direction. Traffic-prediction
    algorithms using AI/ML and reinforcement techniques need to be formulated to increase
    the efficiency of resource allocation between slices, to tackle the traffic surges.
    B. Industrial Automation 1) Lessons Learned: Network slicing tackles the generated
    complexity to the industrial networks. This includes managing and controlling
    the network, according to the introduced new range of requirements by Industry
    4.0. Facilitating the network requirements through allocating resources efficiently
    via network slicing has been examined in the existing researches. Hierarchical
    slicing can be used in large scale factories to reduce the complexity in MNO’s
    network and taking the management of the factory network to the factory authority.
    Utilising network slicing to implement secure industry networks has to be investigated
    further. 2) Future Directions: Using AR/VR technologies in industrial automation
    [204], [205] for operating machines remotely is a significant requirement to enhance
    the performance of a factory line and reduce the cost. Another requirement is
    remote diagnosing faults and performing necessary maintenance activities in machines.
    Network slicing is a salient technology that enables this feature and more researches
    can be conducted in the future in this area. In [206], Backman et al. proposed
    a novel concept of blockchain slice leasing ledger to autonomously and dynamically
    acquire the slices needed for increasing the efficiency in future factories. Future
    researches can be directed in using blockchain technology to the management of
    5G network slices that enable several new business models for smart factories,
    as well as IT infrastructure. C. Smart Healthcare 1) Lessons Learned: A myriad
    of use cases of the IoMT [207] intensifies the need of network slicing to facilitate
    heterogeneous network requirements of each use case. Since IoMT deals with the
    sensitive information of people, security and privacy of the exchanged healthcare
    data should be preserved during the communication [208]. Technical aspects in
    network slicing, such as slice isolation and adaptive SFC to change the security-related
    VNFs dynamically, are spotted as preserving ways to healthcare data. Network slicing
    and the 5G network support the realisation of remote surgeries [209] that need
    ultra-reliable network requirements with very low latency and guaranteed bandwidth.
    2) Future Directions: Remote patients’ monitoring framework collects valuable
    information from wearables, heart monitors and infusion pumps to provide better
    treatment to patients in remote. This is highlighted as a future direction of
    remote healthcare [88]. Healthcare-data transmission and data-management operations
    can be identified as very challenging research topics in healthcare [89]. So,
    the attention of future researches can be paved the way to healthcare-data transmission
    via network slicing. AI/ML techniques can be used to clean the collected massive
    healthcare data in MEC servers prior transmitting to the cloud for analysis. Facilitating
    network requirements in applying AR/VR technologies in remote surgeries and telemedicine
    via network slicing is an enthralling research direction. D. Smart City and Home
    1) Lessons Learned: Network slicing enhances the efficiency of network resource
    utilisation, to enable the realisation of a smart city concept that has billions
    of devices connected together under various use cases. Recursion is discerned
    as a salient aspect that supports the fast deploying of network slices for homogeneous
    smart city use cases. Among the smart home diversified-network requirements, security,
    performance, cost and management shortcomings are addressed via network slicing
    elaborately. 2) Future Directions: More elaborate pilots with more devices in
    multiple home applications are required, despite primitive implementations of
    smart-home solutions. This is to recognise the viability of network slicing in
    smart homes. Recursive composition of network slices can be researched in order
    to support smart city use cases. E. AR/VR/Gaming 1) Lessons Learned: AR/VR is
    becoming a realisation through the 5G architecture. It extends its roots into
    multiple service areas including mission-critical scenarios, like healthcare,
    and entertaining applications, like gaming and movies. Network slicing is recognised
    as the way of providing the network requirements, such as very low latency and
    high security required to AR/VR applications over the common infrastructure. Modern
    games enforced with smart wearables and AR/VR tools that connect people around
    the world need network slicing to attain its network requirements, such as low
    latency and high throughput over the public network cost-efficiently. Edge computing
    [210] is a supported technology for the realisation of the AR/VR. 2) Future Directions:
    To the best of our knowledge at the time that we are doing the survey, no researches
    can be found in network slicing and AR/VR applications. Future researches can
    be directed in the realisation of AR/VR applications using network slicing including
    satisfying AR/VR network requirements, such as security and high throughput. Implementing
    the same serving slice within multiple MNOs spread over different geographical
    regions is required in modern games. F. Military Applications 1) Lessons Learned:
    Military applications need extremely secure communication with very high privacy.
    Network slicing is recognised as the way of enabling secure and privacy-preserved
    communication in military applications over the public network. Scalability, dynamicity,
    end-to-end orchestration, recursion, security, adaptive SFC and privacy are all
    critical requirements in military networks, that can be facilitated through network
    slicing. 2) Future Directions: As far as we are aware, there are no scientific
    investigations in this domain. Thus, this area is a novel domain that researchers
    can direct their researches on the network slicing utilisation in military applications.
    Since security and privacy are supreme aspects in the defense sector, modern methods
    for enhancing these aspects are needed. Rapid deployment of new slices for covering
    battlefields and multi-domain slicing, need to be investigated to facilitate military
    applications. G. Smart Grid 1) Lessons Learned: Network slicing is the solution
    for the realisation of the smart grid that needs several isolated slices for services
    such as smart metering and UAV-based power-line inspection to facilitate diverse
    network requirements. Slices need to be distributed over a very large geographical
    area [211]. MEC can be considered as a viable solution for delay-sensitive applications
    in smart grids. Higher scalability in the network requested by the massive number
    of connected devices, such as smart meters to the grid, can be facilitated via
    network slicing. 2) Future Directions: It is possible to find high-level investigations
    related to smart grid applications in network slicing. However, scientific investigations
    specified for a particular application related to the grid are difficult to find
    and it will open a new research direction. Diverse energy sources and consumers
    can be connected together to build a more effective smart grid. More researches
    can be conducted in combining diverse sectors into the grid. Methods to improve
    the slice coverage are required in smart grid applications. H. UAVs and Drones
    1) Lessons Learned: In addition to the very fast communication requirements for
    controlling the UAV, high-bandwidth requirements exist for applications like transferring
    the video recordings collected by the UAV. Network slicing provides these diverse
    requirements on top of the same physical infrastructure. Slice isolation for providing
    required resources uninterruptedly is a critical requirement in UAVs, to assure
    the best functionality. 2) Future Directions: Contribution of Multiple Input Multiple
    Output (MIMO) systems in UAV communications can be considered as future research
    directions. Improving the network performance in order to increase the flying
    time can also be considered. Application-specific optimisation of deployment,
    mobility and operations of drones [212] are an important research topic that can
    be tackled using network slicing. I. Massive IoT 1) Lessons Learned: A massive
    number of connected devices with low power and low data rates increases the requirement
    of dedicated network slices with simple network functions over the common network
    infrastructure, due to simple power-preserving communication requirements. Massive
    amounts of data collected through the sensors in this application can be processed
    in the edge to reduce the burden in the core network. 2) Future Directions: Simple
    authentication mechanisms for these kinds of devices can be implemented as VNFs
    so that they can be deployed in network slices. They are a vital requirement and
    further investigations can be done in this area. Scientific investigations related
    to RAN-slicing techniques for massive IoT scenarios are also an interesting research
    direction. Methods to improve the coverage of the slices are required when facilitating
    environmental monitoring. J. Scalability 1) Lessons Learned: With the exploitation
    of the IoT for a myriad of applications, an enormous quantity of devices with
    diverse network requirements exist for connecting. The number of actively connected
    devices is varying from time to time. This escalates the need for a scalable network.
    Through slicing the network and changing the network-resource allocation dynamically
    (with respect to the requirements like the amount of traffic through the slice),
    network slicing increases the scalability of the network. 2) Future Directions:
    Extending the proposed dynamic network-slicing framework for fog computing systems
    into the 5G core network is stated as a future research direction in [46]. Dynamic
    resource allocation is an important aspect of the operation of improving scalability.
    The use of prediction algorithms based on the AI/ML techniques to predict the
    traffic pattern is an enthralling direction that can be used to enhance the scalability
    of the network. K. Dynamicity 1) Lessons Learned: Dynamic resource allocation
    between slices and the ability to deploy network slices dynamically is recognised
    as two main areas in achieving dynamicity via network slicing. We have identified
    that the number of active connections and the amount of traffic flowed vary rapidly
    in the IoT applications. Dynamic resource allocation using network slicing is
    a possible solution to increase the efficient utilisation of network resources.
    Rapid deployments of new slices for situations such as disaster management and
    battlefields, intensify the need of dynamicity of the network. 2) Future Directions:
    AI/ML-based resource-requirement prediction algorithms are a vital requirement
    in enhancing the flexibility of dynamic resource allocation between slices and
    it will be a sophisticated research direction. For efficient dynamic resource
    allocation, resource-allocation algorithms should be designed with a very low
    computational complexity [27]. Due to the heterogeneity of Radio Access Technologies
    (RATs), slicing the RAN is a complex task and it aggravates dynamic RAN resource
    allocation. L. Recursion 1) Lessons Learned: Slice creation is a frequent activity
    due to various slice requirements with slight changes among them. Recursion supports
    creating slices using the existing slices and it reduces the complexity of creating
    new slices while fastening the deployment of new ones. We recognised that the
    recursion supports the rapid expansion of the IoT in novel application areas.
    2) Future Directions: Since recursion is a novel concept, there is a lot to investigate
    under this aspect. To the best of our knowledge at the time we are conducting
    the research, we couldn’t find a dedicated scientific investigation regarding
    implementing recursion in network slicing. Required algorithms, entities, protocols
    and interfaces needs to be researched in implementing recursion. M. Adaptive SFC
    1) Lessons Learned: Network slice that is allocated for a particular use case
    can be identified as an SFC itself. It runs on the principles of SFC [213]. The
    chain of the NFs will be needed to change according to the different situations,
    such as deploying a security function when there is a security attack and removing
    the security function after the attack. The adaptability of the SFC in the network
    slice supports minimising the cost related to the network in terms of the resources
    and time, as well as increasing the productivity of the use case. 2) Future Directions:
    As stated in [29], there are two main challenges in SFC: selecting the optimal
    node and the routing scheme for the selected nodes. AI/ML-based algorithms can
    be developed in selecting optimal nodes and the optimum routing scheme for the
    SFC. N. Security 1) Lessons Learned: IoT exploitation in critical applications
    like smart grids and military applications and sensitive applications like smart
    health, increases the security requirements. To accomplish the different security
    levels in the IoT applications, network slicing can be considered as one of the
    optimum technologies. Slice isolation in network slicing is identified as the
    basic way of providing security between different applications. Deployment of
    different security functions in the slices is another way to achieve security
    requirements. In addition to the traditional security challenges, a series of
    new security challenges have been introduced due to network slicing. Security
    in network slicing can be divided into three main parts: life cycle security,
    inter-slice security and intra-slice security [179]. 2) Future Directions: Due
    to the lack of large-scale implementations of network slicing and the ongoing
    5G security specifications being prone to change, the analysis of network slicing
    security is still in an incipient phase [179]. Slice isolation is a critical requirement
    in achieving security. Several possible research directions can be identified,
    such as level of isolation and inter-slice communication with slice isolation.
    As discussed in [179], solutions for life cycle security, inter-slice security
    and intra-slice security can be investigated. Due to the third-party involvement
    in management scenarios of network slicing, a series of unknown security attacks
    will be generated and those can be examined in future researches. O. Privacy 1)
    Lessons Learned: Since IoT has entered to the applications that deal with sensitive
    information like healthcare applications and military applications, privacy became
    a momentous requirement. Allocating separate slices for different applications
    with strong slice isolation mechanisms allows privacy-preservation of the data
    communicated in different slices. The ability to change the privacy-related network
    functions of the network slice dynamically facilitates to corporate more privacy-preserving
    facilities into the IoT data streams. 2) Future Directions: As slice isolation
    is a critical requirement in preserving privacy, implementing an E2E isolated
    network slice needs to be investigated. Novel privacy-protecting algorithms that
    can be implemented as VNFs and deployed in a slice can be addressed. Effectuating
    concepts like Privacy by design and Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) in network
    slicing to preserve privacy can be studied. P. End-to-End Orchestration 1) Lessons
    Learned: Network slicing is an end-to-end technology that enables the deployment
    of slices, from the customer end to the application backend, through the network.
    It has the ability to change the configurations in slices according to the SLAs
    between the tenants and the network providers. This smooths the joining of new
    applications into the 5G market, including diverse IoT applications. We recognised
    that the diverse management requirements during the end-to-end traffic flow of
    various IoT applications can be accomplished using the end-to-end orchestration
    property of network slicing. 2) Future Directions: Though there are proposed E2E
    network slicing management and orchestration frameworks, a sophisticated E2E orchestration
    and management plane is required. It must have adaptive solutions for managing
    resources holistically and efficiently, through making the decisions according
    to the current state of the slice, as well as the predictions of future user demands
    [21]. Q. Resource Management 1) Lessons Learned: IoT increases the resource requirements
    in the telecommunication networks that can’t be satisfied cost-efficiently using
    traditional methods. We identified that the network slicing is the modern solution
    for addressing this problem. Assigning a dedicated amount of resources for each
    slice, along with the ability to dynamically reassign or overbook the allocated
    resources, increases the resource utilisation efficiency and cost-efficiency of
    the system [214]. Assuring the SLAs of the connected third-party tenants due to
    heterogeneous applications, including the IoT, becomes a reality due to network
    slicing [215]. 2) Future Directions: Radio resource management with guaranteeing
    the diverse QoS requirements is a challenging task [28]. Investigating efficient
    methods for RAN resource management for RAN slicing is a possible future research
    direction. In [215], Khodapanah et al. highlighted the requirement of an intelligent
    slice management function for fulfilling the SLAs of different network slices
    in the network. AI/ML-related algorithms for predicting resource requirements
    is a novel approach that can be used in resource management in network slicing.
    SECTION VIII. Emerging and Future Research Directions for Network Slicing and
    IoT Integration In this section, we present some of the novel technologies and
    their impact on network slicing and IoT realisation. Blockchain, AI/ML, multi-domain
    slicing and hierarchical slicing will be covered in here. A. Network Slicing and
    Blockchain Blockchain is a novel technology that began to attract the attention
    as the basis of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. It has the ability to vastly
    improve the existing technology applications, as well as to enable the realisation
    of the new applications that were never previously practical to be deployed [216].
    Blockchain can be identified as a time-stamped series of data that are immutable.
    This means once data is added to the blockchain, they cannot be deleted or modified.
    Data is stored in the blocks that are connected to each other and secured, using
    cryptographic principles. Different kinds of existing blockchain-based activities
    can be categorised into three areas: Blockchain 1.0 for currency-related operations,
    Blockchain 2.0 for contracts such as stocks, bonds and loans and Blockchain 3.0
    for applications such as health, science and literacy [217], [218]. Blockchain
    has been rapidly utilised to register, authenticate and validate assets and transactions.
    It has also been utilised to record data, manage the identification and govern
    interactions among multiple parties [219]. As well as in the other application
    areas, blockchains can be utilised in the telecommunication applications such
    as fraud detection, Identity-as-a-Service and data management, 5G enablement and
    the IoT connectivity [220]–[222]. In [219], Chaer et al. identified the main five
    areas that can be used blockchain in 5G networks: 5G infrastructure and crowdsourcing,
    5G-infrastructure sharing, international roaming, network slicing and management
    and authentication of mMTC and uRLLC. Figure 17 explains how blockchain can be
    used to achieve benefits in network slicing and in different IoT applications.
    Fig. 17. Role of Blockchain for Network slicing in IoT. Show All Network slice
    broker is a popular research area of using blockchain in network slicing and several
    researches can be found in this domain [206], [223]–[225]. In [223], Nour et al.
    proposed a network slice broker design based on blockchain technology. It supports
    the slice provider that is a new role included in 5G, to select resources from
    different resource providers and create E2E slices. They envisioned a subslice-deployment-brokering
    mechanism as a series of small contracts. In [224], Zanzi et al. proposed a novel
    network-slicing-brokering solution that leverages blockchain technology called
    NSBchain. It allows the allocation of network resources from Infrastructure Providers
    (InPs) to the Intermediate broker (IB) via smart contracts. It also allows IB
    to assign and redistribute their resources to tenants in a secure, automated and
    scalable manner. In [225], Valtanen et al. presented a blockchain network-slice-brokering
    use case value analysis. They used an industrial automation scenario as a use
    case in their paper that acquired the slices needed autonomously and dynamically.
    B. Network Slicing and Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are revolutionary technologies that have become
    ubiquitous in every field, making machines intelligent in order to make decisions
    themselves without any human intervention. Telecommunication operators tend to
    use ML techniques in multifarious areas such as network automation, customer experience,
    business process automation, infrastructure maintenance and new digital services
    [226]. ML can be recognised as a necessary part of any 5G network, due to its
    higher complexity than previous generation networks and the ability to serve a
    plethora of vertical services including the IoT [227]. Network slicing needs integration
    and more intelligent capabilities based on ML and big data applications, in order
    to achieve functionalities such as self-configuration, self-optimisation and fault
    management [228]. ML techniques (i.e., supervised learning, unsupervised learning
    and reinforcement learning) have been extensively used in improving network security,
    including authentication, access control, malware detection and anti-jamming offloading
    [229]. A comprehensive survey on resource management in cellular and IoT networks
    using ML techniques, was presented in [230]. Figure 18 shows how AI/ML can be
    used in network slicing and in different IoT application scenarios. Fig. 18. Role
    of AI/ML for network slicing in IoT. Show All In [231], Thantharate et al. implemented
    a deep learning neural network, to develop a DeepSlice model to manage network-load
    efficiency and network availability. It covers three main goals: appropriate slice
    selection for a device, correct slice prediction and allocating required resources
    based on the traffic prediction and adaption of slice assignments, in case of
    network failures. In [232], Mei et al. proposed an intelligent network-slicing
    architecture for V2X services that leverages the recent advancements of ML technologies.
    A novel deep reinforcement algorithm is proposed to automate the deployment of
    network slices based on the collected historical data of vehicular networks. A
    deep reinforcement algorithm was proposed in [233] for resource mapping in 5G
    network slicing. The proposed RLCO algorithm was able to solve the problems of
    poor efficiency of existing algorithms in virtual network mapping, low resource
    utilisation and poor coordination between node mapping and link mapping. In [234],
    De Bast et al. proposed a fast-learning Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) model
    that has the ability to optimise the slice configuration of unplanned Wi-Fi networks
    dynamically without expert knowledge. The proposed approach was able to optimise
    various Wi-Fi parameters per slice dynamically. C. Multi-Domain and Multi-Operator
    Slicing Network slices that are allocated to different vertical applications,
    may be spread over large geographical areas or encompassing areas where coverage
    can’t be provided by a single operator, may need to combine resources from different
    operators to provide the coverage [75]. Provisioning of high-quality connectivity
    infrastructure in specific locations such as schools and transport hubs, the context-driven
    and location-specific needs for wireless connectivity in different facilities,
    different business requirements for deployment of 5G networks, and the growing
    interest for local 5G networks to serve restricted set of customers such as in
    a factory environment, are some facts that burgeon the concept of local 5G operators
    concept [235]. Therefore, the involvement of multiple administrative domains in
    creating and operating the network slices for providing a better service is a
    significant requirement in novel 5G networks. Figure 19 shows the concept of multi-domain
    network slicing that depicted a network slice spanned over three administrative
    domains. As shown in the figure, a minimum of three orchestrators are needed to
    facilitate multi-domain network slicing. One is domain-specific-slice orchestrator
    for the management and orchestration of the Network Slice Subnet Instances (NSSIs)
    in each domain. Another is domain-specific-NFVI orchestrator for managing network
    resources. Thirdly, multi-domain E2E-slice orchestrator for E2E management of
    the NS. The significant challenges in multi-domain slicing includes identifying
    the necessary administrative domains with required resources to deploy the NSSIs,
    stitching them to create the federated NSI, and the run-time coordination of the
    management operations across different administrative domains [75]. The open-research
    challenges in the area of multi-domain network slicing are service-management
    interfaces and service profiling, resource sharing and isolation and service-based
    network management [75]. Fig. 19. Multi-domain network slicing. Show All D. Hierarchical
    Slicing Hierarchical slicing is an exotic area in network slicing that will generate
    new business models. Ordinarily, MNO creates network slices according to the requirements
    received from the third party tenants. Though it satisfies the basic communication
    requirements of the tenant, he may need to further slice the received network
    slice into more subslices that are specified for separate service areas of the
    particular tenant. As an example, a giant-sized smart factory can get a dedicated
    slice from a large MNO. But the factory needs to further slice the received network
    slice into more slices that are specialised to different applications in the factory,
    such as operating machines, monitoring the factory environment and communication
    between employees. This can be recognised as the concept of hierarchical slicing.
    Reference [236] highlights a set of key features in hierarchical network slicing
    concepts, such as multi-tenant Virtual Service Networks (VSNs) with embedded slices,
    hierarchical SDN control and NFV integration and distributed slice selection.
    Figure 20 shows the concept of hierarchical slicing. Allocated slice is sliced
    again into three slices that are specified for the services of the tenant. In
    [80], Sun et al. proposed a hierarchical resource allocation architecture for
    network slicing. In there, they use Global Radio Resource Manager (GRRM) to allocate
    resources for a slice and Local Radio Resource Manager (LRRM) that is specific
    for the slice, to further divide the allocated amount of resources for the slice
    among the UEs. To the best of our knowledge, there are no significant scientific
    investigations that were conducted in hierarchical slicing and hence, this is
    a rich area for conducting future researches. Fig. 20. Hierarchical slicing Architecture.
    Show All SECTION IX. Conclusion Network slicing is becoming a reality in future
    telecommunication networks, due to the support of several technologies, such as
    SDN, NFV and cloud computing. It has been identified as an inevitable technology
    in the realisation of the IoT solutions that are proliferating in several applications
    with heterogeneous network requirements. We comprehensively discussed how network
    slicing can be used in different IoT applications, along with the existing researches
    and future research directions for each application. Technical aspects that can
    be improved in the IoT through network slicing were explored. Although network
    slicing imparts a lot of advantages in the IoT realisation, several technical
    challenges in network slicing will mature, due to the evolution of the IoT. We
    identified those challenges during the survey. Since the lack of large-scale implementations
    of slicing and the specifications related to network slicing that are still prone
    to changes, network slicing is a rich area that has several possible future research
    directions. In all essence, network slicing and IoT are two complementary technologies
    that, if well harnessed, have the potential of enabling the smart world since
    5G networks and beyond. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

    \ two billion in 2050, according to\nthe survey taken by the Food and Agriculture\
    \ Organization, while the arable area is likely to grow\nonly by 5%. Therefore,\
    \ smart and eﬃcient farming techniques are necessary to improve agriculture\n\
    productivity. Agriculture land suitability assessment is one of the essential\
    \ tools for agriculture\ndevelopment. Several new technologies and innovations\
    \ are being implemented in agriculture as\nan alternative to collect and process\
    \ farm information. The rapid development of wireless sensor\nnetworks has triggered\
    \ the design of low-cost and small sensor devices with the Internet of Things\n\
    (IoT) empowered as a feasible tool for automating and decision-making in the domain\
    \ of agriculture.\nThis research proposes an expert system by integrating sensor\
    \ networks with Artiﬁcial Intelligence\nsystems such as neural networks and Multi-Layer\
    \ Perceptron (MLP) for the assessment of agriculture\nland suitability. This proposed\
    \ system will help the farmers to assess the agriculture land for\ncultivation\
    \ in terms of four decision classes, namely more suitable, suitable, moderately\
    \ suitable,\nand unsuitable. This assessment is determined based on the input\
    \ collected from the various sensor\ndevices, which are used for training the\
    \ system. The results obtained using MLP with four hidden\nlayers is found to\
    \ be eﬀective for the multiclass classiﬁcation system when compared to the other\n\
    existing model. This trained model will be used for evaluating future assessments\
    \ and classifying the\nland after every cultivation.\nKeywords: smart agriculture;\

    \ is considered as the base for human living because it is the primary source\n\
    of food and income for most of the countries in the world. The economy of the\
    \ country depends\non agriculture production as it provides food, raw materials,\
    \ employment, etc., to the people living\nin that country [1]. It has been observed\
    \ in recent times that there is no signiﬁcant development in\ncrop production\
    \ in the agriculture sector. Also, there is a rapid increase in the price of food\
    \ because\nthe production of the crop is not meeting demand [2]. One of the causes\
    \ for the decrease in crop\nproduction is the farmers use of the traditional way\
    \ of cultivation, which leads to less crop yield.\nThe farmers new to the agriculture\
    \ ﬁeld have insuﬃcient knowledge about the characteristics of soil\nSensors 2019,\
    \ 19, 3667; doi:10.3390/s19173667\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019,\
    \ 19, 3667\n2 of 16\nfor crop cultivation [3]. They are not conscious of the fact\
    \ that agriculture land needs to be assessed\nbefore cultivation [4].\nLand suitability\
    \ analysis is a mandatory prerequisite for crop cultivation, which helps to obtain\n\
    maximum production. In order to acquire the properties of the soil, farmers depend\
    \ on soil testing\nlabs, which are not suﬃcient enough to help them, and sometimes\
    \ the data provided by the labs are\ninaccurate [5]. In order to get enough knowledge\
    \ about cultivation, data need to be collected manually,\nwhich is very diﬃcult\
    \ for farmers. The solution is the replacement of traditional methods of data\n\
    collection with Internet of Things (IoT)-based sensors [6]. Sensors play a signiﬁcant\
    \ role in collecting\ninformation about various factors such as soil, water, climate,\
    \ etc., for agriculture development. With\nthe help of data gathered from diﬀerent\
    \ sensors, land suitability analysis could be done, which would\nhelp farmers\
    \ identify the current status of their agriculture land and improve their crop\
    \ production.\nSeveral decision models have been developed so far to assist the\
    \ farmers in taking a decision on crop\ncultivation to maximize their proﬁt [7].\n\
    Ever-changing real-world conditions like monsoons to temperate are the dominant\
    \ factors in\naﬀecting agriculture productivity. Soil parameters to weather prediction\
    \ are essential in knowing\nthe future yield [8]. The key factors that are inﬂuencing\
    \ the crop yield are climatic conditions, soil\nproductivity, and groundwater\
    \ characteristics, as well as its availability. An extensive study on\nphenotyping\
    \ is helping researchers to understand these factors [9]. One of the signiﬁcant\
    \ challenges\ninvolved in identifying the diﬀerent land conditions is based on\
    \ the inﬂuence of various soil parameters.\nOver the past few decades, soil testing\
    \ has been practised, which is widely accepted by agriculture\nexperts and farmers\
    \ to determine the properties of soil for agriculture production [10]. The Agriculture\n\
    Management Information System (AMIS) is mandatory to store the data acquired in\
    \ various formats\nand exchanges the data for digital agriculture technology [11].\
    \ Currently, AMIS has enhanced its\nfacilities by accumulating the latest technologies,\
    \ such as the Internet and the Internet of Things (IoT).\nIntroduction of the\
    \ usage of sensors actually reduces the cost and time involved in assessing the\n\
    land suitability in the traditional manner [12]. The uses of sensors are plenty,\
    \ and it is possible to use\nas many sensors in the ﬁeld of agriculture. Soil\
    \ sensors, water sensors, and biosensors are few that\nhave been shown to have\
    \ a signiﬁcant role in measuring nature. These sensors contribute to the smart\n\
    farming system, especially in the handling of appropriate irrigation systems to\
    \ help farmers. The Radio\nFrequency Identiﬁcation (RFID) technology is used for\
    \ the detection of animals entering into the\nfarmland. The Global Positioning\
    \ System (GPS) position-based seeding recommendation is emerging\nas another beneﬁt\
    \ in the ﬁeld of agriculture beneﬁting from the latest technological developments\
    \ [13].\nSome of the beneﬁts it has achieved in recent days are improved eﬃciency,\
    \ sustainable growth, as well\nas cost-eﬀectiveness. It is considered to be the\
    \ connection between the collection of physical devices\nthrough internet connection\
    \ such as WiFi, Data cards, etc.\nAs a revolutionary change, the sensor-driven\
    \ network has a considerable role in precision\nagriculture [14]. Timely forecast\
    \ based on soil parameters will ensure proper irrigation systems. IoT\nhas a signiﬁcant\
    \ role in handling the recorded data from sensors. General Purpose Input/Output\n\
    facilitates various sensor inputs and the corresponding outputs in Raspberry Pi.\
    \ Further, this could\nreally help in hosting diﬀerent sensors. Cloud computing\
    \ is helping the IoT sensor networks to record\nthe measured data through its\
    \ sensors. The wireless medium is transferring the data to the cloud,\nwhich is\
    \ used later for data analysis [15].\nData Analytics has brought impactful results\
    \ for future predictions in almost every single\napplication. Artiﬁcial intelligence-based\
    \ model building is a challenging task as the model should\nreplicate the observed\
    \ parameters in the dataset. Parametric estimations are helpful in solving the\n\
    problems in a futuristic way, and agriculture problems are among those [16]. Agriculture\
    \ data analysis\nis done with diﬀerent machine learning algorithms. Maximizing\
    \ the outcome is the agenda for any\nmachine learning model, and model assessment\
    \ metrics are helpful in analyzing the results obtained.\nAppropriate training\
    \ of the machine learning model will produce the results with utmost accuracy.\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 3667\n3 of 16\nNeural network-based models are used widely,\
    \ as they have the capability to improve the eﬃciency\nof the model over every\
    \ iteration [17]. Classiﬁcation problems are handled by various algorithms,\n\
    such as support vector machines, decision tree algorithms, etc. Multiclass classiﬁcations\
    \ are expertly\nhandled by neural network algorithms [18]. When the model is trained\
    \ with the appropriate number\nof inputs and outputs, it is expected to give better\
    \ results compared to other machine learning models.\nThe integration of IoT,\
    \ along with machine learning models, are providing the farmer recommendation\n\
    system with appropriate inputs [19].\nIn this work, an agriculture dataset has\
    \ been obtained through various IoT sensor devices such as\na pH sensor, soil\
    \ moisture sensor, salinity sensor, and electromagnetic sensor. A sensor is a\
    \ device\nwhich is used to detect and respond to some type of input obtained from\
    \ the physical environment [20].\nAs it requires less labor and consumes less\
    \ time, it is used in many real-time applications. As the\nInternet plays a mediatory\
    \ role in various kinds of communication and data exchange, it is advisable to\n\
    integrate the agriculture data with the cloud platform. The data acquired from\
    \ the various IoT devices\ncould be stored to the cloud platform [21].\nThe key\
    \ contribution of this work is as follows\n•\nThe selection of the relevant attributes\
    \ and the collection of data from the appropriate sources for\nbetter agriculture\
    \ land suitability classiﬁcation, and these data are heterogeneous in nature.\n\
    •\nIntegration of diﬀerent data collection and bringing it to a form suitable\
    \ for future predictions.\n•\nThe noble initiation towards helping the farmers\
    \ build a recommendation model, especially for\nthe low economic regions, in a\
    \ country like India.\n•\nGeneralization of the proposed model, which could be\
    \ used for any land, as the current test inputs\nare suﬃcient for the classiﬁcation\
    \ of the land suitability with this developed model.\n•\nThe multiclass classiﬁcation\
    \ is another crucial contribution as the majority of the past work is\nbased on\
    \ binary classiﬁcation, which includes two decision classes, namely suitable and\
    \ unsuitable.\nThese multiclass results are helpful for the farmers when compared\
    \ to the binary classiﬁcation, to\ntake suitable action based on the outcome of\
    \ the results.\nThis paper presents a model that will automate the process of\
    \ analyzing various deciding factors\nin the assessment of present and future\
    \ conditions for the better crop yield. The diﬀerent classiﬁcation\nwill help\
    \ decide well in advance how to proceed to start a new session. Besides, this\
    \ would ensure\nminimal loss to the farmers, and the diﬀerent sections presented\
    \ here elucidate the model further.\n2. Related Work\nThe integration of the Internet\
    \ of Things into the agricultural system has led to the Internet of\nAgriculture\
    \ of Things along with advanced computing techniques. The researchers apply this\
    \ to\nobtain maximum beneﬁt and to also improve the production of agriculture,\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence, and\nIoT [22]. The agriculture domain is experiencing\
    \ new evolution and revolution motivated by sensors,\nIoT, big data, and cloud\
    \ technology [23]. The IoT based on a smart agriculture system was developed\n\
    using deep reinforcement learning integrated with a cloud environment, in which\
    \ four layers were\nincluded, namely data collection, edge computing, data transmission,\
    \ and cloud computing [24]. IoT\nhas been integrated with agriculture systems\
    \ to yield maximum proﬁt, and the applications of IoT in\nagriculture have been\
    \ categorized into restricted environment planning, open farm planting, livestock\n\
    farm monitoring, and aquaculture development [25].\nA new proposal was presented\
    \ for agriculture applications by investigating various integrated\nplatforms,\
    \ which include cloud computing, IoT, and data mining techniques [26].\nA scalable\n\
    network-based architecture was proposed to monitor and regulate agriculture farms\
    \ in rural areas\nwith the help of IoT-based WiFi with long-distance network and\
    \ fog computing [27]. The development\nof IoT in agriculture data analytics has\
    \ transformed from a speciﬁc crop to any kind of crop. Also,\nthe system is able\
    \ to support a various number of applications from controlling and supervising\
    \ the\nagriculture crops to promoting the products in the market [28]. An irrigation\
    \ monitoring and control\nSensors 2019, 19, 3667\n4 of 16\nsystem was developed\
    \ using a fuzzy approach to generate a moisture content distribution map of soil\n\
    by applying an interpolation technique.\nThe IoT-based Wireless Sensor Network\
    \ (WSN) was used to generate a distribution map with the\nmeasurements of soil\
    \ moisture content taken at nine places of the selected farmland [29]. An IoT-based\n\
    system was developed to water agriculture crops using a wireless sensor network,\
    \ and a web application\nwas also designed to control the information about the\
    \ crop and ﬁeld [30]. Several machine learning\nalgorithms have been used so far\
    \ for prediction and forecasting. A new forecasting model was designed\nby combining\
    \ the gravitational search algorithm with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to forecast\
    \ the level\nof water in Winnipesaukee and Cypress Lakes in the USA [31]. A neural\
    \ network-based model was\nproposed using MLP to predict the bid price of the\
    \ keyword in a particular search engine ranking [32].\nA hybrid model was proposed\
    \ by combining the ﬁreﬂy algorithm and MLP to predict the salinity value\nof soil\
    \ with the help of remote sensing data [33]. An algorithm was proposed for the\
    \ identiﬁcation of\nweed diseases using MLP and automatic relevance determination.\
    \ Three multi-criteria yield models\nwere proposed using neural networks with\
    \ MLP for the prediction of winter rapeseed [34].\nAn IoT-based hydroponic intelligent\
    \ system was developed using deep neural networks to control\nthe actions in the\
    \ hydroponic environment characterized by multiple parameters gathered using IoT\n\
    sensors [35]. An IoT-based smart decision model was developed to help the farmers\
    \ to get information\nsuch as fertilizer requirements, crop analysis, and market\
    \ requirements. IoT-based sensors were used to\nobtain the data related to farming,\
    \ and it is stored in a cloud framework where information is processed\nand sent\
    \ to farmers’ mobile devices by applying some data mining techniques [36]. An\
    \ Intelligent\nmodel was developed for the diagnosis of faults in the aquaculture\
    \ ponds located in remote places\nthrough IoT sensors. A fuzzy neural network\
    \ algorithm was applied for fault detection, and the model\ndetects many types\
    \ of faults in aquaculture ponds [37]. An IoT-based prototype was designed for\n\
    monitoring the water level in sources like borewells, water tanks, etc. This prototype\
    \ could be used to\navoid damage in pump motors when the water level goes beyond\
    \ the threshold level [38].\nA predictive platform for precision agriculture was\
    \ presented using IoT devices to improve\ncrop productivity at low-cost. Deep\
    \ learning algorithms were used to predict the diseases in plants\nwhich were\
    \ hidden in the images of the leaves, and they were classiﬁed with maximum accuracy\
    \ [39].\nAn intelligent system was developed to predict the fruit-melon image\
    \ of skin lesions and alert for new\nplanting environments using the convolutional\
    \ neural network and deep learning rule. The image is\nobtained by using an infrared\
    \ video sensor, and the system has obtained a satisfactory accuracy of\n97.5%.\
    \ A modern automatic agriculture monitoring system was developed using the ZigBee\
    \ Wireless\nSensor Network and deep learning algorithms. Wireless sensor networks\
    \ are also used to monitor the\ntemperature of soil and humidity. Also, the system\
    \ classiﬁes the moisture content in the soil.\nA decision tree-based model was\
    \ proposed for optimizing water and energy consumption [40].\nFurther, this was\
    \ accomplished with the assistance of the Internet-of-things. Moreover, to help\
    \ the\nfarmers in saving the precious water resource, which is declining day by\
    \ day, several soil parameters\nwere considered. Besides, for measuring the water\
    \ requirement, and factors such as soil moisture\ncontent and soil temperature\
    \ were utilized for making a suitable decisions concerning water release.\nThe\
    \ cloud-based IoT sensors are helpful in this work to control the overall setup.\
    \ This in turn also\nsaves the energy.\nThe below section presents the proposed\
    \ system which is a recommendation model for using\nartiﬁcial intelligence and\
    \ sensors.\n3. Proposed System—Sensors Driven Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) - Based\

    The various parameters used to ﬁnd agriculture land suitability analysis in this\

    \ value is obtained based on the measurement of the soil moisture sensor and\n\
    granularity of the soil is obtained using the measurement acquired from the moisture\
    \ content of the\nsoil. The values of the structure of the soil and the compact\
    \ and cementation are obtained from the\nagriculture experts.\nThe type of dataset\
    \ acquired from the sensors are numerical values. Based on the values obtained\n\
    from the sensor, suitability range values (obtained from experts) are assigned\
    \ to the parameters\nconsidered for the land suitability model. For example, the\
    \ pH value ranges from 7.2–6.7 for favorable\nland conditions, 6.6–5.5 for less\
    \ favorable land conditions, 5.4–4.5 for unfavorable land conditions,\nand less\
    \ than 4.5 for the very unfavorable land condition. The salinity value for the\
    \ favorable land\ncondition is <2, 2–6 for less favorable land conditions, 6–12\
    \ for unfavorable land conditions, and\ngreater than 12 for the very unfavorable\
    \ condition. The sampling period of data acquisition is one\nday. The average\
    \ of the one-day data obtained from various sensors is stored in the cloud network\
    \ as\npart of the preprocessing of the data. As the data may contain missing and\
    \ noisy values, the mean of\nthe data is considered. Since the data contain diﬀerent\
    \ units of measurement (categorical, numerical),\nnormalization is done before\
    \ applying the proposed model.\nFigure 1 states the architectural diagram of the\
    \ proposed model. The steps involved in this process\nare shown in this ﬁgure.\
    \ The data is collected from the farmland using sensors, and is then transferred\n\
    and stored with the help of the Raspberry Pi system in the cloud. The stored data\
    \ is used here to\nbuild the artiﬁcial intelligence recommendation model shown\
    \ in the ﬁgure. The constructed model is\nexpected to classify the results into\
    \ four diﬀerent categories. Amazon Web Service (AWS) is used here\nfor the storage\
    \ of the data.\nThe learning model construction is explained in the algorithm\
    \ part given below. The built model\nwill be assessed with inputs received after\
    \ every cultivation period, and accordingly, assessment results\nwill be provided.\
    \ Diﬀerent classes are considered here for land suitability assessment as most\
    \ suitable\n(class 1), suitable (class 2), moderately suitable (class 3), and\
    \ unsuitable (class 4).\nThe Algorithm 1 presented here explains the steps involved\
    \ in the processing the collected data\nfrom the diﬀerent sensors. Since the size\
    \ of the data is quite high in size, it is necessary to handle the\ndata with\
    \ the algorithm that is capable of handling the expected size of the data. That\
    \ is the reason\nwhy a neural network approach is considered here for processing\
    \ the data. The algorithm presented\nhere is further explained below.\nArtiﬁcial\
    \ Intelligence Model building is given in the algorithm. Processing of the neural\
    \ networks\nrelies upon the network topology, adjustments of weights, and activation\
    \ functions. The network\ntopology deﬁnes the network arrangement together with\
    \ its connecting links and nodes. In neural\nnetworks, learning refers to the\
    \ process of modifying weights of neural connections among the neurons\nof the\
    \ speciﬁc network. Activation functions are additional eﬀorts applied over the\
    \ input to achieve\nthe exact output. In the proposed work, a supervised learning-based\
    \ neural network is adopted where\nthe learning process is dependent. The input\
    \ vector is oﬀered to the network model and obtains an\noutput vector, which is\
    \ then compared to the desired or target vector. An error signal is developed\n\
    in case of a variation existing between the actual and the desired output vector.\
    \ Depending on the\nerror signal the weights are adapted until the desired and\
    \ the actual output matches. Neural networks\ncan be precisely deﬁned as complex\
    \ adaptive architecture, which can transform its internal structure\ndepending\
    \ on the information passing through them. The following section explains the\

    \ Study Area\nThe data used for this experimentation are collected from the diﬀerent\
    \ villages of the Vellore and\nTiruvannamalai district in the state of Tamil Nadu,\
    \ India. With expert opinions, we have shortlisted\nthe various parameters that\
    \ are really inﬂuence the crop yield. This collection of the dataset includes\n\
    a combination of distinctive climate, soil, and groundwater properties. Four decision\
    \ classes are\nconsidered here for land suitability assessment, namely most suitable\
    \ (class 1), suitable (class 2),\nmoderately suitable (class 3), and unsuitable\
    \ (class 4).\n4.2. Data Preparation\nIt is essential to prepare the information\
    \ astutely before training the neural networks (NN) and\nmultilayer perceptron\
    \ (MLP) models. The present real-world data obtained from sensors are distributed\n\
    non-uniformly, and henceforth, th data cannot be utilized legitimately amid training\
    \ and testing of the\nNN and MLP models. In this way, the input features are normalized,\
    \ and categorical variables are\nconverted to numeric data through the data label\
    \ encoder for eﬃcient processing. The standardized\ndataset is then sub-divided\
    \ into training and independent test sets in the ratio of 75:25. The results\n\
    obtained are observed in the perspective of multiclass classiﬁcation, as well\
    \ as for the individual class\nbasis. The process of training and testing is repeated\
    \ for a variable number of iterations starting from\n30, 50, and so on, till 100\
    \ until the convergence optimization is met, and also for a variable number of\n\
    neurons and hidden processing layers for each model.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3667\n\
    8 of 16\n4.3. Performance Measures\nThe performance parameters which are assessed\
    \ for multiclass classiﬁcation are characterized as\nfollows. For a class ‘C’,\
    \ the classiﬁer eﬃciency and performance could be assessed with true positive\n\
    (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) that can\
    \ be determined from the\ncounts of testing samples belonging to ‘C’ [42]. Various\
    \ performance metrics appropriate for assessing\nNN and MLP for multiclass classiﬁcation\
    \ problems are calculated [42]. Classiﬁcation accuracy scores\ncould be used to\
    \ determine the accuracy of the model by deﬁning the number of correct predictions\n\
    made from all the predictions. Also, this enables us to determine the per-class\
    \ eﬀectiveness of the\nmodel and is calculated as,\nAccuracy =\nTP + TN\nTP +\
    \ TN + FP + FN\n(1)\nThe performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score,\
    \ etc., used for binary classiﬁcation\nneeds to be generalized for the multiclass\
    \ classiﬁcation setting. To meet the appropriate needs, we\ncalculate the micro-average\
    \ and the macro average. In micro-averaging, the performance is evaluated,\ni.e.,\
    \ the precision, recall, and the F1 score are obtained from the individual TP,\
    \ TN, FP, and FN of\nthe n-class model [42]. In macro-averaging, the mean of the\
    \ performance of each individual class is\ndetermined, providing equal weight\
    \ to each of the classiﬁcation labels. Precision is the ratio of the\npredicted\
    \ positive events that are actually positive.\nPrecisionmicro =\nPn\ni=1 TPi\n\

    \ is the\nperformance measurement for classiﬁcation problems under various threshold\
    \ settings. ROC represents\nthe probability curve, and AUC is the degree or measure\
    \ of separability distinguishing the classes.\nThe AUC-ROC score is represented\
    \ in Table 2 under various iterations for the NN and MLP learning\nmodels. Figures\
    \ 2–4 represent the AUC-ROC curve for the multiclass classiﬁcation problem under\n\
    various iterations for the learning models. The AUC-ROC curve indicates how well\

    \ the ith data instance of the learning model.\n5. Experimental Results\nThe proposed\
    \ sensor-based AI model evaluates the experimental agriculture land based on the\n\
    considered attributes for cultivating the crop, which is expected to give better\
    \ yield. The agriculture\ndata obtained from sensors consists of 1000 alternatives\
    \ with 14 attributes. Out of 1000 data instances,\n750 data instances are used\
    \ for training the model, and the remaining 250 are used for testing the model.\n\
    The test dataset has been collected separately after every crop yield in a span\
    \ of one year. The proposed\nmodel classiﬁes the experimental dataset into four\
    \ decision classes, namely most suitable (class 1),\nsuitable (class 2), moderately\
    \ suitable (class 3), and unsuitable (class 4). The agriculture site belongs to\n\
    class 1, and class 2 could be used for crop cultivation in the present form, whereas\
    \ the agriculture farm\nbelongs to class 3 needs to be further processed by applying\
    \ the appropriate manure before cultivating\nthe crop, and the land that comes\
    \ under class 4 cannot be used for cultivation. The collected agriculture\ndataset\
    \ here is applied to the MLP algorithm for training purpose. The performance of\
    \ the MLP-based\nmulticlass classiﬁcation model is compared with the results obtained\
    \ from neural networks.\nThe number of hidden layers and the number of neurons\
    \ in each hidden layer are one of the most\nsigniﬁcant architectural parameters\
    \ which legitimately impacts the execution of MLP and NN during\nthe training\
    \ and preparation of the information for setting up a learning base. In any case,\
    \ determining\nthese parameters prior has been an unsolved problem in ML research.\
    \ In the proposed work for NN,\nthe experiments were performed with the number\
    \ of hidden neurons (Nh) to be set as 30, 50, and 80\nand the results were noted.\
    \ For MLP, the experiment is repeated for three and four numbers of hidden\nlayers\
    \ and the neurons in each layer were 30, 50, and 80. All the results have been\
    \ epitomized and\ndeﬁned in tables for varying the Nh values. Tables 1 and 2 deﬁnes\
    \ the results obtained for each class\nseparately using NN and MLP with Nh = 30.\
    \ Likewise, Tables 3 and 4 deﬁnes the results obtained\nfor Nh = 50 and Nh = 80.\
    \ On the other hand, Table 4 describes the results attained by the NN and\nMLP\
    \ based on multiclass classiﬁcation with Nh = 30. Likewise, Tables 5 and 6 illustrates\
    \ the multiclass\nclassiﬁcation results obtained for Nh = 50 and Nh = 80 accordingly.\
    \ It needs to be noticed that all the\nresults that appeared in these three tables\
    \ are averaged and equated over ten independent simulations\nfor each of the learning\
    \ models.\nTable 1. Performance of Neural Networks (NN) and MultiLayer Perceptron\

    \ are delineated in Tables 2–6, are basically dependent on\ndiﬀerent performance\
    \ parameters. The proposed work compiles various performance parameters for\n\
    the evaluation and assessment of NN and MLP for the multiclass classiﬁcation dataset.\
    \ The training\nperformance for the NN for the proposed dataset is found to be\
    \ varying for diﬀerent values of Nh such\nas Nh = 30, Nh = 50, and Nh = 80. The\
    \ performance measures of the NN model are found to improve as\nthe number of\
    \ neurons in the hidden layer Nh increases. With the increase in Nh, the NN is\
    \ capable\nof predicting the test data hypothesis with improved accuracy. Moreover,\
    \ the MSE and the RMSE\nare found to be very low and decrease accordingly in all\
    \ three cases. Further, this results in better\nconvergence of error, leading\
    \ to possibly proper learning of features. The performance parameters,\nlike the\
    \ accuracy, precision, and others mentioned, seems to follow a similar manner.\n\
    Hence, it could be presumed that predictive accuracy could be a good measure for\
    \ this dataset.\nThe performance results obtained using the MLP with three hidden\
    \ layers are found to be much better\nthan that of NN. Similar to the NN model,\
    \ this MLP model shows improved performance results\nwith the increasing number\
    \ of Nh. However, since the number of hidden layers has increased the\narchitectural\
    \ complexity, the convergence optimization is achieved with less number of iterations\
    \ when\ncompared to the NN.\nThe accuracy and other performance measures are found\
    \ to improve accordingly with an increase\nin the Nh. On observing the performance\
    \ measures of MLP with four hidden layers, the model\nindividually is found to\
    \ provide better results with improved performance with an increase in Nh.\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 3667\n14 of 16\nHowever, when observed for the test case of Nh = 30,\
    \ MLP with three hidden layers is found to produce\nbetter results than the MLP\
    \ with four hidden layers. Further, this may be due to the increase in\narchitectural\
    \ complexity with an increased number of hidden layers. Also. if the Nh is set\
    \ to as high as\n100, there might be a high risk of over-ﬁtting the training data\
    \ which would lead to poor performance\nthan those obtained with Nh values of\
    \ 50 and 80. Besides, provided the current experimental setup,\none could likewise\
    \ accomplish slightly diﬀerent results due to the underlying fact that the biases\
    \ and\ninitial weights of the neural networks are determined randomly. If an appropriate\
    \ weight set is ﬁxed\ninitially, one could obtain superior results for similar\
    \ settings. This assertion could be endorsed by the\nfact that the gradient descent\
    \ may not generally ensure a near-ideal weight set towards the end of the\nneural\
    \ network training process.\nAccording to the results obtained inTable 6, the\
    \ performance of MLP with four hidden layers\nis high compared to the performance\
    \ of the Neural Network and the MLP with three hidden layer\napproaches used in\
    \ some of the existing literature. Therefore, the proposed model assesses the\
    \ given\nagriculture land and provides better results for sustainable agriculture\
    \ development compared to other\napproaches. This model provides a reliable decision\
    \ on the suitability level of the agriculture land in\nfour diﬀerent categories,\
    \ helping agriculturists to assess their land appropriately. Thus, this proposed\n\
    model could be used as a recommendation model for land suitability to improve\
    \ the crop production\nfor sustainable agriculture development.\n7. Conclusions\n\
    Since agriculture is the backbone of any country, it is necessary to ensure its\
    \ sustainable growth\nover the years. This work has presented a model that would\
    \ be as accurate as 99%, which would be the\nmost desirable. The data collected\
    \ through various sensors, handled here with MLP with four hidden\nlayers, has\
    \ ensured better eﬃciency. A proper advisory system with precise instructions\
    \ would always\ndeliver better results. Thus, the accuracy score to precision\
    \ score presented depicts the eﬃciency of this\nproposed approach, which will\
    \ ensure appropriate classiﬁcation. Multiclass classiﬁcation in agriculture\n\
    would further ﬁne-tune the recommendation system to guide farmers appropriately.\
    \ Rather than\nbinary classiﬁcation, this one would guide the farmers’ precisely.\
    \ Thus, this approach would provide\nreal-time data to ensure better crop yield\
    \ productivity.\nAuthor Contributions: This research speciﬁes below the individual\

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: A rise in the population has immensely increased the
    pressure on the agriculture sector. With the advent of technology, this decade
    is witnessing a shift from conventional approaches to the most advanced ones.
    The Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed both the quality and quantity of
    the agriculture sector. Hybridization of species along with the real-time monitoring
    of the farms paved a way for resource optimization. Scientists, research institutions,
    academicians, and most nations across the globe are moving towards the practice
    and execution of collaborative projects to explore the horizon of this field for
    serving mankind. The tech industry is racing to provide more optimal solutions.
    Inclusion of IoT, along with cloud computing, big data analytics, and wireless
    sensor networks can provide sufficient scope to predict, process, and analyze
    the situations and improve the activities in the real-time scenario. The concept
    of heterogeneity and interoperability of the devices by providing flexible, scalable,
    and durable methods, models are also opening new domains in this field. Therefore,
    this paper contributes towards the recent IoT technologies in the agriculture
    sector, along with the development of hardware and software systems. The public
    and private sector projects and startup''s started all over the globe to provide
    smart and sustainable solutions in precision agriculture are also discussed. The
    current scenario, applications, research potential, limitations, and future aspects
    are briefly discussed. Based on the concepts of IoT a precision farming framework
    is also proposed in this article. A graphical abstract for Recent developments

    is inferred from the Latin words ‘Ager’ means ‘Land’ and ‘Culture’ means ‘Cultivation’.
    It is the milestone field of human civilization and is one of the benchmark areas.
    This field is the withstander of the economies of various nations. According to
    the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), more than
    60% of the human population depends on agriculture for survival and around 12%
    of the total land area is under agricultural production [1]. Predicted by FAO,
    the global population will reach the mark of 8 billion people by the year 2025
    and 9.6 billion by the end of 2050 (FAO, 2009) [2]. The interpretation of this
    data shows that to tackle this population growth, an estimated increase of 70%
    in food production must be achieved worldwide by 2050 [3]. Agriculture is also
    the second-largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter, because of fossil-based fertilizers,
    biomass, and machinery. In some of the developed and developing nations, the agriculture
    sector is the backbone of the economy. This field has a huge contribution in the
    growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of developing countries, in particular,
    some of them are listed in TABLE 1. TABLE 1 Nations Having Agriculture as a Major
    Part of Their GDP [4] In India, 53% of the population is dependent on the agriculture
    sector for employment and 61.5 % of the Indian population is primarily dependent
    on the agriculture sector for its livelihood [5]. Focusing on the market size,
    India is the second-largest fruit producer in the world. Based on certain data
    and statistics, the farming income in India is expected to double by 2022. Eyeing
    this change, there is an intra-state cluster development of certain states in
    terms of the agriculture sector. The various stats and numbers representing the
    impact of agriculture in the overall economic development of India as compared
    to other fields has been shown in Fig. 1. FIGURE 1. Contributions of various sectors
    in the Indian economy [6]. Show All At present, the demand is more than the supply
    generated and this curve will illustrate more unstable results in the coming years,
    due to increase in demand with population rise. To maintain the demand-supply
    curve, there will be enormous stress on the agricultural sector. Global warming
    and changing climatic conditions are also important factors to be taken into consideration.
    From the past decades, due to the increase in demand and pressure on the overall
    structure of the field, this area is witnessing the slow but progressive shift
    from traditional approaches to the most advanced technology-driven methods. The
    use of traditional approaches and conventional methods, as well as the changes
    in the environment, lay stress on the agricultural sector. Some of the challenges
    for the agricultural sector are given as follows: The use of traditional techniques
    of farming hinders the optimization of both cost and time. Depletion of the topsoil
    due to floods and winds resulting in the deposition of the pollutants, sediments,
    nitrates, and phosphates, result in causing the eutrophication and the runoff
    of the soil. Planting the same crop after each harvest makes the soil redundant
    of the essential nutrients. Water scarcity due to the climatic changes lowers
    the level of groundwater for irrigation, thereby disturbing the water cycle. Global
    climate changes due to the destruction of the tropical forests and the other vegetative
    species in agriculture result in the elevation of the carbon dioxide and other
    greenhouse gas levels. Lack of expertise in proper recognition of the particular
    plant species. There is no proper method to detect the disease at early stages,
    such that precautionary measures could be taken to prevent it. Therefore, because
    of these factors, the need for the creation of modern methods and intensification
    of the agricultural practices to use water, soil, minerals, and other resources
    efficiently becomes obligatory. The nature of the technology and devices is changing
    i.e. it never settles for any less. A lot of research papers addressing the challenges
    of agriculture in the IoT domain have been put forth. Constant developments and
    everlasting expectations from the existing technologies paves a great way for
    motivating academicians and researchers to set and attain new standards. During
    recent years, there has been a paradigm shift in the study and application of
    domains like IoT, cloud computing, machine learning, and big data, etc. Therefore,
    from the trends of these data sets, a constant need is felt to revisit the current
    standings and capacities of the new age IoT concepts. The modern-day requirements
    and the counteractive substitutes in the field of agriculture and changes exactly
    to the expectations based on the concepts of IoT must be addressed. The contribution
    of IoT in the agriculture field and certain gaps in resource utilization motivated
    us to perform a study that addresses current issues and applications of IoT in
    agriculture. Agriculture is expected to get immensely fortified by the advancement
    of technology especially by the domain IoT. Precision agriculture is the new term
    appended to the agriculture filed, with all the procedures being followed, addressed,
    and simulated in a tech-driven manner. Incorporation of the internet has started
    to revolutionize this field by associating devices together, now being identified
    as the Internet of Things. Coined in 1999 by a British visionary “Kevin Ashton”,
    Internet of Things is a consortium of devices connected [7]. The devices are associated
    with internet via Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Radio-frequency Identification
    (RIFD), Near Field Communication (NFC), Long Term Evolution (LTE), and other devices
    and communication technologies. This association helps the devices and the other
    objects transfer the information gathered to destined places all over the network.
    Precision agriculture, therefore, aims to optimize and improve agricultural processes
    to ensure optimum production with reliable, fast, and distributed dimensions thus
    providing growers a detailed overview of the ongoing scenarios in the cultivation
    stretches. This practice is followed to reduce energy consumption. The major areas
    where IoT can leave an everlasting impression are climate monitoring [8], data
    analytics [9], early disease detection [10], crop counting [11], smart irrigation
    [12], etc. With the spread of a network of devices, a communication channel can
    be established between the farmers, fields, and experts. By developing IoT based
    models, the field conditions can be monitored remotely on regular time intervals
    without any human intervention and after analyzing the data favorable and efficient
    decisions can be taken accordingly. This will help to ensure both field and market
    safety and security to the farmer. Also, with early monitoring of crops, disease
    detection can be done and thus preventive measures can be taken to save the crop
    beforehand. For producers it will also help in the analysis of consumer demands.
    Whether the product will be able to meet market expectations, thus creating an
    intelligent decision driven farming. An analysis of different existing articles
    addressing the research and development of precision agriculture is presented
    in TABLE 2. TABLE 2 Alaysis of Various Papers in the Field of Precison Agricuture
    for the Current Study In this article based on research gaps and findings obtained
    from articles analyzed below, a systematic survey is done. Therefore in this study,
    the most prominent problems of the agriculture sector, and solutions provided
    by modern systems are addressed and discussed in detail. The major contributions
    of this study are as follows: A comprehensive survey of the architectural, conceptual,
    and implementation details of IoT models adopted for Precision Agriculture has
    been carried out. Various IoT hardware platforms and other associated devices
    like sensors, accumulators, etc. along with their role in agriculture have been
    discussed in brief. Various IoT OS supported for Precision Agriculture have been
    discussed. The significance and key differences of MIoT in agriculture have been
    discussed along with related studies. Studies limited to a specific domain has
    been merged together for clear mapping of the domain. Sensors and their role in
    agriculture is discussed. Various projects/ start-up’s started all over the globe
    for tacking agricultural problems and providing intelligent and sustainable solutions
    to farmers have also been discussed. Functional concepts like limitations, improvements,
    future works and applications are discussed separately. The rest of the paper
    has been organized as in Section 2 various search and source methods used for
    the selections of relevant articles has been introduced, in Section 3 to get into
    the deep insight of the various concepts, theories, and devices related to the
    implementation of Internet of Things has been discussed, followed by Section 4
    which gives the various related studies concerning different applications of Internet
    of Things in Agriculture, findings like challenges, limitations, improvements,
    future work, etc. with a short description of our proposed work has been given
    in Section 5, and finally, at last, the article ends with a conclusion. Table
    3 gives the detailed nomenclature used throughout this article. TABLE 3 Nomenclature
    SECTION II. Sources and Search Methods The research methodology consists of going
    through articles based on the contribution of IoT and its related technologies
    for the advancement and development of the agriculture filed. For designing the
    overall structure of this article, the data and selected studies are chosen strictly
    based on a time frame. Most of the articles taken for study are sorted from 2015
    to 2020. This time frame is chosen to visualize and understand the current impact
    of IoT in the field. In TABLE 4, a summary of the resources from where the papers
    have been selected is presented. TABLE 4 Summary of the E-Reserves for Obtaining
    the Related Research Articles Given the objective of this article, research has
    been conducted thoroughly by examining the existing literature work related to
    the subject. For developing a firm foundation, the articles containing the origin
    of IoT, alongside current standings, recent trends, and technologies, were considered
    for a study concerning their contributions to the field of agriculture. By reviewing
    the existing literature, a sustainable framework has been developed to overcome
    the existing challenges in the field. The keywords mainly used to identify the
    literature included Precision Agriculture, Agriculture, Plant Monitoring, Internet
    of Things, Smart Agriculture, Smart Farming, Irrigation, Plant Pathology, Wireless
    Sensor Networks, etc. The eight-year trends of the different terminologies and
    their search significance over the years have been extracted from Google and are
    presented in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. FIGURE 2. Worldwide distribution of IoT of the
    past eight years [19]. Show All FIGURE 3. Precision Agriculture distribution worldwide
    of the past eight years [19]. Show All From the figures, it can be seen that the
    frequency of search or usage of these two terms is somewhat stable over the past
    eight years. An average, 80% of people talk and search about these topics for
    study and other related purposes, thus establishing the growing interest worldwide
    in this area. So for a better understanding, in the next section, the various
    terminologies related to the Internet of things concepts and devise have been
    discussed. SECTION III. Introduction to the Internet of Things (IoT) Concepts
    and Theories Inspired from the technology of the internet to connect the whole
    world, the Internet of Things constitutes of things possessing unique identities
    and are connected to the internet. A cosmos of sensors, actuators, appliances,
    and other devices connected with each over the internet, results in making the
    Internet of Things (IoT). The scope of IoT is not just limited to only connecting
    things but to allow them to communicate and exchange data. Based on the Electronic
    Devices and Network Annex-IEA-4E (EDNA), by 2020 the number of connected devices
    will rise to 50 billion, thus resulting in the generation of high revenue. IoT
    works in a layered manner depending upon the problem it is addressing. Therefore,
    it can be define that IoT possesses a layered architecture [20]. All these layers
    combined are called the IoT functional blocks. Apart from the functional blocks,
    various communication models that aid the smooth working of an IoT model are a
    request-response model, publish-subscribe, push-pull, and exclusive pair [20].
    Fig. 4 represents the reference architecture of IoT in agriculture and includes
    the following layers: device/physical layer, network layer, middleware layer,
    service layer, analytics layer, and end-user layer. The layered architecture includes
    all the hardware devices, facilities, equipment, internet, communication technologies,
    protocols, and data analytic algorithms. How the layers work along with each other
    is described below: Perception Layer: Also called physical or the device layer,
    this layer lies at the bottom of the architecture and constitutes of sensors,
    actuators, microcontrollers, gateways, routers, switches, hubs, etc. The main
    role of this layer is, how efficiently the sensing devices and the other equipment’s
    can work together to gather data. The microcontroller device acts as a controller
    as it performs all the networking ifunctionalities. The microcontroller also acts
    as a network regulating body as it regulates the networks, such that the sensors
    and other devices can collect data. The main aim of this layer is to capture data
    and transfer it to the other layer i.e., the higher abstraction layers. In terms
    of agriculture, the devices in the physical layer gather, soil, water, pH value,
    humidity, leaf wetness, and other data parameters. Also, the topology in which
    the devices are placed plays a major role in power consumption and efficient data
    collection in this layer. Network Layer: It comprises of internet and other communication
    technologies. The main aim of this layer is, how to achieve better communication
    in the platform. In terms of agriculture, the design of this layer plays an important
    role in a framework due to the selection of suitable communication technologies
    relevant to field size or the test bed size. LTE, CDMA, GSM, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, LoRa,
    NFC, UWB Bluetooth, and RIFD are some of the communication technologies used for
    agriculture purposes. ZigBee, LoRa, and NFC are the most used communication technologies
    employed depending upon the problem and the area to be addressed in the agro domain.
    NFC and Bluetooth are the most suitable for the greenhouses. Various protocols
    like HTTP, WWW, and SMTP serve for efficient communication in the agricultural
    scenarios. Middleware Layer: This layer in IoT architecture is accountable for
    device management, context awareness, interoperability, portability, and security-related
    responsibilities. In terms of agriculture scenarios, HYDRA, SMEPP act as best
    middleware due to their context-aware functionalities. Service Layer: Dealing
    with agricultural problems, cloud-assisted service layer in IoT layered architecture
    plays a prominent role in providing cloud storage and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).
    To facilitate the function of sensing, actuation, and other activities, this layer
    focuses on some main areas or domains such as monitoring, detection, control,
    decision making, recognition, etc. The service layer offers services like device
    monitoring, control, discovery, and data publishing services. Analytics Layer:
    The layer is responsible for the processing and analysis of data. This layer works
    as a consortium of two steps- 1) Data ingestion, is the step that performs storage,
    cleansing, and streaming of data and the 2) Data analytics, which performs data
    reporting, mining, and learning. In the analytics layer various machine learning
    tools, data analytic algorithms are employed to give early predictive decisions
    for measuring the crop yield, crop growth, disease detection, etc. These decisions
    can enhance farm monitoring capacity. The predictive decisions can help in the
    design of better decision support systems. End-User Layer: Being the topmost layer
    of the model, it serves the consumer or the user. To provide the interface to
    the users to control and monitor their model, this layer allows them to view the
    system status, analyze or process the data. In agro models, the farmer is the
    end-user. This layer provides a user-friendly experience and platform to the farmers.
    The services or applications in this layer are designed based on the behavioral
    study and pattern analysis of the user. Various intelligent approaches and data
    analytic studies are employed to understand the behavior of the users, as they
    come with different needs and offer a lot of diversity. Social media, Cloud computing,
    Mobile messaging are the platforms used to provide services to users, experts,
    and industries. Through this layer, the whole IoT based platform can be monitored,
    controlled, and run. The services generated from this layer are mostly the link
    between the user and the systems/platforms. FIGURE 4. A layered ecosystem/architecture
    of Agro-IoT. Show All A. Multimedia Internet of Things (MIoT) in Agriculture Based
    on the working, nature of deployment, and the subject IoT concepts are used to
    address, traditional IoT is differentiated into various forms such as IoMT, MIoT,
    IIoT, etc. Without the inclusion of these concepts, IoT systems cannot successfully
    realize the concept of ubiquitous computing. In these paradigms, the interaction
    and cooperation between the heterogeneous devices is facilitated. Due to the increase
    in the number, diversity of devices and data with time, these concepts have become
    more functional and prominent to develop models and techniques for coming challenges
    and reflect the possibilities enabled in them. All these concepts have the same
    main character of availability, intelligence, and devices but they only differ
    in their due course of action i.e., their general usage. Being an allied branch
    or extension of IoT, MIoT, include smart objects that are usually resource-constrained,
    in terms of memory, energy, and processing power. Due to the progressive reduction
    in size and cost of production of these devices, MIoT models are expected to be
    developed and deployed on a large scale. Generally, the sensors of these models
    are usually designed to be battery operated or solar power operated. Due to the
    large data sensing and analysis, these devices require high computational power.
    Mostly, the multimedia data includes audio, video, and image data, which possess
    unstructured features and is difficult to transmit and analyze on a computationally
    scarce network and low bandwidth conditions. Multimedia data shows different behavior
    compared to the scalar data due to its computational complexity and network topology
    bottlenecks to the Quality of Service (QoS). A lot of work has been done in IoT
    and its allied fields to realize the concept of heterogeneous, low-level data
    transmission, and communication. In agricultural frameworks, the data is mostly
    in the visual form e.g., pest images, plant disease images, field images, etc.
    The characteristic difference in scalar and multimedia data is shown in Fig. 5.
    FIGURE 5. Key characteristic differences between IoT and MIoT data [25]. Show
    All Depending upon the various parameters there are key differences between IoT
    and MIoT and they are discussed as: The IoT systems work mostly on non-heterogeneous
    devices while the MIoT functions well in case of heterogeneity. IoT data is mostly
    scalar, however, MIoT considers the multimedia data. Traditional IoT networks
    does not take into consideration the concept QoS while transmission and communication
    whereas in case of MIoT, QoS and QoE play a major role as the prime parameters.
    IoT can function well over low bandwidth channels whereas MIoT networks are in
    demand of high bandwidth due to bulky data. Node operation is predefined in IoT
    whereas in MIoT the node operation is adaptive in nature. Various authors have
    worked on the implementation of concepts of MIoT for agriculture. Zhang et al.
    [21], worked on the concept of preserving the concept of data confidentiality
    while realizing the challenge of low-cost data acquisition. A measurement matrix
    under the control of chaos and random subsampling is employed to capture the ruptured
    image signals. Then these sampled sub-images are assembled to form a big master
    image and then encrypted based on android transform and single value diffusion.
    Correlation, histogram, keyspace, robustness, real-time, and entropy analysis
    are performed to understand and realize the concept of low-level transmission.
    Rani et al. [22], worked on the concept of bridging the gap between the scalar
    and multimedia data, and for this, they developed an IoMT cross-layer protocol.
    This protocol considered cross-communication between the physical, data link,
    and routing layers. The main objective of this work was to achieve energy-efficient
    communication with less computational time complexity. An optimal mathematical
    model was developed to study the cross-layer behavior in all the three layers,
    therefore selecting the efficient one. A comparative study was conducted on two
    parameters like delay and distance. Usman et al. [23], proposed a multilayer framework
    based on multilevel edge computing architecture to manage, and preserve the privacy
    of end devices from external attacks. Authors mainly focused on the three major
    challenges i.e., node management, privacy-preserving, and network protection.
    The proposed architecture is divided into three layers with the first layer comprising
    of underlying network partitioned into multiple clusters to manage end-devices
    and Level-One Edge Devices (LOEDs). In the second layer, the LOEDs apply an efficient
    aggregation technique to reduce the volumes of generated data and preserve the
    privacy of end-devices. Local differential privacy-based technique is applied
    to protect the privacy of sensitive information in aggregated data. In the last
    layer, the mobile sinks are registered with a level-two edge device via a handshaking
    mechanism to protect the underlying network from external threats. Floris and
    Atzori [24], addressed the issue of evaluation of Quality of Experience (QoE)
    for IoT applications where mostly multimedia data is involved. For designing a
    layered architecture, authors first tried to analyze the QoE parameters or factors
    with applications in the relevant scenarios. Then a layered multimedia IoT architecture
    was proposed for QoE analysis by combing each of the analytic and contributing
    factors. Zikria et al. [25], presented a brief overview of the MIoT along with
    its challenges, solutions and future opportunities. The authors discussed the
    data differences between the traditional IoT and MIoT, along with the role of
    communication technologies. The demand for realizing the dream of MIoT and its
    bottlenecks were also discussed. The challenge of data collection and its impact
    over the network traffic is also discussed along with the methodologies developed
    to solve it. Nauman et al. [26], presented a comprehensive survey on the multimedia
    internet of things. Authors discussed the existing role of MIoT in concern with
    various fields like medical, agriculture, automation, and industry, etc. The importance
    of QoE and QoS for multimedia transmission over IoT channels is also discussed.
    A better need for routing and Physical-Medium Access Control (PHY-MAC) protocols
    for M-IoT was also discussed. A potential discussion on open research issues related
    to multimedia communication in IoT was presented. Alsamhi et al. [27], presented
    a survey on the role of green IoT in greener and smart cities. The authors focused
    on how the environment pollution can be controlled along with other parameters
    for making living more sustainable and green with the aid of IoT concepts. AlSkaif
    et al. [28], presented a survey on the energy efficiency of MAC protocols in low
    data rate wireless multimedia sensors. The conflicting goals of WMSN were also
    discussed. Role and challenges of multimedia data were also discussed. A focused
    analysis was performed on network parameter constraints and what techniques are
    employed to solve them. A comparison of the energy consumption of MAC protocols
    in four selected application scenarios related to smart cities and environment
    monitoring was also presented. Libo et al. [29], worked on how with the use of
    multimedia data in the form of images can be employed to detect the plant diseases.
    Rape diseases were studied as a case study. Authors also discussed the challenges
    and bottlenecks faced for the transfer of multimedia data over low bandwidth channels.
    With machine intelligence, authors also proposed a diagnostic procedure via which
    the data can be transferred over wireless multimedia sensors networks. Psannis
    et al. [30], proposed a technique for the transfer of advanced media-based smart
    big data via intelligent systems. Authors in their work addressed the problem
    of the rapid rise of devices and heterogeneity. An encoding algorithm with HVEC
    standard for performance evaluation was proposed to transfer the data intelligently.
    B. Hardware Platforms for IoT The hardware platform for IoT comprises a set of
    compatible hardware capable of running certain software. The main components of
    a hardware platform are machine language, sensors, wireless devices, programs,
    and processors, protocols, etc. The processor in a hardware platform determines
    how much fast a framework can work. To design certain new methodologies in IoT,
    various hardware platforms supported are elaborated as: 1) Raspberry Pi It is
    a series of single-board computers developed in the UK by Raspberry foundation.
    There are various families of raspberry i.e., Raspberry Pi 1, Raspberry Pi 2,
    Raspberry Pi 3, Raspberry Pi Zero, Raspberry Pi 4. All these families have different
    models. The Broadcom processor is used in most of the boards. It acts more like
    a computer system and can do multitasking [31]. 2) Arduino Uno Developed by Arduino.cc,
    it is a microcontroller board and is based on the ATMega32 processor. Arduino
    Uno possessing a USB port is a very valuable addition to the family of microcontrollers.
    Various versions of Arduino like Arduino Uno, Arduino Due, Arduino Leonardo, and
    Arduino Mega are present in the market. Out of these the most common versions
    are Arduino Uno and Arduino Mega [32]. 3) Node MCU It is an open-source IoT platform.
    It generally refers to firmware rather than the development kits. It is a low-cost
    open-source kit/module developed for the ESP8266 Wi-Fi chip. It is developed in
    the Arduino IDE environment [33]. 4) Beaglebone Developed by Texas Instruments,
    it is a low-cost open-source single-board computer. Its size measures 75 by 75
    mm and possesses all the functionality of a basic computer. It requires 2W of
    power or a 5V separate power and can work smoothly without any cooling or sinks
    [34], [35]. 5) Banana Pi It is a low-cost credit-card-sized single-board computer
    developed by a Chinese company Shenzhen SINOVOIP Co. Ltd. The hardware design
    is hugely influenced by Raspberry Pi. It is compatible with Raspberry Pi boards
    as well. It can be developed both on Android and Linux [36]. The various hardware
    platforms of IoT with their functional specifications are given in TABLE 5. TABLE
    5 Hardware Platforms of IoT and Their Specifications C. IoT Operating System (IoT
    OS) for Agriculture IoT operating system (IoT OS) is an operating system designed
    to perform within the constraints particular to Internet of Things devices. IoT
    OS are designed and developed in such a way that it can function under the restrictions
    of memory, size, power and processing capability. The main aim of IoT OS is to
    enable successful data transfer over the network via internet. The IoT OS for
    a particular framework is not chosen at random. Certain parameters such as footprint,
    scalability, portability, modularity, connectivity, and reliability are taken
    into consideration. As per the requirement of agriculture, a huge number of devices
    are connected having different features and also the devices have to withstand
    the different environments, the OS then to be chosen must be scalable, cost-efficient,
    and reliable. Various studies have been put forward for the role of IoT OS in
    network management and overall communication. Javed et al. [37], provided a detailed
    reviewed comparison of the operating systems designed for IoT devices based on
    their architecture, scheduling methods, networking technologies, programming models,
    power, and memory management methods, along with other features required for IoT
    OS applications. Musaddiq et al. [38], studied the role of small IoTOS in powering
    the scarce network devices. Authors also put light on the energy consumption of
    these devices. A detailed discussion on IoT devices and resource management is
    provided and some state of art IoT OSs such as Contiki, TinyOS, and FreeRTOS are
    also investigated. Baccelli et al. [39], a comprehensive review of RIOT is provided.
    The key components highlighted in this study are the kernel, hardware abstraction,
    software modularity for various configurations. The authors also discussed the
    operational aspects like system boot-up, timers, power management, and networking
    along with the relevant APIs. Zikria et al. [40], proposed a study for the management,
    challenges, and opportunities of IoT OS in managing IoT systems. The authors discussed
    the issue of interoperability, protocol functionalities to support heterogeneous
    deployment scenarios. Supported hardware and future research trends are also discussed.
    Ain et al. [41], proposed an efficient and flexible decision-making system for
    maintaining user thermal comfort with the help of intelligent sensors. Fuzzy based
    approach along with RIOT OS was developed to tackle the problem of fluctuation
    and adjustment. Results show that the proposed approach can perform 28% better
    than the existing approaches in terms of energy efficiency. Stergiou et al. [42],
    studied the transfer of metadata in the IoT networks. Authors discussed the techniques
    and open tools such as CC analyzers and simulators which can provide intelligent
    metadata transfer over a network. The experimentation was performed on CloudSim
    and Cooja emulator of Contiki OS for the testing of a single network segment.
    From the experimentation, it was found that no duplicate packet transfer occurred
    which is a good sign for multimedia data transmission. The various IoT OS with
    their functional specifications are presented in TABLE 6. TABLE 6 IoT OS Platforms
    in Agriculture and Their Specifications D. Sensors and Their Role in Agriculture
    Sensors are the devices, modules, machines or subsystems capable of detecting
    the changes or events in the environment. They also send signals back to the receiver
    end. Mostly the sensors are used with other electronics. A sensors sensitivity
    usually indicates how much change in sensor output occurs with respect to the
    change in the input quantity measurements. Most sensors possess the linear transfer
    function. The sensitivity of a sensor is defined as the ratio between the output
    signal and the measured property. The resolution of a sensor is the smallest change
    it can detect in the quantity it is measuring. In the area of agriculture, demand
    of technological solutions with high aim in rising production and quality is increasing
    day by day. Also the solutions are required which provide optimal analysis and
    sustainable methods for the field development with reduced cost and time. To sustain
    such challenges, sensor- based technologies have proven to be of much help to
    tackle the above issues and challenges. Precision agriculture is an emerging area
    where sensor based technologies are playing a major role. Since the sensors are
    a major data collection agents, they play a dynamic role in agriculture. Also,
    it is very difficult to collect the data from an agricultural field due to the
    undulating field conditions that keep on changing over time. Sensors are selected
    or designed according the problem to be addressed or needs identified by the farmers.
    Agriculturalists generally use sensors to sense the soil conditions, humidity,
    crop conditions, minerals, pH value, water levels, and sunlight, etc. The nature
    and the characteristics of the component which needs to be sensed also plays a
    major role in the development of a sensing device. With the development of technology,
    machinery and easy-to-use microcontroller platforms, the usage of sensors has
    expanded beyond the traditional fields of measurement i.e., temperature, pressure
    and flow. However, the analog sensors such as potentiometers and force sensing
    resistors are still widely in use. Pajares et al. [54], discussed the sensors
    in agriculture and forestry. In the article, various related works of the sensors
    performed by different authors in the same domain were presented. The role and
    importance of the component or substance which needs to be sensed was discussed
    along with their characteristics and specifications. The major areas focused by
    authors were soil analysis, seed growth, weed detection, forest stands and reflectance,
    machinery for effective treatments, microorganisms, pest control, seedling breeding,
    growing, state of health, positioning, navigation, safety, detection and classification.
    Zhu et al. [55], showed that LIDAR, IMU, and Encoder (x2) can be used for designing
    a prototype vehicle for the agricultural domain. The authors also discussed how
    these sensors can be used for the development and usage of that prototype in case
    of undulating surfaces and rough terrains. A complete review of the wireless sensors
    and the network applications used in agriculture is provided. The authors also
    addressed the importance of sensors in the field of agriculture. Along with the
    sensors, the communication technologies that support sensor communications are
    also mentioned by Rehman et al. [56]. The sensors used in the medical and agricultural
    fields have also been discussed. In the case of the agricultural field, the various
    conditions and circumstances affecting the data collection from sensors are addressed.
    The various types of sensors and their platforms used by different authors in
    their work are also included by Chokkareddy et al. [57]. Plageras et al. [58],
    used efficient IoT based sensor and big data analytics for secure collection of
    data and communication over a channel. In the study, smart housing or building
    was taken as case study, and the secure data collection with the sensors was performed
    and analyzed. The behavior of various sensors for data collection in different
    scenarios in terms of IoT and cloud computing was studied by Stergiou et al. [59].
    The secure communication among devices was also studied along with performance
    bottlenecks and challenges. The various sensors and their use in agriculture is
    discussed below: 1) Level Sensors They measure the substance of liquid in a cast.
    The cast can be any agricultural field, pond, water tank, etc. They measure data
    in two methodologies 1) Point level measurements: indicate only whether the constituent
    or level measured is above or below the sensing point or threshold. 2) Continuous
    measurements: specific range measurements and exact substance amount determination
    are performed by these sensors. In agricultural fields, the water level sensors,
    humidity sensors, and moisture sensors are used to measure the water content levels
    in a field. The point level sensors are used when the water content in the cast
    i.e., soil or testbed is very less i.e. in dry and arid areas, whereas the continuous
    level sensors are feasible for semi-arid locations. Some of the ultrasonic level
    sensors are also used in water treatment plants. Blank et al. [60], designed a
    low-level senor based fusion application for agricultural machinery design. 2)
    Temperature Sensor Temperature sensors measure the temperature of the environment
    or surroundings. They are of different types i.e. thermistors, thermocouples,
    resistance temperature detectors, infrared sensors, semiconductor sensors. In
    agriculture they measure the temperature variants in a field. Mahan et al. [61]
    designed an optimal temperature based field monitoring system by using a low-cost
    infrared sensor. 3) Proximity Sensors Detect the presence of nearby objects without
    any physical intervention. The sensor works by emitting an electromagnetic beam
    in the field and looks for any alterations in the signal. These are mainly employed
    in agricultural cattle grazing, counting of fruits, etc. Kim et al. [62] used
    a capacitive proximity sensor to optimize the harvest yield of fields. 4) Infrared
    Sensors Senses the changes in the environment by emitting infrared rays. They
    work in two approaches i.e., active and passive. An active IR sensor can both
    emit and detect the radiations and constitute a light-emitting diode and a receiver.
    The passive IR sensors can only detect the radiation and possess only a LED. In
    agriculture field infrared sensors can be employed to detect the presence of rodents
    in the orchards, count the number of plants or trees in the field, capturing satellite
    images of the field. Allred et al. [63], used IR sensor-based satellite imagery
    to map the findings and results of UAV to chart agricultural drainage systems.
    5) Touch Sensors Also known as tactile sensors, work on sensing the touch. They
    are low-cost sensors. In the agriculture field they can be used for the detection
    of intrusions in the field. Depending on the target and the range, there are different
    types of sensors, the same are discussed in Fig. 6 and TABLE 7 below: TABLE 7
    Sensors Based on Their Fields of Application FIGURE 6. Sensors and their types.
    Show All SECTION IV. Related Work The advancement and role of the Internet of
    Things in precision agriculture along with the related areas where research is
    being conducted are discussed in this section. Literature including various approaches,
    techniques, and methodologies presented by the number of authors has been divided
    into different sections. Various studies are performed and put forward by various
    academicians and authors concerning the evolution of agriculture relating to the
    incubation of the concepts of the Internet of Things. Kim et al. [64], reviewed
    different articles related to the induction of unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture.
    The authors highlighted the recent trends, controls, perspectives, and platforms
    of UAV for agriculture. The study focused on what are the different platforms
    used for UAV and how those platforms can be designed. The hardware components
    related to the design of UAVs were also discussed. Sensor types compatible with
    platforms such as fixed-wing, helicopter, quadcopter, etc. were also discussed.

    also presented. Various applications of UAVs in crop monitoring, spraying, and
    mapping, etc. were also presented. The authors concluded their study by providing
    the data on the latest technology trends and applications of UAVs in agriculture.
    Ayaz et al. [65], studied the latest trends and technologies in the field of agriculture.
    The potential sensors, IoT devices, communication techniques, used for soil, crop
    irrigation, insect, pest analysis were studied and discussed. Also, how this technology
    is redefining the agriculture system and boosting farmers to work, is portrayed.
    Authors studied the recent developments of IoT and how it is helping in providing
    the solutions while designing an IoT system for agriculture, what strategies and
    policies need to be considered. The advanced agricultural practices such as greenhouses,
    vertical farming, hydroponic farming, and phenotyping are also explained. All
    the crop stages and potential challenges are also discussed. Farooq et al. [66],
    presented many aspects of IoT in agriculture. Authors discussed all the recent
    technologies associated with IoT along with big data analytics for the development
    of precision agriculture systems. Various network topologies, architectures, layers,
    and protocols are also presented. In context to the development of a smart farm,
    all the major components and relevant technologies were discussed. Also, the regulations,
    standardizations, and policies used by several countries to standardize IoT methods
    for agriculture have been discussed. Elijah et al. [67], gave an overview of IoT
    and data analytics technologies and practices in agriculture. The authors divided
    their study into four sections i.e., communication technology, internet, data
    storage, technology. The authors also provided an analysis and data on how the
    aforementioned sections can be employed for dealing with the diminishing agricultural
    resources. The pros and cons of various technologies such as cloud computing,
    WSN, radio frequency identification, middleware systems, etc. to their application
    in the agriculture field are also discussed. Studies on how these technologies
    can be used to develop an IoT ecosystem, with technical and business scenarios
    were also presented. Misra et al. [68], discussed the concepts and role of IoT,
    AI and big data in the field of agriculture. In the review, focus was laid on
    green- house monitoring, disease detection, usage UAV machines and drones agriculture
    and supply chain modernization, social media in food industry, food quality assessment
    and modernization for food traceability. Thakur et al. [69], reviewed articles
    of repute in the context of the employability of WSN in agriculture. The authors
    highlighted the different communication technologies and WSN technologies adopted
    for precision agriculture. The authors also discussed various sensors and their
    role in agriculture. The influence of various techniques for designing the models
    is also discussed at length. Damos [70], presented a review on the pest control
    in precision agriculture. The author discussed the various computer-aided technologies
    employed for forecasting and designing decision support systems. The challenges
    and constraints of designing the decision support system were highlighted. The
    most available and published data present online in terms of pest management was
    also discussed. A differentiation between the documented and existing decision
    support systems was highlighted. The advancement and role of the internet of things
    in precision agriculture along with the related areas where research is being
    conducted are discussed in this section. Literature including various approaches,
    techniques, and methodologies presented by the number of authors has been divided
    into different sections and are discussed as follows: A. IoT in Farm Management
    Farm management refers to the construction and implementation of decisions for
    obtaining the maximum production and profit via organizational operation of decisions.
    This area is most benefitted by automation and the implementation of new technological
    methods. With farm management agricultural practices are made informative by evaluation
    and comparison with the other developed approaches and methods. Diedrichs et al.
    [71], with the aid of machine learning and IoT sensing devices, predicted the
    occurrence of frost events. Authors designed their system based on three layers
    i.e., a group of internet-enabled devices for water data collection. The authors
    augmented the data using the synthetic minority oversampling technique due to
    its capability of reducing the occurrence of errors with the ML approaches. The
    humidity and temperature sensors were employed to collect data from five meteorological
    stations of the Mendoza Province of Argentina. For each station, the existing
    sensor data spanning from a period 2001 to 2016 was taken as a reference to collect
    the daily data. The data was divided into two sets i.e., locally available is
    the config-local and the one available globally is the config-all. Bayesian Networks
    were employed along with SMOTE and recursive portioning, to train the system.
    Jawad et al. [72], designed a wireless power transfer technology based on a drone
    charging system for smart agriculture. The authors used the concepts of magnetic
    resonator coupling and sleep/active modes of charge transfer system for designing
    the model. Authors mainly focused on how to charge wirelessly the drones and other
    equipment employed in agricultural field monitoring. The magnetic resonant coupling
    technique was considered due to its capability of high power transfer and efficiency.
    In the experimentation, authors found that the FSC coil with 150 coil turns in
    the transmitter circuit and the MTC comprising of 60 coil turns in the receiver
    (i.e. drone) accomplish the maximum transfer power and efficiency. For finding
    the accurate efficiency, the model was tested based on different load, and how
    to load misalignment changes the model behavior was also noted. Drone flight time
    was also taken into consideration and was estimated based on the adopted battery
    capacity and payload of the drone. Tseng et al. [73], proposed an intelligent
    IoT based platform for farm management. The authors took the data based on different
    plants i.e., beans, spinach, celery via sensors, and used 3D normalization on
    that data to extract the optimal/useful data. The average and variance were moved
    to obtain user data without making any visible changes in the actual data. Farmer’s
    behavior was analyzed for the application of pesticides and fertilizers. For the
    platform development SIM5320E, IoT Development Board is used along with the BH1750
    illumination sensor and BME280 temperature and moisture sensor. Bacco et al. [74],
    designed a model based on air-ground UAV communications for smart farming. Authors
    empirically and analytically developed a real test-bed implementation of IEEE
    802.15.4 based communication between unmanned aerial vehicle and ground sensors.
    The focus was laid on how to transfer data between sensors and other devices present
    on the ground in an optimized manner to ensure fewer transmission losses. From
    the experimentation, and result analysis authors found the Gilbert-Elliot model
    to be suitable to approximate the packet loss in the link at low transmission
    speeds. The authors used approximately 80,000 datasets from the testbed. Ahmed
    et al. [75], based on the concepts of fog computing and Wi-Fi-based long-distance
    networks proposed a system for smart monitoring. In comparison to the existing
    traditional models, a scalable and flexible model was designed for monitoring
    and controlling agro farms in rural areas. Authors introduced a WiLD network and
    fog computing in the existing WSN-based solutions to cover long ranges with fewer
    delays. A cross-layer based MAC and routing solution for sensing and actuating
    were proposed to reduce the network latency. Throughput, coverage range, and network
    latency of the network structure were analyzed. Liu et al. [76], by hybridizing
    the concepts of IoT, cloud computing, and data mining proposed an integrated framework
    for the agricultural field. China was considered as the territory to design and
    devise mechanisms to enhance modern agriculture as compared to the conventional
    one. Quality, safety, management, and pollution are were taken into consideration
    while designing the model. NoSql database, DynamoDB, relational database Oracle,
    and file object storage Amazon S3, were employed to provide the hybrid data storage
    design. Bai et al. [77], due to the issue of frequently changing environmental
    conditions addressed the issue of estimation and control in the greenhouse. The
    authors studied how to collaboratively deploy WSNs and actuator schemes for agriculture.
    Sensor nodes were used to conduct a local estimation with Kalman filters to enhance
    the stability and transmission of data ensuring energy optimization. Using the
    concepts of collective clustering and mutual effect, the actuator node based scheme
    is designed for the improvement of estimation speed and conversion accuracy. Parameter
    optimization is achieved through fuzzy neural networks along with the PID control
    algorithm. Jinbo et al. [78], performed research on developing a platform for
    the monitoring of a field with agricultural modernization. A system named DEMO
    was proposed by using the SpringMVC framework, MyBatis, Spring Data DynamoDB Stored
    Procedure, Paho, and other related technologies grounded on the J2EE platform.
    Open-source elements such as raspberry, IoT gateway integrated with the ZigBee
    module were used for the development of the platform and were chosen due to their
    stable and cost-efficient properties. The proposed system is capable of massive
    data processing and analysis for agricultural monitoring. RESTful interface service
    system developed on a cloud platform, ExtJs client technology, and WeChat were
    applied to develop the Demo system of an application layer. Mukherjee et al. [79],
    worked on the challenges of a decentralized and heterogeneous UAV swarm deployment.
    The work is focused on how to design and deploy a UAV in resource-constrained,
    harsh, and challenging environments. Swarm edge due to its heterogeneous nature
    and unequal data generation within its member’s results in under-utilization of
    the available computational resources. To solve this issue, the authors proposed
    a Nash bargaining-based weighted intra edge processing offload scheme which can
    reduce the problem of heavy processing in some swarm members. The proposed method
    achieves better scalability and reduced processing delays. Chen et al. [80], developed
    an IoT based inexpensive platform named ‘AgriTalk’ for precision soil farming.
    Turmeric plant was considered for cultivation and experiments were conducted to
    enhance its growth and production. Authors employed AgriTalk in developing several
    other IoT based models for the fields of Mountain Bao in Taiwan. For the study
    authors grew turmeric in three fields. The proposed model is capable of addressing
    dynamic changes in the field conditions for plants grown via in-soil cultivation.
    Automated devices like sensors, actuators with desired farming intelligence were
    employed to design the model. Manual delays for automatic control and switching
    over long distances were also addressed. From experim-entation it was found that
    the curcumin concentration in turmeric leaves after six months was elevated to
    6685.6 μM as compared to 72.1 μM thus witnessing a fivefold increase. Lopez et
    al. [81], proposed a smart system for estimation of soil parameters using an autonomous
    wireless sensor network. Phosphorus content in the soil was measured. For power
    optimization and maintaining a balance between change rate phenomena of soil throughout
    the day for phosphorous estimation, authors developed a dynamic power management
    approach. DPM was tested on both the circuit level and the system level. ANN was
    used to find the significant correlations between the soil parameters such as
    electrical conductivity, phosphorous, temperature, and humidity. Also, energy
    harvesting with the help of IoT and cloud services is proposed. Chen and Yang
    [82], provided a detailed analysis of how efficiently the systems can be developed
    for agriculture based on the techniques of data visualization, clustering, etc.
    The authors studied the significance of various parameters in the same environment
    and effects. For the promotion of efficient development of agriculture, the authors
    proved that data visualization and cluster analysis pave a way for finding the
    key technologies to be applied in modern agriculture. For time and cost optimization,
    functions such as sensing, monitoring, identification, transmission, and feedback
    can be realized using IOT platforms and they can serve as an impetus for intelligent
    agriculture. To test and develop their methodology, authors took the agriculture
    situation in the Jhinsa river basin which lies in the upper reaches of the Yangtze
    River as a testbed. This area has become the most abundant area of biological
    communities in Eurasia. For the study, the authors collected precipitation and
    temperature data. Since data was large, k-means clustering is used to analyze
    the data. Leng et al. [83], presented a study for the application of IoT in agricultural
    products supply chain management. Authors discussed in length what to take into
    consideration, while designing a structural model for the supply chain management.
    RIFD technology was considered as the key constituent for designing the model.
    Pereira et al. [84], based on the concepts of IoT developed an instrument capable
    of performing environment monitoring in a poultry farm. The authors focused on
    designing a cost efficient prototype for the poultry monitoring which provides
    affordable benefits compared to the commercial products available in the market.
    DHT22 sensors were used to collect air pressure and temperature details and CPU
    such as Wemos Mini D1with chipset ESP-8266EXwith standard Wi-Fi 2.4 Ghz connectivity
    were used to calibrate the whole model. Singh et al. [85], developed a cloud based
    autonomic system for delivering agriculture as a service via web and mobile based
    applications. For data collection IoT and other devices were used for communication
    and coordination. Fuzzy logic was used to automatically analyze agriculture. An
    architecture named Agri-info was developed to provide user services. Kolipaka
    [86], proposed a predictive analysis using cross media references for precision
    farming. Authors focused on the usage of sensors and MEMS integrated IoT for precision
    farming. The crop growth parameters such as soil state, water, weed state, crop
    quality and seed quality were also discussed. ML and big data approaches were
    applied to perform predictive analysis and thus finding method to provide optimal
    solutions to farmers. Further based upon the certain characteristics we have tabularized
    the major findings in TABLE 8. TABLE 8 Summary of Developed Methods for Farm Management
    B. IoT in Irrigation Irrigation is the method of application of controlled water
    to the farming fields, at needed intervals. Irrigation has been a constant area
    where a lot of energy, money, and labor is invested in the case of farming. Detection
    and knowledge of water level can reduce the cost of production by half. For increasing
    crop yield, smart irrigation management is essential. Various optimized and precise
    methods have been developed by various academicians. Klein et al. [96], with the
    help of satellite images, worked on the implementation of closed-loop irrigation.
    The authors designed a real-time water requirement system, which can optimize
    water delivery for 140 cells located in four hectares of land. Vegetative indexes
    were calculated for analyzing the total water consumption and how via loops this
    facility can be automated. Through this study and experimentation it was found
    that with the integration of closed-loop strategy and advanced water analysis,
    the overall water consumption efficiency can be improved. Alahi et al. [97], extended
    research to design and develop a smart nitrate monitoring system for the monitoring
    nitrate content in the surface and groundwater. The authors proposed a portable
    sensing system with the help of a planar inter-digital sensor, associated electronics,
    instrumentation, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy-based analysis. Through
    real-time monitoring and sending data directly to the IoT web server, the proposed
    system possesses the capacity to monitor the impact of industrial, urban, and
    agricultural activity on water content and quality. The system also ensures distributed
    monitoring. Daskalakis et al. [98], used leaf sensing technology instead of ground
    soil monitoring for knowing the plant water stress. The authors proposed a low
    cost and low power consumption leaf moisture sensing model by sensing the leaves
    with the new plant backscatter sensor node/tag. The developed tag collects the
    information from a leaf via analog and digital conversions and then the data is
    transferred via remote communication to a low-cost software-defined radio reader
    using monostatic backscatter architecture. The data collected from this node is
    then connected to the irrigation system. The proposed system is powered by a flexible
    solar panel. Jayalakshmi and Gomathi [99], proposed a sensor-cloud based precision
    agriculture for intelligent water management, to enhance crop production. For
    the model design, moisture and stress levels of different plant organs were considered
    along with the behavior vegetative and reproductive organs cell growth, and its
    effects on the water requirement were studied. The dimensionality reduction technique
    was employed to choose the optimal parameters. For the case study, the wheat plant
    was taken. The effect of soil temperature and water suction rate was studied in
    the case of the plant growth. The non-adsorbing testbed was prepared by exploding
    the sand grains at high temperatures. With the aid of WSN, it was monitored when
    the plant needs to be irrigated. Angelopoulos et al. [100], developed a small
    scale smart irrigation prototype for a strawberry greenhouse. The prototype possesses
    off the shelf hardware and software requirements and was tested on large farms
    having multiple crops to get a data gain. The reference architecture also targets
    edge data distribution. The model was tested in Greece and its performance was
    compared against the traditional existing strawberry greenhouse methods for irrigation.
    Compared to the cloud-based approaches, and their incompetence to handle network
    traffic, security challenges, and data sharing with the third party, this model
    is secure and reliable and can handle large datasets. Dominguez-Nino et al. [101],
    worked on how to integrate sensors for developing automated software tools to
    undertake the routine tasks and decision-making involved in scheduling irrigation.
    The authors also focused on the suitability of capacitance approach soil moisture
    sensors and how to automatically interpret them and providing feedback to the
    scheduling algorithm. The proposed approach was tested in the apple orchards located
    at the IRTA-Lleida Experimental Station in Mollerussa, Lleida, Spain. For the
    study, both the physiological and agronomic properties were taken into consideration
    while experimentation. Krishnan et al. [102], designed an automated irrigation
    method. The authors developed a fuzzy logic-based system for precision irrigation
    by using Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) service to enable farmers
    to water the fields. Soil and temperature, humidity, and motor status parameters
    were monitored and taken for the study. For the efficiency evaluation of the system,
    a comparison was done between the proposed system, drip irrigation, and manual
    flooding. Harun et al. [103], designed an environment-friendly system named “Greenhouse
    Irrigation Management System” for precision irrigation in agriculture. Some critical
    environmental parameters such as soil moisture, pH, temperature, humidity are
    measured with the use of WSNs to make decisions. The sensors measure the data
    and based on certain threshold value result, the fields are irrigated. Olivo [104],
    focused on the problems associated with device growth and its effects on the control
    decisions. To address this issue, an architecture named “Rules Engine and Context
    Event Processor (RECEP)” is proposed for the dynamic processing of events originated
    in the context of IoT and PA. In this model the concept if optimization was used
    to optimize the resources to increase agricultural production. The experimental
    setup was set in a banana field located in Machala-Ecuador. The given model was
    designed for operating in low-cost infrastructures for both small and large producers.
    Marcelino et al. [105], based on the work and issues of small family farmers,
    proposed a low-cost system for control, monitoring, and automation of agricultural
    greenhouse. The proposed model was designed by prototyping Raspberry Pi and Arduino
    along with sensors. Temperature, humidity, and light sensors are used for the
    field data collection. The web human interface was developed for interaction between
    the system and the farmers. Koksal and Tekinerdogan [106], developed an automatic
    farm management information system capable of performing data acquisition, processing,
    monitoring, planning, and decision making and managing the farm fields. The authors
    tested their models on two case studies on smart farming in Turkey, one for smart
    wheat in Konya and other greenhouses in Antalya. The feature-driven domain analysis
    model is designed based on IoT reference architectures and data modeling approaches.
    The system was capable of performing all farming related functions, such as irrigation,
    crop monitoring, etc. Hate et al. [107], designed a vegetable traceability system
    with smart irrigation. The field parameters like soil moisture, humidity, water
    supply control, and temperature of particular farmland are monitored with sensors
    such as water level, humidity, soil moisture, and temperature sensors. With IoT,
    the cost is reduced and efficiency is improved. Agale and Gaikwad [108], focused
    on the problem of water reduction in farmlands. An IoT based automatic system
    is designed to collect, analyze, and monitor the real-time sensor data every 10
    seconds from soil and environment and provide irrigation solutions based on that.
    The parameters like temperature, humidity, soil moisture were considered for data
    collection. The proposed method achieved 92.24 % accuracy in water-saving strategy.
    Huan et al. [109], designed a system for monitoring of water in aquaculture ponds.
    To design the system authors used the concept of narrowband IoT (NB-IoT). The
    system used STM32L151C8 microcontroller, sensors and other devices for real time
    data collection and other services. The system was implemented and tested in ChangZhou,
    JiangSu Province, China and performed with low error rate. Vij et al. [110], developed
    a smart precision irrigation system based on the concepts of IoT and machine learning.
    The main aim of authors was to develop a computationally efficient and low cost
    system. Raspberry Pi and Arduino Mega 3 were used as microcontroller and other
    sensors were used to fabricate the system. Compared to the existing systems, the
    proposed system is computationally efficient. The various findings of this section
    have been tabularized in TABLE 9. TABLE 9 Summary of IoT Based Developed Methods
    for Irrigation C. IoT in Crop Monitoring Crop monitoring is the process or method
    of observing the farm fields and crops for enhancing productivity and reducing
    cost. This can be performed with satellites, drones, sensors, and other methods.
    Vegetative indexes of an area can also play a major role in crop monitoring by
    providing the data related to the exact area of land under cultivation etc. With
    crop monitoring the estimated time of harvest can be predicted. de Souza et al.
    [118], proposed an integrated framework with the combination of hardware, software,
    middleware, and other equipment to monitor the testbed. The authors also recorded
    the testing of each equipment in the seed test labs. An IoT based system was developed
    where soil sensors provided the relevant information/data for the growth of seeds.
    Testing was performed in the Official Seed Analysis Laboratory (OSTL) of the Brazilian
    Agricultural Research Corporation. Rekha et al. [119], developed a WSN based framework
    for sensing agricultural characteristics and then provide decisions to the farmers.
    Based on the data collected, the model will provide decisions for irrigation and
    crop monitoring. For the case study, India was taken into consideration due to
    its large farming area and population dependence on agriculture. Groundnut farming
    was studied in this work. Becker Reshef et al. [120], proposed a remote sensing
    analysis based crop monitoring system for strengthening agricultural decisions
    and improving crop security. The authors named this model as “GEOGLAM” model which
    ensures the decision support of all the necessary steps for crop security and
    analysis. Kamath et al. [121], proposed a wireless sensor-based model for monitoring
    the growth of weeds in paddy crop. The authors performed a study on how Raspberry
    Pi and WSN can be modeled for precision agriculture. Raspberry Pi based model
    was deployed to monitor crop along with the integration of Bluetooth 4.0 to send
    signals from visual sensors to the base station. A solar cell battery was used
    to provide power to the system. At the remote station, the images of the crops
    were processed to extract the background and foreground objects. Classification
    between weeds and paddy crop was performed with SVM. Rao and Sridhar [122], Developed
    an automatic irrigation system by prototyping Raspberry Pi and other IoT devices
    to enhance crop productivity. A cloud-based data collection system supported by
    sensors used for data collection is employed to collect the field data. The data
    collected is sent to the base station and based on that data, the decisions are
    made. Parameters like humidity, soil temperature, and sunlight availability are
    measured. Geng et al. [123], for greenhouse environment monitoring proposed a
    four-layer IoT based mobile system. To design the system, the authors proposed
    integration of both Raspberry Pi and Arduino chip in the design where the former
    serves as the data server and later as the master chip for a mobile system. Fabrication
    of all the sensors, actuators, and other devices was done on a single board, thereby
    reducing the device’s physical distances for better performance due to serial
    communication. A dedicated communication protocol with CYC was designed to reduce
    transmission errors and data loss. Shadrin et al. [124], designed an intelligent
    agriculture IoT equipment to monitor the crop. The authors designed the system
    using the test case of monitoring the seed germination. The proposed model was
    fabricated with the integration of low power embedding wireless sensor nodes with
    artificial intelligence. CNN was used to train the model along with the collection
    of data via sensor nodes of the different stages of germinated seeds. A 3D clustering
    analysis was used to analyze the relationship between environmental factors and
    farmer issues. Uddin et al. [125], focused on developing a system for monitoring
    crops from the stage of seed germination to harvest. For this authors proposed
    a resource optimized fast health crop monitoring system. Saudi Arabian agriculture
    was taken into consideration as a case study. IoT and drones were harnessed to
    make an efficient agricultural monitoring system. Data collection methods were
    used to collect data from heterogeneous devices arranged in localized clusters.
    The system was designed to withstand a harsh environment with agility and feasibility.
    Feng et al. [126], proposed a crop growth and nutrition diagnostic system based
    on hyperspectral remote sensing. Color canopies obtained from images captured
    with satellites, UAV, and remote sensing were used to determine the index of yield.
    To determine the color canopy of plants, the color correlation was employed. Cen
    et al. [127], discussed the usage of UAV with dual image frame cameras to estimate
    the aboveground biomass and panicle biomass of rice. The authors conducted their
    study at different growth stages of the crop. The field investigations were made
    on the variations in typical vegetation indices. The accuracy of the model was
    obtained with the extraction of RGB images at two different stages. Random forest
    was employed to obtain AGB as well as the PB. Khan and Kumar [128], proposed a
    framework for the monitoring the crop field. To make their study reliable, the
    authors monitored weather in real-time to get an idea of how to provide an ambient
    condition to farm. Production increase techniques are also proposed for precision
    farming. To overcome the problems of delay in information transfer from the field
    to the farmer, the context-based agricultural mobile sink is designed in WSN.
    Thus the mobile sink node introduction improves the overall efficiency and energy
    consumption of the model. Frontward communication area (FCA) based route selection
    is proposed to reduce energy consumption and delay. Min and Kuang [129], designed
    a system for monitoring the rice crop field. The analysis of the growth of rice
    and rice duck in real-time is done by obtaining the data via the Internet of Things.
    Authors comprehensively viewed the rice and rice duck plant species and the ambient
    farm conditions required for their growth. Qiulan et al. [130], estimated the
    production of carbon from the crop growth. The authors provided a framework for
    the estimation of organic carbon compounds in the farmland soil. The wheat plant
    was taken as a test case in this study. The model provided the real monitoring
    of the farm for carbon production with the aid of IoT and other devices. The real-time
    data was collected from the Yanzhou District of Jining City, Shandong Province,
    China. Harun et al. [131], proposed an improved crop monitoring system based on
    IoT concepts. Brassica Chinensis is the plant taken for study and was subjected
    to four different light treatments such as pulse treatment, continuous treatment,
    high intensity, and artificial control for enhancing the plant growth. The authors
    also analyzed parameters such as leaf count, height, dry weight, and chlorophyll
    a and b. An intelligent embedded system was developed to monitor and capture real-time
    data. Alonso et al. [132], designed an intelligent edge IoT based platform for
    precision livestock and crop monitoring in a dairy farming scenario. In their
    study, authors used the concepts of AI, blockchain technology, edge computing
    and IoT concepts for designing the platform. The architecture named Global Edge
    Computing Architecture (GCEA) was tried and tested in real time in a dairy farm.
    Castellanos et al. [133], proposed a narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) system for collection
    of soil parameters to monitor the potato crop health and growth. A UAV aided network
    is used to support the purpose. The architecture proposed accessed the real filed
    scenario of a potato filed near Bogota, Columbia. The main achievement of this
    work was the energy harnessing due to optimal topology applied for the deployment
    of sensors across the field and thus making the battery last for 82 hours for
    above ground sensors and 77 months for the deep buried sensors. Shafi et al. [134],
    presented a multimodal for crop health monitoring based on the concepts remote
    sensing, IoT and ML. Authors conducted their research in Pakistan. Sensors were
    deployed in fields to collect the real time data. Multispectral data from drones
    presented a NDVI and was used to analyze the crop based on its chlorophyll content.
    Variable length time series data captured from IoT devices and sensors were used
    to generate crop health maps. Deep neural networks were implemented for classification
    and provided the optimal classification. Some studies of the articles incorporating
    IoT in fields related to crop monitoring are presented in TABLE 10. TABLE 10 Summary
    of Developed Methods Crop Monitoring D. IoT in Disease Detection Diseases play
    a vital role in the economic and food crisis of a country. So to avoid this, disease
    detection is employed. This involves the detection of various diseases whether
    fungal, viral, bacterial, etc. from the stages of early to the post-harvest. Incubation
    of IoT has revolutionized the disease detection area in plant phenotyping resulting
    in major control resources available to avoid disease occurrence. Wang et al.
    [146], focused on addressing the problem of pests and insects. Authors proposed
    an IoT based model that can detect the early occurrence of the pests and diseases
    from visual references. Rough set theory algorithm and NN were used to model design.
    The proposed model was compared with existing models for accuracy and efficiency.
    Pandiyan et al. [147], applied the concepts of image segmentation and IoT, to
    develop a system/platform that can detect the diseases in plants. Authors proposed
    a novel platform having an Advanced Segmented Dimension Extraction (ASDE) with
    Heterogeneous Internet of Things procedural (HIoT) aspects, to detect the apple
    leaf diseases. A sign based plant disease identification model for real-time resembling
    of leaf diseases namely bacteria, fungi, micro-organisms, and viruses is presented.
    Three levels i.e. connectivity level, platform level, and service level were employed
    for performing data aggregation, transmission, and automatic identity identification.
    Leaf gestures were studied to identify the diseases in leaves. Zhao et al. [148],
    developed an automatic crop disease detection system capable of identifying and
    recognizing the leaves from a cluttered background. Combining IoT concepts and
    CNN, authors designed a novel approach named “Multi-Context Fusion Network (MCFN)”
    along with IoT deployments for crop diseased detection in wild. Kale and Sonavane
    [149], developed a smart and optimized smart fertilizing decision support system
    for smart farming. The authors addressed the problem of disproportion due to lack
    of judgment. Concepts of IoT and GA were used to design the system. An improved
    GA based multilevel parameter optimized feature selection algorithm for ELM classifier
    along with IoT was proposed in the designed system. The proposed system focuses
    on plant disease detection in a real-time environment. Khattab et al. [150], developed
    an IoT based cognitive automatic monitoring system for detecting the epidemic
    diseases in plants. By combining the concepts of artificial intelligence and prediction
    algorithms to develop the expert system, capable of predicting, analyzing, and
    decision making. A layered approach was used to design the model. Soil, leaf wetness,
    wind speed, and wind direction sensors were employed to gather the data. The model
    was tested on detection of the diseases like Late Blight, Early Blight, and Powdery
    Mildew in tomato and potato crops. Chen et al. [151], based on AI technologies
    and IoT, developed a system named “RiceTalk” for the detection of Blight diseases
    in the rice plant. AgriTalk model was used as a base model in this work to develop
    this system. Compared to AgriTalk, the authors used non-image IoT devices to design
    this model for disease detection. Devi et al. [152], proposed a simple and efficient
    IoT enabled solution for developing a system for automatic disease detection.
    Bunchy top of banana and Sigatoka diseases in the wild banana plant were detected
    and classified. Environmental parameters like soil moisture, temperature were
    measured with sensors and the IoT model was framed using the Raspberry PI hardware
    model. Data were classified using GLCM and RFC for disease detection. Kitpo and
    Inoue [153], developed an early disease detection system for rice crops disease
    detection. The drones based IoT architecture with real-time data collection capabilities
    was designed. For the mapping of drones on the fields, GPS sensors were used.
    The designed system is capable of displaying the analytical results and the position
    of the plant where the disease is present. Pawara et al. [154], studied the pomegranate
    diseases such as Bacterial Blight, Fruit Spot, Fruit Rot, and Leaf Spot. Developed
    a HMM and senor based model to early detect the disease and provide the solutions.
    Parameters like air temperature, leaf wetness, air humidity, and soil wetness

    recognition. The fungal diseases of rural crop fields with detected. Environmental
    data conditions such as humidity, temperature, wind speed, and rainfall were employed
    for designing decision support. A Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMr) model
    was used to classify the data. Jumat et al. [156], developed a cost-efficient
    and affordable smart farming prototype capable of detecting plant disease and
    proving decisions. For study and experimentation, Septoria plant disease was taken
    and studied for different stages right from outbreak to spread maturity. The system
    also possesses the web-enabled facilities for farmer support. Some studies of
    the articles incorporating IoT in fields related to disease detection are presented
    in TABLE 11. TABLE 11 Summary of IoT Based Developed Methods for Disease Detection
    SECTION V. Findings Several research articles related to the role and responses
    of the Internet of Things in agriculture have been studied. From the literature
    and studies, it can be seen that immense contribution has made by IoT in the field
    of agriculture starting from micro areas and moving over to macro environments.
    Internet of Things along with the concepts of cloud computing, cluster computing,
    wireless sensor networks and computer vision has revolutionized the field of monitoring,
    crop production, disease detection, and supply chain management. Since the domain
    of agriculture itself is a wide domain so considering the impact IoT has or can
    make on this field, the search was not restricted or limited to any area. The
    data acquisition for agriculture systems is a multidimensional approach. There
    are several fields in agriculture where IoT is applied e.g., crop monitoring,
    diseased detection, precision irrigation, supply chain, cattle grazing, and raising,
    etc. To design a precision approach, the target plays a very important role in
    data collection. From the existing studies it is found that mostly overall 90%
    of the data is self-acquired by the authors with the use of wireless sensors.
    This data included soil data, pH values, light, water, humidity, and images. In
    the case of crop disease detection, leaves were taken as the primary subject of
    study due to their ease of availability and quantity. Nearly 80% of the leaf data
    was self-acquired using digital cameras and web-enabled devices. However in some
    studies to validate their models, authors also used the existing standard ground
    truth databases available. Satellite imaging and remote sensing images were also
    taken to understand the demography and vegetative indexes of a region. UAV drones
    were the most used devices along with web-enabled digital cameras and mobile devices
    to capture the data in the form of images and also acted for providing real-time
    monitoring of device location in the fields. Certain issues and challenges are
    faced by the authors while capturing real-time images due to environmental and
    lighting conditions. To avoid these issues, laboratory-based testbeds such as
    greenhouses were developed and their data was acquired in a closed environment.
    From the literature, it is seen that, to develop the prototypes certain common
    parameters were taken for conducting the study irrespective of the problem to
    be addressed. Theses parameters included soil data, pH value, humidity level,
    moisture content, water content. After the analysis of the studies it was found
    that for any agricultural system to flourish all these parameters play a combined
    role. These parameters were most common for the problems addressing farm management,
    crop monitoring, and irrigation. However in certain other parameters like leaf
    wetness, salinity, disease severity, fertilizer ratio, plant height, CO2 content,
    mineral content, and conductivity were considered while addressing the specific
    problems like plant disease detection, smart irrigation, seedling germination,
    etc. These were the devices employed to collect the data. Depending upon the problem
    the authors addressed, different type of sensors were employed. For soil data
    collection, the contact method sensors such as hygrometers, or electrodes which
    penetrate the soil were used to collect soil information. While as in the case
    of the collection of soil information via tractors or vehicles non-contact soil
    sensors were employed. But for the studies it can be seen that contact method
    sensors are the most common devices used for soil data collection. In case of
    soil pH value and salinity electrochemical sensors are employed. In the case of
    soil nitrates, CO2, and fertilizer content, topsoil depth, biomass content, organic
    matter are measured. For water data collection, parameters like relative humidity,
    leakage of pipes, dissolved oxygen, nitrates, and other oxides were measured by
    the authors. To accomplish this various water sensors like ultrasonic sensors
    were employed to measure the water levels in the tanks, ponds, and farms. Temperature
    and humidity sensors were used to measure the temperature of water and humidity
    of soil for water content. In the case of plant leaves, the leaf wetness sensors
    were employed to understand the moisture content of the plants. Other than these
    sensors, neutron sensors, time travels sensors, and capacitance sensors are also
    employed by some authors for measuring the water levels. In the case of supply
    chain and cattle grazing, tags and biosensors were employed to gather the data.
    To develop the prototypes, the authors used the devices based on functional capabilities.
    From all the devices, Arduino and Raspberry Pi were the most desirable hardware
    platforms for the authors. Arduino was employed to tackle simple or sequential
    issues that do not require complex solutions. In the case of scenarios with complex
    environments, Raspberry Pi boards were employed due to their capability of addressing
    multiple problems at the same time. For functionalities that faced time issues,
    Raspberry Pi boards were employed. In the case of communication technologies,
    LoRa and ZigBee are the most commonly used communication technologies by the authors
    in the platform designs due to their capabilities of handling a multitude of solutions.
    Lora and ZigBee use GPS to enable and detect geo-locations. They are low cost
    and secure for data transmission. Other than these technologies, authors also
    made use of cloud and cluster computing to handle a large mass of data and provide
    on-spot solutions to the consumers. The authors performed the processing of data
    in different stages. At first preprocessing on data was performed to remove any
    kind of outliers or anomalies in the data. To remove the imperfect data, algorithms
    such as noise removal with Gaussian noise, salt and pepper noise, histogram equalization
    were commonly used for the preprocessing of image data. However in the case of
    numerical data missing value imputation, the banana dataset for noise reduction
    was employed. To obtain the optimal data from a given set of data, data reduction
    was performed. The data reduction approaches e.g., dimensionality reduction, attribute
    subset selection, numerosity reduction, etc. were employed by various authors.
    To make systems capable of taking decisions, several learning algorithms like
    GA, CNN, NN, SVM, PNN, GANs were used to train and test the models. From the literature,
    it is seen that most studies and experiments were performed in countries that
    have agricultural economies like the USA, China, India, Brazil, Australia, etc.
    Most of these countries are economically stable and first world countries. They
    have better infrastructure and service availability. Also only 20% of the studies
    were focused on real-time implementation of their prototypes which indicates that
    most of the experimentation was conducted in a closed environment. This pattern
    raises concerns on how these studies can be employed in real-time environments
    with low infrastructure and maintenance costs. The problem of power consumption
    was also addressed by some studies. However there were no comparisons and reasons
    given on how the dream of IoT can be made real for poor and self-financing farmers.
    Along with this, a few studies provided the cost estimation for the deployment
    of the models. In the Fig. 7, the percentage distribution and contribution of
    IoT in different fields of agriculture are shown. From the figure it can be seen
    that more extensive studies are conducted in the field of crop monitoring. FIGURE
    7. Percentage contribution of IoT in different fields of agriculture. Show All
    These studies and analysis put forth by different articles show that current/existing
    solutions have incorporated IoT to solve several challenges in the agricultural
    domain. With the incorporation of these technologies, a large number of challenges/factors
    for improvement have emerged. Along with the study of factors for improvement,
    future research directions, applications are also highlighted. The sections below
    explain the factors for improvement and the futuristic research directions. A.
    Challenges Despite the growth achieved by IoT over the past few decades, there
    still exist some conceptual, fundamental, and developmental issues. 1) Cost Designing
    a cost-optimized model is still a difficulty faced by many authors. Scientists
    are focusing on developing cost-efficient systems by reducing the hardware and
    software requirements in IoT deployments. Economic differences of countries make
    it difficult for farmers to deploy devices and technology. So, it is important
    to develop some economic models. 2) Standardization To fully utilize the technology
    for large range of applications, standardization of devices is essential. The
    present or current mechanisms do not confirm any standardization formats either
    for the data and process representation. Deprived of the cordial use of the semantic
    ontologies, machine-readable codes result in output differences due to misinterpretation
    and alterations from time to time. With standardization the interoperability issues
    of the devices, applications, systems and products can be solved. 3) Heterogeneity
    While designing a system, heterogeneous devices are used. Every device differs
    in processes and services requirements. In the case of agriculture, most models
    perform with heterogeneous devices, so it is important to create interaction between
    heterogeneous modules and communication technologies. Because of heterogeneity,
    the complexity of the network increases, and sometimes falsified results may appear.
    4) Accessibility For developing any farming decision support system based on IoT
    technology and other devices, the demand for availability of existing software
    and hardware to be present anywhere any time is a must thing. These problems need
    to be addressed to ensure the availability of services anywhere and anytime. Lack
    of availability of the required equipment can result in chaos and delay in the
    services. 5) Adaptability While designing a model, especially for precision farming,
    it is pertinent for the devices to be adaptable with the other devices and the
    surroundings. Since the environmental conditions keep varying and also sometimes
    due to certain communication or hardware issues certain devices are not adaptable
    with each other. 6) Energy Optimization Energy is the most emerging issue in IoT
    systems, WSNs, and other devices for their communication. Till now conventional
    sources of energy have been supporting the designing and working models. But due
    to an increase in devices, the consumption of conventional energy is not a reliable
    solution. Non-conventional sources of energy like solar, wind, water energy harvesting
    schemes should also be tested, but they haven’t been of much success and new methodologies
    should be developed to employ them for model development. 7) Compatibility To
    achieve the standards of fragmentation and scalability, the developed models or
    software should be flexible and should run on any machine. 8) Reliability For
    successful and smooth working, reliability is a major concern for IoT devices
    in terms of data transmission. The devices need to gather and transfer reliable
    data as based on the data received and interpreted, the decisions are made. Reliability
    is still a challenge due to system failures, node failures, battery issues, or
    other interventions. 9) Mobility Generally the systems or models developed are
    static. For smooth implementation of the framework, there should be mobility as
    most of the devices and applications are mobile. In mobile models, the issue of
    maintaining connectivity is still a difficult task. 10) Environmental Conditions
    In agriculture there are different landforms. So it becomes difficult to adapt
    to those changes, and this also jeopardizes data and services. This alters the
    accuracy of a system. 11) Real-Time Deployment Most of the studies put forward
    are not employed or tested in a real-time testbed. So before deploying a system
    or model, real-time analysis is a must, to avoid post-deployment losses. B. Improvements
    Since the growth of IoT is remarkable in the field of agriculture, certain improvements
    can be included in the growth and developmental state to make the systems and
    models more efficient, reliable, and business-oriented. 1) Warding Off the Performance
    Degradation Generally while developing systems, customer interaction or input
    is not taken. As the models serve a variety of customers from dynamic backgrounds,
    therefore their input must be taken while developing the models. This way the
    performance hazards and chaos that occurs on the filed can be avoided. 2) Sharing
    Rich Data Globally In almost all, the IoT based models designed for precision
    farming, the data sharing while integrating and mapping the system design should
    be encouraged. This can lead to the development of an interactive model globally.
    This feature can also help in understanding the topographic and demographic challenges
    of various regions on a global level. Thus the suitable solutions can be designed
    with those working in resource-constrained environments. 3) Moving Towards High-Speed
    Communication The communication domain itself is witnessing a progressive and
    dynamic shift. Since the IoT models are remotely located, so better communication
    is a prerequisite. Therefore it is important to consider high-speed communication
    strategies like 5G, for making the devices more reachable with lesser delays.
    4) Cost Analytic Studies for Model Design With the incumbent of IoT in agriculture,
    a variety of models are designed for addressing different domains such as irrigation,
    farm management, disease detection, and crop monitoring, etc. While designing
    the models various case studies are performed. As the development cost of models
    for these cases varies from country to country i.e., in first world countries
    there will be the different cost of devices and in second and third world countries
    it will be different. Therefore a model cost analysis will provide an idea of
    the purchasing power and investment a farmer from these varied economic regions
    can invest to develop a model. Also this can result in seeking or considering
    other cheaper and efficient ways to develop models. C. Future Research Directions
    With the advancement in the development of precision agriculture platforms with
    IoT and other technologies, the development of new applications or research areas
    is envisioned. After the study of the literature, certain potential concepts and
    futuristic research directions are listed and discussed below: Design of platforms
    in a user-friendly manner (from farmers’ perspective and ease of using) using
    Artificial Intelligence and other learning tools. Farmer’s perspective here means
    that an audit should be done well before designing the prototype. From this study
    a clear insight and differences between the requirements of the farmers and farming
    systems across the globe can be understood. To develop concepts and methodologies
    based on multidimensional aspects like science, expertise, experience, industry,
    etc. Energy harvesting or power optimization methodologies should be developed
    to reduce the cost of production, maintenance, and fault tolerance. It is evident
    that mostly the farms be it small or large, require power and energy for the working
    of devices. In most of the cases, the power to the devices is supplied from the
    main line or the power grid. But this is not a sustainable and efficient method.
    Thus in order to make farms self-reliant, the energy harvesting or power optimization
    approaches should be developed or incorporated while designing of the models.
    Induction of cloud sources for data gathering and processing in a reliable, systematic,
    and scientific manner. Develop systems that can withstand variable soil and environmental
    conditions. Since the agricultural environments are harsh and keep on changing
    with change in climatic conditions or seasons. So it is essential to develop systems
    which can be robust and sustainable to the changes in the external as well as
    internal factors. Development of user or farmer friendly apps for monitoring crop
    and plant health. Mostly farmers come different ethnic and linguistic backgrounds.
    So due to this their level of understanding and ways to perform agricultural tasks
    is also different. It is important to develop frameworks considering the native
    language of a region into consideration so the farmer and machine interaction
    can be improved. This will enhance enable the acceptance of precision farming
    methods easy as it can be seen some areas are reluctant to adopt due to this linguistic
    and understanding problems. Development of efficient sensor-based systems for
    high elevation areas. High elevation areas mostly have undulating surfaces and
    also in most of the countries, supply of power to these areas is still a dream.
    Form the literature, it can be seen that these areas have not been targeted for
    precision farming instead of being resource deficient. Therefore deployment and
    design of sensor based systems in these areas opens a scope in future of precision
    farming. Usage of previous and existential scientific data for the development
    of decision support systems in farming. Generally for designing the precision
    farming models, the primary data is considered. However for designing cost efficient
    and reliable models, the previous case studies and deployment models should be
    considered for the study. This means a collaborative model development methodology
    should be developed for understanding the nature of the work. To recognize various
    plant species using mixed data sets or heterogeneous data. Design of a portable
    and sustainable farming equipment control systems for large as well as small farms.
    Mostly from the study it can be seen that first world countries are welcoming
    in PA approaches while as in most third world and other nations, this concept
    is still in avoidance due to cost and shelf life of products and equipment’s.
    Development of reliable supply chain management methods for precision farming.
    D. Applications of IoT in Agriculture IoT has revolutionized the world of agriculture,
    and a manifold of application can be derivative of implementation of the Internet
    of Things in agriculture. These applications are a resultant of the architectural
    design chosen. These applications have been categorized and differentiated based
    on the subject they focus on and also the service they provide. The major sectional
    areas where IoT is applicable in agriculture are- observation, data collection
    and corroboration, governing, and management. Most of these fields work collaboratively,
    and all the applications involve at least two of these sections. All these sections
    are described below and TABLE 12 presents various IoT applications in agriculture.
    TABLE 12 Applications of IoT in Agriculture 1) Observation It is also called monitoring
    as the main aim of this section is to discern the working of various models, devices,
    applications, etc. With the incubation of the concept of IoT, it is the first
    and foremost stage to be smeared. In this phase, all the devices and equipment
    that are placed strategically are monitored for their work. Sensors, are the major
    deployment and data collection tools engaged in this phase for data collection
    of various field and non-field parameters. Monitoring the certain parameters,
    like soil salinity, pH value, volumetric water content by using various soil sensors
    and other essential parameters such leaf wetness sensors, color, humidity, etc.
    helps in the development of systems capable of performing following operations
    e.g., calculation of leaf area index, leaf health, leaf color, plant growth and
    aid in the development of automatic plant recognition systems. Other devices like
    water sensors aid in the monitoring of irrigation levels and requirements of the
    fields. Thus with such devices, smart irrigation scheduling systems are developed.
    Also with the gas sensors, remote monitoring devices such as UAV devices or images
    with hyperspectral reflectance properties, help in the estimation of biomass,
    nitrogen, carbon, and other essential gases content. This data can also be used
    to find the vegetative indexes of the filed or large demography. Heavy-duty vehicles
    such as thrashers, tractors, trucks etc., also need supervision and can use data
    analytics for farm management. Robots, autonomous vehicles, agricultural drones
    other equipment also need to be monitored remotely for better farm supervision.
    Livestock monitoring with the aid of IoT is also an important subject for precision
    farming. It includes cattle monitoring remotely using tags. Labour is also a major
    area of concern for precision farming. Since human intervention is generally prone
    to errors due to differences in understanding, decision making, and methodologies
    applied to solve a particular problem. Also the induction of human labor is cost-intensive.
    Therefore, with the application of IoT, human interference can be minimized and
    a network can be set up for monitoring thus reducing the errors and cost. 2) Data
    Collection and Corroboration Data is the main constituent of precision farming.
    It acts as both base and catalyst in the whole process. With IoT, a large number
    of data is collected in varying forms and formats. Sensors, cameras, and various
    other nodes aid in the collection of data. In precision agriculture, based on
    the nature of the problem, the IoT network can be designed and formulated to collect
    different types of data. After the data is collected, the corroboration also called
    documentation of the data is very important for better understanding. Corroboration
    is a natural application of collected data, but certain additions of different
    samples such as manual or machine integration are also seen. Data once collected
    needs to be refined and understood, labeled, and thus documented in a certain
    format. Documentation or corroboration of data helps in formulating statistical
    analysis and developing the decision support systems. Remote sensing charts and
    other crop assessing tools can be employed to understand the total crop yield
    of a particular region. Crop management can also be optimized using corroborating
    data. A yearly or term analysis can be performed on this data to improve precision
    farming. Food chain supply management can use the predictive analysis of this
    data for optimizing and designing new efficient strategies. The major areas where
    its application is seen are yield mapping for fertilization planning, field planning,
    agro-food traceability, site-specific measurements based on soil and water analysis,
    and remote vehicle monitoring for supply chains, etc. 3) Foretelling Also called
    forecasting is one of the major attributes or applications for decision making
    that is brought in agriculture with the introduction of IoT. With the IoT devices
    and network, real-time data analysis along with the comparison to the previously
    available datasets helps in the forecasting of the upcoming events in much advance.
    With this foretelling, various decision support systems can be designed capable
    of taking optimal and real time-decisions. It can also act as a preventive measure
    mechanism for avoiding or dealing with various upcoming unprecedented situations.
    With monitoring, data collection, and corroboration, foretelling can help in early
    disease detection, pest growth, weeding, drought, smart irrigation, and harvesting.
    Artificial intelligence can be employed for designing these learning systems.
    With IoT, a predictive analysis could be made way earlier than the harvest period
    for assessing crop production and consumption. Pre and post-harvest crop monitoring
    along with behavioral sciences and market analysis can also be employed to help
    site-specific farming and production increase in precision agriculture in the
    context of IoT. 4) Governing and Management It is an outcome of the monitoring
    device. Governing helps in controlling the whole system. Foretelling also plays
    a major role in governing. With IoT, it is important to govern the farm. Thresholds
    play a major role in designing a controlling strategy. Controlling is a major
    addendum of IoT in agriculture. Applications of controlling can be easily seen
    in site-specific management, working of smart irrigation models, plant growth
    monitoring models, and early crop analysis models and also in supply chain and
    smart vehicular navigation, interaction, optimization, and logistics control of
    farms. With governing, all the new strategies, formulae, practices and methods
    employed to solve the problems occurring on daily basis in farms can be monitored.
    These strategies can then be compared and analysed with the previous existential
    strategies. Therefore a knowledge base can be maintained. From the data analysis
    of that knowledge base, the best or the optimal strategies that can be employed
    to design or mould the system can be fetched. Various case studies can be performed
    to gather and test such information. From this the redundant techniques can be
    withdrawn and robust ones can be prioritised. With these methodologies and experiments,
    the management can be made more flexible, scalable and reliable. Also governing
    and management can be employed to find the best suited solutions. Due to the growth
    in agriculture sector, various public and private sector projects and startups
    are being started in various countries across the world. All these projects use
    artificial intelligence and IoT concepts to provide support and solutions to the
    growing industry of agriculture. All these projects or startups are explained
    in the TABLE 13. TABLE 13 IoT Based Public and Private Sector Projects/Startups
    for Precision Agriculture E. Our Proposed Work Inspired by the contribution of
    IoT in the field of agriculture, we proposed an architecture for precision farming.
    The layout of the architecture to be designed is proposed and shown in Fig. 8.
    The structure proposed for precision farming in case of farm management will constitute
    of different layers. The first layer would be the sensing layer, in which different
    types of sensors like soil, humidity, water, light, proximity, and conductive
    sensors will be deployed in the region of experimentation. All data from the sensors
    will be sent to the base station. The second layer is the network layer, which
    consists of gateways, internet, and other devices. This layer manages the traffic
    of the whole architecture. This layer collects data from the sensing layer and
    transfers it to the decision layer and the application layer. The third layer
    is the decision layer, which processes the data, manipulates it, and generates
    alerts or actions. The next layer is the application layer, which constitutes
    the firmware and the users. It receives all the inputs from other layers and the
    outputs are made visible to users. It also manages how the whole architecture
    will work or look. FIGURE 8. Proposed layered architecture for Precision Agriculture.
    Show All Our proposed architecture aims to observe and monitor the farm in real-time.
    Optimize the resource utilization, early detection of the diseases, and identification
    of the plant species, optimize irrigation facilities, and make definite use of
    pesticides and other manures. Monitor the growth of plants in each stage and take
    the necessary actions for the betterment of plants. The model to be designed will
    take into consideration the earning and investment of the small scale farmer.
    A scalable and cost efficient model will be designed by considering the reusability
    and recycling of the materials used. From the literature, it is found that the
    issue of interoperability and robustness is still not achieved. So, while designing
    the model these issues will be prioritized. Also, power supply and power consumption
    is a bottleneck for each model. So, from the literature it is found that energy
    harnessing approaches can be used to address this issue. In the proposed model,
    main focus will be on incorporating the concepts of energy harnessing approaches
    like solar energy and wind flow energy for power optimization. Harnessing solar
    energy for regions which have different season’s e.g., Kashmir, which has four
    seasons like spring, summer, autumn and winter throughout the year. So for these
    regions depending only on solar energy will be a bottle neck. Therefore, in the
    proposed work, a hybrid approach based on consumption of both wind and solar energy
    for reducing power consumption will be proposed. Some of the major findings of
    the proposed work will be: A scalable and cost efficient model will be designed
    by considering the reusability and recycling of materials used. The issues of
    interoperability and robustness issues of heterogeneous devices will be targeted.
    Power supply and power consumption being the bottleneck of each model will be
    targeted. To tackle such issues, energy conservation and energy harnessing approaches
    like solar and wind energy will be used. Harnessing solar energy for regions which
    have different season’s e.g., Kashmir, which has four seasons like spring, summer,
    autumn and winter throughout the year. So for these regions depending only on
    solar energy will be a bottle neck. Therefore in the proposed work, a hybrid approach
    based on consumption of both wind and solar energy for reducing power consumption
    will be proposed. Small scale farmers will be targeted for the development of
    sustainable and robust model. SECTION VI. Conclusion The Internet is revolutionizing
    our world. Communication via connective devices has become the countenance of
    survival. Agriculture is growing from precision farming to micro-farming. IoT
    has added more potential to communication by enabling the communication between
    humans and objects along with the environmental aspects. Seeking the vision of
    omnipresence i.e., anytime, anything, anywhere, everywhere, IoT should be considered
    a core for the development of new architectural concepts. Resource scarcity is
    a must address issue in precision agriculture and models should be developed to
    optimize resource utilization. Inclusion of monitoring in food supply chains,
    farms, greenhouses equipped with tags, WSN, etc. at each stage in the growth of
    the product/plant, making automatic reasoning via intelligent analysis and responses
    is moving towards much safer, secure, and trustworthy systems. In the article,

    and Prospects Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract:
    The application of the Internet of Things in agricultural development usually
    occurs via a monitoring network that consists of a large number of sensor nodes,
    thus gradually transforming agriculture from a human-oriented and single-machine-centric
    production model to an information- and software-centric production model. Due
    to the large area coverage of agriculture and the variety of production objects,
    if all farmland perception information is gathered into the cloud server, the
    server will exert greater pressure on the network, which reduces the speed of
    response to event processing. This problem may be perfectly solved by the recent
    emergence of Edge computing, which can share the load of the cloud server and
    reduce the delay. Edge computing has prospects in agricultural applications, such
    as pest identification, safety traceability of agricultural products, unmanned
    agricultural machinery, agricultural technology promotion, and intelligent management.
    The application of the Agricultural Internet of Things integrates artificial intelligence,
    the Internet of Things, and blockchain and Virtual/Augmented Reality technologies.
    This paper primarily reviews the application of Edge computing in the Agricultural
    Internet of Things and investigates the combination of Edge computing and Artificial
    Intelligence, blockchain and Virtual/Augmented reality technology. The challenges
    of Edge computing task allocation, data processing, privacy protection and security,
    and service stability in agriculture are reviewed. The future development direction
    of Edge computing in the Agricultural Internet of Things is predicted. Three key

    is the foundation of human survival and plays a fundamental role. It is vital
    to the stability and the development of society. However, with the emergence of
    three factors that restrict agricultural development: (i) population aging and
    migration (also known as urbanization) have led to a gradual decline of rural
    labor; (ii) industrial buildings and residential buildings are gradually eroding
    agricultural land, resulting in a reduction in agricultural land [1]; (iii) increased
    climate change will also continue to change crop growth conditions such as temperature,
    precipitation and soil moisture in unpredictable ways [2]. The challenges that
    agriculture faces are increasingly severe. In order to meet the challenges, people
    must be seize the opportunity of the third revolution in the information technology
    industry, for example, Internet of Things (IoT), big data, artificial intelligence
    et al.. They can bring fundamental changes to agriculture. The Agricultural Internet
    of Things (Agricultural IoT) not only solves the problems of increasing food demand,
    environmental pollution caused by excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers,
    and the safety of agricultural products [3], but also reduces labor costs [4],
    greatly promoting the continuous development of agriculture in the direction of
    high quality and high output. However, the widespread use of the Agricultural
    IoT has led to the explosive growth of sensors and the increasing number of data.
    The large amount of data increases the load on the cloud server, which reduces
    the response speed. The emergence of the Edge computing models can solve the problem
    of cloud server load. The classical Edge computing models include: the Cloudlet
    introduced by Satyanarayanan solves the latency problem of accessing the cloud
    by using computing resources available in the local network; the Fog computing
    introduced by Cisco enables applications to run directly on the edge of the network
    through billions of smart connected devices; the Mobile Edge computing introduced
    by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) allows mobile users
    to utilize computing services from base stations. Through the emergence of three
    classical Edge computing models, we can find a new trend: some calculations that
    take place in the cloud are gradually moving to the edge [5]. Similarly, the data
    generated by the Agricultural IoT is also increasing, resulting in increased load
    on the cloud server. In order to share the offload of the cloud server, the computation
    that occurs in the cloud is offloaded to the edge segment for execution. In addition,
    the real-time requirements of some applications of the Agricultural Internet of
    Things are high. The edge server is close to the data source, so it provides intelligent
    services nearby and shortens the response time. Although the Edge computing is
    favorable for agricultural development, but Edge computing applied to agriculture
    has little literature, so we combine with a lot of related literature and present
    a review of the application of Edge computing in the Agricultural IoT, which inspires
    more people to develop the Agricultural IoT under Edge computing in the future.
    This paper reviews the concept and research status of the Edge computing and Agricultural
    IoT. In addition, we describe in detail the research status of Edge computing
    in the application of pest identification and crop classification, agricultural
    product safety traceability, unmanned agricultural machinery, agricultural product
    promotion, etc., which mainly involves artificial intelligence, blockchain and
    virtual/augmented reality technology. In the end, the literature also mentions
    the challenges and opportunities of the combination of Edge computing and Agricultural
    IoT, and provides direction for the development of Edge computing and Agricultural
    IoT. The organizational structure of this paper is as follows. In Section II,
    it mainly introduces the concept of Edge computing and Agricultural IoT in detail;
    the necessity of combining Edge computing with the Agricultural IoT is discussed
    in Section II; then in Section III, the application of Agricultural IoT combined
    with Edge computing is reviewed; in Section IV, Edge computing combined Agricultural
    IoT meets the challenges; finally, the paper is concluded and a vision of their
    future is described in Section V. SECTION II. Background This section mainly introduces
    the concept, structure, and research status of Edge computing and Agricultural
    IoT. The aim of this section is to provide the reader with a solid foundation
    of the research subject. A. Edge Computing 1) Definition and Development of Edge
    Computing With the rapid development of the IoT, billions of smart devices are
    installed each year. It is estimated that more than 70 billion smart devices will
    be installed by 2020. The access of a large number of devices has led to an increase
    in the amount of data to be processed. We face the challenge of processing and
    analyzing those data, especially if it needs to be processed in real time. Simply
    using a cloud server is not able to provide real-time response while handling
    such a large data set. Edge computing is proposed for solving the problem of data
    explosion and network delay. The research fields of Edge computing include Fog
    computing [6], Cloudlet [7], [8] and Mobile Edge computing (MEC) [9], [10]. Although
    Edge computing has been proposed for a long time, there is no uniform and strict
    definition. Satyanarayanan [11] defines it as, “Edge computing is a new computing
    model that deploys computing and storage resources (such as Cloudlets, fog nodes)
    to networks closer to mobile devices or sensors.” Its system architecture is shown
    in Fig. 1, which is divided into three layers: terminal device, edge node and
    cloud center. As we all know, 5G is becoming more and more popular, and edge computing
    is one of the core technologies in the 5G era, but its architecture is open and
    can also be deployed and applied to 4G LTE networks. Operators will smoothly evolve
    on the existing network structure, and finally achieve full coverage of the computing
    power of low-level network nodes, and continue to improve edge computing capabilities.
    FIGURE 1. The system architecture. Show All From the development trend since 2010,
    the attention of Edge computing continues to rise, as shown in Fig. 2 (Some data
    quoted from [12]). Especially since 2016, the attention of Edge computing has
    increased rapidly. Shi et al. derived five typical scenarios for the application
    of Edge computing: cloud offload, video analytics, collaborative edge, smart home,
    smart city [13]. Sun et al. proposed a real-time fault detection algorithm based
    on Edge computing and cloud computing for the video monitoring system, which effectively
    improved the average repair time [14]. In [15], in order to meet the demand of
    smart home, a system based on Edge computing was designed to predict the demand
    for household electricity. The system can provide better quality of service and
    enhance the scalability of the system. In [16], Higashino et al. proposed a large-scale
    spatio-temporal information collection mechanism based on Edge computing and IoT
    to mitigate disasters and build a safe and intelligent city. FIGURE 2. Number
    of papers retrieved by “Edge computing” on Google Scholar. Show All 2) The Hierarchy
    of Edge Computing The Edge Computing Consortium (ECC) defines four areas for Edge
    computing: equipment domain (Perception and control layer), network domain (Connection
    and network layer), data domain (Storage and service layer), application domain
    (Business and intelligence layer). As shown in Fig. 3: these four layers are the
    computing objects of Edge computing. FIGURE 3. The hierarchical deployment structure
    for Edge computing. Show All Equipment domain: in the equipment domain, Edge computing
    can directly process the perceived information. For example, intelligent identification
    can be directly deployed in video collection and audio collection. Network domain:
    in the network domain, the automatic conversion of each network protocol is realized,
    and the data format is standardized. At the same time, the Edge computing in the
    network domain can conduct intelligent management of the “converged network”,
    reduce the redundancy of the network, ensure the security of the network, and
    further participate in the optimization of the network. Data domain: Edge computing
    in the data domain makes data management smarter and more flexible. First, Edge
    computing can analyze the integrity and consistency of the data, and conduct data
    collation to delete redundant and wrong data in the system. Secondly, Edge computing
    can maintain efficient coordination with cloud computing and share cloud computing
    tasks. Application domain: Edge computing in the application domain provides localized
    business logic and application intelligence. It enables applications to be flexible
    and fast- responding. Edge computing can provide localized application services
    independently, when it loses contact with the cloud. Edge computing is deployed
    in the above four domains, where it is closer to the user and application scenarios.
    It enables the device to have intelligent sensing capabilities and it can be equipped
    with adaptive connection strategies and more optimized deployment strategies.
    It can solve data heterogeneity and related network synchronization problems in
    the system, and provide local business logic and application intelligence. Edge
    computing is an open and distributed platform that provides network, computing,
    and storage services at the edge of the network, close to the data end. It meets
    the demands of intelligent, real-time business, data optimization, and security
    aspects of agricultural digital transformation. In addition, there are two kinds
    of edge servers mentioned in this paper: remote edge computing servers located
    on the edge of wireless network; local edge computing device. B. Agricultural
    Internet of Things 1) Definition and Development of Agricultural IoT Since the
    IoT technology is proposed in 1999, it has gradually penetrated into various fields
    [17], [18]. Agriculture is the focus of attention of people all over the world,
    and it is naturally also involved. With regard to the concept of Agricultural
    IoT, different researchers have given different interpretations from different
    perspectives. For example, Li et al. [19] believe that the Agricultural IoT usually
    refers to the use of relevant sensing devices to perceive information on environmental
    factors in plants, agricultural production tools, etc., and an informational network
    for real-time monitoring of agricultural production processes, positioning and
    management of agricultural production objects based on pre-defined protocols for
    data transmission. The characteristics of Agricultural IoT are relatively clear,
    mainly in the aspect comprehensive perception, intelligent processing and timely
    feedback of agriculture from planting to sales [20]. The emergence of cloud computing
    and its extended Edge computing models such as fog computing and Mobile Edge computing
    have made the Agricultural IoT a milestone. It has completely transformed the
    management and operation of the farm [21]. The Agricultural IoT has made great
    progress in recent years. Xing et al. designed a greenhouse information intelligent
    monitoring system based on ZigBee wireless sensing technology [22]. Diego et al.
    designed agrometeorological monitoring station based on Bluetooth technology,
    and the data was sent to the computer through the wireless Bluetooth module [23].
    In order to realize the collection, management, visualization and upload of real-time
    information in paddy fields, Zhang et al. proposed a paddy field information monitoring
    system based on Solar-Powered Panel and GPRS technology [24]. However, both ZigBee
    and GPRS are short-range wireless technologies and have high operating costs.
    Therefore, a wide area network monitoring system combining NB-IoT and LoRa is
    designed in [25]. By studying the development of farmland monitoring systems,
    we find that the development of Agricultural IoT is not only reflected in the
    rapid growth of the types and quantities of agricultural sensors, but also in
    combination with emerging technologies. 2) Architecture of Agricultural IoT At
    the beginning of development, Agricultural IoT mainly focused on the application
    of the single entity, which leads to the scalability, scalability and interoperability
    of the entire system gradually fail to meet the growing demand of the agricultural
    production. Later, the new hierarchical structure model of Agricultural IoT was
    proposed, based on the specific needs of agricultural production and marketing,
    combined with the principles of safety, reusability and expansion of IoT systems
    and practical experience. As shown in Fig. 4, the model is divided into five layers
    from top to bottom, including the sensing layer, the transport layer, the application
    layer, etc. The communication protocols and data are transmitted between the layers
    using different communication protocols. FIGURE 4. The agricultural IoT architecture
    (AIoT in the picture represents the Agricultural IoT). Show All The sensing layer
    of the Agricultural IoT consists of various sensor uses Wi-Fi, GPRS, and ZigBee
    technologies to transmit data, and transmits the collected data to the access
    layer of the Agricultural IoT system structure; the access layer is mainly composed
    of hardware gateways and built-in software middleware. The middleware can effectively
    shield the complexity of the underlying heterogeneous sensing network and provide
    a unified abstract management interface to provide a foundation for the rapid
    establishment of Agricultural IoT business applications; the network layer transmits
    data to the upper layer through Internet Protocol, mobile communication network
    protocols; the Agricultural IoT data sharing layer is equivalent to a huge data
    pool, which realizes the integrated sharing of various types of monitoring data.
    The layer mainly uses transmission protocols such as TCP and UDP; the application
    layer obtains data from the data sharing layer through protocols such as HTTP,
    FTP and other protocols and constructs a corresponding Agricultural IoT system.
    Compared with the traditional three-layer and four-layer IoT architecture, the
    functions of each layer in the five-layer Agricultural IoT architecture are clearer
    and more independent, which is beneficial to the network load balancing between
    servers at different levels, and can reduce the communication burden of the enterprise
    network. C. The Necessity of Combining Edge Computing With Agricultural IoT Based
    on the combination of IoT and cloud, the Agricultural IoT system has simple device
    access and rapid system setup. However, due to the centralized processing of data
    by the cloud computing model, it is difficult to solve the following problems
    when the device and data are exploding. (1) Excessive resource cost: the sensors
    continuously collect various sensor data, and the data is usually stable or rarely
    changed. Uploading all the data to the cloud for processing will consume a lot
    of network resources and cloud resources. (2) Real-time performance is difficult
    to guarantee: data processing and decision-making are all in the cloud, and the
    processing is not timely. (3) Excessive reliance on the network: when the network
    is unstable, it cannot process data and control devices in time. (4) Data security
    and privacy protection: all sensor data and control data need to be transmitted
    through the network, and there are risks such as information eavesdropping, tampering,
    fraud and illegal operation of equipment. These problems will increase the cost
    of Agricultural IoT systems (network flow, storage, and computational costs),
    reduce stability and availability of system, and make it difficult to automate
    production control, especially in large-scale, factory-planted, and aquaculture.
    In addition, non-standard and self-resource limitations of sensors and control
    devices (including computing, storage capabilities, etc.) bring obstacles to device
    access and linkage control. Therefore, it is necessary to study and solve the
    above problems to develop smart agriculture and promote precision agriculture.
    Edge computing provides intelligent services at the edge of the networks which
    are close to thing or data source, enabling each edge of the IoT to have data
    collection, analysis, computing, and intelligent processing capabilities to process
    data, filter data, and analyze data nearby. In addition, local decision- making
    and processing can meet key requirements of network capabilities and resource
    constraints, security and privacy challenges. Therefore, we introduce Edge computing
    into the Agricultural IoT system to improve the standardization, stability, and
    availability of the agricultural IoT system. SECTION III. Research Status of Edge
    Computing in Agricultural IoT This section introduces the concepts of Artificial
    Intelligence (AI), blockchain and Virtual Reality /Augmented Reality and their
    research status in agriculture. The most important concept is to summarize the
    research status of Edge computing and Agricultural IoT application technology.
    A. Research on Artificial Intelligence in Agriculture Based on Edge Computing
    Since the breakthrough in deep learning in 2001, AI has entered a new era and
    is gradually infiltrating the modern agricultural field and injecting new vitality
    and a new impetus into the development of modern agriculture. In addition, the
    rapid development of mobile computing technology and the IoT has generated billions
    of bytes of data at the edge of the network. Driven by this trend, AI must be
    pushed to the edge of the network to fully release the potential of edge big data.
    This situation caused the emergence of Edge computing, which is an emerging paradigm
    that pushes computing tasks and services from the core of the network to the edge
    of the network. AI computing is becoming increasingly complex, and an increasing
    amount of data is needed. As a result, edge intelligence (EI) is generated as
    an interdisciplinary subject of AI and Edge computing [26]. Edge intelligence
    leverages the available data and resources of end devices, edge nodes, and cloud
    centers to optimize the total training and reasoning performance of the deep learning
    model. In 2–5 years later, the Edge computing technologies and machine learning
    will be in the mainstream [27]. AI has a place in Agricultural IoT application
    technology and is primarily employed in video analysis, unmanned agricultural
    machinery, pest identification, and plant species identification. Therefore, the
    research of edge intelligence is one of the most important components of future
    research topics. 1) Artificial Intelligence AI is a branch of computer science.
    Research in this area includes robotics, language recognition, image recognition,
    natural language processing, and expert systems. The AI mentioned in this paper
    primarily involves image processing; its main applications in agriculture are
    pest and disease identification, crop species identification, and unmanned agricultural
    machinery. Since Yann LeCun published Gradient-based learning applied to document
    recognition in 1998 [28], deep learning has been developed for more than 20 years.
    Represented by the well-known Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), deep learning
    has achieved leapfrog development in recent years due to the following four classic
    CNNs: AlexNet [29], VGG [30], GoogleNet [31] and ResNet [32]. Zhang et al. improved
    the GoogleNet model structure and Cifar10 model structure and applied an improved
    model to training of corn leaf pest identification, which improved the optimal
    recognition accuracy by 0.4% and 1.7% respectively [33]. Too et al. [34] directly
    tuned the VGG16, Inception-V4, ResNet, and DenseNet networks and applied them
    to train and test insect images from 14 plants in the PlantVillage image set.
    They compared the experimental results by using different iterations and attained
    the optimal recognition accuracy of 99.75%. Goh et al. constructed an optimal
    Convolutional Neural Network to complete the classification task based on plant
    mutants and improve the classification success rate [35]. Research on the accuracy
    of pest and disease identification is very mature but few studies examine the
    running time of the model. In this paper, the author proposes the idea of using
    Edge computing to reduce the running time of the model. According to the introduction
    of [26], the author summarizes the framework of edge intelligence, which includes
    the edge-based mode, device-based mode, edge-device mode, and edge-cloud mode,
    as shown in Fig. 5. In Fig. 5(a), the terminal devices receive the data and send
    data to the edge server. DNN model reasoning is performed on the edge server,
    and the forecast results are returned to the device. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the
    edge server sends the DNN model to the mobile device and locally performs model
    reasoning. As shown in Fig. 5(c), the device divides the DNN model into multiple
    parts. The device executes the DNN model to a specific layer and sends the intermediate
    data to the edge server. The edge server will execute the remaining layers, and
    the predicted result is sent to the mobile device. The device in Fig. 5(d) is
    responsible for input data collection, and the DNN model is executed in cooperation
    with the cloud through the edge. Due to the development of deep learning, the
    commonly employed models of DNN (such as AlexNet and GoogleNet) have reached millions
    of neurons. All neurons are concentrated in mobile devices or edge servers; thus,
    the hardware requirements are very high. Their concentration in the cloud server
    will cause delays; thus, use of the edge-cloud mode is common. FIGURE 5. Edge
    Intelligence inference modes: (a)Edge-based mode (b)Device-based mode (c) Edge-device
    mode (d) Edge-cloud mode. Show All 2) Research Status of Edge Intelligence In
    this section, we review the relevant literature on the combination of AI and Edge
    computing techniques. The role of edge nodes in AI is summarized in Table 1. TABLE
    1 Overview of the Role of Edge Computing in Artificial Intelligence a: Execution
    of Part of the Program To solve the problems of insufficient processing capability
    and limited resources of terminal equipment, the industry introduced computational
    offloading in Mobile Edge Computing [36]. In the application of plant diseases
    and pests identification, the role of the edge server is to execute part of the
    program, which uses computing offload technology. At the same time we also need
    to consider the division of CNN or DNN procedures. MAUI is a system, which enables
    fine-grained energy-aware offload of mobile code to the infrastructure [37]. It
    maximizes the potential for energy savings through fine-grained code while minimizing
    changes to applications. It allows part of the program to be executed locally
    on the smart phone and others to be run remotely in the infrastructure. Second,
    MAUI provides a method for each application. But MAUI needs to perform an analysis
    step for each individual application, while performing DNN partitioning requires
    prediction. The Neurosurgeon lightweight scheduler proposed by Kang et al., makes
    decisions based on the DNN topology without any real-time analysis [38]. It selects
    the best partition point, optimizes end-to-end latency, and performs DNN division
    between mobile and cloud. The new computing paradigm reduces the computation required
    by the data center, thus shortening the query service time and improving the query
    throughput. The deep network layer is partitioned to respectively run on mobile
    devices and the cloud. Compared to [38], the deep network is further divided into
    cloud, fog computing devices and users’ mobile devices. Decommissioning procedures
    takes up some time, but their overall time is much shorter than the time they
    spend executing in the cloud center or terminal alone. Teerapittayanon et al.
    [39] for adapting to the cloud-edge-terminal distributed hierarchy, proposed a
    distributed depth neural network (DDNNs) based on distributed hierarchy. DNN is
    divided into various parts by Cloud Exit, Edge Exit and Local Exit, and then it
    is mapped into a distributed computing hierarchy. The structure takes advantage
    of the geographical diversity of sensors, which not only reduces communication
    costs but also improves the accuracy of target recognition. DeepX [40] divides
    the entire DNN or CNN into multiple parts and executes them on each local device.
    Its advantage is that it uses runtime layer compression (RLC), which no longer
    focuses on the training phase of deep learning and the compression of the entire
    model, but provides the memory consumed in the reasoning phase and the hierarchical
    compression of the computation runtime. Meanwhile, deep architecture decomposition
    (DAD) can effectively identify the units of the depth model quickly, decompose
    them, and allocate the blocks to local and remote processors. But DeepX cannot
    operate Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) at present. The deep network layer is
    partitioned to respectively run on mobile devices and the cloud. Sun et al. [41]
    proposed mVideo to make full use of resources on collaborative edges and cloud
    nodes. The video stream processing platform is provided with a mechanism to partition
    video analysis tasks according to the available resources of mobile edge nodes.
    At the edge node, a lightweight DNN model is used to preprocess the video data,
    and the results are uploaded to the cloud node for further analysis. Its advantage
    is that the collected video data covers a large area and reduces communication
    costs. Overall, the execution time is reduced by 90%. b: Pretreatment The role
    of the edge server in the application of farm intelligent monitoring systems and
    unmanned agricultural machines is pre-processing. In the large-scale video stream
    analysis, the edge preprocessing is used to make a preliminary judgment of the
    object, so as to reduce the communication time and the load in the cloud center.
    The architecture of edge-enhanced video analysis system proposed by M.Ali is composed
    of camera terminal, edge node, cloudlet and cloud center [42]. The CNN model is
    trained and the generated model is saved in the cloud. The saved model is then
    transferred and distributed on cloudlets and cloud resources for object inference.
    In this paper, edge resources are used for the basic processing stage, which improves
    efficiency. But the authors did not experiment with the extensibility of the architecture.
    Edge preprocessing also includes compressing deep neural networks on edge devices.
    Model compression was introduced to overcome the difficulty of large computation
    and large memory consumption in the terminal of the model. In 2015, Han’s Deep
    compression model compression method was reviewed [43]. Cropping, weight sharing,
    quantization, and coding were applied to model compression and good results are
    achieved. Hardy et al. proposed a novel algorithm for updating and compressing
    models on the server [44]. It is flexible to perform distributed deep learning
    on edge devices through adaptive compression. In addition, the edge node also
    plays the role of a supervisor, which contains a test data set to calculate the
    accuracy of the central model. Finally, we found that compressing images in a
    system that sends images from edge nodes to cloud nodes can reduce communication
    bandwidth. But the introduction of compression technology also increases the computational
    overhead of compression and decompression. In general, transmitting smaller images
    may result in better performance overall, but higher compression rates may negatively
    affect prediction accuracy. Chandakkar et al. [45] proposed to update or train
    DNNs on edge devices to provide personalized services. How to deploy updates /
    training on mobile devices is our challenge. Moreover, simply from the experiment
    of updating the DNN, it is a hot research topic to study the catastrophic forgetting
    after construction in the next few years to maximize the data performance. c:
    Edge Caching Drolia et al. [46] were inspired by the web cache and proposed to
    add a cache module to the edge device. The advantage of caching on the edge server
    is that the images obtained by the terminals in the same area of the edge device
    service often have similarities. By caching the characteristics of these objects,
    these queries do not need to be submitted to the cloud, which can greatly reduce
    the delay of users. The challenge is that when the distribution of the query graph
    changes drastically, the Distribution Estimator in the edge device cannot quickly
    respond to the change. Later, they proposed Precog [47], which has the same application
    scenario, and it caches the models from the edge in the terminal device. This
    is a technology of edge and terminal device collaboration. When an object feature
    point query is missing on the terminal device, the image of the query is uploaded
    to the edge, and Markov Estimator in the edge records the query and sends the
    updated object probability distribution to the terminal device along with the
    query result. Precog has the same strengths and weaknesses as Cacher. In general,
    the program division is aimed at specific neural networks. Two or more edge servers
    can be used, and the combination of splitting and preprocessing and edge caching
    can make use of the specific structure of NN, thus providing more opportunities
    for optimization. B. Application of Edge Computing in Traceability of Agricultural
    Products An increasing number of people are eating organic agricultural products.
    However, due to the lack of common credit certificates in the market, people are
    not assured of the purchase of organic agricultural products. Therefore, tracing
    agricultural products is especially important. Wang et al. [48] and Zhang et al.
    [49] use an RFID-based meat traceability system, which traces from the customer
    to the manufacturer. It connects to the ONS server of the RFID system via the
    Internet and obtains the PML server of the IP address for each product-related
    point to obtain detailed information about product circulation; Lahbabi et al.
    proposed a traceability system that can share product certification information
    in real time [50]. Yun et al. described the research progress of key technologies
    in agricultural product traceability systems [51]. Azram et al. proposed a food
    document traceability model that is based on a software product line [52]. In
    the above centralized supply chain traceability system, members of the supply
    chain rely on an information provider to store, transmit, and share all information.
    The centralized system approach poses problems because it is a monopoly, asymmetric
    and opaque information system approach. This can lead to trust issues among players
    in the supply chain, including fraud, manipulation and tampering [53]. The blockchain,
    which is the underlying technology of digital currency, securely records transaction
    information for all currencies in a decentralized distributed ledger. The decentralization
    of the blockchain and the high transparency ensure that the traceability of stored
    data cannot be tampered with [54]. Many new distributed applications have been
    implemented based on blockchain technology. Many of these applications focus on
    the automation and digitization of financial sector processes. Automating processes
    can save money and increase transparency. Therefore, blockchain technology can
    potentially make a significant contribution to the efficiency and competitiveness
    of world agriculture. 1) Blockchain In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto proposed the concept
    of blockchain. Blockchain refers to the technical solution of collectively maintaining
    a reliable ledger via decentralization and distrust [55]–[57]. The infrastructure
    model of blockchain technology include a data layer, network layer, consensus
    layer, incentive layer, contract layer and application layer. The centralized
    management of agricultural products and the tampering of data are solved by blockchain
    technology. Lucena et al. [58] proposed a method for measuring the grain quality
    using blockchains and smart contracts. They proposed an implementation of a practical
    case that increased the value of genetically modified (GM) exports of Brazilian
    grain exporters by 15%. To study how to promote value transfer by converting African
    farmers’ assets, such as livestock, farmland and agricultural products, into small-scale
    agriculture, Chinaka [59] and Schneider [60] proposed a product traceability system
    that is based on a prototype blockchain to improve the transparency and automation
    of the agricultural sector. Holmberg and Aquist [61] investigated a solution that
    is based on blockchain traceability in the dairy industry. These studies apply
    the concept of blockchain to product traceability but lack a framework of blockchain
    application. The structure diagram of a blockchain-based food safety traceability
    system proposed by Wang et al. [62] and Li and Wang [63] is shown in Fig 6. Based
    on this description, we determine that the application of blockchain in Agricultural
    IoT is increasing. FIGURE 6. Structure diagram of food safety traceability system
    based on blockchain. Show All 2) The Research Status Although the blockchain solves
    the problem in which data is easily falsified, the scalability of the blockchain
    is small and the memory is insufficient. The problem was solved by the combination
    of blockchain and edge computing technology. In table 2 an overview of the combination
    of edge computing and blockchain applications. Liu et al. proposed new electric
    vehicles cloud and edge (EVCE) as a typical application scenario of the Internet
    of Things, which also involves the transmission and transaction of information
    and energy [64]. At the same time, using the blockchain to connect the strong
    and weak electricity can provide EVCE with transparency and traceability security
    guarantees. Xu et al. proposed a product traceability system that is based on
    blockchain and Edge computing technology [65]. The role of the blockchain is to
    prevent malicious tampering by third parties. The edge server performs a difficult
    hash calculation with the blockchain node and returns the result to the blockchain
    node for verification. If the blockchain node does not have sufficient internal
    storage space, it can offload the entire blockchain to the edge server and store
    only relatively new blocks (referred to as storage offload) in the internal storage.
    The disadvantage is to consider the computing power of the edge nodes. In this
    regard, Stanciu proposed that the deployment of computing on the edge nodes requires
    smaller Dockers containers. The three-layer edge model was mentioned in [66].
    It consists of physical devices and processes, edge nodes and cloud services.
    The blockchain is deployed on the top layer to ensure transaction security and
    to be properly verified. Edge computing solves the inconvenience caused by blockchain
    computing applications due to limited computing power and available energy consumption
    of Agricultural IoT terminal equipment. But the paper does not take into account
    the problem of the efficiency of identity verification and the vulnerability of
    the connection between the edge node and the terminal. In [67], a distributed
    trusted authentication system combining edge computing and blockchain is proposed.
    The system is composed of three parts: physical network layer, blockchain edge
    layer and blockchain network layer. Edge computing is applied in the edge nodes
    of the blockchain to provide name resolution and edge identity authentication
    services based on smart contracts. In addition, the edge computing cache strategy
    is proposed to improve the hit rate and reduce the delay. TABLE 2 Overview of
    the Combination of Edge Computing and Applications of Blockchain However, as the
    application of blockchain technology becomes more mature, the increase in data
    has caused inventory inflation [68]. The problem of insufficient storage arises
    when the blockchain is only applied to the digital currency, to which the application
    scenario of the blockchain is not limited. For example, in [54], transaction information
    involves files, videos, and audio, which generates higher requirements for blockchain
    storage capabilities. However, the high demand for storage of blockchain data
    is not conducive to the development of blockchain. By combining IPFS [69] and
    blockchain, a decentralized identity management solution is proposed. According
    to [70] and [71], the working principle of the agricultural product traceability
    system, which is based on blockchain technology and combines Edge Computing and
    the IPFS mechanism, is shown in Fig. 7: Edge Computing is used to manage local
    networks, package data formats, and provide computing power. Data is transmitted
    from the intelligent terminal to the edge node through the edge gateway, and files
    with large memory, such as photos and videos, are stored via the IPFS mechanism.
    The content hash value returned after the storage is transmitted to the edge node
    through the cloud server. The value is packaged in the JSON format with the previous
    data, and the packaged data is stored in the blockchain in the form of a transaction.
    Once the transaction is completed, the data stored in the blockchain cannot be
    tampered with, and the data is queried in real time based on the hash value after
    the transaction. In the security traceability architecture of blockchain products
    based on edge computing, edge nodes only play the role of data processing. The
    security of data transmission and the efficiency of identity authentication are
    not considered. All in all, by building a decentralized system, blockchain can
    provide infrastructure support for the IoT and help solve the ubiquitous security
    issues in the IoT. At the same time, the IoT provides a large number of landing
    scenarios for the blockchain. FIGURE 7. Agricultural product traceability architecture
    based on edge calculation, blockchain and IPFS. Show All C. Study on the Combination
    of VR/AR and Edge Computing in Agriculture Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality
    have been the focus of the industry’s attention since 2016. Users have higher
    and higher requirements for real-time performance. Scholars have found that the
    actual physical or network distance between the client and the cloud is too large
    to limit the response speed of VR / AR. At the same time, the growth rate of bandwidth
    resources in the cloud lags far behind the growth rate of data, which ultimately
    leads to cloud computing being unable to meet the higher VR / AR computing requirements
    of bandwidth. The idea is to combine edge computing with VR/AR. Compared with
    former cloud computing, Edge computing can better support AR/VR computing scenarios:
    (1) Cisco noted that global devices will generate 600ZB data in 2020 in the Global
    Cloud Index [72], 90% of which is temporary data similar to AR/VR scenarios. A
    large amount of temporary data can be stored at the edge nodes to alleviate the
    pressure on the cloud bandwidth. (2) High delay, strong jitter and low data transmission
    rate caused by the unstable links and routes in the complex network environment
    affect the responsiveness of cloud services [73]. The edge-side is closer to the
    user-side in both geographical distance and network distance, which ensures lower
    latency and reduces network jitter, which renders edge calculation more useful
    and responsiveness stronger [11]. (3) The images involved in AR computing, such
    as face data, belong to the user’s private data. These data is stored at the edge,
    which reduces the possibility of privacy leakage. 1) Virtual/Augmented Reality
    Technology VR and AR are immersive interactive environments that are based on
    computing information [74]. VR emphasizes the immersion of the virtual world,
    which emphasizes that people can interact with objects in the virtual world in
    a natural way. While AR emphasizes the ability to incorporate computer-generated
    virtual information into real-world scenarios and does not isolate the connection
    between the observer and the real world [75]. VR and AR differ by the device.
    The VR device is a closed-type head-mounted display, which is cumbersome and inconvenient.
    AR equipment is divided into three types: head-mounted, hand-held and space-projected
    by Bimber and Raskar according to the application scenario [76], which is relatively
    light. Recently, the application research of VR/AR technology in agriculture has
    emerged. According to the study of Cupial [77], AR has many applications in agriculture
    and will become an important technology in the Agricultural IoT in the future.
    Fernandez et al. [78] developed a tractor assist system that is based on wearable
    AR technology. When a tractor is working in the field, the parts that have been
    treated in the field are displayed in the field of view of the driver’s AR glasses.
    Vidal et al. reviewed the current status of AR and proposed its new applications
    in weed science [79]. It includes software for image identification for species
    identification and quantification of weeds, and selection of herbicides based
    on weed density. Nigam et al. [80] proposed a primitive augmented reality system.
    They use augmented reality technology to help farmers identify insects and successfully
    utilize integrated pest management. Generally, farmers are not trained in entomology,
    and they tend to destroy the insects they find in the field. In fact, not all
    insects should be eliminated because the prosperity of fields and ecosystems depends
    on their existence. The authors of the paper proposed an innovative augmented
    reality application that they intend to help farmers identify insects and use
    integrated pest management. The system made recommendations for farmers to use
    pesticides reasonably and reduce pollution. Another interesting augmented reality
    application for greenhouses shown in Neto and Doke [81]. This application uses
    a network of humidity and temperature sensors to sense conditions to develop staphylococcus
    fungi in tomatoes and warn farmers through their mobile devices. In addition,
    Liu et al. noted the use of AR technology to simulate the growth of plants and
    livestock, to visualize information and help users manage different agricultural
    jobs [82]. Janna and Timo [83] proposed the use of drones and AR technology to
    accurately control the fertilization rate in agriculture. A drone is responsible
    for collecting soil information, and the AR technology guides the user to the
    generated sample points. In applications in agriculture, a mix of AR and VR technologies
    are utilized where virtual and actual environments are smoothly combined [84].
    Premsankar et al. [85] experimentally demonstrated that cloud deployments have
    higher latency than edges. Edge computing was introduced. Although various studies
    have investigated edge caching and computing, their use for AR/VR applications
    has been given minimal attention [86]. 2) Research Status In this section, we
    learned that the role of edge computing in AR/VR is mainly to store in edge and
    execute some VR/AR tasks at the edge. In table 3, we summarize the role of edge
    servers in VR/AR. TABLE 3 The Role of Edge Servers in VR/AR In fact, the role
    of edge computing in VR/AR is mainly edge caching. In edge caching, caching strategies
    can be divided into proactive and reactive. In proactive caching, the content
    to be requested is predicted and brought to the cache. In reactive caching, the
    content obtained is cached and is updated according to user needs. S.Park et al.
    came up with the idea of caching on the client side [87]. The priority cache mentioned
    in the paper can be used in the edge cache. M. Chen et al. studied edge caching
    in VR networks to reduce backhaul traffic and meet real-time requirements of VR
    users [88]. In their proposal, a unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is used to collect
    the VR content requested by the user and transmit it to the small base station
    and the retrograde cache. Deep learning algorithms is implemented to find the
    best caching strategy. In J. Chakareski’s research, the authors used edge computing
    to overcome the computing limitations of VR devices by enabling users to offload
    computing tasks to edge servers [89]. The author’s goal is to use the Lyapunov
    stochastic optimization model to minimize calculation and transmission power consumption,
    but it is affected by co-channel interference, reliability and delay constraints.
    M. S. Elbamby et al. proposed an proactive caching and computing scheme to meet
    the high reliability and low latency requirements of VR users [90]. In the paper,
    information about user actions and game actions is used to pre-calculate and cache
    the next video frame to minimize latency while multi-connectivity is applied to
    ensure reliability. Although it is aimed at the application of VR games, it is
    also applicable the planting of plants in the online VR of the Agricultural IoT.
    To briefly summarize, the architecture diagram of the edge server playing a role
    of caching in VR/AR is shown in Figure 8. FIGURE 8. Structural diagram of the
    combination of edge calculation and VR/AR in agriculture. Show All Edge computing
    can also perform some parts VR/AR tasks. Yan and Qiao [91] proposed a method for
    solving the delay and bandwidth for Web AR that primarily deployed the edge server
    between the clients, assumes AR computing tasks and storage of 3D models, which
    is closer to the user end and satisfies the user’s requirements for real-time
    performance. First, the cloud node initiates full AR service access. After receiving
    a user request, it selects the most appropriate edge computing node and redirects
    the request based on the IP address. Then, according to the calculation task division,
    an independent AR engine and 3D model database are used to identify the target
    image. The architecture overcomes the difficulties of poor portability of AR devices,
    poor pure front-end performance, and high cloud computing costs. In addition,
    Hou et al. [92] proposed rendering on edge servers in order to provide a more
    lightweight wireless VR / AR experience. The paper lists the advantages and disadvantages
    of rendering on cloud servers, remote edge servers, and local edge servers: The
    advantage of cloud server rendering is that it allows users to experience VR /
    AR when moving or anywhere, but the bandwidth cost is high, and it is easy to
    cause network delay due to congestion; Remote edge server rendering can also achieve
    mobility, but its mobility depends on the movement of the mobile device, and there
    is a delay; Local edge server rendering does not provide mobility or provides
    very limited mobility but no latency. We can choose the server for rendering according
    to our needs. Finally, we found that edge computing reduced the response time
    of VR / AR, shared the computing power of VR / AR terminals and made VR / AR more
    widely used in agriculture. SECTION IV. Challenges A. Data Processing A large
    amount of data is generated in the agricultural IoT, so edge computing meets challenges
    related to data processing. In terms of data generation, edge nodes need to have
    storage plans, which determine whether the data is structured, semi-structured,
    or unstructured. So the IT team should know how much data and what type of data
    the edge node will have on the farm in the short or long term. In terms of data
    storage time, in some cases, the collected data is retained for a long time. However,
    in some cases, only a part of the data need to be retained or stored for a short
    period of time. For example, in the image recognition of pests and diseases under
    edge computing, when edge nodes execute part of the program, the original data
    can be discarded and only the feature data can be saved. In terms of data transfer,
    not all collected data must be moved to another platform. In some cases, only
    a portion of the data needs to be moved, or only data that has been aggregated,
    cleaned, or transformed in some other way, and may not even need to be moved.
    Much depends on the processing and analysis after data collection. B. Task Assignment
    In the paper, the Agricultural IoT is mainly end-edge-cloud collaboration that
    is the terminal, edge nodes and cloud center work together. So assignment of task
    is directly related to the execution and efficiency of the tasks. Partitioning
    in the edge environment needs to decompose the application into multiple components
    according to various state information, such as resources, energy consumption
    and response delay of the edge node. While the semantics of the original application
    is preserved, the program components are placed on different edge nodes. The Neurosurgeon
    proposed by Kang et al. [38] refers to the use of Fine-grained Computation Partitioning
    to partition the DNN model, which is executed at the edge or the cloud. How to
    design and implement the application partitioning technology in the Edge computing
    environment enables the proper distribution of application components among multiple
    heterogeneous edge nodes. Thus, the high performance and reliability of the application
    is obtained in the Edge computing environment. Some scholars are solving the problem
    of task allocation. For example, Using Lyapunov optimization theory to design
    a resource allocation algorithm based on a single slot. The problem of task offloading
    and resource allocation are transformed into three sub-problems of user local
    computing resource allocation, power and loan resource allocation, and edge server
    resource allocation. C. Privacy Protection and Security Computing closed to the
    data source is an effective way to protect privacy and data security. However,
    in the environment of Edge computing, privacy protection and security face the
    following challenges: (1) farmers’ awareness of privacy and security is weak.
    The survey shows that wireless connection uses default passwords, which indicates
    that many users do not protect their personal privacy. In this case, people can
    easily use a webcam, temperature and humidity sensors and other equipment to spy
    on a farm’s confidential planting and breeding data. Farmers’ awareness for privacy
    and security should be strengthened, and they are encouraged to change their passwords.
    (2) higher requirements exist for the physical security of edge equipment. Edge
    devices do not operate in fixed places, such as cloud computing centers. Most
    of these devices are open to the outside world in an uncontrolled environment
    and data on edge devices is more valuable than data on IoT terminals; they are
    more vulnerable. The access control system is added to the edge. In principle,
    this access control system should be suitable for multi-entity access control
    between different trust domains. At the same time, various factors such as geographic
    location and resource ownership should also be considered. (3) effective tools
    for data privacy and security are lacking. Although many data security methods
    are available, they are not fully applicable to Edge computing architectures.
    The network edge is more vulnerable to hacking in a highly dynamic environment.
    (4) distributed management is more difficult. Each endpoint has a specific vulnerability
    and should be protected differently. How to manage vast infrastructure is one
    of the challenges that we face. D. Service Stability The farms occupy a vast area,
    so they are all in the wilderness and the signal is poor. Service stability is
    especially important. Any kind of reliable system has four characteristics: distinguishability,
    scalability, isolation and reliability. Distinguishability: the rapid development
    of the IoT has caused the deployment of multiple services at the network edge.
    However, these services have different priorities. Key services need to be executed
    before common services are executed. For example, failure judgment and failure
    alarm of an unmanned harvester have priority over straight driving. Scalability:
    when certain equipment is worn out, the first problem to be solved is whether
    the newly purchased equipment can continue the service execution of the original
    system. We can design a flexible and extended service management layer to solve
    this problem. Isolation: in a distributed system, shared resources can be managed
    by different synchronization mechanisms, such as locks or tokens. In the edge
    system, this problem is more complicated. In the automatic watering system, if
    the program does not respond, the user can still water. Issues of isolation can
    be solved by deploying or uninstall the framework and adding access control. Reliability:
    when the edge device fails, the Edge computing system can inform the user which
    component is in trouble. Cao et al. discovered that the data transmission accuracy
    of edge equipment is lower in the case of low power and other unreliable conditions
    [93]. Thus, saving energy is a way to improve reliability. SECTION V. Conclusion
    and Prospects Edge computing, as an emerging network architecture, has realized
    localized services and improved user experience. Edge computing is extensively
    employed in the retail, financial, and agricultural fields. In this study, we
    comprehensively discuss the concepts related to Edge computing and Agricultural
    IoT. We have transformed the research status of Edge computing applications in
    the agricultural field into the research status of Edge computing combined with
    AI, blockchain, and VR/AR. For AI, Edge computing can perform data preprocessing
    and share the computing of the cloud server and storage models. For blockchain
    technology, Edge computing solves the problems caused by a lack of computing power
    and available energy consumption for terminal devices to the blockchain. The data
    stored in the edge server can ensure the reliability and security of the data
    by using blockchain technology. For VR/AR, Edge computing primarily reduces the
    response time. Some programs on the terminal can be offloaded to the edge server,
    which makes VR/AR devices lighter; thus, the scope of use is expanded. We identified
    and discussed four open research challenges. This study provides information for
    future researchers to learn about the application of Edge computing in the agricultural
    field and advances the research to resolve the unaddressed issues. As the two
    important supports of the digital transformation of the industry, Edge computing
    and cloud computing will jointly promote the Agricultural IoT to create greater
    value in the aspects of network, business, application and intelligence. Most
    of the current research on edge computing is applied in fields such as smart cities
    and smart homes. Few scholars have studied the application of edge computing in
    agriculture. In the next step, we will focus on the difference between the program
    running under the edge computing and the cloud center, and study the program specifically
    applicable to the edge computing architecture to ensure the integrity, robustness
    and accuracy of the program under the edge computing environment. In the future,
    edge computing will have a broad market in the agricultural field. According to
    IDC forecasts, 50% of the Internet of Things with more than 50 billion terminals
    will face network bandwidth limitations, and 40% of data will need to be analyzed,
    processed and cached at the edge of the network. The size of the edge computing
    market will exceed trillions, and it will become an emerging market that is evenly
    matched with cloud computing. The vast market space of edge computing will bring
    unlimited imagination and new opportunities to agriculture. Authors Figures References

    \ devices connected to the internet has increased\nsigniﬁcantly. These devices\
    \ can interact with the external environment and with human beings\nthrough a\
    \ wide range of sensors that, perceiving reality through the digitization of some\
    \ parameters\nof interest, can provide an enormous amount of data. All this data\
    \ is then shared on the network with\nother devices and with different applications\
    \ and infrastructures. This dynamic and ever-changing\nworld underlies the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) paradigm. To date, countless applications based on IoT\nhave\
    \ been developed; think of Smart Cities, smart roads, and smart industries. This\
    \ article analyzes\nthe current architectures, technologies, protocols, and applications\
    \ that characterize the paradigm.\nKeywords: Internet of Things; machine to machine;\
    \ smart vehicle; e-health; smart building; smart\nhome; smart city; smart agriculture;\
    \ Industry 4.0\n1. Introduction\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm refers\
    \ to a system of devices, interconnected\nwith each other, equipped with computational\
    \ capacity (smart objects), identiﬁable and\nenabled to transfer data over a network,\
    \ without a required human interaction [1]. The con-\ncept behind this paradigm\
    \ is the pervasive presence of smart devices, which by cooperating\nwith each\
    \ other and interacting with human beings achieve common goals [2].\nAlthough\
    \ this technology has started to be widely used only in recent years, it is\n\
    possible to see traces of it already many years ago, even with theoretical hints.\
    \ To give an\nexample, in 1991, Mark Weiser wrote an article on ubiquitous computing:\
    \ it is a model\nof human–machine interaction in which information processing\
    \ is integrated within ev-\neryday objects rather than within individual personal\
    \ computers [3]. One of the ﬁrst real\napplications of a system similar to the\
    \ described above can be found in the industrial sector,\nwhere realized machines\
    \ were able to exchange information about their state independently.\nThese systems\
    \ were called machine to machine (M2M). The machines formed a closed\nsystem,\
    \ and the primary purpose of the information exchange was to make the monitoring\n\
    and management of the machines more efﬁcient and less expensive. Compared to the\n\
    current meaning of IoT, there was a lack of awareness of the potential that data\
    \ could\nprovide if reused in a broader context, for example, when aggregated\
    \ with other systems\nconnected through a network [4].\nThe term “Internet of\
    \ Things” was ﬁrst used in 1999 by Kevin Ashton during a Procter\nand Gamble presentation\
    \ [5]. In this presentation, Ashton explained the possible beneﬁts\nof using RFID\
    \ technology in goods management. By equipping the goods with special\ndevices,\
    \ they could “communicate” information of interest (status, traceability, etc.).\
    \ In this\nway, “things” and people could provide information about their status\
    \ and the surrounding\nworld, but in a much more efﬁcient way.\nThe actual birth\
    \ of the IoT dates back, according to Cisco estimates, to a period\nbetween 2008–2009,\
    \ when for the ﬁrst time, the number of connected objects exceeded\nInformation\
    \ 2021, 12, 87. https://doi.org/10.3390/info12020087\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/information\n\
    Information 2021, 12, 87\n2 of 20\nthe world population. In 2010, the number of\
    \ such objects had almost doubled compared\nto that time, reaching about 12.5\
    \ billion. Since those years, IoT, thanks to continuous\ntechnological developments\
    \ and considerable investments by companies, has become\nincreasingly widespread\
    \ in everyday life.\nAccording to IoT-analytics estimates, there are currently\
    \ about 20 billion connected\nobjects globally, and the IoT sector generates a\
    \ market of about $150 billion. In 2024,\nconnected objects will exceed 30 billion,\
    \ and the market value will be about 1 billion. As\nwith any new technology trend,\
    \ there are three possible categories of challenges for IoT to\novercome: business,\
    \ society, and technology [6–8].\nThe business ﬁeld’s challenges mainly concern\
    \ the identiﬁcation of the motivation to\nstart investing or not in a speciﬁc\
    \ product and the design of a business model to achieve\neconomic gain. In this\
    \ category, depending on the use and the type of customer, products\ncan be divided\
    \ into three categories:\n•\nConsumer IoT (smartphones, smart car, smartwatch,\
    \ etc.);\n•\nCommercial IoT (IoT Healthcare, Smart City, etc.);\n•\nIndustrial\
    \ IoT (includes various types of devices for industrial use).\nThe challenges\
    \ in society’s ﬁeld are to identify with the perspective of the customer\nwho\
    \ beneﬁts from a product. To do this, it is necessary to consider some elements\
    \ such as\nthe constant change of requirements and demands imposed by the customer,\
    \ the emergence\nof new devices, customer conﬁdence in speciﬁc brands and products,\
    \ and lack of knowledge\nof best practices in terms of privacy and security.\n\
    Although the current technologies that belong to the IoT domain can now be deﬁned\n\
    as advanced, several areas can be identiﬁed that need further development.\nIoT\
    \ needs minimal components to be integrated into everyday objects. The miniatur-\n\
    ization and integration of components itself is a ﬁeld that can expand with the\
    \ integration\nof silicon components into metallic or fabric materials. In addition,\
    \ there is a need for such\ncomponents to quickly harvest the necessary energy\
    \ from their surroundings and use it\nproﬁtably. Smart objects need to withstand\
    \ harsh conditions, be it humidity, temperature,\nor shock and vibration; for\
    \ their everyday use, they also need to be extremely reliable, and\nguarantee\
    \ very high and consistent quality. Another aspect that is often underestimated\
    \ is\nthe ability of smart devices to self-conﬁgure and organize themselves. Moreover,\
    \ it will be\nnecessary to ﬁnd standard protocols to identify objects uniquely.\
    \ Moreover, a critical ﬁeld\nconcerns security to ﬁnd solutions to secure connected\
    \ objects, preventing cyber-attacks\nthat can undermine the global growth of the\
    \ Internet of Things.\n2. Most Common IoT Architectures\nOne of the main challenges\
    \ to deal with the technological ﬁeld to promote the deploy-\nment of IoT systems\
    \ is to deﬁne a reference architecture that supports current features and\nfuture\
    \ extensions. For this reason, such an architecture must be [9]:\n•\nscalable,\
    \ in order to manage the increasing number of devices and services without\ndegrading\

    \ Three-Level Architecture \nA generic high-level architecture composed of three\
    \ layers has been introduced in \nthe literature [10]: \n• \nPerception, which\
    \ represents the physical layer of objects and groups all the features; \n• \n\
    Network, which represents the communication layer responsible for the transmission\
    \ \nof data to the application layer through various technologies and protocols;\
    \ \n• \nApplication, which represents the application layer in which the software\
    \ offering a \nspecific service is actually implemented. \n2.1.1. Perception Layer\
    \ \nThe perception layer represents the physical level of objects and interacts\
    \ with the \nsurrounding environment by collecting and processing information.\
    \ This level includes \nobjects that, being able to interact with the external\
    \ world and being equipped with com-\nputing capabilities, become in a certain\
    \ sense “intelligent” or “smart”, where smart refers \nto the technological aspects\
    \ (the smart technologies used), while intelligent refers to the \nfunctional\
    \ aspects (self-identification, self-diagnosis, self-testing, etc.) of the sensor\
    \ [9,10]. \nThese smart objects, which are the fundamental blocks on which the\
    \ IoT is based, can \nbe objects of common usage (a refrigerator, a television,\
    \ a car, etc.) or simple devices \nequipped with sensors and computing capabilities.\
    \ In general, smart objects are equipped \nwith the following essential properties\
    \ [12,13]: \n• \nCommunication: objects can connect to each other and to resources\
    \ on the Internet to \nuse data and services, update their status, and cooperate\
    \ to achieve common goals; \n• \nIdentification: objects must be uniquely identified.\
    \ \nDepending on the specific application, one or more of the following properties\
    \ may \nalso be added: \n• \nAddressability: objects can be directly reachable,\
    \ i.e., addressed, to be interrogated \nand/or configured remotely; \nFigure 1.\

    \ Network Layer\nThe network layer has the task of transporting the data provided\
    \ by the perception\nlevel to the application layer. It includes all the technologies\
    \ and protocols that make this\nconnection possible and should not be confused\
    \ with the network layer of the ISO/OSI\nmodel, which only routes data within\
    \ the network along the best path [9].\nThere are a large number of protocols\
    \ that can be used in IoT. Table 2 shows some\nof the most used protocols, grouped\
    \ according to the ISO/OSI model. Each of them has\npros and cons, and the use\
    \ must be evaluated according to the application. For example,\nthe IPv6 protocol\
    \ was born ﬁrst to solve the problem of addressing space (which with\nthe old\
    \ IPv4 protocol was about to run out) and then to ensure scalability for the systems.\n\
    However, this protocol is designed for wired networks. To meet wireless sensor\
    \ networks\n(Wireless Sensor Network or WSN), the 6LoWPAN protocol [11] was created.\
    \ WSN is, in\nfact, composed of devices characterized by low computational power\
    \ that often have to\nminimize energy consumption. In this way (with the 6LoWPAN\
    \ protocol), the devices\ncan directly overlook the network without needing other\
    \ devices that act as gateways.\nIn speciﬁc applications, however, such gateways\
    \ may be necessary. In these cases, it is\npossible to use data link layer protocols,\
    \ such as Bluetooth or ZigBee, to connect gateways\nand sensors, and then only\
    \ interface the gateway to the network using the IPv6 protocol\nnetwork layer.\n\
    In this layer, wireless protocols are particularly important. Compared to those\
    \ requir-\ning cables, wireless sensors can be installed in hard-to-reach environments\
    \ and require less\nmaterial and human resources for installation. Additionally,\
    \ in a wireless sensor network,\nthe various nodes can be added or removed easily,\
    \ and their location can be changed\nwithout reconsidering the structure of the\
    \ entire network. The choice of a protocol to use\ndepends on the network’s size,\
    \ the power consumption of each node, and the transmission\nspeed needed in a\
    \ given application.\nIn other applications, however, it may be necessary to build\
    \ a wired network. The latter\nenjoys more excellent reliability and higher transmission\
    \ rates [14]. To give an example,\nit is possible to think of a vehicle’s internal\
    \ network that connects the various Electronic\nControl Units (ECU) that control\
    \ the mechanical parts of the car (steering, brake, etc.). In\nthis case, it is\
    \ essential to have a reliable and fast network, because delays or malfunctions\n\
    could have severe consequences for the people on board the car.\nInformation 2021,\

    \ layer includes all the software necessary to offer a speciﬁc service. In\nthis\
    \ level, the data from the previous levels are stored, aggregated, ﬁltered, and\
    \ processed,\nand databases, analysis software, etc., are used. As a result of\
    \ this processing process, the\ndata is made available to real IoT applications\
    \ (smart wearable, smart car, etc.). This is\noften done using certain software\
    \ deﬁned as middleware, which has the task of hiding the\nheterogeneity of the\
    \ underlying layers. Some software technologies currently widely used\nto manage\
    \ the vast amount of data provided by devices are:\n•\nCloud computing, where\
    \ services such as storage or data processing are provided\nfrom a set of pre-existing\
    \ resources, conﬁgurable and remotely available in the form\nof distributed architecture;\n\
    •\nEdge computing, where data processing is partially distributed on the peripheral\n\
    nodes of the network to increase the performance of IoT systems.\nThe management\
    \ of the format of the data to be processed also belongs to this level.\nThese\
    \ can be of type [11]:\n•\nbinary-based, small size but not readable by human\
    \ beings;\n•\ntext-based, larger size but readable by human beings.\nAmong the\
    \ many commercial platforms used for implementing IoT applications, some\nexamples\
    \ are Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Xively, Firefox WebThings Gateway, etc.\n2.2.\
    \ Service-Oriented Based Architecture\nThe last architecture presented is service-oriented\
    \ based architecture. In general,\nservice-oriented architecture (SoA) is a component-model\
    \ based, which can be designed to\nconnect different functional units of applications\
    \ though interfaces and protocols [15,16].\nSoA is designed to coordinate services\
    \ and enable the reuse of software and hardware\ncomponents. SoA can be easily\
    \ integrated into IoT architecture, extending the three-layer\narchitecture, adding\
    \ a new layer between network layer and application layer, called thes\nservice\
    \ layer, which provide services to support the application layer. This represents\
    \ the\nfour-layer SoA-Based IoT architecture, in which there are the perception\
    \ layer, the network\nlayer, the service layer, and ﬁnally the application layer.\
    \ Here there is a new layer that\nintegrates the SoA functionalities [17,18],\
    \ and it is different from previously described\narchitecture. The service layer\
    \ consists of service discovery, service composition, service\nmanagement, and\
    \ service interfaces. Service discovery is used to discover the service\nrequests;\
    \ service composition is used to interact with the connected objects and integrate\n\
    services to get the requests in an efﬁcient way; service management is used to\
    \ manage and\nInformation 2021, 12, 87\n6 of 20\ndetermine the trust mechanisms\
    \ to understand the service requests; service interfaces are\nused to support\
    \ interactions among all provided services.\n2.3. Middleware Architecture\nAnother\
    \ important and very common architecture in IoT is middleware based IoT\narchitecture\
    \ or ﬁve-layer architecture [19]. In the recent years, the proposed architecture\n\
    for IoT needs to address many factors like scalability, interoperability, reliability,\
    \ QoS,\netc. In this regard, middleware based IoT architectures assist in creating\
    \ applications\nmore efﬁciently; this layer acts as a connection between applications,\
    \ data, and users. In\nfact, IoT development depends on the technology progress\
    \ and design of various new\napplications and business models [20]. To allow these\
    \ characteristics and many others, a\nﬁve-layer architecture has been proposed,\
    \ which is composed of ﬁve levels: perception\nlayer, network layer, middleware\
    \ layer, application layer, and business layer. In particular,\nthe middleware\
    \ layer has some critical functionalities, such as aggregating and ﬁltering the\n\
    received data from the hardware devices, performing information discovery, and\
    \ providing\naccess control to the devices for applications.\nIn general, middleware\
    \ is a software or service programming that can provide an\nabstraction interposed\
    \ between IoT technologies and applications. In middleware the\ndetails of different\
    \ technologies are hidden, and the standard interfaces are provided to\nenable\
    \ developers to focus on the development of applications without considering the\n\
    compatibility between applications and infrastructures. The middleware is gaining\
    \ more\nand more importance in the last years due to its major role in simplifying\
    \ the development\nof new services and the integration of legacy technologies\
    \ into new ones. This excepts the\nprogrammer from the exact knowledge of the\
    \ variegate set of technologies adopted by the\nlower layers. Advantages are:\n\
    1.\nSupport on various applications;\n2.\nRuns on various operating systems and\
    \ platforms;\n3.\nDistributed computing and the interaction of services among\
    \ heterogeneous networks,\ndevices, and applications;\n4.\nSupport standard protocols;\n\
    5.\nProvides standard interfaces, providing portability and standard protocols\
    \ to enable\ninteroperability, and making middleware play an important role in\
    \ standardization;\n6.\nProvides a stable high-level interface for applications.\n\
    2.4. Other Used Architectures\nThe high-level architecture just described provides\
    \ a simple and general overview of\nan IoT project’s structure and has been described\
    \ in more detail to provide an overview of\nthe leading technologies and protocols\
    \ used in IoT. Depending on the application, however,\nit could be necessary to\
    \ add additional layers or adapt the architecture to the speciﬁc\napplication\
    \ to realize.\nIn particular, there are two different architectures: the architectures\
    \ belonging to\nthe ﬁrst class are obtained by adapting to the context of IoT\
    \ existing architectures; the\narchitectures belonging to the second class are\
    \ built from scratch. Some examples of\narchitectures can be seen in Table 3.\n\

    \ (right). \nDue to the scarcity of computational resources and the heterogeneity\
    \ of devices and \ntraffic, new protocols have been introduced that have replaced\
    \ or flanked the TCP/IP stack \nprotocols. \nIn particular, instead of the application-level\
    \ protocols of the TCP/IP stack, the Con-\nstrained Application Protocol (CoAP)\
    \ is used, which represents a lightweight version of \nthe Hypertext Transfer\
    \ Protocol (HTTP), suitable to working with devices and sensors \nwith limited\
    \ resources. CoAP also uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) at the transport\

    \ CoAP also uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) at the transport level,\nwhich,\
    \ compared to the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) used by HTTP, offers fewer\n\
    services but is much lighter [21]. Finally, a layer is added (adaptation layer)\
    \ in which the\nIPv6 packet headers, using the IPv6 over Low Power Wireless Personal\
    \ Area Network\n(6LoWPAN) protocol, are encapsulated and compressed so that devices\
    \ can manage them\nwith little computing power. These protocols will be discussed\
    \ in detail in the next section.\n2.4.2. Server-Based Architecture\nIn this type\
    \ of architecture, the various devices are connected to a gateway server that\n\
    manages the devices’ connection to the Internet, shown in Figure 3.\nThe main\
    \ difference from the architecture described above is that the devices are\nnot\
    \ directly accessible and only look at the Internet through the gateway. In this\
    \ way,\nthe constraints given by the scarcity of computational resources and heterogeneity\
    \ must\nbe managed only at the lowest level, where the connection between the\
    \ devices and the\ngateway itself is implemented. At the higher level, the standard\
    \ protocols of the TCP/IP\nstack can be used.\nInformation 2021, 12, 87\n8 of\

    \ TCP/IP stack \ncan be used. \n2.4.3. Cloud-Based Architectures \nIn this type\
    \ of architecture, the large amount of data generated by objects is stored, \n\
    processed, and presented to the user through services made available from the\
    \ cloud [22] \nThere are many architectures of this type realized by various companies\
    \ such as AWS by \nAmazon, Azure by Microsoft, Xively by Google, etc. In this\
    \ paper, the Amazon AWS ar-\nchitecture will be illustrated [23]. \nAWS consists\
    \ of four main elements: The Device Gateway, the Registry, the Rules \nEngine,\
    \ and the Device Shadow. The Device Gateway acts as an intermediary between the\
    \ \nconnected devices and the cloud services through the Message Queue Telemetry\
    \ \nTransport (MTTQ) protocol. MTTQ is a lightweight, publish–subscribe messaging\
    \ proto-\ncol designed for situations where low power consumption is required,\
    \ and the available \nbandwidth is limited. Security between devices is ensured\
    \ by using the Transport Layer \nSecurity (TLS) protocol. The Rules Engine processes\
    \ incoming messages and distributes \nthem to other devices or cloud services.\
    \ The Registry is responsible for assigning a unique \nID to each connected device,\
    \ regardless of device type, vendor, or connection mode. Ad-\nditionally, it is\
    \ responsible for storing metadata about connected devices in order to track \n\
    them. Device Shadows are virtual representations of physical objects. These representa-\n\
    tions are persistent and stored in the cloud to be accessed at any time (even\
    \ when the \ndevice is offline) by cloud services or other devices. \nFigure 3.\

    \ services or other devices.\n2.4.4. Edge Computing-Based Architectures\nNowadays,\
    \ the concept of IoT is often placed side by side with Edge Computing.\nHowever,\
    \ Edge Computing represents the future of IoT, because it has been proposed\n\
    to be integrated with IoT to enable computing services devices, aiming to increase\
    \ the\nperformance and resilience of services [24]. Edge Computing is a horizontal\
    \ architecture\nthat provides distributed computing, data storage, and control\
    \ capabilities. It interferes\nbetween cloud structures and end users to make\
    \ available ﬁles and resources that are\nusually accessible only through a network\
    \ connection. Thanks to the advantage of dis-\ntributed architecture, Edge Computing\
    \ can provide faster response and greater quality of\nservice [25]. Building an\
    \ architecture based on Edge Computing may have more beneﬁts:\n•\nMinimizes latency;\
    \ many actions are taken very close to where the action is;\n•\nAllows for bandwidth\
    \ saving, avoiding over dimensioning the band to the Cloud;\n•\nSolves some security\
    \ issues, because many decisions are taken in a subnet and are not\nexposed to\
    \ the risks arising from the external Internet.\nThe Edge Computing applications\
    \ are multiple and differentiated, and it is possible to\nmonitor or analyze in\
    \ real time network data of industrial devices. It can be possible, for\nInformation\
    \ 2021, 12, 87\n9 of 20\nexample, to have actions machine to machine (M2M), perform\
    \ actions on other machines or\nHuman Machine Interaction (HMI), launch alerts,\
    \ and report to specific users. In Figure 4,\nthere is an example of fog/edge\
    \ computing architecture:\n \n[25]. Building an architecture based on Edge Computing\
    \ may have more benefits: \n• \nMinimizes latency; many actions are taken very\
    \ close to where the action is; \n• \nAllows for bandwidth saving, avoiding over\
    \ dimensioning the band to the Cloud; \n• \nSolves some security issues, because\

    \ 4, there is an example of fog/edge computing architecture: \n \nFigure 4. Edge\
    \ Computing-based architecture. \nThe problems related to data transmission delays\
    \ and security in data management \nhave led to the development of Edge Computing\

    \ also include Software Deﬁned Networking (SDN) based approaches. Machine\nlearning\
    \ based architectures include Transferring Trained Models (TTM) and Hierarchical\n\
    Fog-Assisted Computing Architecture (HiCH). There are architectures oriented to\
    \ data\nplacement strategy; a remarkable example are those dedicated to Fog infrastructures,\n\
    architectures that are oriented to Big Data processing. Finally, there are orchestration-based\n\
    architectures that contain SDN-based architectures and architectures based on\
    \ Cloudlet\nand Fog Computing.\nToday, challenges facing Edge Computing in IoT\
    \ are made possible by the advent\nof new communication technologies and hardware,\
    \ such as 5G, and the components of\nmodern IoT devices, which are becoming smaller\
    \ and performing.\nInformation 2021, 12, 87\n10 of 20\n2.4.5. Social Internet\
    \ of Things Architecture\nIn a social network based IoT architectures (or SIoT),\
    \ objects are listed on a social\nplatform creating groups and relationships (as\
    \ in a traditional social network) in order to\nprovide certain services [27].\
    \ Such an approach has some advantages:\n•\nThe structure of SIoT can be modeled\
    \ to ensure the navigability of the network. The\ndiscovery of objects and services\
    \ can be performed effectively, and the scalability is\nalso guaranteed, as in\
    \ the case of social networks formed by people;\n•\nA level of reliability can\
    \ be deﬁned to establish the degree of interaction with objects;\n•\nThe models\
    \ developed for the study of typical social networks made up of people can\nbe\
    \ reused.\nIn this architecture, it is possible to see three main elements: the\
    \ SIoT server, the\ngateway, and the objects. Each of the elements can be composed\
    \ of three layers: sensing (or\nperception), network, and application. These have\
    \ similar functionalities to those described\nin the high-level architecture.\
    \ The server is responsible for managing and storing data (base\nsub-layer), providing\
    \ the main functionalities of the siot system (component sub-layer),\nand offering\
    \ interfaces for objects and people (interface sub-layer).\nIn general, the gateway\
    \ only transfers data between different networks, but depending\non the objects\
    \ it has to manage, it may have a set of features covering all three layers. On\
    \ the\nother hand, the objects have only the task of collecting data from the\
    \ surrounding domain,\nbut, as in smartphones, for example, they could also perform\
    \ higher-level functions.\n3. The Enabling Technologies and Most Common Protocols\n\
    The IoT concept in the real world can be realized through the integration of several\n\
    enabling technologies. In this section, the most relevant enabling technologies\
    \ for IoT are\npresented, focusing on the different layers listed above. At the\
    \ bottom of all architecture,\nwe can ﬁnd the perception layer, which contains\
    \ all physical devices and objects: in this\nlayer, the main function is to identify\
    \ and track objects. To achieve this function, several\ntechnologies can be implemented:\
    \ one on the most common ones for this layer is RFID,\nused to identify and track\
    \ objects without contact. It supports data exchange via radio\nsignals over a\
    \ short distance [28,29], and it works through RFID tag, RFID reader, and\nantenna\
    \ [30]. Tags are characterized by a unique identiﬁer and are applied to objects;\n\
    readers trigger the tag transmission by generating an appropriate signal, which\
    \ represents\na query for the possible presence of tags in the surrounding area\
    \ and for the reception\nof their IDs. Each RFID tag is attached in an object\
    \ and has its unique identiﬁcation\nnumber. An RFID reader can identify an object\
    \ and obtain the corresponding information\nby querying the attached RFID tag\
    \ through appropriate signals. RFID can be useful in the\nperception layer of\
    \ IoT to identify and track objects and exchange information. Another\nimportant\
    \ category of technologies is the wireless sensor network, which can monitor and\n\
    track the status of devices and transmit the status data to the control center\
    \ or sink nodes\nvia multiple hops [31,32]. Sensor networks consist of a certain\
    \ number (which can be very\nhigh) of sensing nodes communicating in a wireless\
    \ multi-hop fashion; the collected data\nare analyzed to take speciﬁc actions\
    \ based on required services. The IoT sensors can be\nsmart sensors, actuators,\
    \ or wearable sensing devices. Other technologies are: Single Board\nComputers\
    \ (SBCs) integrated with sensors and built-in TCP/IP and security functionalities,\n\
    which are typically used to realize IoT products (e.g., Arduino Yun, Raspberry\
    \ PI, Beagle\nBone Black, etc.); and RFID sensor network (RSN), which has the\
    \ possibility of supporting\nsensing, computing, and communication capabilities\
    \ in a passive system.\nIn the middle of IoT architecture we can ﬁnd the network\
    \ layer, which is used to\ndeﬁne routing and provide data transmission support\
    \ through integrated heterogeneous\nnetworks. Examples of communication protocols\
    \ used for the IoT are Wi-Fi, Bluetooth,\nIEEE 802.15.4, Z-wave, and LTE-Advanced.\
    \ Some speciﬁc communication technologies\nalso used are RFID, Near Field Communication\
    \ (NFC), and ultra-wide bandwidth (UWB).\nRFID is the ﬁrst technology used to\
    \ realize the M2M concept (RFID tag and reader): the\nRFID reader transmits a\
    \ query signal to the tag and receives reﬂected signal from it,\nInformation 2021,\
    \ 12, 87\n11 of 20\nwhich in turn is passed to the database, and it identiﬁes\
    \ objects based on the reﬂected\nsignals [33]. RFID tags can be active, passive,\
    \ or semi-passive/active, and they have a\nrange from 10 cm to 200 m. The NFC\
    \ works at high frequency band at 13.56 MHz and\nsupports data rate up to 424\
    \ kbps; the applicable range is up to 10 cm [34]. The UWB\ncommunication technology\
    \ is designed to support communications within a low range\ncoverage area using\
    \ low energy and high bandwidth, whose applications to connect sensors\nhave been\
    \ increased recently [35]. Another communication technology is Wi-Fi that uses\n\
    radio waves to exchange data among things within 100 m range [36]. Bluetooth presents\n\
    a communication technology that is used to exchange data between devices over\
    \ short\ndistances using short-wavelength radio to minimize power consumption\
    \ [37]. Bluetooth\nspecial interest group (SIG) produced Bluetooth 4.1, which\
    \ provides Bluetooth Low Energy\nas well as high-speed and IP connectivity to\
    \ support IoT. LTE (Long-Term Evolution) is\noriginally a standard wireless communication,\
    \ and it can cover fast-travelling devices\nand provide multicasting and broadcasting\
    \ services. LTE-A (LTE Advanced) [38] is an\nimproved version of LTE including\
    \ bandwidth extension, which supports up to 100 MHz,\ndownlink and uplink spatial\
    \ multiplexing, extended coverage, higher throughput, and\nlower latencies.\n\
    In many architectures, it can be possible to ﬁnd a service layer such as SoA-based\n\
    architecture. The service layer is located between the network layer and the application\n\
    layer and provides efﬁcient and secure services to objects or applications. In\
    \ the service\nlayer, the following enabling technologies should be included to\
    \ ensure that the service can\nbe provided efﬁciently: interface technology, service\
    \ management technology, middleware\ntechnology, and resource management and sharing\
    \ technology. The interface technology\nmust be designed in the service layer\
    \ to ensure the efﬁcient and secure information ex-\nchange for communications\
    \ among devices and applications. To support applications in\nIoT, an interface\
    \ proﬁle (IFP) can be considered as a service standard, which can be used to\n\
    facilitate the interactions among services provided by various devices or applications.\
    \ To\nachieve an efﬁcient IFP, universal plug and play should be implemented [39,40].\
    \ Service\nmanagement can effectively discover the devices and applications, and\
    \ schedule efﬁcient\nand reliable services to meet requests. A service can be\
    \ considered as an integrated ap-\nplication, including collection, exchanging,\
    \ and storage of data, or an association of these\nbehaviors to achieve a special\
    \ objective [41].\nVarious heterogeneous networks are integrated to provide data\
    \ delivery for all appli-\ncations in IoT (smart transportation, smart grid, etc.).\
    \ To reduce the cost, some applications\ncan share part of the network resources\
    \ to increase their utilization. In this case, ensuring\nthat information requested\
    \ by various applications is delivered on time is a challenging\nissue in IoT.\
    \ Existing resource sharing mechanisms primarily focus on the spectrum shar-\n\
    ing, which is used to efﬁciently coordinate multiple networks in the same frequency\
    \ to\nmaximize the utilization of network resources [42,43].\nApplications are\
    \ on the top of the architecture, exporting all the system’s functionali-\nties\
    \ to the ﬁnal user. However, this layer is not considered to be part of the middleware,\n\
    but exploits all the functionalities of the middleware layer. Using standard web\
    \ service\nprotocols and service composition technologies, applications can realize\
    \ a perfect integra-\ntion between distributed systems and applications. Many\
    \ IoT standards are proposed to\nfacilitate and simplify application programmers’\
    \ and service providers’ jobs. Different\ngroups have been created to provide\
    \ protocols in support of the IoT. In this paragraph,\nsome of the most common\
    \ protocols that can enable a reliable and secure communication\nin IoT are presented\
    \ as shown in Table 4 [44,45].\nInformation 2021, 12, 87\n12 of 20\nTable 4. Most\

    \ for the physical layer and the MAC layer in\nwireless personal area networks\
    \ (WPANs). This protocol is used to focus on low-rate\nWPANs, providing low rate\
    \ connections of all things in a personal area with low\nenergy consumption, low\
    \ rate transmission, and low cost [46].\n•\nLow-power WPANs (LoWPANs) are organized\
    \ by many low-cost devices connected\nvia wireless communications (Tan and Koo\
    \ 2014). In comparison with other types of\nnetworks, LoWPAN has several advantages\
    \ (small packet sizes, low power, low band-\nwidth, etc.). 6LoWPAN protocol (an\
    \ enhancement of LoWPANs), designed combining\nIPv6 and LoWPAN, has several advantages:\
    \ great connectivity and compatibility with\nlegacy architectures, low-energy\
    \ consumption, ad-hoc self-organization, etc.\n•\nZigBee is a wireless network\
    \ technology, designed for short-term communication\nwith low-energy consumption\
    \ and great reliability. In ZigBee protocol, ﬁve layers\nare included: physical\
    \ layer, MAC layer, transmission layer, network layer, and\napplication layer.\n\
    •\nThe main objective of Z-wave is to provide reliable transmission between a\
    \ control unit\nand one or more end-devices; Z-wave is suitable for networks with\
    \ low bandwidth.\nAlthough both ZigBee and Z-wave support the shortrange wireless\
    \ communication\nwith low cost and low energy consumption, there are some differences\
    \ between them.\n•\nLoRaWAN is a cloud-based MAC (Media Access Control) layer\
    \ protocol but primarily\nserves as a network layer protocol for managing communications\
    \ between LPWAN\n(Low Power Wide Area Network) gateways and end-node devices such\
    \ as routing\nprotocol, managed by LoRa Alliance. Version 1.0 of the LoRaWAN speciﬁcation\
    \ was\nreleased in June 2015. LoRaWAN deﬁnes the communication protocol and system\n\
    architecture for the network, while the physical LoRa layer allows long-range\
    \ commu-\nnication link. LoRaWAN is also responsible for managing communication\
    \ frequencies,\ndata rates, and power for all devices. Devices in the network\
    \ are asynchronous and\ntransmit when they have data available for sending. Data\
    \ transmitted by a device\n(called an endpoint) are received by multiple gateways,\
    \ which forward data pack-\nets to a centralized network server (or network server).\
    \ The network server ﬁlters\nout duplicate packets, performs security checks,\
    \ and manages the network. Data\nare then forwarded to the application servers.\
    \ The technology shows high reliabil-\nity for moderate load; however, it does\
    \ present some performance issues related to\nsending acknowledgments.\n•\nThe\
    \ Sigfox standard is based on ultra narrow band RF communication with very\nlow\
    \ consumption. It takes advantage of the 868 MHz frequency and is not subject\
    \ to\nconcessions. The possible applications are countless: for example, the remote\
    \ detection\nof sensors and meters.\n•\nNarrowband Internet of Things is an LPWAN\
    \ radio technology standard developed\nby 3GPP to enable communication for a wide\
    \ range of cellular devices and services,\nInformation 2021, 12, 87\n13 of 20\n\
    the speciﬁcations of which were frozen in 3GPP Release 13, in June 2016. Other\
    \ 3GPP\nIoT technologies include eMTC and EC-GSM-IoT.\n•\nMessage Queue Telemetry\
    \ Transport (MQTT) uses a publish/subscribe technique: it\nis a messaging protocol,\
    \ which is used to collect measured data on remote sensors and\ntransmit them\
    \ to servers. MQTT is a simple and lightweight protocol and supports\nnetworks\
    \ with low bandwidth and high latency.\n•\nConstrained Application Protocol (CoAP)\
    \ is a messaging protocol based on represen-\ntational state transfer (REST) architecture\
    \ [47,48]. CoAP has been proposed to modify\nsome HTTP functions to meet the requirements\
    \ for IoT; in fact, it is an application layer\nprotocol in the 6LoWPAN protocol\
    \ stack and aims to enable resources constrained\ndevices to achieve RESTful interactions.\n\
    •\nExtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is an instant messaging protocol\n\
    based on XML streaming protocols. XMPP inherits features from XML protocol, so\n\
    it has great scalability, addressing, and security capabilities, and it can be\
    \ used for\nmultiparty chatting, voice and video streaming, and tele-presence.\n\
    •\nData distribution service (DDS) is a publish/subscribe protocol for supporting\
    \ high\nperformance device-to-device communication. DDS has been developed by\
    \ object-\nmanage-group and is a data centric protocol, in which multicasting\
    \ can be supported\nto achieve great QoS and high reliability.\n•\nAdvanced Message\
    \ Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is an open standard message queuing\nprotocol used to\
    \ provide message service (queuing, routing, security, reliability, etc.)\nin\
    \ the application layer; it focuses on message-oriented environments and can be\n\
    considered as a message-oriented middleware protocol.\n4. Applications in IoT\n\
    As said previously, there are many applications ﬁeld of the IoT like Big Data,\
    \ Cloud\nComputing, health care, Smart City, Smart Home, Smart Grid, mobile application,\
    \ cyber\nindustries, Smart Agriculture, automotives, and many others.\nThe importance\
    \ of IoT has gone established with time, especially for those applica-\ntions\
    \ natively interconnected such as mobile application, and it lends itself to all\
    \ those\npervasive/ubiquitous computing applications [49]. In fact, there is often\
    \ confusion be-\ntween the concept of IoT and Context-Aware Computing, because\
    \ they seem closely linked.\nAlthough these two concepts are often used simultaneously,\
    \ they remain two separate\nthings. IoT is one of the enabling technologies of\
    \ context-aware computing, and today, a\nlarge number of IoT-based pervasive systems\
    \ take advantage of Context-Awareness as a\ncore feature [50–52].\nAnother important\
    \ paradigm that ﬁts with the IoT is Industry 4.0, which represents the\ncurrent\
    \ trend of automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies. Industry\n\
    4.0 includes cyber–physical systems, the Internet of things, and Cloud Computing.\
    \ Today,\nseveral research works explain this concept. Indeed, Guo-jian Cheng\
    \ et al. talk about In-\ndustry 4.0 Development and its application for intelligent\
    \ manufacturing [53]. This concept\nis strict in relationship with IoT, because\
    \ to realize the vision of cyber–physical systems,\nit iss necessary that all\
    \ systems are interconnected over the network, and IoT provides\nthe right technology\
    \ base. As highlighted by the EU Framework Program for Research\nand Innovation\
    \ (HORIZON 2020) (Horizon 2020 is the ﬁnancial instrument implementing\nthe Innovation\
    \ Union, a Europe 2020 ﬂagship initiative aimed at securing Europe’s global\n\
    competitiveness.), many funds will be invested by the European community in IoT\
    \ and\nIndustry 4.0, because this will soon represent a sure source of work for\
    \ companies [54].\nThe concept of IoT is often associated with Smart City and\
    \ Smart Home. In fact,\nSmart City has deﬁned as an urban development vision that\
    \ integrate multiple information\nand communication technologies to improve the\
    \ quality of life [55]. The assets that are\nincluded and managed in this vision\
    \ are multiple; for example, we can consider local\ndepartments information systems,\
    \ schools, libraries, transportation systems, hospitals,\npower plants, water\
    \ supply networks, waste management, and law enforcement. Smart\nInformation 2021,\
    \ 12, 87\n14 of 20\nHome is deﬁned as a modern home that has appliances, lighting,\
    \ and/or electronic devices\nthat can be controlled remotely by the owner, often\
    \ through mobile. As evidence, these\ntwo concepts integrate with the IoT paradigm\
    \ and are enabled by it. K. E. Skouby and P.\nLynggaard suggest a four-layer model\
    \ that joins and interfaces these elements by deploying\ntechnologies such as\
    \ 5G, Internet of Things, Cloud of Things, and distributed artiﬁcial\nintelligence\
    \ [56]. Talari et al. provide an inclusive review on the concept of the smart\n\
    city besides their different applications, beneﬁts, and advantages. In this work,\
    \ it can be\npossible ﬁnd a review of IoT technologies and their capabilities\
    \ to merge into and apply to\nthe different parts of smart cities [57].\n5G represents\
    \ a new era technology that will allow us to surf at speeds much higher\nthan\
    \ the current ones; in fact, if 4G technology provided an average of 10 Mbps per\
    \ user,\n5G will make us navigate at a minimum of 100 Mbps [58]. This will certainly\
    \ give more\npossibilities for mobile devices and a greater impetus to the development\
    \ of new planning\nstrategies such as smart cities and all that follows, such\
    \ as having more and more objects\nconnected to each other and able to exchange\
    \ information. Obviously, this great range of\nadditional opportunities is undoubtedly\
    \ a great point in favor of this technology.\nAnother important and challenging\
    \ application for IoT is the Smart Grid system. The\nSmart Grid aims to use energy\
    \ power in a safe and correct way in which the power supply\nsystem can distribute\
    \ electricity avoiding waste. For these reasons, today the use of Smart\nGrid\
    \ and Smart Micro Grid is very widespread. An example of this application is presented\n\
    by Clarizia et al., who proposed an architecture of a real-time energy management\
    \ system\nthat provides several Smart Meters [59]. This application monitors connected\
    \ loads and\ncommunicate with a Smart Concentrator via CAN Bus that stores the\
    \ data forwarded from\na single Smart Meter, in order to make this information\
    \ available for http request/response.\nLi et al. present the design and implementation\
    \ of a novel co-simulator and evaluate the\neffectively IoT-aided algorithms for\
    \ scheduling the jobs of electrical appliances [60].\nDuring last year, health\
    \ care support systems are growing up, and these are essential\nfor the medical\
    \ support, with an IoT communication framework as the main enabler\nfor distributed\
    \ worldwide health care applications. Vitali and Pernici have proposed an\napproach\
    \ to a health-care scenario enriched with IoT devices; these techniques allow\
    \ the\ndiscovery of interconnections between processes and external factors which\
    \ have an impact\non them [61]. Ahouandjinou et al. have explored the opportunities\
    \ for IoT to realize the\nvision of the future of health care to attainment a\
    \ new monitoring status system for patients\nof the Intensive Care Unit (ICU),\
    \ to improve medical care service performances [62].\nToday, to support IoT, it\
    \ is important to consider all the substructures that are used to\nsupport the\
    \ IoT devices. In particular, Cloud Computing is one of technologies that is more\n\
    applied and better lends itself to be used in IoT. It is important for example\
    \ for data storing\nand sharing between various IoT devices, such as communication\
    \ from and to sensor and\nactuator or mobile device. Galache et al. presents the\
    \ Cloud project, whose main aim is\nmaking citizens aware of city resources and\
    \ helping them to use and care these resources\nby means of smart IoT services\
    \ in the Cloud [63]. Carrillo et al. present a framework\nused to provide the\
    \ needed computational power to the Smart Building by using Cloud\nComputing to\
    \ have all computational power as well as control monitor capabilities in the\n\
    cloud [64].\nAs its deﬁnition, Big Data represents large and complex data sets,\
    \ which include\nanalysis, capture, data curation, search, sharing, storage, transfer,\
    \ visualization, querying,\nupdating, and information privacy. In last few years,\
    \ the IoT challenge consists in managing\nand analyzing the entire large amount\
    \ of data generated by sensors all around the world.\nThis is the reason why the\
    \ concept of Big Data is often associated with that of IoT. Sezer\net al. propose\
    \ a combined framework that brings Big Data, IoT, and semantic web together\n\
    to build an augmented framework. They provide a realistic use case that demonstrates\n\
    how the model can implement the desired functionality and achieve the goals of\
    \ such\na model [65]. Bashir et al. present an IoT Big Data Analytics IBDA framework\
    \ for the\nInformation 2021, 12, 87\n15 of 20\nstorage and analysis of real time\
    \ data generated from IoT sensors deployed inside the\nsmart building, developed\
    \ by using Python and the Big Data Cloudera platform [66].\nAnother important\
    \ concept associated with IoT is Smart Agriculture. Starting from\nconcept of\
    \ precision agriculture, that is an integrated system of methodologies and tech-\n\
    nologies designed to increase crop production, quality, and productivity of a\
    \ farm, we\nhave the deﬁnition of Smart Agriculture. It is based on the aim “do\
    \ the right thing, in the\nright place at the right time, with the right amount”,\
    \ respecting the real needs of plants.\nIndeed, it deﬁnes the scope of application\
    \ solutions aimed at the monitoring, management,\nand optimization of different\
    \ processes related to agriculture. Baranwal et al. propose an\nintegrated approach\
    \ based on IoT device, capable of analyzing the sensed information and\nthen transmitting\
    \ it to the user [67]. This device can be controlled and monitored from re-\n\
    mote location, and it can be implemented in agricultural ﬁelds, grain stores,\
    \ and cold stores\nfor security purpose. This study is oriented to accentuate\
    \ the methods to solve problems\nlike identiﬁcation of rodents, threats to crops,\
    \ and delivering real time notiﬁcation based on\ninformation analysis and processing\
    \ without human intervention. Kapoor et al. describe\nan approach to combine loT\
    \ and image processing to determine the environmental factor\nor man-made factor\
    \ (pesticides/fertilizers), which is speciﬁcally hindering the growth of\nthe\
    \ plant [68].\nNo less important than the previous ones are the Blockchains. Blockchains\
    \ represent\nthe reference infrastructure for the operation of this network of\
    \ “intelligent objects”. Many\nthink that distributed trust technology is the\
    \ only technology capable of ensuring scalability,\nrespect for privacy, and reliability\
    \ for growing IoT environments [69,70].\nBlockchains are a candidate for the role\
    \ of key application for the IoT. The technology\nin question can be used to track\
    \ billions of connected devices, allowing the processing of\nthe transactions\
    \ they produce and the coordination between physical devices. This decen-\ntralized\
    \ approach would eliminate the failure points of traditional networks, facilitating\n\
    the creation of a more resilient ecosystem in which smart devices can operate.\
    \ Furthermore,\nthe cryptographic algorithms used by Blockchains would allow to\
    \ increase the protection\nof private consumer data [71].\nOne of the most interesting\
    \ applications is the Cognitive IoT based on Blockchain as\nshown in [72]. Cognitive\
    \ IoT is the use of cognitive computing technologies in combination\nwith data\
    \ generated by connected devices and the actions those devices can perform [73,74].\n\
    In this way, in a computer, system understanding means being able to take in large\
    \ volumes\nof both structured and unstructured data and derive meaning from them—that\
    \ is, establish\na model of concepts, entities, and relationships. This provides\
    \ a wealth of major and\ninteresting applications.\nThe sensors’ rapid spread\
    \ and their produced data also affected the industry of\nautomotive. In fact,\
    \ for a few years it is possible to see a fast increase of technologies on\nboard\
    \ of a car both for control and assistance systems than for monitoring and diagnostic\n\
    systems. In this scenario, IoT offers an important support for automotives, since\
    \ it furnishes\nthe best way to help the automobile manufacturers thanks to its\
    \ paradigm implementations.\nIt is possible to afﬁrm that the Automotive Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) is an emerging research\nﬁeld that applies the IoT to the intelligent\
    \ transport system [75]. With the introduction of\nsmartphones, cloud, Edge Computing,\
    \ and mobile Internet, the automotive ecosystem is\nshifting toward the Internet\
    \ of Vehicles (IoV) [76,77]. These technologies have brought the\ncar to become\
    \ a very smart vehicle, so now the automobile is considered an integrated and\n\
    complicate ecosystem of objects that cooperates with each other.\nTrying to summarize,\
    \ the applications of most signiﬁcant interest then turn out to be:\n•\nSmart\
    \ Wearable: are wearable devices, low energy consumption, equipped with sen-\n\
    sors and networked to collect data on users in order to monitor daily physical\
    \ activity\n(to keep track of progress) or other information useful for health\
    \ (heartbeat, quantity,\nand quality of sleep, etc.) to identify possible problems\
    \ on time and do prevention;\n•\nSmart Vehicle and Connected Vehicle: systems\
    \ that were once mechanical (steering,\nbrakes, etc.) have been replaced by electronic\
    \ control units (ECUs) able to commu-\nInformation 2021, 12, 87\n16 of 20\nnicate\
    \ with each other and with the outside world. This is to efﬁciently exploit the\n\
    fuel and increase the driver’s safety by monitoring parameters of interest thanks\
    \ to\nelectronics. The internet connection can be used to monitor trafﬁc (and\
    \ then choose the\nmost appropriate route to get to a speciﬁc destination or ﬁnd\
    \ parking quickly), send\nsignals in case of failure, receive timely assistance,\
    \ and have access to infotainment\nservices and many other applications. In this\
    \ case, the ECUs form a network of smart\nobjects inside the car, but also the\
    \ car itself, seen in a broader context (like a smart\ncity), becomes a smart\
    \ object;\n•\ne-Health: the goal is to monitor patients’ health through devices\
    \ (which can also\nbe placed inside the human body) to make prevention and make\
    \ diagnoses and\ntreatments even when patients are far from the hospital. Additionally,\
    \ monitoring the\ndemand for healthcare services makes it possible to invest efﬁciently\
    \ in speciﬁc areas\nof healthcare;\n•\nSmart Building and Smart Home: smart objects\
    \ can be used to monitor the structural\nintegrity of buildings (and thus ensure\
    \ more excellent safety), environmental parame-\nters (such as temperature or\
    \ humidity), or the presence of people in speciﬁc places.\nAll this to make the\
    \ environment comfortable and at the same time efﬁciently manage\nlight, electricity,\
    \ heating, etc.;\n•\nSmart City: a network of sensors can be used to efﬁciently\
    \ manage water resources,\ntransport, energy, waste collection, etc., which would\
    \ reduce pollution and waste and\nincrease the comfort of citizens. Two possible\
    \ examples could be intelligent parking\nmanagement and public lighting management.\
    \ In the ﬁrst case, citizens could avoid\nwasting time looking for a free parking\
    \ space, and the pollution caused by the car\nwould be reduced; in the second\
    \ case, the lighting could be managed according to the\ntransit of pedestrians\
    \ and vehicles, which would allow energy savings;\n•\nSmart Metering and Smart\
    \ Grid: thanks to the monitoring of the electricity grid, it is\npossible to manage\
    \ the distribution and generation of energy (even that generated\nby small generators\
    \ such as wind or photovoltaic plants scattered throughout the\nterritory);\n\
    •\nSmart Agriculture (or precision agriculture): thanks to a network of sensors\
    \ and\nactuators, you can monitor the health and the actual needs of crops to\
    \ exploit resources\n(water, fertilizers, etc.) in an efﬁcient and targeted way;\n\
    •\nSmart Factory (or Industry 4.0): by integrating new technologies in production\
    \ pro-\ncesses, working conditions could be improved (an example could be the\
    \ support of a\nrobot to the human operator) as well as safety and productivity\
    \ in an industry.\n5. Technological Challenges in the IoT Field\nHowever, there\
    \ are other technological challenges on which research is focusing to\npromote\
    \ the development and diffusion of IoT [78,79]:\n•\nStandardization: in order\
    \ to ensure the development of the IoT, it is crucial to have\nopen standards\
    \ for the connectivity of systems, interoperability of the various elements,\n\
    etc. This process would facilitate both technological innovation (thanks to the\
    \ public\navailability of standards) and independence from speciﬁc technologies\
    \ or vendors;\n•\nAvailability and reliability: data must be available anytime\
    \ and anywhere for each\nauthorized object. Therefore, mechanisms are needed for\
    \ the object’s interoperability\nand the transfer and restoration (in case of\
    \ unexpected data events). Additionally, the\nmobility of devices must be managed\
    \ appropriately;\n•\nData storage, processing, and visualization: New methods\
    \ must be found to efﬁciently\nmanage and visualize the vast amount of data coming\
    \ from smart objects;\n•\nScalability: research on this topic serves to make it\
    \ possible to add new services and\ndevices to existing IoT systems without degrading\
    \ their presentations. In particular,\nit is necessary to take into account constraints\
    \ such as memory, computing power,\nbandwidth, etc.;\nInformation 2021, 12, 87\n\
    17 of 20\n•\nManagement and self-conﬁguration: the user can efﬁciently manage\
    \ a large number\nof devices. Additionally, smart objects must be able to self-conﬁgure\
    \ in response to\nexternal events as much as possible, always in order to simplify\
    \ management;\n•\nUnique identiﬁcation of smart objects: each smart object must\
    \ have unique identi-\nﬁcation in order to be reached by all the others. This\
    \ process represents a problem,\nespecially concerning the considerable increase\
    \ of smart objects present;\n•\nEnergy consumption: smart objects must manage\
    \ energy efﬁciently. They often\ncommunicate with other devices via wireless technologies\
    \ and have batteries as a\npower source that cannot always be replaced easily;\n\
    •\nSecurity and privacy: as far as security is concerned, in general, we have\
    \ that: Commu-\nnications between devices are often wireless, and this makes it\
    \ easy to “eavesdrop”;\nthe low computing capacity they have makes it challenging\
    \ to implement elaborate\ncountermeasures. As far as privacy is concerned, one\
    \ of the main problems lies in\nthe fact that smart objects collect a considerable\
    \ amount of information about users;\na possible attacker could have access not\
    \ only to users’ data but also to their habits\nand information about their health,\
    \ etc. Moreover, in an IoT application, the concepts\nof “safety” (security of\
    \ physical objects and people) and “security” (security of data\nand information\
    \ systems) tend to converge on the same level, since the objects have\ngained\
    \ the ability to interact with the surrounding world.\n6. Conclusions\nThis article\
    \ has provided a current overview of architectures, technologies, protocols,\n\
    and applications that characterize the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. In particular,\
    \ the\nmain architectures used in the IoT domain have been described based on\
    \ their reference\nlayers. The leading enabling technologies and most common protocols\
    \ are IEEE 802.15.4,\nLoWPANs, ZigBee, Z-wave, and LoraWLAN, and Sigfox No-IoT,\
    \ MQTT, CoAP, XMPP,\nDDS, and AMQP have been discussed. The main application areas\
    \ have been identiﬁed,\nsuch as Big Data, Cloud Computing, health care, Smart\
    \ City, Smart Home, Smart Grid,\nmobile application, cyber industries, Smart Agriculture,\
    \ and automotive.\nThe global IoT market is growing exponentially. The statistics\
    \ show that it reached\n745 billion dollars in 2019. However, to realize its growth,\
    \ it is unnecessary to analyze\ndata, statistics, and market forecasts. In fact,\
    \ it is before our eyes how important connected\ndevices have become and how emerging\
    \ technologies such as the Industrial Internet of\nThings, smart homes, smart\
    \ cities, smart factories, and smart metering are already a reality.\nThe possibilities\
    \ for the development of the Internet of Things are endless. Much will\ndepend\
    \ on the programmatic lines that global market manufacturers will adopt to make\
    \ the\nconnected devices as compatible as possible and thus increase the degree\
    \ of interoperability\nand integration without neglecting the aspects related\
    \ to safety. The analysis companies’\nforecasts are optimistic: in 2023, the IoT\
    \ market globally should reach 318 billion dollars.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization:\

    is driving the digital revolution. AlSome palliative measures aremost all economic
    sectors are becoming “Smart” thanks to the analysis of data generated by IoT.
    This analysis is carried out by advance artificial intelligence (AI) techniques
    that provide insights never before imagined. The combination of both IoT and AI
    is giving rise to an emerging trend, called AIoT, which is opening up new paths
    to bring digitization into the new era. However, there is still a big gap between
    AI and IoT, which is basically in the computational power required by the former
    and the lack of computational resources offered by the latter. This is particularly
    true in rural IoT environments where the lack of connectivity (or low-bandwidth
    connections) and power supply forces the search for “efficient” alternatives to
    provide computational resources to IoT infrastructures without increasing power
    consumption. In this paper, we explore edge computing as a solution for bridging
    the gaps between AI and IoT in rural environment. We evaluate the training and
    inference stages of a deep-learning-based precision agriculture application for
    frost prediction in modern Nvidia Jetson AGX Xavier in terms of performance and
    power consumption. Our experimental results reveal that cloud approaches are still
    a long way off in terms of performance, but the inclusion of GPUs in edge devices
    offers new opportunities for those scenarios where connectivity is still a challenge.

    Article 05 March 2022 1 Introduction Smart agriculture is an emerging field where
    the concepts, techniques and systems of Industry 4.0 are applied to the agrarian
    world [10]. The combination of both IoT and AI provides sustainable procedures
    to optimize crops, reduce the use of pesticides, optimize irrigation and, in general,
    avoid the most egregious problems in agricultural processes [6, 28, 29, 38]. Of
    particular interest to us is the prevention of frost. In Mediterranean areas,
    low temperatures at certain times of the agricultural cycle are a major problem
    that can result in losses of millions of euros. 1 However, it is not an easy task
    as it depends on several factors, including temperature, humidity, wind speed,
    etc. [30], but also on the particular location of the plot. Actually, the global
    weather forecast provides coarse grain information which is not valid to predict
    frost at the plot level. Some palliative measures are available to avoid crop
    loss, such as connecting windmills and stoves or connecting heating in a greenhouse
    to avoid crop losses. However, these measures need to be activated some time in
    advance, between 2 and 4 h, to be really effective. Therefore, this is a scenario
    where both accuracy and performance are equally critical. A false positive, i.e.,
    the application predicts a frost but eventually does not occur, means an economic
    and environmental impact, as these techniques are often too costly in both terms.
    A false negative, i.e., the application does not predict a frost but eventually
    occurs, can mean the loss of the crop which usually has dramatic consequences.
    Equally important is to predict the frost early enough in order to be able to
    take palliative actions, because otherwise, the consequences would be the same.
    Deep Learning is a area within machine learning which relies on a set of artificial
    neural networks organized as complex hierarchical levels [11]. Deep learning models
    are applied in agriculture to deal with problems such as the automatic identification
    of plant disease through images or yield predictions in crops [19]. In the field
    of deep learning, Long short-term memory (LSTM) [18] is a recurrent neural network
    (RNN), first proposed by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, which has feedback connections.
    LSTM goes beyond processing single data points such as images, but also entire
    sequences of data such as speech, video or time-series data in general. Thus,
    they are well suited to classifying, processing and making predictions based on
    data capture from IoT infrastructures [26]. In our previous work, an IoT system
    was proposed to obtain fine-grained information from a particular plot area [15]
    and some prepossessing tasks were carried out to remove outliers and out-of-range
    values. Moreover, we develop a deep learning model for the frost prediction based
    on a long short-term memory (LSTM) with satisfactory accuracy results, i.e., an
    average quadratic error of less than a Celsius degree and a determination coefficient
    \(R^{2}\) greater than 0.95 [14]. However, the computational cost of this model
    was too high and therefore it should be executed offline. This limits the success
    of this technique of because several reasons. The IoT infrastructure should be
    connected to the Internet with high-speed connection or, at least, with a minimum
    number of cloud outages. This is actually not the scenario in rural areas where
    IoT infrastructures are often found in inhospitable conditions, where high temperatures,
    lack of connectivity and security are just a few examples that limit the existence
    of responsive Web services. With a low-bandwidth connection plus the training
    and inference time of the LSTM model in the cloud, the maximum prediction window
    allowed for decision making (i.e., 2–3 h) would be difficult to achieve. Edge
    computing [32] is an emerging area where processing in close proximity to mobile
    devices or sensors may provide energy savings, highly responsive Web services
    for mobile computing, scalability and privacy-policy enforcement for the Internet
    of Things, as well as the ability to mask transient cloud outages. Indeed, edge
    computing platforms are designed to be energy efficient and therefore performance
    is not their primary objective. Some computing platforms are emerging to enable
    edge computing with a reduced power budget and ever-increasing performance. Among
    them, we may highlight Nvidia Jetson family which can run between 7.5 and 10 W
    of power, offering a good performance ratio [17]. In this article, we provide
    a performance and energy evaluation of edge vs. cloud computing platforms for
    a LSTM deep learning model to predict the possibility of frost in crops, taking
    as input data captured from an IoT system. The main contributions of this paper
    include the following: 1. The LSTM model for frost prediction previously published
    in [14] has been adapted to be executed on high-end and low-power GPUs. 2. CPU
    and GPU code is evaluated in terms of performance and power on the Nvidia Jetson
    AGX Xavier to find out whether the inclusion of GPUs on the edge devices is a
    compelling alternative for running heavy workloads like the LSTM model. The GPU-based
    code of out LSTM model shows 1.6x speedup factor compared to multicore counterpart
    version. 3. We also compare the edge solution with its cloud-based counterpart
    for both stages: training and inference, showing that Nvidia Jetson may offer
    enough computational horsepower to create an autonomous decision support systems
    for frost prediction. Training could be developed during the warmest part of the
    day when frost is unlikely to occur and inference can be made from midday. 4.
    The quality of the results obtained is also evaluated to ensure that our version
    of the GPU draws similar conclusions to its CPU counterpart. The rest of the paper
    is structured as follows. Section 2 shows the necessary background to better understand
    our proposal. Section 3 introduces the deep learning model based on LSTM to predict
    temperature. Section 4 includes the empirical results in which both quality and
    performance evaluations are presented. Section 5 summarizes the conclusions and
    gives some directions for future work. 2 Background 2.1 Edge versus cloud computing
    Since the early days, computing has alternated between centralization and decentralization.
    At the beginning, batch processing and time-sharing prevailed in a centralized
    fashion. With the advent of personal computing in the 1980s, we then move to a
    decentralized approach that was centralized again in the mid-2000s through the
    cloud. Nowadays, cloud computing is established as the most obvious infrastructure
    to leverage from a mobile device. However, the optimal cloud infrastructure may
    be too far away from the mobile device. Li et al. show the average round trip
    time from 260 global vantage points to their optimal Amazon EC2 instances was
    74 ms [24]. In addition, the latency of the wireless first hop should be added.
    Therefore, in some emergent applications, this latency is not tolerable and some
    authors pointed out the necessity of moving again toward distribution. Satyanarayanan
    et al. [32] propose two-level architecture to look for mobile applications'' interactive
    performance. The first level was the unmodified cloud computing architecture,
    and a second level was a network of dispersed elements called cloudlets with state
    cached from the first level [33]. Moreover, Bonomi et al, motivated by IoT infrastructure
    scalability instead, introduced the term fog computing that consists again of
    a multilevel hierarchy of fog nodes spanning from the cloud to IoT edge devices
    [4]. As stated in [32], the proximity of cloudlets (or fog nodes) provides different
    benefits but of particular interest to us are two of them: 1. Highly responsive
    cloud services, achieving low end-to-end latency, high bandwidth and low jitter
    to services located on the edge. Edge computing brings, through cloudlets, computational
    power within one wireless hop of sensors or mobile devices. Indeed, applications
    that are both latency-sensitive and computation-intensive would not become possible
    without this technology. Interactive mobile applications such as virtual or augmented
    are leading examples. 2. Scalability via edge analytics, lowering the bandwidth
    required by high-data-rate IoT sensors processing applications. Reducing the amount
    of information to be transferred to the cloud through a data analytics on the
    edge may avoid network overloading and may provide energy saves. A leading example
    of this is GigaSight framework [35] where video from mobile devices only goes
    to the nearby cloudlet. The cloudlet runs computer vision application and sends
    the results and some metadata to the cloud, reducing drastically the application
    bandwidth. Edge computing is a compelling alternative to enable smart environments
    in agriculture ubiquitously. Actually, agriculture procedures are usually developed
    in rural areas where several technological challenges often cohabit. Among them,
    we may highlight technical issues such as bandwidth, connectivity, power supply
    and scaling sensors but also environmental issues that complicate the deployment
    of IoT, such as extreme weather conditions. Some recent works have carried out
    studies considering edge computing for smart agriculture or farming. For instance,
    Zamora-Izquierdo et al. [36] proposes a platform to deal with soilless culture
    needs in full recirculation greenhouses using moderately saline water. Edge computing
    here is in charge of monitoring and managing main PA tasks near the access network
    to increase system reliability against network access failures. However, they
    do not introduce computationally heavy workloads such as deep learning models
    at this level as they require higher computational horsepower. Singh, Chana and
    Buya propose Agri-Info, a cloud-based autonomic system for delivering agriculture
    as a service. They do provide intelligent procedures to diagnose the agriculture
    status automatically using fuzzy logic but they execute so in the cloud, offering
    a mobile interface to see the output. Indeed, this is a good approach as long
    as high connectivity is guaranteed. Moreover, they do not use information from
    the ground; they use expert knowledge taken from their mobile or tablets where
    connectivity is somehow guaranteed. Finally, a survey on the role of IoT in agriculture
    for the implementation of smart farming is provided in [9]. They clearly state
    that IoT-based solutions are at the forefront of automatically maintaining and
    monitoring agricultural farms with minimal human involvement. Indeed, this requires
    the involvement of AI models that can provide predictions in real time. 2.2 Deep
    learning in precision agriculture Deep learning is made up of a set of techniques
    that allow the construction of models with great potential and outstanding results
    [19]. Recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures have been widely applied for
    regression [20]. RNNs are a type of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in which
    connections between nodes create a graph directed over a time sequence, allowing
    to have a temporal dynamic behavior. The main difference between RNNs and other
    ANNs architectures is that they use their internal state (memory) to process input
    sequences. RNNs work well in problems with short-term dependencies where the model
    only needs to look at recent (or close) information to carry out the current task
    [12]. However, there are some problems that require less recent or more distant
    information to perform the current task. This is called long-term dependency,
    and RNNs do not work well in such scenarios. The long short-term memory (LSTM)
    is type of RNNs, which is designed to deal with long-term dependencies such as
    those within time series based on learning from previous observations to predict
    the next value in the sequence [18]. While Standard RNNs are based on chain of
    very simple ANNs, such as a single tanh layer, LSTMs are also based on chain of
    ANNs, but the ANNs has a different structure. Deep learning models have drastically
    improved the state of the art in many sectors of industry including agriculture
    [25]. In the field of agriculture, different deep learning techniques (mainly
    convolutional neural networks for image classification and LSTM for the prediction
    of temporal variables) are applied to multiple problems such as plant diseases
    [27], the classification of plant species [13], identification of soil cover and
    classification of crop type [22], estimation of yields [23], identification of
    weeds [3], predictions on climatology [31], just to mention a few recent studies
    within the umbrella of precision agriculture. Focusing on the problem of climatology,
    some works have been published for climatic prediction, showing very good results.
    For instance, Salman et al. [31] propose the construction of a robust statistical
    model to predict meteorological visibility based on other intermediate variables
    (temperature, pressure, humidity and dew point). They use two- and four-layer
    LSTM networks. The data are normalized and rescaled in the range of [0, 1] and
    using a moving average. Here, the multilayered LSTM model was most effective.
    However, this work was not applied to precision agriculture but for forecasting
    visibility based on temperature, pressure, humidity, dew point in airport area
    context. LSTM was also used to predict climate variables in [37]. The targeted
    variables used as an input were temperature, humidity and wind speed. In this
    case, the network architecture consists of two LSTM layers with the activation
    function being the RELU and the optimizer RMSProp. The data were also normalized
    and rescaled in the range of [\(-1\), 1]. The results were generated for a coarse-grained
    prediction in cities. Again, it is not applied to precision agriculture context
    and therefore data were obtained for historical datasets instead of real-time
    information like us. Kratzert et al. [21] proposed a model for rain and runoff
    also using LSTM, which predicts discharge for a variety of watersheds. The authors
    demonstrate the potential of this method by using some variables such as day length,
    rainfall, temperature or humidity. Here, the LSTM is composed of two LSTM layers,
    and between them is a dropout layer to avoid overtraining of the network but in
    the context of water management scheduling not in precision agriculture. Finally,
    we have explored the bibliography of combining deep learning methods with edge
    computing architectures. Chen et al. [7] propose ThriftyEdge, a resource-efficient
    edge computing for intelligent IoT applications, and one of the case studies is
    precision agriculture. However, this work is not tailored to deep learning-based
    applications. Boubin et al. [5] explore fully autonomous precision agriculture
    where fully autonomous aerial systems (FAAS) map crop fields frequently. They
    develop the full-stack architecture, including a software driven by reinforcement
    learning and ensemble models. The early results presented in this paper do not
    show any relevant results in the field of edge computing. Actually, they work
    at simulation level, running their experiments in a Laptop. Finally, we refer
    the reader to [39] for a review in Edge Intelligence, where efforts for bridging
    the gaps between deep learning and edge computing are summarized. Even though
    the area of precision agriculture is cited as one of the main domains for edge
    intelligence, it is worth highlighting that any work is cited for this domain.
    3 LSTM model for temperature prediction on IoT infrastructures This section introduces
    the proposed LSTM model for the temperature prediction in IoT infrastructures.
    First of all, we briefly introduce the IoT infrastructure to capture information
    from a plot that was previously introduced in [15]. Next, the proposed LSTM model
    for the prediction of temperature is explained in depth. Fig. 1 IoT system architecture
    Full size image 3.1 The IoT infrastructure Figure 1 shows the IoT architecture
    previously presented in [15]. This infrastructure is deployed in two different
    crops at Murcia (South East Spain). The system monitors the hydro-climatological
    information of a plot, and depending on the data and models developed, the system
    can alert farmers to take appropriate action if necessary. The infrastructure
    is based on three main components: (1) hydro-climatological sensors, (2) an intelligent
    data processing system and (3) a monitoring component. The intelligent data processing
    system only performs a preprocessing of outliers values to avoid showing incorrect
    values to the farmer. In this article, we are evaluating the possibility of introducing
    the computation of intelligent algorithm at the edge of the network. Therefore,
    the intelligent data processing system would be physically at the edge or in the
    cloud, depending on the requirements set by the users. The algorithm will allow
    farmers to obtain a temperature prediction in real time at their plots. The workflow
    begins at the sensor level in which the climate data are captured. The sensor
    network is the 4H remote control system of Hidroconta. 2 Figure 2 shows the IoT
    node composed of temperature, humidity and wind speed sensors. They are connected
    to the analog inputs available on the IoT node. In our case, we only use the information
    provided by the temperature sensor. Sensors provide information every 10 min.
    Fig. 2 IoT node (we refer the reader to [15] for insights) Full size image The
    IoT node has connectivity capabilities. For this study, there are three IoT nodes
    where one of them is acting as a gateway to send data to the cloud via GPRS connection.
    The slave nodes are connected to the gateway using LoRa technology. 3 Moreover,
    all of them have a 6 volts (V) and 12 amp (A) battery and a 12V and 5 watts solar
    panel. Finally, each IoT node has a microcontroller with 256 KB of firmware storage
    and 96 KB of volatile memory for data, and it is able to store up to 20.000 records.
    Therefore, the IoT nodes store the information in their internal memory for fault
    tolerance. Fig. 3 Two computing models are presented; a a cloud-based approach
    where the computation is carried out in the backend and b an edge computing approach
    where the computation is carried out in the IoT node Full size image Figure 3
    shows the different computing schemes under evaluation for air temperature prediction
    using LSTM deep learning model. On the one hand, a centralized computing system
    has been used where the IoT nodes have sent the temperature by means of GPRS to
    the centralized module, in which an outliers cleaning has been carried out to
    be able to estimate the temperature using the LSTM. Also, this module allows to
    visualize the data (3a). The second scheme presents the computational component
    within the IoT module. In this way, the LSTM is executed locally, which allows
    temperature prediction without the need to send the information to a centralized
    module. Finally, the prediction is sent by GPRS to a module that allows data to
    be displayed (3b). 3.2 The LSTM model for temperature prediction Analysis of sensor
    data from IoT infrastructures as the one described above can provide valuable
    information for creating new applications to deal with the emergent problems that
    are currently unsolved. We are particularly interested in air temperature modeling
    for early identification of frost on crops. In our previous work, we designed
    a deep learning model, which offered very good results in the prediction of this
    variable. In what follows, we introduce this model and refer the reader to [14]
    for insights. In the Mediterranean area, there is a large diurnal temperature
    variation, which implies that the data time series of air temperature is nonlinear,
    containing sensitive information, making very difficult to predict with traditional
    autoregressive (AR) models such as ARIMA [2]. As previously explained in Sect.
    2, the LSTM is type of RNNs which is designed to deal with long-term dependencies,
    and therefore, it has shown very good results for predicting values in time series.
    LSTM is usually composed of four layers, interacting in several ways, and the
    key idea of LSTMs is the cell state which is basically like a conveyor belt. The
    information runs through the entire chain, with only some minor linear interactions.
    The LSTM can add or remove information to the cell state through the Gates. They
    are an optional way to let information pass and are based on a sigmoid neural
    network layer and a point multiplication operation. The sigmoid layer produces
    numbers between zero and one, describing how much of each component must pass.
    An LSTM has three of these gates in order to protect and control the cell state.
    Figure 4 shows the interaction of the three gates in detail, as well as how the
    LSTM modules exchanges information with each other. An LSTM module receives the
    temperature at time t as input, which is processed together with the temperature
    prediction at time \(t-1\), received from the previous LSTM module. Both temperatures
    are processed and sent to the next module, which also receives the temperature
    at \(t+1\). As an example, let us assume that the LSTM receives the temperature
    at the instant t, where \(t=3.41\,^\circ \)C. After processing this temperature,
    which is now considered as the previous temperature (\({t-1}\)), it returns as
    output the temperature at the instant \(t+1\), let us assume the temperature \({t+1}\)
    = 3.05 °C, that is, the output of the temperature for the next 10 min interval
    would be 3.05 °C. Fig. 4 LSTM scheme developed to deal with the frost prediction.
    Each LSTM module interacts with the previous and subsequent one. The schema shows
    the three gates that compose each LSTM module, which allow it to remember or delete
    the information that passes through them Full size image The first step in our
    LSTM is to decide the input layer. This is an importance decision as it decides
    what information goes through the cell state. In our case, it is a sigmoid layer,
    which receives as input the air temperature taken from the sensors (see Fig. 3a).
    Moreover, a hidden stacked LSTM layer that is made by LSTM blocks contains four
    interacting layers. These four neuronal layers are made up of three sigmoids and
    a hyperbolic tangent, which have been tested from 50 to 200 neurons. So in each
    step, the LSTM block has to decide what information will be stored in the state
    of the cell. To do this, the two types of neural networks work differently: the
    neural layers with sigmoids decide which values of air temperatures have to be
    updated, while the neuronal layer of the hyperbolic tangent creates a vector of
    new values of candidate air temperatures that could be added to the state. The
    two processes are combined to create a status update. Finally, the output layer
    gives the predicted air temperature based on previous air temperatures. The parameters
    used have been optimized, such as learning factor (0.001), optimizer (Adam), activation
    function (hyperbolic tangent), etc. A more detailed explanation of the parameters
    (batch size, number of epochs, number of delay sequences...) used for the experiments
    is shown in Sect. 4.1.1. 3.3 CPU and GPU implementation Two different implementations
    of the LSTM model previously described have been developed for this article. Both
    of them are based on Keras (version 2.2.4) [16]. Keras is a Python-based open-source
    neural network library, which is capable of running on top of many neural network
    frameworks such as Tensorflow [1] or CNTK [34], just to mention a few. Keras contains
    implementations of commonly used neural networks, including convolutional and
    RNN neural networks. Moreover, it includes the main building blocks such as objectives,
    optimizers, layers, activation functions. Algorithm 1 shows the code baselines
    of our LSTM implementation. First, we create the model as a linear stack of layers
    with the sequential function from Keras. Then, different layers are added to the
    model, depending on an input parameter which is actually defined by the user.
    The influence of this parameter in terms of performance will be studied in Sect.
    4.2. Moreover, the code is able to decide wheather the user wants to build the
    model on GPU through cuDNNLSTM or on CPU through LSTM. cuDNNLSTM is a Keras function
    which offers fast LSTM implementation with CuDNN [8]. It can only be run on Nvidia
    GPU, with the TensorFlow backend. cuDNN is a GPU-accelerated library of primitives
    for deep neural networks created by Nvidia. It provides GPU counterpart versions
    for standard routines such as forward and backward convolution, pooling, normalization
    and activation layers. LSTM function is the standard LSTM model defined by Hochreiter
    [18]. Finally, once the model has defined your model, it is compiled with compile
    function. This creates the structures previously defined by the underlying backend
    (in our case TensorFlow 10.11.1) in order to efficiently execute your model during
    training. 4 Results and discussion This section introduces the performance, energy
    and quality evaluation of our LSTM model as applied to predict the air temperature
    of a particular plot in an IoT infrastructure with edge computing capabilities.
    First of all, the experimental environment is described, providing the main metrics,
    hardware and software environment and datasets used in the experiments shown below.
    Then, the execution time and power consumption of the edge computing platform
    and the high-performance server are shown and discussed in detail before the quality
    evaluation of the LSTM to predict air temperature is provided. 4.1 Experimental
    setup 4.1.1 Metrics The performance and energy evaluations are carried out by
    varying the most relevant parameters of the LSTM model, i.e., number of epochs
    and number of neurons. Moreover, this study analyzes the two main stages of this
    model, i.e., training and inference, which are carried out in both an edge computing
    platform (Nvidia Jetson Xavier) and a high-performance computing server. Energy
    of the system is measured by polling once every second the power supply of the
    Jetson architecture with the Watts Up Pro power meter, which provides individual
    energy measurements for the server connected to it, and therefore, energy measurements
    refer to the entire node executing the LSTM model. As for the quality of the results,
    the prediction of temperature is a regression task and the metric measures used
    to assess the quality of the results obtained with the LSTM model are the root
    mean quadratic error, the mean absolute error (MAE), the Pearson correlation coefficient
    (PCC) and determination coefficient (R\(^2\)). The results are positive when the
    RMSE and MAE measurements are less than one degree Celsius and PCC, and the closer
    to one \(R^2\) is, the more acceptable and suitable the model is. For both experiments,
    95% of the data are used to train the model and 5% of the data are used to perform
    the inference task. The optimum parameters used for the experiments are shown
    in Table 1. Parameters that do not influence the computational performance of
    the LSTM have been validated in previous experiments. Table 1 LSTM parameters

    2 Each row’s format collected every 10 min. 6 per hour. 144 per day Full size
    table The dataset to evaluate the LSTM model is obtained from the IoT system previously
    described in Sect. 3.1. Table 2 shows an example of the data collected by this
    architecture. The IoT infrastructure generates 144 rows per day (i.e., 1 row each
    10 min), and the data layout is as follows: Date: in dd/mm/aaaa format. Hour:
    in hh:mm format. Air temperature: decimal number in Celsius degrees. Wind speed:
    decimal number in m/s. Relative air humidity: decimal number in %. Our LSTM model
    only works with air temperature, which is collected every 10 min. For the experimental
    environment, four different datasets have been created to test scalability of
    edge and cloud solutions. They include a number of air temperature measurements
    from different periods, including 3,6,12 and 18 months, respectively (see Table
    3). Table 3 Description of the datasets used in the experiments. It shows the
    number of instances, the start and end date period of the air temperature data
    Full size table 4.1.3 Hardware and software environment Experiments have been
    carried out in two different GPU-based platforms: The former is the edge computing
    like architecture Jetson AGX Xavier Developer Kit. It has four-core ARM v8.0 64-bit
    CPU, 8MB L2 + 4MB L3, 512-core Volta GPU with Tensor Cores and 16GB 256-Bit LPDDR4x
    running at 137GB/sec. The latter is called HETEROLISTIC, and it is composed of
    two hexa-core Intel Xeon E5-2650 at 2.20 GHz, 128 GB of RAM, private L1 and L2
    caches of 32 KB and 256 KB per node, and a L3 cache of 32 MB shared by all the
    cores of a socket. It includes an Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti(Pascal), with 12 GB and 3584
    cores (28 SM and 128 SP per SM). The software environment is based on gcc 7.4.0
    and cuda 10 and Python 3.6.5. The design of our LSTM model is based on Tensorflow
    1.10.1 and Keras 2.2.4. 4.2 Evaluation Fig. 5 Execution time (in seconds) of LSTM
    training stage with multicore CPU and GPU on AGX Xavier, varying the number of
    epochs for training. The training is carried out with information of 3 months
    with 150 neurons Full size image Fig. 6 Energy (in KWh) on AGX Xavier of LSTM
    training stage with multicore CPU and GPU on AGX Xavier, varying the number of
    epochs for training. The training is carried out with information of 3 months
    with 150 neurons Full size image One of the main goals of this paper is to validate
    edge computing for complex tasks such as those under the umbrella of deep learning.
    Computational devices at the edge are traditionally low power and therefore have
    limited computational horsepower. Recently, more powerful edge computing devices
    have emerged, such as those from the Nvidia Jetson family, which include an accelerator
    to speed up parts of the code. Figure 5 shows the performance difference between
    a GPU-based code of our LSTM model compared to multithreaded CPU counterpart version,
    executed in the Nvidia Jetson AGX Xavier for the training stage and varying the
    number of epochs. Although the GPU architecture included in Xavier only includes
    a multiprocessor with 512 cores, more than 1.6x speedup factor is reported. Moreover,
    Fig. 6 shows the energy in KWh of the two implementations. Xavier’s power consumption
    is higher when the GPU is enabled. Actually, the Xavier consumes 10W when the
    GPU code is running and only 8W when only CPU code does. However, the performance
    difference between these codes makes the GPU code more efficient compared to the
    CPU code in terms of energy consumption. Fig. 7 Execution time (in seconds) of
    LSTM training stage, varying the number of epochs for training. The training is
    carried out with information of 3 and 6 months with 150 neurons Full size image
    Fig. 8 Execution time (in seconds) of LSTM inference stage, varying the number
    of epochs for training. The inference is carried out with information of 3 and
    6 months with 150 neurons Full size image Figures 7 and 8 show the execution time
    of the proposed LSTM model to predict the temperature of a plot. Experiments are
    carried with the GPU version of the LSTM model on the edge computing platform
    Jetson AGX Xavier and the high-performance computing server HETEROLISTIC. Two
    performance figures are provided for main stages of the LSTM model, i.e., training
    and inference, and in both scenarios, HETEROLISTIC is defeated by a wide-margin
    Jetson Xavier (peak performance difference of 3.5x speed-up factor). However,
    the magnitude of the execution time for each of these stages is very different.
    Computationally speaking, the training process is more time-consuming than the
    inference process; a difference reaches up to five orders of magnitude, and thus
    different conclusions can be drawn. As previously explained, the LSTM is designed
    to be a part of intelligent component of an IoT infrastructure. The IoT infrastructure
    sends information periodically every 10 min, and therefore, this is time limit
    for making instantaneous predictions. Otherwise, the prediction will become obsolete,
    and the farmer would not be able to take actions before a temperature drops. Therefore,
    the execution time obtained for inference in Xavier is valid for performing instantaneous
    prediction on edge computing. There are scenarios where the deadline to obtain
    the prediction is, at least, 12 h or even more. This is the case of frost prediction
    in places where there is a large diurnal temperature variation as it is the targeted
    region (South East, Spain). Frost prediction is a scenario where the farmer needs
    to know the prediction several hours in advance to activate the antifreeze mechanisms.
    In addition, climate change makes the weather even more unpredictable and changing.
    Therefore, the deep learning models need to be retrained periodically. Execution
    time for the training stage for 3000 epochs and 6-month dataset is less than 12
    h (i.e., 11.01 h) in the case of Jetson Xavier, which is actually the worst of
    the cases presented in Figs. 7 and 8. The execution time is drastically reduced
    when the dataset size and the number of epochs are reduced. For instance, it takes
    less than 6 h to train with 3-month dataset, running 3000 epochs and less than
    1 h if the training is performed with 3-month dataset and 200 epochs. Therefore,
    Jetson Xavier can offer great performance to enable an autonomous decision support
    system for frost prediction, in which both training and inference are performed
    at the edge. Fig. 9 Execution time (in seconds) of LSTM training stage, varying
    the number of epochs for training. The training is carried out with information
    of 12 and 18 months Full size image Fig. 10 Execution time (in seconds) of LSTM
    inference stage, varying the number of epochs for training. The inference is carried
    out with information of 12 and 18 months Full size image Figures 9 and 10 show
    large-scale (12- and 18-month datasets) training and inference on both Jetson
    Xavier and HETEROLISTIC. The training execution time grows exponentially along
    with the number of epochs, and inference stays flat. Table 4 Execution time (in
    seconds) of LSTM training and inference stages, varying the number of neurons
    for training and setting the number of epochs to 2500 Full size table Finally,
    Table 4 shows the scalability of the LSTM when the number of neurons increases,
    setting the number of epochs to 2500. The execution time is not affected too much
    by increasing the number of neurons. The usage of GPUs allows high-performance
    data training of the LSTM on both architectures. 4.3 Quality evaluation This section
    shows the results obtained from the LSTM model designed to predict the temperature
    from IoT information. First, we show and analyze the results of the three cross-validations
    and then we show the results of the test of 95% for training and 5% for testing
    (considering 24 consecutive hours). Table 5 Quality results for 3-month, 6-month
    and 12-month datasets varying the number of epochs. RMSE (root-mean-square error),
    MAE (mean absolute error), PCC (Pearson correlation coefficient) and \(R^2\) (determination
    coefficient) Full size table After analyzing the results of the computational
    performance of the models in their training phase and given the high computational
    cost with the 18-month datasets, we have only analyzed the quality of the results
    for the 3-, 6- and 12-month datasets, since the time of 18 months was excessive,
    even the time for the 12-month datasets is considered excessive for an autonomous
    system, but we have considered it necessary to study the quality of the results,
    in case the prediction results were very remarkable. Table 5 shows the error after
    model inference by setting the number of neurons to 150 and varying the number
    of epochs for 3-, 6- and 12-month datasets. The most suitable models are those
    obtained by the 3-month dataset, whose value of \(R^2\) is 99%. For datasets of
    6 and 12 months, the value is also acceptable but it is much better that of the
    3-month dataset. Regarding the error, both RMSE and MAE, there is a remarkable
    fact and it is the increase above a Celsius degree of the 6-month dataset. This
    error increase is due to the fact that the datasets include summer months, which
    causes the model to have noise since the objective is to predict low temperatures.
    As can be seen, this error decreases for the 12-month dataset. Analyzing in depth
    the results, we see how the smallest error and the most adjusted model are produced
    with 3000-epoch configuration. Nevertheless, looking at the difference in time
    in the experiment of computational performance between the configurations of 2500
    and 3000 epochs, we have an hour of difference, being slower the training with
    3000 epochs. Studying the difference of error between 2500 and 3000 epochs with
    the increase of 1 h, we consider more satisfactory considering performance vs.
    quality the result obtained with 2500 epochs. The two best results are highlighted
    in Table 5. Once the quality of the results has been studied after varying the
    number of epochs, Table 6 analyzes the quality of the model by varying the number
    of input neurons to the model between 50 and 200. This is done for 3-, 6- and
    12-month datasets. The behavior obtained is similar to the variation in the number
    of epochs. The 6-month dataset obtains a greater error than the 3-month and 12-month
    datasets. The most suitable model taking into account the determination coefficient
    \(R^2\) is the 3-month dataset with 150 neurons. Already with 200 neurons, the
    model starts with overlearning and the error increases slightly. Table 6 Quality
    results for 3-month, 6-month and 12-month datasets, varying the number of neurons.
    RMSE (root-mean-square error), MAE (mean absolute error), PCC (Pearson correlation
    coefficient) and \(R^2\)(determination coefficient) Full size table Therefore,
    in view of the results, we can conclude that the data indicate that it is possible
    to run the prediction model of the LSTM at the edge, since with a training of
    5 h, there is enough time between frost and frost, even if these occur on consecutive
    days. The most optimal configuration found is to train the data with the last
    3 months collected by the node IoT taking as input 150 neurons and making a maximum
    of 2500 epochs. With this configuration, the mean quadratic error obtained is
    less than 0.8 Celsius degrees. 5 Conclusions and future work Prior knowledge of
    low temperatures can help the farmer to anticipate resources and apply frost control
    techniques early enough to ensure maximum efficiency. The overall objective is
    to create an autonomous decision support system for precision agriculture, and
    in such hostile environments, connectivity is limited and there are transient
    clouds that limit the effectiveness of these systems. Edge computing provides
    a framework in which connectivity and security problems are addressed by computing
    at the edge of the network, but today’s edge computing architectures are not able
    to handle heavy workloads. This article evaluates edge computing for frost prediction
    in crops by estimating low temperatures through LSTM deep learning models. LSTM
    deep learning models are computationally heavy workloads, but provide very good
    results for predicting time series. Our results demonstrate that novel edge computing
    platforms including low-power GPUs such as Nvidia Jetson Xavier provide an excellent
    framework for driving edge computing as a real alternative to smart applications.
    Our best LSTM model obtains a deviation less than 1 degree centigrade, being trained
    with information of 3 months, 2500 epochs and 150 neurons, and its execution time
    is less than 5 h which allows training before the prediction is required. As future
    work, new variables will be incorporated into the LSTM to create a multivariate
    LSTM and study the influence of other variables on temperature prediction, as
    well as the network adjustment creating a new architecture with more layers and
    different activation functions and different learning factors. Notes https://www.laverdad.es/murcia/ultimas-heladas-region-20190404113101-nt.html.

    Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) present a promising advanced technology that can
    enhance people life quality and smartness of cities dramatically and increase
    overall economic efficiency. UAVs have attained a significant interest in supporting
    many applications such as surveillance, agriculture, communication, transportation,
    pollution monitoring, disaster management, public safety, healthcare, and environmental
    preservation. Industry 4.0 applications are conceived of intelligent things that
    can automatically and collaboratively improve beyond 5G (B5G). Therefore, the
    Internet of Things (IoT) is required to ensure collaboration between the vast
    multitude of things efficiently anywhere in real-world applications that are monitored
    in real-time. However, many IoT devices consume a significant amount of energy
    when transmitting the collected data from surrounding environments. Due to a drone''s
    capability to fly closer to IoT, UAV technology plays a vital role in greening
    IoT by transmitting collected data to achieve a sustainable, reliable, eco-friendly
    Industry 4.0. This survey presents an overview of the techniques and strategies
    proposed recently to achieve green IoT using UAVs infrastructure for a reliable
    and sustainable smart world. This survey is different from other attempts in terms
    of concept, focus, and discussion. Finally, various use cases, challenges, and

    (ICT)IoTPollution monitoringIndustry 4.0Smart cities 1. Introduction Recently,
    UAV technology has emerged as a promising technology for intelligent surveillance
    and reconnaissance operations. The use of UAVs leads to enormous benefits such
    as reduced transmission power consumption [1], conservation of resources [2],
    and reduced pollution [2,3]. Furthermore, UAVs prove themselves indispensable
    in natural and human-made disaster relief operations (in preparedness, assessment,
    and recovery), emergency aid, parcel delivery, imagery over large geographical
    areas, data gathering, and environmental monitoring [4], [5], [6]. Recently, the
    UAVs technology has been classified as a promising solution for combatting COVID-19
    due to the capability of UAVs in detecting a person when not wearing a mask (when
    a UAV is equipped with a high-resolution camera), identifying an infected person
    (when a UAV is equipped with a thermal camera) [7]. All of the above characteristics
    lead to improved smartness and reliability of the smart environment. The UAV can
    act as an aerial Base Station (BS) for delivering communication services to a
    wide coverage area. Agility and the ability to enable communication beyond Line
    of Sight (LoS) in disaster areas are among the most important drones'' features,
    making UAVs play a vital role in achieving the green Internet of Things (IoT).
    In areas not accessible by human beings, such as disaster areas, the UAVs can
    act as aerial relays where they are equipped with IoT devices and advanced communication
    equipment to deliver communication services to survivors and share collected data
    for decision making and taking necessary actions in real-time [8]. For instance,
    the UAVs can guide Search and Rescue (SAR) teams when their wearable smart devices
    are connected to a UAV to direct them towards a suitable route for their safety
    [9]. IoT devices are not able to send data over considerable large distances because
    of their energy limits. Therefore, a UAV can represent a crucial technology in
    IoT communication, and data aggregation from small devices, such as sensors and
    health care devices [10]. In extending the range of communication over IoT devices,
    the integration of UAVs and IoT is required to gather data from IoT devices and
    transmit it to the intended destination [11]. Authors of [12] provided a solution
    to integrate UAVs and IoT devices into disaster response settings and offered
    event detecting and automatic network repair facilities. An advantage of this
    technology is that the UAV can deliver IoT data in real-time to any particular
    place or the ground control for agile decision-making. For ensuring energy efficiency
    on these low-power devices, smart UAVs can help by moving automatically towards
    potential smart IoT devices, establishing the connection, collecting data, and
    transmitting onward (to the edge/fog/cloud), which is out of the transmission
    range of smart IoT devices [13]. Fig.1 shows the UAVs capability as a Fog node
    to collect data from many IoT devices in a large area and control the operation
    mode (sleep or active) of distributed devices for saving energy. The devices shown
    in red are in active mode, while those shown in black are in sleep mode. Thus,
    a smart UAV can also help in ensuring battery longevity. Download : Download high-res

    IoT devices. Furthermore, a UAV can be used to connect to IoT devices effectively
    and efficiently to deliver broadband communication services to large coverage
    areas at low cost in order to decrease energy consumption [14], and reduce transmission
    power while retaining reliability [1]. Recently, connected swarm UAVs with IoT
    devices have also been considered [15,16]. In [17], the authors presented a steering
    technique for UAVs with multiple 4G networks to guarantee reliable connectivity
    that supports Quality of Service (QoS) with an acceptable energy consumption.
    One of the primary applications of the 5G communication network is IoT and sensor
    networks. Qualcomm and Nokia have initiated drone projects, in which they conducted
    many experiments on how to use UAVs for Beyond 5G (B5G) communication networks
    [18,19]. Many surveys and tutorials analyze UAVs'' challenges, opportunities,
    and future for B5G [20], [21], [22], [23]. Collaboration between IoT and UAVs
    can be employed to achieve new IoT regimes, such as civil applications, industrial,
    and medical environments, and extend the UAV functionalities [24]. Therefore,
    in [25], authors considered UAVs as the middleware for energy-efficient discovery
    in sensor networks and IoT. Nowadays, IoT has enabled advanced applications in
    smart homes, intelligent logistics, smart cities, smart power grids, smart manufacturing,
    etc. These applications have become critical to our lifestyle. The environmental
    factor pertains to the use of green things that protect environment from hazardous
    and harmful emissions, alleviate the consequences of climate change, conserve
    natural resource usage, and reduce pollutions and power consumption. Hence, greening
    IoT networks is a critical technology towards reducing CO2 emissions and pollution,
    environmental conservation, and minimization of operating costs and power consumption
    [26]. Furthermore, utilizing UAVs as a bridge (fog computing layer) for monitoring
    Industrial IoT (IIoT) in smart industries [27,28], has gained considerable attention.
    UAV-enabled Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is empowered to support offloading tasks
    and improve computing capability and energy efficiency [29]. To the best of our
    knowledge, existing research attempts have not addressed UAV technology''s importance
    to green IoT applications to improve smart cities'' quality of life. Therefore,
    this paper provides a comprehensive survey of strategies and techniques used for
    greening IoT applications using UAVs to facilitate energy efficiency, sustainable
    QoS, and delivery of services to large coverage areas at low cost, thereby reducing
    the carbon footprint. 1.1. Contributions This paper is designed to provide a comprehensive
    overview of the techniques and strategies used for greening IoT using UAV technology.
    To this end, the primary goal is to collect the literature on the use of UAVs
    for greening IoT that address the applications, challenges, and opportunities
    of UAVs as edge intelligence devices for greening IoT. We believe that this comprehensive
    survey will help readers to fully accomplish the potential strategies for greening
    IoT using UAVs edge intelligence technology. Furthermore, we will highlight the
    applications of green IoT by using UAVs technology. The contributions of this
    paper are listed as follows: • Green IoT, we outline the critical role of greening
    IoT by integrating UAVs with IoT. We discuss the strategies and techniques used
    for UAVs use cases for green IoT applications based on enhancing green IoT such
    as smart homes, smart cities, smart agriculture, smart healthcare, and smart grid.
    • Connectivity and communication beyond 5G, we discuss the most current development
    regarding integrating UAVs and B5G networks. We introduce UAVs'' important applications
    for enabling Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) such as sensors,
    5G and beyond 5G technologies, and Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) to green
    IoT. • Energy efficiency, we discuss the most recent studies regarding the UAV
    technology''s performance in improving IoT energy efficiency. We focus on strategies
    and techniques for power optimization problems of integration of UAVs and IoT.
    Furthermore, we summarize various efficient techniques for energy efficiency of
    UAV systems to green IoT. • Pollution hazardous monitoring, we discuss the most
    recent studies in regards to monitoring pollution using UAVs. We discuss the strategies
    and techniques that enable UAVs to monitor and improve air quality effectively
    and efficiently. Then, we summarize various efficient techniques for reducing
    pollution with the help of UAVs in Industry 4.0 applications. • We discuss future
    scopes, challenges, and opportunities of using UAVs technology for greening IoT.
    1.2. Review of recent surveys The IoT regime includes the ever-expanding world
    of sensors, computers, actuators, and smart devices. For example, everything could
    communicate over the Internet, such as buildings, smartphones, vehicles, home
    appliances, and even natural objects, to create a smart world. However, many IoT
    devices require high energy to cooperate, connect, and share information with
    the central node (if applicable) or one another. Therefore, developing effective
    power conservation strategies becomes critical for extending the battery lifetime.
    Furthermore, load balancing can play a critical role in improving network lifetime
    by decreasing smart devices'' energy consumption. Therefore, many studies have
    surveyed appropriate strategies and technologies to improve the intelligent world''s
    smartness level by applying UAVs for different applications [30], [31], [32],
    [33]. Smartness is evaluated by many factors such as the smart economy, smart
    living, smart mobility, smart environment, smart people, smart governance, smart
    tourism, etc. In [31], the authors introduced technical problems and potential
    applications related to smart UAVs in smart cities. The authors discussed enabling
    techniques used to develop the integration of smart UAVs in smart cities. However,
    they did not address enabling technologies for green IoT by using UAVs technology
    in smart city applications. Also, in [32], the authors summarized the strategies
    and techniques that are used for greening IoT and improved the smartness of cities.
    However, all of them addressed technologies that did not discuss how UAV technology
    can improve green IoT applications. The authors in [34] described different frameworks
    for smart city monitoring by using smart drones. Motlagh et al. [35] reviewed
    how UAVs operations support IoT services. The authors discussed the possibility
    of UAVs being equipped with IoT devices such as sensors, RFID devices, and cameras
    to collect data from monitoring areas. Also, in [33], the authors described drones''
    concepts equipped with IoT devices being used to deliver services to a wide coverage
    area. This paper mainly discussed how UAVs could be utilized to support crowd
    surveillance, depending on face recognition techniques. They compared the processing
    of video data on MEC and UAV payload. The findings showed the MEC-based offloading
    technique''s superiority, as demonstrated by lesser processing time and energy
    consumption. Hence, gathering data from IoT devices on the ground with improving
    energy efficiency was not addressed. Loke [36] outlined the challenges and open
    issues related to fog computing and UAVs for efficient data collection. However,
    in [30], the authors extended the collaboration between UAVs and IoT for enabling
    connectivity. The finding showed that the connectivity rate was reduced with increased
    UAVs’ height because more significant interference occurred by increasing the
    path loss. In [37], the authors discussed the opportunities, challenges, and applications
    of UAVs in smart cities. Moreover, cybersecurity issues, public safety, and privacy
    issues related to the application of UAVs for smart cities were discussed in [38].
    Many researchers have discussed green IoT with the help of UAVs, but for specific
    applications and purposes such as security [39,40], energy efficiency [41] networking,
    5G [42,43], and autonomy [44]. Furthermore, the QoS from space technologies is
    considered to improve greening communication [45], [46], [47], [48], public safety
    [49], and disaster recovery [50,51]. The authors in [52] discussed the use of
    using UAVs for green logistics, healthcare, and agriculture. The authors in [41]
    studied a UAVs-assisted wireless system and focused on maximizing the vehicle''s
    rate on the ground to join the UAV''s trajectory while maintaining UAV''s energy
    constraints. Furthermore, the optimal trajectory is introduced for balancing QoS
    and energy efficiency intelligently using Q-learning [53], [54], [55], [56], RF
    band allocation [57], and wireless power transfer to recharge the UAVs [58]. Briefly,
    the surveys in [35] and [33] are primarily limited to UAVs'' architecture to deliver
    IoT services. Also, [59] introduced the benefits and applications of UAVs for
    wireless telecommunications. More so, [31] and [29] discussed enabling technologies
    that integrate smart cities and UAVs to be greener and smarter. Additionally,
    in [38], the authors only addressed UAVs for public safety and privacy, monitoring
    smart cities [34]. Surprisingly, no survey has been thoroughly carried out, given
    the importance of using UAVs to green IoT and enhance the smart world''s quality
    of life. In light of the above, Table1 shows a comparison of the related work
    in this area. Table 1. Comparison of existing surveys. Ref. Highlighted UAV IoT

    survey on efficient and intelligent UAV techniques, which have been proposed in
    the literature in recent years for greening IoT. The paper focuses on different
    criteria for continuing connectivity between UAVs and IoT devices to improve QoS
    metrics (path loss, Received Signal Strength (RSS), bandwidth, drop rate delay),
    and energy efficiency and reducing hazardous pollution. The rest of the survey
    is organized as shown in Fig.2. The overview of using UAV technology for green
    IoT is discussed in Section II. Section III, IV, and V discuss how the UAVs are
    used for energy efficiency, green ICT, and reducing pollution hazards. Applications
    of UAVs are discussed in Section VI. Then, the future scope and conclusion are
    discussed in Section VII and VIII, respectively. Download : Download high-res

    Overview of using UAVs for greening IoT To green IoT, energy efficiency plays
    a crucial role in achieving the reliability and sustainability of services in
    smart cities [61]. In networking, green IoT aims to determine the relay location
    and the number of nodes that satisfy the power consumption and budget constraints.
    Hence, the devices are proposed to be equipped with sensors and communication
    add-ons. They can sense the surrounding things and communicate with each other.
    Green IoT focuses on green design, green manufacturing, green utilization, and
    green disposal [62]. Arshad et al. [63] evaluated efficient techniques for greening
    IoT based on reducing energy consumption. Green IoT includes design and leverage
    aspects, as shown in Fig. 3. The design aspect includes communications protocols,
    designing energy-efficient computing devices, and networking architectures for
    interconnecting physical applications in smart cities [60]. Leveraged technologies
    are used for improving IoT in terms of cutting pollution hazards and enhancing
    energy efficiency. Moreover, green IoT involves various strategies and techniques
    for reducing energy consumption, reducing CO2 emissions, and reducing IoT devices''
    pollution. UAVs play an essential role in enhancing IoT devices'' performance
    to improve life quality and green environment. Download : Download high-res image

    aspects. Recently, UAVs represent a microcosm of IoT. The advantages of using
    a UAV for green IoT include better connectivity and lower prices. Equipment such
    as sensors and cameras are used for remote control and navigation of the drones.
    UAVs can collect data from the ground of any environment by IoT devices carried
    in the UAV payload. The drones'' service delivery is implemented using wireless
    communication technologies, including 5G, LTE, and Wi-Fi. Connecting many UAVs
    (drone swarms) in the sky will enable many new services and business opportunities.
    Noting UAVs’ mobility and agility, swarms can enhance the QoS and improve temporary
    events'' capacity and coverage in 5G cellular networks [64]. Fig. 4 shows how
    UAVs can deliver broadband services to large coverage areas. For providing smart
    city monitoring, disaster recovery, and traffic monitoring, multi-UAV swarms can
    be used effectively. For instance, in [65], the UAV was used for delivering communication
    services when conventional wireless networks are destroyed, for supporting disaster
    recovery and SAR operations [66]. Similarly, Merwaday et al. [67] addressed how
    to use UAVs as a Base Station (BS) during a disaster for public safety and guiding
    SAR teams to perform complex tasks efficiently. In addition to the work of [65,67],
    Bor-Yaliniz et al. [68] envisioned UAV-assisted cellular networks for delivering
    wireless communication networks anywhere as per demand at any time. Predicting
    the coverage area of the UAV is of utmost importance for successfully performing
    the intended application. Alsamhi et al. [69] applied an intelligent technique
    for predicting the signal strength and demonstrated that the coverage area could
    be identified based on the signal strength. The authors in [70] introduced a solution
    for cooperative spectrum leasing among UAVs and cellular users during the disaster
    situations provide additional spectrum access for the UAVs in return to enhancing
    the quality of communications for cellular users through cooperative relaying.

    Fig. 4. Multi-UAV for providing services to large coverage areas. Furthermore,
    a statistical method to predict the path loss between a UAV and a terrestrial
    wireless terminal was presented in [71]. The authors of [72] also addressed the
    path loss prediction from the aerial platforms above urban environments. In [30],
    the authors introduced the drones'' coexistence techniques and distributed IoT
    devices on the ground-based stations in Machine to Machine (M2M) communication
    networks. Emerging advanced technologies such as 4G/5G/6G have potential applications
    for UAVs equipped with IoT devices and Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers
    for delivering IoT services in many applications from great heights. The authors
    of [73] discussed the importance of UAVs with advanced intelligence techniques
    to cope with the delay and minimize overhead limitations of Vehicle Ad hoc NETworks
    (VANETs). Many scenarios need a UAV to gather data from different real-time applications
    in the smart world, such as public safety, dynamic agriculture coordination, disaster
    management, recovery, data routing, monitoring accident, intelligent transport
    systems, intelligent flying BS [74], and relay data from isolated sensors to a
    BS. Table 2 illustrates the scenarios in which UAVs have already been used to
    gather data for various applications. The UAVs that carry IoT devices can also
    store and process data to enable a UAV to perform tasks effectively. Due to the
    energy required for processing IoT tasks and data urgency, the authors of [75]
    suggested that data processing should be performed locally. After that, the processed
    data should be forwarded to the server for taking necessary actions. Data gathered
    by UAVs has been collected to assist the research teams in serving so many applications.

    and store data on the devices themselves, but they involve large hardware and
    power requirements. Therefore, the drone''s use will reduce energy usage and control
    of both sleep and active IoT devices for greening IoT. The authors of [91] consider
    a UAV as a sink node in a wireless communication network to collect data from
    the sensors at any event. They also investigated the optimization of the UAV network
    service area. Processing data on the UAVs is required for data-intensive operations
    such as dynamic sense, image processing, and path planning. In [92], the authors
    designed efficient data processing devices to process data in low power consumption.
    Furthermore, in [93], the authors employed Machine Learning (ML) techniques to
    an image captured by IoT devices such as cameras onboard a drone. A Convolutional
    Neural Network (CNN) with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used for the image
    recognition tasks. Briefly, gathering data by using UAVs can be done in several
    ways: (i) UAVs collecting data from IoT devices deployed in any environment and
    then delivering gathered data to the nearest BS [94], (ii) UAVs equipped with
    smart IoT devices to collect data directly from any problematic place to reach
    [95], (iii) UAVs equipped with smart IoT devices and collaborate with smart IoT
    devices in smart cities. For example, UAVs are utilized for public safety and
    data collection from SAR''s smart wearable devices to perform specific tasks.
    3. Energy efficiency The UAV can provide energy efficiency for IoT devices by
    minimizing their power consumption. To save energy while sending the data captured
    by the IoT devices, the UAVs can move toward IoT devices to gather data. The UAVs
    advanced communication technologies such as B5G can exchange data with IoT devices
    in smart environments. The authors in [16] applied the genetic algorithm to improve
    drone-assisted IoT sensor networks based on energy consumption, sensor density,
    flight time, and fly risk level. The authors of [96] summarized the strategies
    for green cellular IoT based on energy saving. Applying controlling and processing
    techniques in UAVs are the essential points in saving energy. A UAV is equipped
    with IoT devices to process, manage the data, and then deliver it efficiently,
    taking advantage of LoS with the transmitters [75]. A cooperative framework for
    the drone-based wireless sensor network (WSN) was presented in [97]. It composes
    of fixed-group leaders, drone-sink, and sensor nodes. This study showed that the
    energy consumption and processing complexity of the leader''s election are reduced.
    In [98], the authors discussed the strategies and techniques of drone-based WSN
    for collecting data. The proposed techniques and strategies could reduce energy
    consumption, extend flying time, and reduce data collection latency. In [99],
    the authors presented an algorithm to collect data in WSNs by applying UAVs and
    mobile agent technologies. Both techniques were shown to contribute to saving
    time and energy consumption of sensor nodes. More so, in [100], the authors proposed
    a model of one IoT device''s efficient energy. Additionally, the authors of [101]
    explored the importance of drones'' cooperation with WSNs to improve energy-efficiency
    by relaying to extend their lifetime. The outcomes showed that the proposed technique
    reduced delay and improved UAV routing with a better coverage area. In [102],
    the authors proposed an efficient power consumption model to consider the load
    factor and speed for the drone-based relay. Furthermore, a wired UAV docking system
    was presented to implement several functions via the collaboration of UAV and
    IoT devices to improve energy efficiency, reduce wasted resources, and ensure
    security among them [103]. In [104], the authors introduced drones'' applications
    for improving IoT security platforms, emergency response, and building monitoring
    by utilizing beacons. Research targeted towards extending the battery life in
    UAVs has also been performed. Authors of [105] discussed an automatic battery
    as a replacement technique, while an automatic battery allowed the UAV to keep
    working indefinitely without any manual intervention. This mechanism successfully
    looked into the power management in UAVs for continuous surveillance indoor and
    outdoor environments. For UAV- deployment energy efficiency, the authors of [102]
    introduced an energy efficiency approach using a channel model. The communication
    of UAVs with energy efficiency was investigated with trajectory optimization [106].
    The authors of [107] introduced the use of UAVs to enable MECs and measure the
    optimal altitude and throughput. Furthermore, designing UAVs communication trajectories
    improve energy efficiency [56,108]. The trajectory optimization uses for recharging
    UAVs using Q-learning [54] and balances energy consumption and QoS [53]. In [109],
    the maximization of UAVs'' energy efficiency is discussed, in which the UAVs are
    deployed as a relay station to amplify the signal strength between the IoT devices
    and end node (center). The authors of [110] focused on the energy consumption
    of UAVs and optimal MECs offloading. The energy harvesting IoT performance by
    using UAVs with Nakagami-m fading is discussed in [111]. Table 3 summarizes the
    advantages of using UAVs for enhancing the energy efficiency towards greening
    IoT. Table 3. UAV for energy efficiency to green IoT. Ref Highlight Advantages

    and communication technology (ICT) plays a vital role in green IoT devices. Green
    ICT focuses on green RFID technology, green sensor networks technology, green
    cellular networks, etc. [117]. IoT poses a high potential to bolster environmental
    sustainability and economic [105] with the advancements of enabling technologies.
    The evaluation and impact of ICT on power consumption and CO2 emissions, which
    are increasing rapidly and damaging our environment, are highlighted in [118].
    4.1. RFID Reducing RFID tag size and developing energy-efficient algorithms to
    optimize the tag estimation are needed to green RFID [119,120]. Hubbard et al.
    [121] addressed the techniques required to enhance UAVs'' battery lifetime and
    the importance of RFID reader detection range. The benefit of integrated RFIDs
    and UAVs is the support of additional information that could be used in the supply
    chain of management systems. In the same context, in [122], the authors used a
    feasibility analysis to recharge the multipurpose RFID tags in UAVs for monitoring
    environment with energy balancing demonstration. Furthermore, the authors of [123]
    presented an efficient solution to monitor harsh environments using the combination
    of UAVs and RFIDs. The finding showed that the UAV equipped a set of RFID tags
    and sensors to monitor a specific area. Furthermore, the findings showed that
    the combined technologies worked correctly, and tags had the power to monitor
    instruments, particularly where the monitoring is required for a harsh environment.
    UAVs are used to gather data from RFID and scattered throughout the area [123].
    The combinations of RFID and UAV work in conjunction, and tags are powerful for
    monitoring the instruments while the monitoring is required to deliver service
    in a large area in harsh environment. Moreover, in [124], the authors introduced
    UAVs with indoor localization techniques using RFID systems. Their main aim is
    to achieve simplicity and cost-efficiency. UAV tracking and localization are considered
    to achieve simplicity and cost efficiency by using radio-frequency shadowing,
    observation of received signal strength indicator (RSSI), and interference under
    indoor environments. A summary of using a UAV with RFID for green IoT is shown
    in Table.4. Table 4. UAV and ICT technology for green IoT. Ref Technology Highlight

    cities for data gathering and measuring global and local environmental conditions.
    A sensor node contains several small, low-cost, and low-power electronic devices
    such as a battery, sensing unit, a storage unit, a processing unit, and a communication
    unit [125]. These nodes suffer from scarce resources (i.e., limited sensing range,
    battery power, communication range, storage, process, and computing resources)
    [126]. Every sensor can read data from its surroundings such as sound, temperature,
    pressure, acceleration, humidity, etc. [127]. Furthermore, sensors collaborate
    and communicate with each other in a sensing environment based on 5G and deliver
    the BS''s required sensory data using ad-hoc technology. Mehmood et al. [128]
    discussed the smart control of energy-efficiency in routing protocols for WSN
    concerning the design trade-offs. Traditional routing protocols in WSNs are generally
    challenging to maintain desirable network performance due to the unstable environment
    situations and application requirements. The sink node will drive some relay nodes
    in the path to deplete their batteries earlier than others. Unbalanced-energy
    consumption routing results in a shorter network lifetime. In contrast, dynamic
    path routing with the assistance of probabilistic forwarding is a proper solution
    since it distributes the network''s traffic load and the energy consumption in
    the network. Such challenges are discussed in [129] [127]. WSNs have been used
    for various applications such as environment monitoring [125, [130], [131], [132]],
    fire detection [133], [134], [135], object tracking [136], [137], [138], evolving
    constraints in the military [139], monitoring machine health, and monitoring the
    industrial processing [125]. Green IoT benefits from keeping the sensors mode
    in sleeping to save energy [140, 141]. Recently, sensor nodes gain energy harvested
    from their environment, including sun, kinetic energy, vibrations, temperature
    differentials and so on [142], [143], [144]. WSNs supply sufficient power to improve
    the lifetime of the system and reliable transmission. IoT networks require a large
    number of sensors deployed for monitoring a specific environment. To enhance UAVs
    function, Malaver et al. [145] discussed integrating UAVs technology and WSN technology.
    The CO2 concentration was monitored during the data collection in real-time by
    integrating UAV and WSN technologies. The integrated system is recommended and
    applicable for many applications, including mining studies, agriculture, bushfires,
    botanical and zoological domains [146]. Besides, the authors of [147] introduced
    an efficient technique called Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for analyzing
    data gathered by integrated UAV and WSN technologies systems. Further, integrated
    UAV and WSN technologies are used for data gathering with low power from large
    coverage areas [148]. The integrated system indicated an efficient solution for
    energy utilized resources [97,101]. The UAVs can manage node duty cycling status,
    i.e., sleep or active. Furthermore, WSNs and smart drones’ cooperation was utilized
    to reduce energy consumption during the routing process, which highly maximized
    IoT devices [101]. Moreover, the authors of [149] presented the communication
    links between the WSN nodes and UAVs to optimize wireless medium scheduling and
    UAV trajectory setting for reducing nodes'' energy consumption while gathering
    the sensory data from the target environment. This idea is supported by a study
    in [150], which revealed that energy consumption is reduced due to a drone''s
    use, which can move sequentially closer to the target environment and gather WSNs
    nodes'' data from short distances. Moreover, Rashed et al. [87] presented the
    tradeoff between operation time and nodes'' coverage to choose the right mobility
    pattern for UAVs. Data takes two ways to gather data, i.e., data transmitted from
    the sensor nodes on the WSN environment to the UAV and data gathered by sensor
    nodes equipped in the UAV board. Collected data is sent from the UAV to the cloud
    for analysis. Furthermore, wireless medium allocation and energy allocation of
    sensory data in the first and second ways are considered and discussed deeply
    [151]. Table. 4 shows a summary of methods for using a UAV with sensors for green
    IoT. The combination of UAV and WSN for monitoring extensive scale application
    is summarized in [152]. The collaboration between the WSN and UAVs becomes the
    cheapest and friendly for monitoring smart applications in the real world with
    intelligence techniques. The authors of [153] introduced the collaboration between
    the UAV, WSNs, and IoT for crop monitoring and precision agriculture. Briefly,
    with the help of UAV, the communication bandwidth between the UAV and WSN is enhanced,
    the energy required for data transmission is reduced, and the coverage area is
    extended. Therefore, the monitoring and data gathering from WSN improve efficiently.
    The collaboration of WSN and UAVs plays a vital role in improving energy efficiency,
    processing locally, making decisions, and extending the coverage using clustering
    techniques, as shown in Fig.5. Download : Download high-res image (245KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 5. WSN and UAV collaboration. 4.3. B5G Nowadays,
    5G represents a promising technology that impacts our life and environment, even
    in improving the IoT performance, as shown in Fig. 6. The B5G applications include
    robotic communications, e-health, the interaction between the robots and humans,
    media, e-learning, public safety, e-governance, transport and logistics, industrial
    and automotive systems. Green wireless communication technologies play a crucial
    role in greening IoT. It refers to sustainable, energy-efficient, energy-aware,
    and environmentally-aware technologies. The green communication network idea is
    aimed at reducing CO2 emissions, radiation exposure, and energy consumption. Abrol
    et al. [154] presented the growing and influence need for energy efficiency. Energy
    efficiency adaption fulfills the demands for enhancing data rate, increasing the
    capacity, and providing high QoS of the next-generation networks (NGN). Many research
    types have been done to save energy by using solar power to enhance QoS [50, [155],
    [156], [157], [158], [159], [160]]. Koutitas et al. [161] used genetic algorithm
    optimization to develop network planning. The finding showed significantly CO2
    reduction, cost-saving, and low radiation exposure. In the same direction, Naeem
    et al. [162] disused how to minimize CO2 emissions and maximize the data rate
    in the cognitive WSNs environment. Download : Download high-res image (573KB)

    The study in [163] discussed a set of system parameters in order to evaluate the
    energy consumption and the CO2 emissions of wireless communication networks. Moreover,
    Motlagh et al. [164] presented a steering technique among multiple 4G networks
    for ensuring efficient and reliable network connection from drones, in which the
    UAV improves the QoS and costs to an acceptable amount of energy. Also, Xu [165]
    proposed a single UAV framework representing a sink node and a head cluster of
    sensors in a specific environment, considering a low message delay. On the other
    hand, the broad UAVs'' energy is a challenge, while protocols should help the
    UAVs network [166]. Therefore, UAVs are a promising technology to delegate wireless
    services to large coverage areas with reducing energy consumption. The authors
    of [167] discussed the energy efficiency of heterogeneous 5G cellular networks
    with the help of UAVs’ help. They formulated how the efficient coverage of UAVs
    is improved with energy efficiency. A summary of the advantages of using UAVs
    with 5G technology for green IoT is shown in Table 4. The development of an integrated
    UAV and B5G network with intelligent techniques can consider balancing the extended
    coverage area at the cost of energy consumption or increasing the number of UAV
    with improving QoS. 5. Hazardous pollution Newly monitoring environmental pollution
    is an essential concern in our world. WSNs can be utilized to monitor environmental
    pollutions. However, the transmission power of sensor nodes is limited to transmit
    data in real-time. Thus, the authors of [174] developed a UAV system capable of
    measuring point source emissions. The study focuses on the airflow behavior and
    the performance of CO, CO2, NO2, and NO sensors for measuring the emissions in
    a particular area. The greenhouses'' pollution should also be taken into consideration
    for controlling the gas emission from the greenhouses. The study in [146] emphasized
    the importance of a solar-powered UAV equipped with a CO2 sensing system integrated
    with a WSN to control pollution produced from the greenhouses. Flexible deployment
    has been found an appropriate technology for air pollution monitoring [175]. Authors
    in [176] studied the existing UAV techniques for monitoring the application environment.
    Heuristic and PSO techniques monitor the particular area and focus on the most
    polluted zones [177]. Moreover, the study in [178] introduced an efficient module
    for UAV platform to monitor multiple air pollutants in real-time. The study in
    [179] improved the idea of combining UAVs and mobile stations, which can be navigated
    autonomously for pollution monitoring. The UAV was used as a platform in air quality
    research, focusing on the roadside air pollution profiling. However, Zang et al.
    [180] demonstrated experiences in applying UAVs in the water pollution investigation
    in Southwest China in the presence of high altitude, low air pressure, strong
    air turbulence, severe weather, and cloud cover. The authors of [181] summarized
    the UAVs’ importance for monitoring hazardous pollution and emission of chemical
    materials. Simultaneously, the authors of [182] focused on designing UAVs for
    monitoring the air quality base on IoT technology. The finding shows that air
    pollution data was efficient and in real-time. 6. Use-cases UAVs are the merger
    of various mature and advanced technologies that have rightly attracted much attention
    worldwide. Due to their appeals for smart applications, their deployment is a
    new potential market. The primary objective of developing a drone-based system
    is to meet large operational areas, high mobility, low cost, rapid deployment,
    and acceptable positioning accuracy. Connecting the UAVs will enable many new
    services and business opportunities. Klimkowska et al. [175] discussed using UAVs
    for various maritime applications such as red tide detection, ship detection,
    monitoring, border patrol tracking, and the ability to fly over hazardous and
    dangerous areas. Green IoT makes smart devices connect to the real-world efficiently.
    The numerous green IoT applications include smart homes, smart cities, smart grids,
    smart agriculture, and smart healthcare. The data-gathering potential of UAVs
    and IoT devices is enormous. The drone''s ability to fly over crops, houses, and
    cities makes a perfect platform solution to collect data that was once too expensive
    to gather and difficult for a human to do. It is envisaged that the things around
    us will be smarter and greener because of a drone''s capability to fly rapidly
    and collect data in real-time. 6.1. Smart homes Recently, UAVs have been creating
    enormous development in our society, bringing new leaps toward home surveillance
    and security. UAVs integrated with IoT devices like cameras are envisaged for
    security and surveillance of smart homes, company establishments, and government
    offices. For secure smart home applications, a tethered UAV can carry the required
    monitoring devices in the payload. It uses solar-powered sensor nodes for sensing
    physical movements, as well as any acoustic signals. For such applications, the
    UAV has to remain in the proximity of the house/office under surveillance. The
    wireless technique is also used for charging the battery of UAVs and the IoT devices
    in the UAV payload. 6.2. Smart cities Recently, UAVs are being used to improve
    the life quality in smart cities by documenting accident and emergency scenes,
    providing first responder activities in disaster and emergency cases, and monitoring
    construction sites [183], [184], [185]. Smart cities need smart sensory data.
    IoT devices are used to collect data, while UAVs are used as edge computing nodes
    to collect and process the data from IoT devices. Integration of UAV and IoT plays
    a critical role in enhancing the quality of life for city residents. Furthermore,
    decreasing the number of IoT devices can be done using a drone, which can be used
    to save energy and reduce the CO2 emission and pollution of IoT devices. Won et
    al. [186] presented a study on secure communication protocols between the UAV
    and IoT devices for refining the elegance of smart cities. The protocols deliberated
    include multiple kinds of fixed IoT devices and mobile devices with different
    capacities. Numerous UAVs in forthcoming smart cities viz. privacy, cybersecurity,
    and public safety are discussed in detail [187]. Furthermore, UAVs applications
    for smart cities and the opportunities to crack today''s problems have been discussed
    in [186,188]. Lately, crimes, such as terrorism, vandalism, and street crimes,
    have increased in urban areas. Therefore, anticipating crimes through the detection
    of criminals among people crowds is vital. In this vein, UAVs can be used to detect,
    track, and recognize criminals, follow their movements, thereby providing immunity
    from any unwanted situation. UAVs have also been considered as relay stations
    in other research directions to collect and transmit data from IoT devices in
    many applications such as emergency services, healthcare, pollution monitoring,
    traffic tracking, surveillance, fire detection, earthquakes, etc. With the use
    of drones, deployment time, cost, and energy consumption are reduced. Consequently,
    UAVs are graceful to become an integrated part of the smart cities communication
    network for being deployed to quickly collect, analyze, aggregate, and deliver
    highly accurate and detailed data. 6.3. Smart agriculture Agricultural UAVs are
    a modern technique used in farming to be used for aerial imagery with significant
    efficiency. UAVs offer useful data processing capabilities via cloud-based computing
    in delivering aerial monitoring applications in real-time and intelligence-gathering.
    The study in [189] explained several potential applications that required the
    UAVs to collaborate with sensors to perform tasks efficiently, such as remote
    crop monitoring, soil moisture sensing, infrastructure monitoring, monitoring
    water quality, and remote sensor deployment. UAV fogs are required to replace
    massive IoT devices, which will decrease pollution and power consumption. UAV''s
    low cost and efficiency are essential in agricultural operations for monitoring
    and helps farmers know all things about their fields [190]. In [191], Almalki
    proposed an adaptive drone model to detect food quality and safety. Briefly, UAVs
    are used in agriculture for providing transformation, data collecting, and monitoring
    fields regularly. 6.4. Smart grid The UAV-IoT equipment maintains power distribution
    lines, and natural gas pipelines [192]. Nowadays, one of the most significant
    drone''s applications is to carry out the often dangerous work of power crews
    in investigating storm damage or maintaining power lines. Hence, UAVs integrated
    with IoT devices can find and inspect downed power lines quicker than manned crew
    members. Also, UAVs can cover larger areas while protecting crew members from
    danger. UAVs can transmit real-time data and live video streams toward the smart
    grid systems in such an application, allowing power consumption to be managed
    by potential electrical issues like never before. Consequently, UAVs decrease
    both inspection times and costs [193]. In [194], discussed the potential solution
    for communication and management of smart grid domain with the help of edge UAV
    to avoid the delay-tolerant network of UAV and IoT network. 6.5. Smart healthcare
    UAVs play a vital role in picking and fast delivering vaccines, medicine, and
    blood samples to any places. Currently, UAV is used to comb COVID-19 based on
    the above functions and monitor and avoid human interaction [7,195]. Furthermore,
    it enables delivering efficient healthcare to patients, including blood, birth
    control pills, medical supplies to rural areas, vaccines, and snakebite serum
    [196]. Reaching on time, in some cases, could mean the difference between death
    and life. Therefore, the UAV can reach victims who need immediate medical attention
    within minutes. UAVs also can transport medicine within the hospital as well as
    carry blood between hospital buildings. Furthermore, UAVs give elderly patients
    tools to support them and offer various exciting possibilities to the healthcare
    industry for saving time, cost, and lives. UAVs can also deliver medical supplies
    and food aid to areas hit by natural or human-made disasters. Therefore, drones,
    along with wearable and implantable technologies, will revolutionize healthcare
    due to their ability to continuously work alongside IoT sensors to monitor people''s
    health continuously. By utilizing these combined technologies, patients may not
    need to travel miles to get a diagnosis. 7. Future scopes and insights Tremendous
    efforts have been made in making IoT technologies greener. However, they still
    face significant challenges from many aspects, such as limited energy, pollution
    hazards, and QoS. UAV technology is finding its way into greening IoT, and it
    is considered the future of IoT. Despite the tremendous advantages of the UAV
    edge intelligence concept for delivering service in real-time and providing high-reliability
    services to IoT devices in several applications, reducing energy consumption,
    reducing delays, and providing efficient bandwidth, there are still several open
    issues and challenges as discussed in the following. The authors addressed the
    convergence of UAV edge intelligence and blockchain for solving the challenges
    in B5G networks for Industry 4.0 applications [197]. 7.1. Efficient UAV trajectory
    Adjusting the trajectory of the UAVs is challenging. Therefore, designing an efficient
    trajectory to meet computing tasks is another open research problem. While considerable
    research has been dedicated to UAV''s trajectory planning, developing autonomous
    and efficient trajectory planning techniques taking into the account various factors
    such as task priority, delay, user locations, and energy consumption is still
    an open research direction. 7.2. Energy efficiency The limited battery capacity
    of the UAVs represents a critical constraint. Apart from the drone''s energy consumption
    and communication, a UAV also needs energy for computational tasks. The field
    of energy-efficient propulsion of drones, in which the required energy on a UAV
    for computing and communication is optimized, still needs further investigation.
    Furthermore, recharge scheduling and energy harvesting may be considered as another
    direction for improving the drone''s battery capacity. Furthermore, clustering
    users or IoT devices to collaborate for saving energy is another viable direction
    of research. For example, each user/ vehicle/ IoT device can serve as the neighbor
    inside the cluster to reduce energy consumption. Since the distance of transmission
    between neighbors is shorter than that of the drones, the energy efficiency may
    increase significantly in such cases. Regarding the reviewed current literature
    focusing on UAV edge intelligence for greening IoT in different applications and
    from different aspects such as energy efficiency, connectivity, and pollution
    hazardous, we believe more future research is required to be done as shown in
    Table 5. Furthermore, we addressed the challenges of UAVs during performing tasks
    in order to green IoT, as shown in Table 6. Table 5. Research directions, challenges,
    and insights. Study Directions Challenges Future insights [35] (2016) Drone-based

    our lives in numerous ways to protect our environment, and society by sensing
    and cooperatively communicating over the internet. Finding suitable and efficient
    techniques for greening IoT is required to improve our quality and sustainability
    of resources. Collaborative UAVs and IoT have the potential to change our daily
    lives drastically and make a smarter and greener world. UAVs equipped with IoT
    devices are used in many applications to perform complex tasks efficiently at
    a low cost. We found that UAVs technology plays a critical role in reducing energy,
    reducing pollution, and enhancing the connectivity and QoS of IoT devices. Throughout
    this survey, we discuss the importance of emerging UAVs for greening IoT based
    on efficient techniques that can enable green ICT technologies, increase energy
    efficiency, and tackle pollution hazards. We thoroughly identify key challenges
    and future insights of UAVs for green IoT. We hope that the critical research
    challenges and research insights described in this paper will help specify the
    way for researchers to improve collaborative UAVs for green IoT applications in
    the future. 9. Funding This project has received funding from the European Union''s

    Abstract: The growth of the global population coupled with a decline in natural\
    \ resources, farmland,\nand the increase in unpredictable environmental conditions\
    \ leads to food security is becoming a major\nconcern for all nations worldwide.\
    \ These problems are motivators that are driving the agricultural\nindustry to\
    \ transition to smart agriculture with the application of the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) and\nbig data solutions to improve operational efﬁciency and productivity.\
    \ The IoT integrates a series\nof existing state-of-the-art solutions and technologies,\
    \ such as wireless sensor networks, cognitive\nradio ad hoc networks, cloud computing,\
    \ big data, and end-user applications. This study presents\na survey of IoT solutions\
    \ and demonstrates how IoT can be integrated into the smart agriculture\nsector.\
    \ To achieve this objective, we discuss the vision of IoT-enabled smart agriculture\
    \ ecosystems\nby evaluating their architecture (IoT devices, communication technologies,\
    \ big data storage, and\nprocessing), their applications, and research timeline.\
    \ In addition, we discuss trends and opportunities\nof IoT applications for smart\
    \ agriculture and also indicate the open issues and challenges of IoT\napplication\
    \ in smart agriculture. We hope that the ﬁndings of this study will constitute\
    \ important\nguidelines in research and promotion of IoT solutions aiming to improve\
    \ the productivity and quality\nof the agriculture sector as well as facilitating\
    \ the transition towards a future sustainable environment\nwith an agroecological\
    \ approach.\nKeywords: sustainable agriculture; food security; green technologies;\

    1. Introduction\nIn order to meet the current global needs of humanity, new solutions\
    \ and technologies\nare constantly being proposed and implemented. This has led\
    \ to the advent of the Inter-\nnet of Things (IoT) [1,2]. IoT is deﬁned as the\
    \ network of all objects that are embedded\nwithin devices, sensors, machines,\
    \ software and people through the Internet environment\nto communicate, exchange\
    \ information and interact in order to provide a comprehen-\nsive solution between\
    \ the real world and the virtual world [3]. In recent years, IoT has\nbeen applied\
    \ in a series of domains, such as smart homes [4,5], smart cities [6,7], smart\n\
    energy [8,9], autonomous vehicles [10,11], smart agriculture [12–15], campus manage-\n\
    ment [16,17], healthcare [18,19], and logistics [20,21]. Series of other IoT applications\
    \ have\nbeen described by Shaﬁque et al. [22]. An illustration of rich and diverse\
    \ IoT applications\nfor smart agriculture is provided in Figure 1.\nAppl. Sci.\
    \ 2022, 12, 3396. https://doi.org/10.3390/app12073396\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/applsci\n\
    Appl. Sci. 2022, 12, 3396\n2 of 19\nIn recent years, with the aim of increasing\
    \ agricultural production, new solutions and \ntechnologies have been introduced\
    \ in the agriculture sector [24]. An emerging trend is the \napplication of the\
    \ IoT and big data. A significant number of studies have been focused on \nresearch,\
    \ experiments, and applications [25,26]. According to the Cisco forecast, over\
    \ 500 \nbillion IoT devices will be connected to the Internet by 2030 [27]. The\
    \ use of IoT and big \ndata will enable smart agriculture and is expected to enhance\
    \ efficiency and productivity \n[28]. \n \nFigure 1. An illustration of IoT applications\
    \ for smart agriculture. \nOver the years, wireless sensor networks (WSN) have\
    \ been strongly applied in the \nagricultural sector, building the foundation\
    \ for developing smart agriculture [29]. The \nunique characteristics of WSN,\
    \ such as the ability to self-organize, self-configure, self-es-\ntablish, and\
    \ self-recover, make it suitable for smart agriculture [30]. The sensor device\
    \ \nconsists of a radio frequency (RF) transceiver, sensor, microcontroller, and\
    \ battery power \n[31]. The WSN focuses on applications such as environmental\
    \ monitoring, machine con-\ntrol automation, and traceability [32–35]. \nAlong\
    \ with the development of science and technology, the urgent requirement for \n\
    breakthrough solutions and technologies aiming at improving productivity and efficiency\
    \ \nin the agriculture sector has led to adoption of the IoT. The primary motivation\
    \ for their \napplications is the breakthrough progress of smart agriculture and\
    \ its inevitable role as \nthe future of smart and sustainable environment management.\
    \ IoT integrates a series of \nexisting solutions and technologies, such as WSN,\
    \ cognitive radio, ad hoc networks, cloud \ncomputing, and end-user applications\
    \ [36]. In the smart agricultural sector, automation \nsolutions and technologies,\
    \ mechanical machines, knowledge, decision-making tools, ser-\nvices, and software\
    \ are integrated seamlessly to help farmers improve productivity, prod-\nuct quality,\
    \ and profitability [37]. \nFigure 1. An illustration of IoT applications for\
    \ smart agriculture.\nAccording to the United Nations’ (UN 2019) statistics, the\
    \ world population is esti-\nmated to grow to 10 billion by 2050 [23]. As a consequence,\
    \ the requirements of agricultural\nproducts are continually increasing. However,\
    \ farmlands are declining, natural resources\nare increasingly depleted, and the\
    \ rise of unpredictable nature challenges, such as global\nwarming, salinization,\
    \ and ﬂooding, make food security the most concerning problem for\nall nations\
    \ worldwide.\nIn recent years, with the aim of increasing agricultural production,\
    \ new solutions and\ntechnologies have been introduced in the agriculture sector\
    \ [24]. An emerging trend is the\napplication of the IoT and big data. A signiﬁcant\
    \ number of studies have been focused on\nresearch, experiments, and applications\
    \ [25,26]. According to the Cisco forecast, over 500\nbillion IoT devices will\
    \ be connected to the Internet by 2030 [27]. The use of IoT and big data\nwill\
    \ enable smart agriculture and is expected to enhance efﬁciency and productivity\
    \ [28].\nOver the years, wireless sensor networks (WSN) have been strongly applied\
    \ in the agri-\ncultural sector, building the foundation for developing smart\
    \ agriculture [29]. The unique\ncharacteristics of WSN, such as the ability to\
    \ self-organize, self-conﬁgure, self-establish,\nand self-recover, make it suitable\
    \ for smart agriculture [30]. The sensor device consists of a\nradio frequency\
    \ (RF) transceiver, sensor, microcontroller, and battery power [31]. The WSN\n\
    focuses on applications such as environmental monitoring, machine control automation,\n\
    and traceability [32–35].\nAlong with the development of science and technology,\
    \ the urgent requirement for\nbreakthrough solutions and technologies aiming at\
    \ improving productivity and efﬁciency\nin the agriculture sector has led to adoption\
    \ of the IoT. The primary motivation for their\napplications is the breakthrough\

    solutions and technologies, mechanical machines, knowledge, decision-making tools,\
    \ ser-\nvices, and software are integrated seamlessly to help farmers improve\
    \ productivity, product\nquality, and proﬁtability [37].\nIn this work, a comprehensive\
    \ survey of IoT applications for smart agriculture is\nconducted. An analysis\
    \ of 135 relevant works published between 2017 and 2022 was con-\nducted. Firstly,\
    \ relevant 550 papers published in the period of (2017–2022) were retrieved\n\
    from major scientiﬁc databases, namely IEEE Xplore Digital Library, Science Direct,\
    \ MDPI,\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 3396\n3 of 19\nand Springer, by using keywords such\
    \ as IoT-enabled smart agriculture, smart agriculture,\nInternet of Things, aquaponics,\
    \ monitoring forestry based on IoT, tracking and tracing,\nsmart precision farming,\
    \ greenhouse production, Sigfox, LoRa, Wi-Fi, LoRaWAN, and\nIoT ecosystems. In\
    \ the next step, we excluded papers that were published in low-repute\nconferences\
    \ and journals, and then we conducted the content analysis for the obtained\n\
    paper. Finally, 135 papers were selected for the preparation of the present work.\n\
    In addition, we analyzed and discussed the beneﬁts and challenges, open issues,\n\
    trends, and opportunities of IoT in the smart agriculture sector. This work is\
    \ organized\nas follows: Section 1 introduces our work, and in Section 2, we present\
    \ an IoT ecosystem\narchitecture for smart agriculture that consists of three\
    \ main components: IoT devices,\ncommunication technology, and data storage and\
    \ big data processes. Section 3 presents\nthe IoT applications in agriculture,\
    \ including (1) monitoring, (2) tracking and traceability,\n(3) precision agriculture,\
    \ and (4) greenhouses. Section 4 introduces some open issues and\nfuture research\
    \ challenges of IoT for smart agriculture. Issues are discussed for two main\n\
    directions: business and technology. In Section 5, we present the main conclusions\
    \ of this\nwork.\n2. IoT Ecosystem Architecture for Smart Agriculture\nIn this\
    \ section, we present a common framework of an IoT ecosystem for smart agri-\n\

    smart agriculture sector. Sensors can be divided into several typical categories,\
    \ such as\n(1) location sensor, (2) optical sensor, (3) mechanical sensor, (4)\
    \ electrochemical sensor, and\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 3396\n5 of 19\n(5) air ﬂow\

    soil temperature, air humidity, soil moisture, leaf moisture, precipitation, wind\
    \ speed, wind\ndirection, and solar radiation, and barometric pressure [21,24,36].\n\
    2.2. Communication Technology\nThe survey of communication technologies for IoT\
    \ [43,44] indicated that to integrate\nIoT into the smart agriculture sector,\
    \ communication technologies must progressively\nimprove the evolution of IoT\
    \ devices. They play an important role in the development of\nIoT systems. The\
    \ existing communication solutions can be classiﬁed as: protocol, spectrum,\n\
    and topology.\nProtocols: many wireless communication protocols have been proposed\
    \ for the smart\nagriculture sector. Based on these protocols, devices in a smart\
    \ agricultural system can\ninteract, exchange information, and make decisions\
    \ to monitor and control farming condi-\ntions and improve yields and production\
    \ efﬁciency. The typical, low-power communication\nprotocol numbers commonly used\
    \ in smart agriculture can be divided into short-range and\nlong-range categories\
    \ based on the communication range.\n-\nShort-range: NFMI (near-ﬁeld magnetic\
    \ induction) [45], Bluetooth [46], ZigBee [47],\nterahertz (Z-Wave) [48,49], and\
    \ RFID [50].\n-\nLong-range: LoRa [51], Sigfox [52], and NB-IoT (Narrowband IoT)\
    \ [53].\nTable 1 presents some typical communication technologies for the smart\
    \ agriculture\nsector. The values in Table 1 indicate that short-range communication\
    \ technologies have\na transmission distance of less than 20 (m), high energy\
    \ efﬁciency, and low data rate.\nThese protocols are often employed in sensor\
    \ networks, while long-range communication\ntechnologies have transmission distances\
    \ of up to several tens of kilometres, consume more\nenergy, and are installed\
    \ for backhaul device-to-device communications. A diverse survey\nof low-power\
    \ communication technologies for IoT that presents solutions, challenges, and\n\
    some open issues is described by Sundaram et al. [54].\nTable 1. Some typical\

    Spectrum: Each radio device uses certain frequency bands for communication. The\n\
    FCC (Federal Communications Commission) has deﬁned unlicensed spectrum bands for\n\
    unlicensed operations in scientiﬁc, industrial, and medical purposes [55]. These\
    \ spectrum\nbands are often applied for low-power levels and short-range applications.\
    \ Consequently, a\nseries of common technologies for the smart agriculture sector,\
    \ from wireless machine con-\ntrol and UAVs to communication technologies such\
    \ as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, use unlicensed\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 3396\n6 of 19\n\
    spectrum bands [56]. However, the use of unlicensed spectra faces several challenges,\
    \ such\nas the quality of service guarantee, the cost of setting up the initial\
    \ infrastructure, and the\ninterference generated by the huge number of IoT devices\
    \ [57,58].\nA licensed spectrum usually is allocated to mobile networks. It provides\
    \ more efﬁcient\nnetwork trafﬁc, more reliability, enhances the quality of service\
    \ (QoS), offers security,\nprovides extensive coverage, and involves lower initialization\
    \ infrastructure costs for users.\nHowever, the use of licensed spectrum bands\
    \ has faced some limitations, such as high data\ntransmission costs and the low\
    \ energy efﬁciency of IoT devices [59].\nSeveral recent studies have demonstrated\
    \ the efﬁciency of unlicensed spectrum bands\nin the mm wave range. It uses extremely\
    \ low power but provides large transmission\ndistances and high data rates [60,61].\
    \ One limitation of the mm wave spectrum is that the\ndata rate is strongly affected\
    \ by weather conditions, especially rain [62].\nTopology: The establishment of\
    \ the communication spectrum band and operation pro-\ntocol of IoT devices depends\
    \ on the structure that deploys IoT devices for smart agriculture\napplications.\
    \ Network structures for smart agriculture usually have two main types of\nnodes:\
    \ sensor and backhaul nodes [63]. The common characteristics of IoT sensor nodes\n\
    are short communication distance, low data rate, and high energy efﬁciency. In\
    \ contrast,\nIoT backhaul nodes often require large transmission distances, high\
    \ throughput, and data\nrates. Therefore, based on the role of each IoT network\
    \ node, the sensor node or backhaul\nnode selects and installs appropriate communication\
    \ technologies [64]. Figure 5 presents a\ntypical low-power network topology designed\
    \ for measuring and monitoring factors in a\nsmart farm. The system includes:\n\
    (1)\nIoT sensor nodes collect information from the farming environment, such as\
    \ soil\nmoisture, air humidity, temperature, nutrient ingredients of soil, pest\
    \ images, and\nwater quality, then transmit collected data to IoT backhaul devices.\
    \ Depending on\nthe operation purpose and installation location, IoT sensor nodes\
    \ can be installed as\nRFDs (reduced-function devices), which only communicate\
    \ with FFDs (full-function\ndevices). These nodes cannot communicate with the\
    \ other RFDs, aiming to save\nenergy and decrease investment costs.\n(2)\nIoT\
    \ backhaul nodes, besides having the role of an IoT sensor node, also play a role\
    \ as\nintermediate nodes to receive information from other IoT nodes and transmit\
    \ it to the\ncontrol centre. IoT backhaul nodes are often installed as an FFD\
    \ device, which can\nconnect to other FDD and RFD devices.\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12,\

    \ besides the main problems of sensing, collecting\ndata, and controlling devices\
    \ to respond to the real farming environment, data storage and\nprocessing are\
    \ also important problems and face some challenges [26,28]. In reality, the\n\
    number of collected data is huge, and traditional data storage, organization,\
    \ and processing\nsolutions are not feasible. Therefore, big data processing solutions\
    \ need to be researched\nand applied for smart agriculture [65,66].\nThe complexity\
    \ of data storage and processing is due to the unique characteristics\nof the\
    \ smart agriculture ﬁeld, including unstructured data and various formats, such\n\
    as text, images, audio and video, economic ﬁgures, and market information. Recent\n\
    solutions and technologies have introduced the use of cloud platforms for storage\
    \ and\ndata analytics, which are collected from farms [36,67]. In addition, cloud-assisted\
    \ big data\nanalytic solutions, such as edge computing [68] or fog computing [69],\
    \ are also proposed to\nreduce latency and costs and support QoS.\nThe survey\
    \ results demonstrate that, in recent years, many management information\nsystems\
    \ for smart agriculture have been proposed [70–72]. Nowadays, possible solutions\n\
    have been developed and commercialized, providing solutions and services for farmers\n\
    to manage farms and ﬁelds, aiming to increase productivity, reduce human labour,\
    \ and\nenhance farming efﬁciency, as follows:\n-\nOnFarm [73]: It is part of the\

    \ results.\n-\nFarmlogs [80]: It is a platform that provides tools and solutions\
    \ for: (1) automating\nthe production cost calculation process; (2) managing the\
    \ day-to-day activities of the\nfarm in real-time; and (3) supporting marketing\
    \ and increasing sales of products.\n3. Typical Applications of IoT in Smart Agriculture\n\
    In recent years, a series of IoT applications for agriculture have been introduced.\n\
    According to survey results, we divided these applications into categories based\
    \ on their\npurpose, including monitoring, tracking and traceability, and greenhouse\
    \ production. The\ndetailed results are presented in the following subsection.\n\
    3.1. Monitoring\nIn the agriculture sector, factors affecting the farming and\
    \ production process can be\nmonitored and collected, such as soil moisture, air\
    \ humidity, temperature, pH level, etc.\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 3396\n8 of 19\n\
    These factors depend on the considered agricultural sector. Some smart agricultural\
    \ sectors\nare applying the following monitoring solutions:\nCrop Farming: In\
    \ this sector, some vital factors that affect the farming process and\nproduction\
    \ efﬁciency include air temperature, precipitation, air humidity, soil moisture,\n\
    salinity, solar radiation, pest status, soil nutrient ingredients, etc. In [81],\
    \ the authors\ndesigned an IoT device called FarmFox. This device allows real-time\
    \ collection and analysis\nof the composition of the farming soil and transmits\
    \ the information to farmers/owners\nvia the Internet. The results demonstrate\
    \ the health of the soil is monitored in real time to\nprovide timely recommendations\
    \ to farmers aiming to increase productivity and farming\nefﬁciency.\nFurthermore,\
    \ in [82], the authors proposed an IoT device to allow intelligent control\nof\
    \ temperature and humidity factors, called a weather radar. This device will automatically\n\
    turn on the warning mode using the light signal and send messages to the farmer\
    \ when the\ntemperature or humidity exceeds a pre-installed threshold. In [83],\
    \ the authors introduced\nan IoT system based on Web GIS to monitor pest status\
    \ and provide early warnings. In\naddition, this study also proposes a predictive\
    \ model based on monitoring the habitat of\npests and diseases. The efﬁciency\
    \ of the proposed system was indicated, based on the\npredicted ﬁgures of the\
    \ locust epidemic, to have a high accuracy rate (over 87%) in 2019\n(China).\n\
    Monitoring information, such as soil condition, moisture, and temperature, and\
    \ the\nprediction of natural factors, such as rainfall and weather, support the\
    \ control of growing\nconditions of crops, helping farmers plan and make irrigation\
    \ decisions to optimize pro-\nduction and reduce labour costs. In addition, the\
    \ collected data, combined with big data\nprocessing technology, can provide recommendations\
    \ for implementing preventive and\nremedial solutions against pests and diseases\
    \ in farming.\nAquaponics: It is an integration of aquaculture and hydroponics.\
    \ Aquaponics is a\nfarming technique where ﬁsh waste becomes a source of nutrients\
    \ needed by plants. One of\nthe most important issues in such farms is constantly\
    \ monitoring water quality, water level,\ntemperature, salinity, pH, sunlight,\
    \ etc. [84]. According to this research direction, in [85],\nthe authors designed\
    \ an IoT system to monitor the temperature and pH value of water for\naquaponics\
    \ farms. Moreover, this system is also equipped with a control system of water\n\
    metrics to keep the ﬁsh habitat stable and an automatic ﬁsh feeding function to\
    \ increase\nthe productivity of the ﬁsh. The results show that the IoT system\
    \ had stable operation and\nprovided real-time monitoring parameters. The authors\
    \ of [86] designed an aquaponics\nfarm for households/urban areas based on IoT.\
    \ This system recommends the proper ratio\nof ﬁsh and plants.\nConsequently, the\
    \ system decreases feed consumption as well as reduces carbon\nemissions into\
    \ the environment. The primary purpose of this proposal aims to balance the\n\
    self-sustaining ability of the aquaponics system. The experimental results demonstrate\
    \ the\nnumber of ﬁsh decreases from 30 to 15, and the number of plants increases\
    \ from 20 to 30,\nbut the crop production will increase by more than 50%. A detailed\
    \ and diverse survey of\nthe IoT systems and devices for control and monitoring\
    \ of aquaponics farms is introduced\nin [87]. Based on the obtained data, monitoring\
    \ can improve the production of ﬁsh and\nplants through the control, supplementation,\
    \ and regulation of nutritional ingredients in\nthe water. The collected data\
    \ were also used to automate the management of aquaponics\nfarms to reduce labour\
    \ costs.\nForestry: Humans depend on forests for survival. Moreover, forests play\
    \ a vital\nrole in the carbon cycle and provide a habitat for more than two-thirds\
    \ of animal species\nin the world. Forests also have the effect of protecting\
    \ watersheds, limiting ﬂoods, and\nmitigating climate change. The main factors\
    \ that need to be monitored in a forest include\nsoil ingredients, air temperature,\
    \ humidity, and concentration of several different gases,\nsuch as oxygen, methane,\
    \ ammonia, and hydrogen sulphide. A series of forest control\nsystems and solutions\
    \ are presented in [88,89] based on IoT and big data analytics.\nAppl. Sci. 2022,\
    \ 12, 3396\n9 of 19\nIn [90], the authors designed a peatland forest environmental\
    \ monitoring system.\nThis forest area plays a very vital role in the rainforest\
    \ ecosystem of Brunei. However,\nthe peatland forest type is very burnt. This\
    \ work designed an IoT system to monitor\nenvironmental conditions, such as temperature,\
    \ humidity, wind direction, barometric\npressure, and manage possible disasters.\
    \ For the purpose of enhancing feasibility, IoT\ndevices use the solar-powered\
    \ system and communicate with the monitoring centre based\non the LoRa network.\
    \ In [91], the authors proposed a solution to control forest changes\nand vitality\
    \ by using high-resolution RapidEye satellite imagery. This solution has been\n\
    deployed commercially in several states in Germany and has detected leaf diseases\
    \ in a\npine forest affected by pests. Survey results indicate that monitoring\
    \ in forestry focuses on\nproviding early warning systems against forest ﬁres,\
    \ pest control, or deforestation.\nLivestock Farming: It is deﬁned as the process\
    \ of raising domesticated animals, such as\ncows, pigs, sheep, and goats, chickens,\
    \ etc., in an agricultural environment to obtain traction,\nserve production,\
    \ and obtain products such as meat, eggs, milk, fur, leather, etc. In this\narea,\
    \ the factors to be monitored depend on the type and number of farming animals\
    \ [92].\nIn [93], the authors designed a support system for the diagnosis, prevention,\
    \ and treatment\nof diseases for livestock called VetLink. This system can provide\
    \ recommendations for\nanimal health for farmers in rural areas where it is difﬁcult\
    \ to access veterinary doctors\nimmediately. In [94], the authors proposed a noncontact\
    \ temperature measurement system\nand monitoring of animals to ensure early detection\
    \ of diseases and animal health. This\nsystem can be used for remote monitoring\
    \ of animal health and timely anomaly detection.\nIn [95], the authors introduced\
    \ a monitoring system for large-scale pig farms based on IoT.\nThe speciﬁc solution\
    \ is to attach an IC tag on each pig to monitor the behaviour of each pig,\nsuch\
    \ as their period of feeding and resting and exercise. Data from sensors are collected\n\
    and combined with data analytics solutions that can make recommendations for pig\
    \ health.\nThe monitoring data of water, feed, and animal health for livestock\
    \ in the farming\nprocess helps farmers set up livestock plans, reduce labour\
    \ costs, and enhance production\nefﬁciency. While a series of solutions has been\
    \ provided for monitoring large-scale farms,\ntheir application in small and medium-sized\
    \ farms is very limited, especially in developing\ncountries. This can be attributed\
    \ to the high cost and the lack of knowledge needed to\nset up, manage, and operate\
    \ IoT systems. Therefore, effective and low-cost solutions for\nagricultural IoT\
    \ have much potential.\n3.2. Tracking and Tracing\nIn order to meet the needs\
    \ of consumers and increase proﬁt value, in the future, farms\nneed to demonstrate\
    \ that products offered to the market are clean products and can be\ntracked and\
    \ traced conveniently, thereby enhancing the trust of consumers in product\nsafety\
    \ and health-related issues. In order to solve this problem, a series of tracking-\
    \ and\ntracing-based problems for the smart agricultural sector has been proposed,\
    \ speciﬁcally as\nfollows:\nIn [96], the authors designed an information system\
    \ that allows tracking and tracing\nof agricultural products and foods such as\
    \ dairy and vegetables, called SISTABENE. This\nsystem helps suppliers track the\
    \ production process and errors arising in the supply chain,\nand helps end-users\
    \ trace the origin of food. In [97], the authors proposed a food supply\nchain\
    \ traceability system based on blockchain technology. It helps to track and trace\
    \ agri-\nfood supply chains’ production process and trace the origin of agricultural\
    \ products. This\nsolution has been employed at Shanwei Lvfengyuan Modern Agricultural\
    \ Development\nCo., Ltd. (Shanwei, China). Although there are still limitations,\
    \ the results demonstrate\nthat this solution has successfully supported the tracing\
    \ of food and agricultural prod-\nucts through QR codes, improving product quality\
    \ and ensuring the clear traceability of\nproducts. In [98,99], the authors proposed\
    \ smart agricultural solutions to tracking and\ntracing agricultural products,\
    \ thereby allowing consumers to know the product’s entire\nhistory. These solutions\
    \ enable tracking and tracing some of the data collected along the\nAppl. Sci.\
    \ 2022, 12, 3396\n10 of 19\nsupply chain, ensuring that consumers and other stakeholders\
    \ can identify products’ origin,\nlocation, and history.\n3.3. Smart Precision\
    \ Farming\nThe advent of the GPS (global positioning system) has created breakthrough\
    \ advances\nin many ﬁelds of science and technology. The GPS provides the most\
    \ important parameters\nfor locating a device, such as location and time. GPS\
    \ systems have been successfully\ndeployed in many ﬁelds, such as smartphones,\
    \ vehicles, and IoT ecosystems. However,\nGPS is only good support for outdoor\
    \ systems and the sky. Meanwhile, the demand\nfor the locating and navigating\
    \ systems in the home and on the streets of smart cities is\ngrowing rapidly.\
    \ Aiming to solve this problem, an advanced global navigation satellite\nsystem\
    \ (GNSS) is being deployed [100]. Based on GPS and GNSS systems, suitable farming\n\
    maps have been established for ﬁelds and farms. As a result, agricultural machinery\
    \ and\nequipment can be operated autonomously [101]. Figure 6 presents an illustration\
    \ of the\ntypical cloud-assisted, IoT-based precision agriculture platform.\n\

    \ machines to operate autonomously and remotely via the Internet \n[107]. \n \n\

    \ Production \nA greenhouse consists of walls and a roof, which are usually made\
    \ from transparent \nmaterials, such as plastic or glass. In a greenhouse, plants\
    \ are grown in a controlled envi-\nronment, including controlling for moisture,\
    \ nutrient ingredients of the soil, light, tem-\nperature, etc. Consequently,\
    \ greenhouse technology makes it possible for humans to grow \nany plant, at any\
    \ time, by providing suitable environmental conditions [108]. Figure 7 \nillustrates\
    \ a smart agriculture IoT system for monitoring greenhouse farming factors \n\
    based on IoT ecosystems. \nIn [109], the authors introduced an IoT-based greenhouse\
    \ environmental monitoring \nsystem for multipoint monitoring in large greenhouses.\
    \ Instead of using multiple sensors \nat different locations, this solution involves\
    \ a drive system that allows the sensor system \ndiff\nl\ni\ni\nh\nh\nTh\ni\n\

    In smart precision farming, one of the most important applications is the use\
    \ of drones\nin monitoring and farming activities. Some common farming tasks using\
    \ UAVs include\nspraying pesticides, fertilizing, sowing seeds, evaluating and\
    \ mapping, and monitoring\ncrop growth. In [102], the authors presented a detailed\
    \ survey of drone applications for\nsmart agriculture, including applications,\
    \ control technology, and future trends of the UAV\napplication for smart agriculture.\
    \ In [103], the authors designed an automatic agricultural\nproduct classiﬁcation\
    \ system based on camera systems, image processing algorithms, and\nAppl. Sci.\
    \ 2022, 12, 3396\n11 of 19\nmechanical actuators. The experimental results for\
    \ agriculture products such as oranges\nand tomatoes present a classiﬁcation success\
    \ rate of over 95%, and the sorting time for each\nproduct is less than 1(s).\
    \ This solution can be adapted and applied to the classiﬁcation of\ndifferent\
    \ agricultural products. In [104], the authors proposed a solution to estimate\
    \ grape\nproduction. The proposed solution combines an RGB-D camera mounted on\
    \ a mobile robot\nplatform and size estimation algorithm for a bunch of grapes.\
    \ The experimental results\npresent an average error in the range of [2.8–3.5]\
    \ (cm). The results demonstrate this solution\nis a feasible method for evaluating\
    \ the productivity of large-scale grape farms.\nThe survey results show that smart\
    \ precision agricultural equipment, such as irriga-\ntion systems, unmanned aerial\
    \ vehicles (UAV), and smart agricultural equipment, etc.,\nare conﬁgurable in\
    \ an autonomous-control mode based on certain conditions or can be\ncontrolled\
    \ remotely by the farmer via the Internet [105,106]. Smart precision farming helps\n\
    to improve productivity and production efﬁciency and is suitable for large-scale\
    \ farms.\nNowadays, suppliers of precision agricultural equipment have IoT modules\
    \ built into their\nmachines, allowing machines to operate autonomously and remotely\
    \ via the Internet [107].\n3.4. Greenhouse Production\nA greenhouse consists of\
    \ walls and a roof, which are usually made from transparent\nmaterials, such as\
    \ plastic or glass. In a greenhouse, plants are grown in a controlled\nenvironment,\
    \ including controlling for moisture, nutrient ingredients of the soil, light,\n\
    temperature, etc. Consequently, greenhouse technology makes it possible for humans\
    \ to\ngrow any plant, at any time, by providing suitable environmental conditions\
    \ [108]. Figure 7\nillustrates a smart agriculture IoT system for monitoring greenhouse\

    \ of IoT in the agricultural sector still presents some \nchallenges. We have\
    \ present two main problems: economic efficiency and technical prob-\nlems. We\
    \ consider these issues coupled with policies that will drive the integration\
    \ of IoT \ntechnologies in agriculture. \nFigure 7. An illustration of IoT application\

    \ in large greenhouses. Instead of using multiple sensors\nat different locations,\
    \ this solution involves a drive system that allows the sensor system\nto move\
    \ to different locations in the greenhouse. The experimental results show that\
    \ the\nproposed system can effectively monitor multiple points in large greenhouses.\
    \ In [110], the\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 3396\n12 of 19\nauthors introduced an energy-saving\
    \ temperature control technology for smart greenhouses.\nThis study proposed two\
    \ intelligent control methods: active disturbance rejection control\nand fuzzy\
    \ active disturbance rejection control. The experimental results demonstrate\n\
    that the proposed technology saves over 15% of the total energy consumption of\
    \ the\ngreenhouse. In [111], the authors designed an intelligent IoT system to\
    \ monitor and\ncontrol greenhouse temperature for energy efﬁciency and improve\
    \ crop productivity. The\nexperimental results for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,\
    \ where daytime temperatures can be\nabove 50 ◦C, demonstrate the efﬁciency of\
    \ the proposed solution, including saving energy\nand predicting the rate of plant\
    \ growth.\nRecent studies indicated that solutions integrating IoT, big data processing,\

    \ Research Directions\nThe survey results indicate that IoT components for the\
    \ smart agriculture sector,\nincluding hardware and software, have been focused\
    \ on research and achieved many\nbreakthrough results. Several IoT solutions have\
    \ been deployed on large-scale farms/ﬁelds.\nHowever, the widespread deployment\
    \ of IoT in the agricultural sector still presents some\nchallenges. We have present\
    \ two main problems: economic efﬁciency and technical prob-\nlems. We consider\
    \ these issues coupled with policies that will drive the integration of IoT\n\
    technologies in agriculture.\n4.1. Economic Efﬁciency\nIn agricultural economics,\
    \ one of the most important characteristics is a low rate of\nproﬁt of an investment\
    \ project, which presents many risks from natural conditions. The\nbeneﬁt–cost\
    \ of a new technology seeking deployment in agriculture should be carefully\n\
    calculated to ensure a trade-off between the cost of technology implementation\
    \ and the\nproﬁt potential. Therefore, we discuss the economic aspects related\
    \ to IoT implementation\nin smart agriculture.\nThere are several types of costs\
    \ related to the implementation of IoT in agriculture.\nWe divided them into categories,\
    \ including (1) the system initialization cost and (2) the\nsystem operating cost.\
    \ The system initialization cost includes hardware purchases (IoT\ndevices, gateways,\
    \ base station infrastructure). The system operating cost includes service\nregistration\
    \ cost and the cost of labour to manage IoT devices. Furthermore, additional op-\n\
    erating costs include incurred costs from energy consumption, maintenance, data\
    \ exchange\namong IoT devices, gateways and cloud servers. According to the opinion\
    \ of Turgut and\nBoloni [116], the successful deployment of the IoT technologies\
    \ will only happen if the\ncustomer beneﬁts (customers need to know the beneﬁts\
    \ and potential) that IoT systems\nprovide exceed their physical value and privacy\
    \ costs. The businesses participating in the\nIoT domain will proﬁt and achieve\
    \ success. We can describe this process using these two\nconditions, as follows:\n\
    Success o f IoT Applications=\n\x1A Vservice > Cpri + Cuser\nh\n+ Cpay, Farmer\
    \ Bene f its\n(1)\nVin f o + Rpay > Cbusiness\nh\n, Businesses Bene f its\n(2)\n\
    where\nVservice is the expected value received by the IoT service users.\nCpri\
    \ is the cost of the loss of privacy.\nCuser\nh\nis the equipment and hardware\
    \ costs the user pays.\nCpay is the payment for the service fee.\nVin f o is the\
    \ received information value.\nRpay is the received direct payment.\nCbusiness\n\
    h\nis the share of the hardware and maintenance costs of the business.\nAppl.\
    \ Sci. 2022, 12, 3396\n13 of 19\nAccording to the opinion of the service user\
    \ (farmers or the owner of the farm),\nEquation (1) shows that the perceived value\
    \ of the service for the user (Vservice) must be\nhigher than the total of costs,\
    \ including: the cost of the loss of privacy (Cpri), the equipment\nand hardware\
    \ costs the user pays (Cuser\nh\n), and the payments for the service fee (Cpay),\
    \ while\nthe opinion of the service provider, as shown in Equation (2), shows\
    \ that the received\ninformation value (Vin f o) and the received direct payments\
    \ (Rpay) must be higher than the\nshare of the hardware and maintenance costs\
    \ of the business (Cbusiness\nh\n).\nThere is still a gap between service providers\
    \ and service users (farmers or the owner\nof the farm), leading to the slow deployment\
    \ of IoT applications in smart agriculture. In\nterms of the economic aspect,\
    \ the analyzed results show that the need for a support policy\nfrom regulatory\
    \ agencies and governments to allow service providers and service users\nto use\
    \ IoT-based smart agriculture applications in their infancy can be met. As discussed\n\
    in [117], to promote smart agriculture, the European Union has issued supportive\
    \ economic\npolicies, the so-called the European CAP (Common Agricultural Policy),\
    \ whose annual\nbudget amounts to approximately EUR 59 billion and is paid for\
    \ by the nations of the EU.\nIn our view, to be able to apply IoT in the ﬁeld\
    \ of smart agriculture, service costs\n(Cpay) and the operating and system initialization\
    \ cost of IoT (Cuser\nh\n) needs to constantly be\nimproved and optimized to reduce\
    \ the cost of the IoT services for farmers. In addition, IoT\nbusinesses (service\
    \ providers) also need to maximize the value of information obtained\n(Vin f o)\
    \ to improve the proﬁtability of the service providers.\nIn reality, service providers\
    \ may commercially exploit the information received (Vin f o)\nin the period of\
    \ providing services for farms, aiming to encourage the deployment of\nIoT applications\
    \ in smart agriculture. Nowadays, several IoT platform providers allow\nfree registration\
    \ and use of services with some limitation conditions regarding services’\nfunctionality\
    \ and ability processing; the number of connected IoT devices; and the number\n\
    of data stored while premium functions and services charge users a fee.\nIn addition,\
    \ one of the signiﬁcant factors slowing down IoT adoption in agriculture\nis farmers’\
    \ knowledge and ability to use IoT devices. In developed countries, this issue\n\
    can be easily solved due to the accessibility of new technologies of farmers.\
    \ Otherwise, in\ndeveloping countries, where the majority of farmers in rural\
    \ areas have very limited access\nto advanced technologies, this issue is a signiﬁcant\
    \ challenge [118,119].\n4.2. Technical Problems\nInterference: Deploying a huge\
    \ number of IoT devices for smart agriculture can\ncause interference to different\
    \ network systems, especially some IoT networks using short\nspectrum bands such\
    \ as ZigBee, Wi-Fi, Sigfox, and LoRa (See Table 1). Interference can\ndegrade\
    \ system performance as well as reduce the reliability of IoT ecosystems. IoT\n\
    networks that use cognitive technology to reuse unlicensed spectra increase the\
    \ cost of the\ndevice. In our opinion, the advent of the 6G network [120] will\
    \ allow a huge number of\ndevices to connect to the Internet with an extremely\
    \ high access speed and extremely large\nbandwidth. The full interference problem\
    \ of IoT networks will be solved.\nSecurity and Privacy: One of the most important\
    \ problems of applying IoT in smart\nagriculture is the security problem, including\
    \ the protection of data and systems from\nattacks on the Internet. In regard\
    \ to system security, IoT devices’ limited capacity and\nability led to complex\
    \ encryption algorithms that are impossible to implement on IoT\ndevices. As a\
    \ result, IoT systems can be attacked using the Internet to gain system control\n\
    rights; IoT gateways are also attacked via denial of service [121–123]. In addition,\
    \ cloud\nservers can be attacked by data spooﬁng to perform unauthorized tasks\
    \ that affect the\nautonomous farming processes of farms. Cloud infrastructures\
    \ can also be controlled by\nattackers [124,125]. Several issues of detailed IoT\
    \ data privacy and security measures have\nbeen discussed in [126–128]. According\
    \ to Neshenko et al., the IoT data security issue is one\nof the biggest problems\
    \ slowing down IoT adoption in smart agriculture [129].\nRegarding data security,\
    \ the obtained information from IoT systems in farms is col-\nlected, processed,\
    \ and commercially exploited by service providers to varying degrees.\nAppl. Sci.\
    \ 2022, 12, 3396\n14 of 19\nTherefore, one of the most important problems of policies\
    \ regards the validity and legal\nstatus of farm data [130]. In reality, these\
    \ data are of great value when aggregated and\nanalyzed for large-scale agricultural\
    \ activities. Consequently, without policies, the data\nprivacy and security of\
    \ farms can affect the competitive advantage of farmers/farm owners.\nIn our opinion,\
    \ using cryptography coupled with access keys is a possible solution to\nsolve\
    \ this problem. Keys could be made available based on a regional user group and\n\
    to those who contributed to the database. For further complex cases, secure multiparty\n\
    computation can be used, where the homomorphic encryption method [131,132], or\
    \ this\nmethod combined with the blockchain [133], can be applied for the purpose\
    \ of balancing\nprivacy and data utility.\nIn our opinion, the security problems\
    \ of IoT systems will be an exciting research topic\nand garner attention for\
    \ both academia and industry research. An in-depth survey of\nthreats and solutions\
    \ to improve robustness, trust, and privacy for future IoT systems is\npresented\
    \ in [134].\nReliability: Most IoT devices are expected to be deployed outdoors\
    \ (in ﬁelds and\nfarms). Harsh work environments lead to the rapid degradation\
    \ of IoT devices’ quality and\ncan lead to unexpected manufacturer failures. The\
    \ mechanical safety of IoT devices and\nsystems must be ensured so they can withstand\
    \ extremes of weather, such as temperature,\nhumidity, rainstorms, and ﬂoods [135].\
    \ In our opinion, new materials and technologies\nneed to continue to be studied\
    \ to improve the durability of devices.\nThe open problems and challenges discussed\
    \ in this section indicate that for IoT\nto be widely deployed in the smart agriculture\
    \ sector, there are still many issues to be\nsolved. Service providers need to\
    \ reduce the service costs, more effectively exploiting\nthe information collected\
    \ from the farm. On the other hand, farmers need to improve\ntheir skills to be\
    \ able to apply IoT solutions on their farm to enhance productivity and\nfarming\
    \ efﬁciency. Researchers need to continually study and propose optimal solutions\n\
    and technologies to ensure IoT systems’ privacy and security and improve the durability\
    \ of\nIoT devices. These are really major challenges and exciting research topics\
    \ in the future so\nIoT can be widely applied in the smart agriculture sector.\n\
    5. Conclusions\nIn this study, we presented an overview of IoT and big data for\
    \ the smart agriculture\nsector. Several issues related to promoting IoT deployment\
    \ in the agriculture sector have\nbeen discussed in detail. Survey results indicate\
    \ that many studies have been performed\nto apply IoT for smart agriculture, aiming\
    \ to enhance productivity, reduce human labour,\nand improve production efﬁciency.\
    \ The beneﬁts of applying IoT and big data in agriculture\nwere discussed. In\
    \ addition, we also pointed out the challenges we need to overcome\nto be able\
    \ to accelerate the deployment of IoT in smart agriculture. However, there are\n\
    still some challenges that need to be addressed for IoT solutions to be affordable\
    \ for the\nmajority of farmers, including small- and medium-scale farm owners.\
    \ In addition, security\ntechnologies need to be continuously improved, but in\
    \ our opinion, the application of\nIoT solutions for smart agriculture is inevitable\
    \ and will enhance productivity, provide\nclean and green foods, support food\
    \ traceability, reduce human labour, and improve\nproduction efﬁciency. On the\
    \ other hand, this survey also points out some interesting\nresearch directions\
    \ for security and communication technologies for IoT. We think that\nthese will\
    \ be very exciting research directions in the future.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    Abstract: This paper presents new technique of autonomous control for Greenhouse
    irrigation system. The control is used to manage the irrigations hours with the
    aim to reduce cost and increase plant growth performance. This unique control
    involves with loop signals through weather sensors which monitors the changes
    of weather condition. Three sensors namely temperature, humidity and pyranometer
    are used to provide signals that are known as multiplying factor for the control
    algorithm to perform autonomous adjustment for the next irrigation time. The algorithm
    involves with a constant K which is applied as time setting for daily irrigation.
    The time setting autonomously changed associated with the changes of weather such
    as dry climax, raining and hot weather. The control algorithm has been tested
    and the result shows the management of soil moisture through weather feedback
    element is economically improved and would be possible to increase yearly crop
    yield. Published in: 2015 9th Asia Modelling Symposium (AMS) Date of Conference:

    Location: Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia SECTION I. Introduction Systems for the future
    will increasingly have the characteristics of the autonomous features. Autonomous
    is described as independent system which runs with minimum supervision. In this
    greenhouse application some parts of control are necessarily need autonomous features.
    This could enhance the capability of the system that would improve the environment
    for the healthy plants. Autonomous control is designed to perform for several
    functions as follow Monitoring intruder e.g. monkeys. Watering plants Solar Power
    control The new functions of the greenhouse was developed using small size of
    control board. The board is a readymade board with microcontroller 18F4250. It
    has 5 ports which are sufficient for small control application. Besides the board,
    additional peripheral circuits are also required to facilitate the monitoring
    functions such as Real time circuit (RTC), Humidity and Temperature sensor board
    and relay board. Configuration of the board and the supporting circuits is done
    through MicroC (compiler and debugger). In this article the focus is emphasized
    on autonomous control for irrigation system of greenhouse. Systematic Irrigation
    system is crucial for plantation particularly in tropical country. Tropical countries
    like Malaysia have extreme phenomena against heat and high temperature on day
    time. Over-heated through high ultra-violet could kill plants or promotes unhealthy
    growth. Vegetable plant requires wet condition and scheduled irrigation time is
    applied to ensure the plants are not dried. Irrigation through electronic timer
    is not sufficient and not cost effective. Many researchers also introduce soil
    monitoring through radio frequency to gather water contents of the soil [5] [10].
    This technique is manned for monitoring a big plantation. However the limitation
    of this technique is the maintenance cost is high. The sensors are planted in
    the soil and transmits the soil information to the main controller. A new technique
    is proposed with different strategies in controlling the irrigation time. The
    mechanism of control is based on environment changes and feedback the changes
    to the algorithm for calculating the irrigation time. SECTION II. Autonomous Irrigation
    System Figure 1 shows the block diagram of the irrigation control system. The
    system involves with three environment sensors namely ultra violet sensor, humidity
    and temperature sensors. The sensors are used to measure the condition of the
    greenhouse and feedback the data to watering algorithm. Figure 1. Block diagram
    of autonomous watering system Show All The watering algorithm will process and
    calculate the data for determining the next irrigation time. In short to generate
    the next activation time first calibration, K is set to determine the regular
    hours for activation. Secondly the inputs from the three sensors are calculated
    to produce multiply factor for K. The result is used to add with the present activation
    time which then produce the next activation time. A. Parameters in the Algorithm
    One of the factors to promote healthy growth for plants is effective control watering
    system and humidity control level during day time. In tropical country temperature
    could rise up to 37°C during peak noon daily. This temperature level is not suitable
    for some vegetables plant that could reduce crop yield. Simple autonomous solution
    to monitor the temperature level is by using sensors and Real Time Device (RTC).
    One wire sensor SLTH1 is used in the system to measure two environment parameters
    namely humidity and temperature. Another sensor is pyranometer which is used to
    measure sun intensity. The control algorithm use feedback mechanism from the three
    sensors to decide the next activation time for water sprinkler. In general the
    process of control is explained as shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. Flowchart of irrigation
    hours Show All Measurements for the three parameters were carried out to generate
    the next activation time. Once the time has been obtained it will be added with
    RTC time to determine the actual Time for next activation. There are three values
    involved in weather measurement for Green House. First is temperature parameter.
    Temperature is induced from heat particularly from sun. During day time the heat
    is increased especially during noon time. The higher the heat the more water from
    soil is evaporated. As a result the higher frequency is required to watering the
    plants. Second parameter is humidity. Humidity is defined as percentage of water
    contents in air. Humidity is increasing after long raining and during night time.
    In green house, water in soil is evaporated faster when heat is increased. This
    causes humidity decreasing. In relation to watering frequency, the higher the
    value of humidity means less number of watering frequency is applied. Figure 3.
    Irradiance value for one day measurement Show All The third parameter in measurement
    is irradiance. Irradiance is a measurement of solar power and is defined as the
    rate at which solar energy falls onto a surface. The irradiance falling on a surface
    can and does vary from moment to moment. The range of irradiance is within 0 to
    1.6 kw/m2. A typical calibration factor C of pyranometer can be expressed as:
    C=160 mV/(kw/ m 2 ) (1) View Source This value means that when the solar irradiance
    Ee is 1 kw/m2 (typical for a clear, sunny day around noon) the pyranometer will
    provide an output voltage around 160 mV. If the output voltage is found to be
    80 mV, this indicates that the solar irradiance is about 0.5 kw/m2. Thus: Ee=V/C
    (2) View Source where V is the signal voltage in millivolts and Ee is measured
    in kw/m2. Normal day time at peak noon, irradiance is increased to 1.0 kw/m2.
    The higher the irradiance indicates the weather is dry and hot. Therefore the
    plants require more water per day. The range of irradiance is unique which becomes
    multiply factor for calculating the next activation hours. The minimum reading
    is zero that indicates night time while for day time it is slowly increased from
    0 to 1.2 kw/m2 as shown in Figure 3. Apparently the total relation for the three
    parameters with time activation could be described as follow: Time Activation∝
    Humidity Temperature∗Irradiance (3) View Source The equation can be further justified
    as Time Activation (H)=K∗ Humidity Temperature∗Irradiance    H=K∗ rh T∗Ee (4)
    View Source Where K is a constant which related to the coefficient factor for
    Time activation. The example of the calculation is shown as follow: E, g. During
    hot time temperature = 37°C, irradiance = 1.2 kw/m2, Humidity = 37 % K in tropical
    country → 1.2 (typical time setting value) H=1.2  ∗  37%/( 37 ∘ C  ∗  1.2)=1.0
    or 1 hour 0 min View Source If the present time for activation is 10.00 am hence
    the next activation will be 11.00 am. E.g. During raining season temperature =
    29°C, irradiance = 0.6 kw/m2, humidity = 60 % Hours=1.2  ∗  60%/( 29 ∘ C  ∗  0.6)=4.1
    or 4 hour 6 min View Source If the present time for activation is 10.00 am hence
    the next activation will be 2.06 pm. B. Calibration K K is a constant which is
    used to set the average hours for activating sprinkler. The range of K is from
    0 to 5 (in volt 0 to 5 Vdc). The value is dependent on the location of country
    and rain fall factor. In country which has low rain fall per year should apply
    low K to increase the frequency of watering. Activation algorithm will use constant
    K and weather data to calculate the suitable activation time for irrigation. There
    are two situations where system will autonomously do adjustment according to the
    sensor''s measurement. When the weather is changing to dry and hot, the algorithm
    will calculate and shorten the next activation time for sprinkler. On the other
    hand when the weather is changing to raining, the system will calculate and increase
    the time for next activation. In the actual circuit K is set through simple potentiometer
    to produce constant analog voltage. Simple analog level would be 0 to 5 Vdc. A
    simple 3-Pot potential resistor (1KΩ) is used to vary the analog voltage. The
    analog voltage is applied to Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) of microcontroller
    for determining the digital value for K. The conversion of ADC extends the accuracy
    of the calibration as the output of the ADC is in binary number from 0 to 255.
    The algorithm for the simple calculation after ADC would be as follow: H= ADC
    51 ∗ rh T∗Ee (5) View Source SECTION III. Measurement Exercise Measurement exercise
    was carried out from 1st Dec 2010 until 31st Jan 2011 with the aim to evaluate
    daily trend for temperature, humidity and irradiance. The location of the measurement
    was conducted at Templer, Rawang, Selangor. Rawang area is considered small industrial
    area and located nearby Genting Highlands. The weather is moderate at 20°C to
    45°C throughout the year. The measurement graph as shown in Figure 6 is generated
    from EDM system [4]. The graph shows the combination of the three measurements:
    humidity, temperature and irradiance. The first day (31st Dec 2010) indicates
    heavy rain causes the temperature raised to 35°C max while the humidity reading
    is down to 54%. The irradiance is low 0.3 kw/m2 due to the sun was entirely covered
    by the heavy clouds. The next day (1st Jan 2011) was totally different weather
    condition where the sun was fully bright and this cause the irradiance swing to
    1.2 kw/m2. SECTION IV. Sampling Time The graph of Figure 4 indicates that from
    the three parameters, humidity and temperature are consistent while irradiance
    has issue on cloudy which fluctuate the reading. There are several options to
    decide on sampling time for control algorithm. The first option is by taking 10
    readings within 20 minutes and the highest value is chosen and used for the algorithm.
    The second option has similar method by taking 10 readings and an average for
    the 10 readings is used in the sampling time. After considering the actual effect
    of the cloudy condition which has minimum effect to the greenhouse condition,
    the first option is chosen. Therefore sampling time for checking the condition
    of greenhouse is 20 minutes and readings for humidity and temperature is taken
    for every 20 minutes while reading for irradiance is sampled for 10 times within
    20 minutes. The highest values will be taken and used in the algorithm. SECTION
    V. Discussion Greenhouse project is a new concept of entrepreneurship for house
    owners in Malaysia. The project involves with the design structure of the greenhouse,
    control condition for plants, monitoring system, guarding system and etc. Part
    of the system such as Environment Management System (EDM) has been designed and
    presented [4]. Next the present works are related to autonomous control system
    for power management and irrigation system. System dependent with solar energy
    requires effective power management to ensure the system is running non-stop without
    battery failure. Autonomous control for irrigation is in very productive progress.
    The algorithm has been designed and formulated. The algorithm involves with a
    new concept of monitoring the soil''s moisture. It uses weather changes that is
    being read by three environment sensors. The response is feedback to the control
    algorithm for calculating the new activation time. Techniques monitoring through
    planted soil sensor is rigid in terms of the maintenance work. The new concept
    using weather changes would improve the simplicity and it is very autonomous.
    Figure 5 and 6 show two days activation graph for two days data measurement. Both
    constant K have been set with 1.2. Day 1 indicates the transition of activation
    hour is linearly shorten from 9.00 am to 12.00 pm. After 12.00 pm the graph changes
    to irregularity condition where the transition of activation hours start to fluctuate.
    This condition was due to the inconsistent irradiance values. In daily condition,
    irradiance value is much affected by cloudy and raining. Day 2 (Figure 6) shows
    worst irregularity condition than day 1. Irregularities causes inconsistency in
    performing linear activation hours. What is the best solution to minimize the
    inconsistency issue? As suggested in Section IV the solution is by increasing
    the sampling time e.g. read 10 times irradiance values within 20 minutes (minimum
    time frame) before the algorithm pick up the maximum value. The maximum value
    apparently represents the actual value of irradiance. Other variables that also
    cause inconsistency such as short raining, tick cloudy and etc. could also be
    considered in the future for further improvement. In Figure 5 and 6 the straight
    line indicate the ideal values for irrigation hours. This linear response would
    help effective management of irrigation hours for greenhouse or big plantation.
    SECTION VI. Conclusion Irrigation system in tropical countries is crucial because
    it involves with cost and manpower. Tropical countries or two season countries
    weather have high rain fall a year and high temperature during daytime. High temperature
    is caused by heat from the sun and ultra violet ray. Therefore there are three
    parameters involved in determining the weather condition which are temperature,
    humidity and irradiance. The relation of the three parameters is interconnected
    and the changes are used to relate with irrigation hours. Simple algorithm for
    controlling irrigation hours comprise the three environment parameters and calibration
    K. The algorithm is based on loop or feedback measurement from weather sensors
    and the irrigation hours is respond to calculate the suitable hours for next activation
    of sprinkler system. Figure 4. Measurement graph for two days using EDM Show All

    Abstract:\nThe deployment of appropriate technologies to enhance \nmodern agricultural\
    \ practices and improve crop yields \nis imperative for sustainability. This paper\
    \ presents the \ndevelopment of a standalone automated irrigation sys-\ntem. The\
    \ system design features good automation and \ncontrol, which was achieved using\
    \ an array of electronic \ntiming system, soil feedback sensor and wireless commu-\n\
    nication system. Autonomous irrigation events are based \non the states of the\
    \ timing system, the soil feedback sys-\ntem and the wireless communication system.\
    \ The control \nand automation of these systems was done using an AVR \nmicrocontroller,\
    \ which was programmed to trigger intelli-\ngent and independent farm irrigation\
    \ operation through \na water pump attached to the system. The system also \n\
    operates remotely via SMS command from mobile device \nand sends operational status\
    \ feedback via SMS to pre-\nprogrammed mobile user(s). It also sends soil moisture\
    \ \ncondition to a remote user upon query. The system pack-\nage was produced\
    \ using additive manufacturing tech-\nnique. The power supply system was implemented\
    \ using \nsolar power system in order to achieve a standalone, \nautonomous and\
    \ reliable power supply necessary for an \nindependent operation. The performance\
    \ evaluation of \nthe developed system show impressive response time, \ngood reliability\
    \ and excellent stability. Furthermore, the \nnumerical experiment conducted using\
    \ the Response \nSurface Methodology (RSM) produced a mathematical \nmodel for\
    \ the optimization of the irrigation process for \noptimum performance and cost\
    \ effectiveness. \nKeywords: \nAdditive \nmanufacturing, \nAutomation, \nIrrigation,\
    \ Intelligent system, Microcontroller\n1. Introduction\nThe development of appropriate\
    \ technologies in \nmodern agricultural practices have not only improved \ncrop\
    \ yields but have also increased the ease with which \nfarming practices are being\
    \ done especially with the \nadvent of robotic tools. With the increasing awareness\
    \ \nand advocacy for round – the – year farming, and the \nneed to meet up with\
    \ the challenge of global food de-\nmand, deploying appropriate technologies to\
    \ increase \nproductivity and reduce the burden often associated \nwith farm practices\
    \ has become inevitable. Since the \nrole of agriculture in the economic development\
    \ of any \nnation cannot be overemphasized, there is need boost \nagricultural\
    \ productivity with the use of intelligent sys-\ntems for increased food production\
    \ and revenue gener-\nation [1–2]. One of such areas in agricultural practices\
    \ \nthat has posed much burden, wasted useful times and \nresources is farm irrigation.\
    \ Irrigation is the artificial \napplication of water to the land or soil which\
    \ assist in \nthe growing of agricultural crops, maintenance of land-\nscapes,\
    \ and revegetation of soils in dry areas as well \nas during periods of inadequate\
    \ rainfall [3–5]. Mainly, \nthere are two types of irrigation systems namely;\
    \ sprin-\nkler [6–7] and drip irrigation system [8–9]. The use of \nthe sprinkler\
    \ irrigation system involves the spraying \nof water into the air with the aid\
    \ of a pumping system \nand sprinkler, which falls on the crops in form of small\
    \ \ndrops of water like the rain. It finds suitable applica-\ntion in farm rows\
    \ or fields either uniform or undulating \n[10]. On the other hand, the drip irrigation\
    \ involves the \npassage of water directly to the root of plants from or \nbelow\
    \ the soil surface using pipes or tubes. This form \nof irrigation is highly effective\
    \ and conservative and \nmost suitable in areas with acute shortage of water \n\
    supply [11]. With regards to the challenges posed by \nconventional irrigation\
    \ practices, the use of intelligent \nsystems for irrigation are better appreciated\
    \ particu-\nlarly with large-scale farming. Conventional methods \nof irrigation\
    \ are labour intensive, time-consuming, \nrelatively ineffective due to poor water\
    \ distribution \nand lack of monitoring as well as smart control mech-\nanisms\
    \ [12–13]. Its over-reliance on human control \nmakes it not suitable for large-scale\
    \ farming [14–16]. \nAutomatic irrigation systems on the contrary are nei-\nther\
    \ laborious nor time-consuming and can help meet \nthe ever increasing demand\
    \ for food production all the \nyear round [17–18]. In addition, the process is\
    \ cost ef-\nfective in the long run as the initial capital invested will \nbe\
    \ offset via large scale farming to meet the increasing \ndemand for food production\
    \ [19–20]. The burden the \nautomated irrigation system seeks to resolve is the\
    \ abil-\nity to intelligently and independently irrigate the farm \nenvironment.\
    \ As such, farmers can commit the time \nhitherto wasted on prolonged and laborious\
    \ manual \nirrigation to other productive tasks while the system \nindependently\
    \ executes the irrigation process. Accord-\ning to Ganturi [21] and Curtis [22],\
    \ the requirements \nfor a smart irrigation system includes the effective \napplication\
    \ and distribution of water as well as good \ncontrol and monitoring of the process\
    \ of irrigation with \nappropriate feedback mechanisms. Karim et al. [23] \nJournal\
    \ of Automation, Mobile Robotics and Intelligent Systems\nVOLUME  13,      N°\

    \ capac-\nitors, crystal Oscillator, active SIM card, filament for \nadditive\
    \ manufacturing, metal frame for PV and con-\ntrol unit.\nThe capability of the\
    \ automated irrigation system \ninclude the ability to take intelligent decisions\
    \ on its \nstate, based on operational and soil conditions. Also, \nthe solar\
    \ power provision will enable it sustain a con-\ntinuous operation at all times\
    \ and to achieve high \nreliability in its operations. The need for irrigation\
    \ \ntend to increase with increase in solar energy usually \naccompanied by soil\
    \ moisture loss. Hence, the solar \nenergy can be trapped for powering the autonomous\
    \ \nsystem. \n2.1. System Architecture\nThe architecture of the developed system\
    \ is pre-\nsented in Figure 1.\nFig. 1. Architecture of the automated irrigation\
    \ system\n2.2. Automation and Control\nGenerally, irrigation exercise is usually\
    \ carried \nout in the morning or evening hours for the sake of \nthe health of\
    \ farm crops. The pre-programmed time \nfor irrigation was done and stored on\
    \ the micro con-\ntroller. Hence, the microcontroller routinely checks \nfor this\
    \ time with respect to the environmental con-\nditions. A DS1307 timing system\
    \ also known as the \nreal time clock was incorporated to give an accurate \n\
    track of the date and time of the irrigation activities \n(Figure 2).\nFig. 2.\
    \ DS1307 timing system\nAccording to the programming of the microcon-\ntroller,\
    \ there will be need for irrigation only if the \nsoil moisture goes below 25%\
    \ and such irrigation \noperation is halted if the farm is irrigated up to 50%.\
    \ \nTherefore, the microcontroller keeps its check for the \nenvironmental conditions\
    \ in respect of the pre-set \ntime most especially when the humidity drops below\
    \ \ndeveloped a sensor-based M2M agriculture monitor-\ning systems for developing\
    \ countries citing high level \nof automation and control as one of the challenges\
    \ to \nbe addressed. Also, Alagupandi et al. [24] developed \na smart irrigation\
    \ system for outdoor environment us-\ning TinyOS while Gutierrez [25] developed\
    \ an automat-\ned irrigation system using a wireless sensor network \nand GPRS\
    \ module. These works provided a convenient \nplatform for automation, control\
    \ and tracking of irri-\ngation activities. Mrinmayi et al. [26] also developed\
    \ \na smart irrigation system using internet of things while \nRoy and Ansari\
    \ [27], developed autonomous irrigation \nsystems that uses every day climate\
    \ criterion for irriga-\ntion purpose. This helps in saving considerable amount\
    \ \nof water for irrigation via the use of Programmable \nLogic Controller (PLC).\
    \ The issue of water loss due to \nprecipitation has been identified as one of\
    \ the major \nchallenges during the irrigation process. In a bid to \naddress\
    \ this challenge, Kumar et al. [28] developed an \nautomatic irrigation system\
    \ that uses field sensing and \nforecasting in an attempt to control irrigation\
    \ based on \nsoil moisture for the sustainable irrigation of crops. For \neffective\
    \ distribution and control of water irrigation ac-\ntivities, Bai and Liang [29]\
    \ as well as Li-Fang [30] de-\nveloped an optimal model for water conservation.\
    \ The \nparameters that are essential in order to facilitate good \nmonitoring\
    \ and control are; temperature, air humidity \nand soil moisture [30–35]. The\
    \ design objectives of the \ndeveloped automated irrigation system are to achieve\
    \ \noperational intelligence, automation and independ-\nence thereby easing the\
    \ stress often associated with \nconventional irrigation practices. The novelties\
    \ of this \nwork lies in the fact that the ease of operation of the \ndeveloped\
    \ automated system comes with its multiple \nmodes of operation, which affords\
    \ the user convenient \nchoices of operation. The modes include the full auto-\n\
    mation mode whereby the system operates autono-\nmously using the states of the\
    \ timing system and the \nsoil feedback sensor to take intelligent decisions on\
    \ \nappropriate time and extent of irrigation activities to \nbe implemented.\
    \ In addition, a user could send a com-\nmand remotely via mobile phone to the\
    \ field system to \nstart or stop irrigation. Furthermore, users have the \nprivilege\
    \ of querying the system remotely in order to \nget feedback on the real time\
    \ soil conditions. Upon re-\nceiving such command via the Short Message Service\
    \ \n(SMS), the system queries the soil feedback sensor and \nsends the soil moisture\
    \ readings to the authorized us-\ner(s). The system can also be made to operate\
    \ in the \nmanual mode relying on human effort or semi auton-\nomously relying\
    \ on human control during certain pe-\nriods such as the start up or shut down\
    \ based on the \nenvironment and nature of irrigation activities to be \ncarried\
    \ out. The aforementioned peculiarities of the \ndeveloped automated irrigation\

    \ to switch the irrigation pump ON. A Short \nMessage Service (SMS) alert is sent\
    \ to the authorized \nuser on the state of the pump and the active mode \nof control.\
    \ The authorized user receives a message \n“Pump ON”, and Control mode: “Auto”.\
    \ At any condi-\ntion outside the aforementioned operational limits, \nthe pump\
    \ state is kept “OFF”, and the state indicates \n“Idle”. These are designed to\
    \ take place without the us-\ners’ input. In addition, users can send a message\
    \ “ON” \nfrom a mobile phone to the SIM number in the system. \nUpon receiving\
    \ this message, the system activates the \nrelay which will in turn activate the\
    \ irrigation pump. \nThe state changes to “Pump ON” and the control mode \nchanges\
    \ to “Remote”. The state is sent as feedback to \nthe remote operator’s mobile\
    \ phone. Upon receiving \nthe message “OFF” from the user, the pump goes off \n\
    and the state returns to “Idle”. This would equally be \nsent as feedback to the\
    \ users’ mobile phone. The user \nalso has the privilege to query the system via\
    \ a sim-\nple SMS command to get the real time soil moisture \nreading, which\
    \ will be sent as a message from the \nsystem to the users’ mobile phone. In the\
    \ event of an \nemergency need of water on site, such as in the case of \nwashing\
    \ harvested farm crops, a manual mini switch \nis provided for the pump on – site.\
    \ The Light Emit-\nting Diode (LED) goes “OFF” in the idle state, “BLUE” \nin\
    \ the remote control state, “GREEN” in the timing \nor soil automation state and\
    \ “RED” in manual oper-\nation mode. One of the peculiarities of this system is\
    \ \nthat users have the privilege of querying the system \nremotely in order to\
    \ get feedback on the real time \nsoil conditions. Upon receiving such command\
    \ via \nthe SMS, the system queries the soil feedback sensor \nand sends the soil\
    \ moisture readings to authorized \nuser(s). For the purpose of this work, only\
    \ one mois-\nture sensor was used and this is shown in Figure 3. \nThe features\
    \ of the soil moisture sensor include: \npower supply (3.3 V–3.5 V), output voltage\
    \ (0–4.2 V), \ncurrent 3.5 mA), size (60 × 20 × 5 mm). It comprises \nof two probes\
    \ which passes current into the soil and \nthereafter reads the electrical resistance\
    \ so as to de-\ntermine the moisture level. High moisture content in \nthe soil\
    \ often triggers high conductivity of electricity \nby the soil and vice versa.\
    \ The output voltage from the \nsoil moisture sensor is then amplified and sent\
    \ to the \nmicro controller where it is converted to digital us-\ning Analogue\
    \ to Digital Converter (ADC). On the con-\ntroller, the voltage is compared to\
    \ the threshold value \npre-set on it, if the measured voltage is less than the\
    \ \nthreshold value, the micro controller activates the re-\nlay which turns ON\
    \ the pump for irrigation activities. \nOn the other hand, if the measured value\
    \ exceeds or \nequal to the threshold, it implies there is no need for \nirrigation\
    \ hence system remains in the idle state with \nthe LED indicating “OFF”.\n2.3.\
    \ Power Provisioning\nFor a continuous and reliable operation of this \nsystem,\
    \ an independent power supply is essential. \nAs such, a PV module, which was\
    \ scaled relative to \nthe power requirement of the DC operated irrigation \n\
    pump, was deployed. The control unit is equipped \nwith a 10,500 mAH lithium ion\
    \ battery backup to \nkeep the system active at night. The power supply \nunit\
    \ of the system is designed to take power also from \nthe PV installation and\
    \ provision power according to \npower requirement of the control sub – systems\
    \ as \nshown in Figure 4.\nFig. 4. Proteus design model of the automated \nirrigation\

    \ \nAutomated Irrigation System\nFor large farms, pump sizing can be easily done\
    \ \nby estimating the water volume requirements of the \nfarm. This would also\
    \ entail appropriate sizing of \nthe solar power system to deliver required power\
    \ to \nthe irrigation pump. Also, the ampere rating of the \nswitching relay in\
    \ the control system will be matched \nadequately with the current demand of the\
    \ pump. \nThe operational indices show that it takes the system \nabout 25 secs\
    \ to boot up when powered ON and about \n5 secs to receive a message instruction\
    \ for pump acti-\nvation. The solar power system delivers about 300 W, \nwith\
    \ the feedback response time from the soil mois-\nture sensor about 0.5 secs and\
    \ the volume of water \npumped approximately 750 L/hr which is adequate \nfor\
    \ small experimental farm. The smart irrigation \nmonitoring is embedded with\
    \ soil moisture sensor to \nsense and obtain the values of moisture for any loca-\n\
    tion to be irrigated. This is a critical factor which pro-\nvides information\
    \ about the condition of the soil to \nbe irrigated so as to determine the need\
    \ for irrigation \nor otherwise as well the quantity of water needed for \nirrigation.\
    \ The system also provides irrigation data \nin terms of the volume of water used\
    \ for irrigation, \nperiod of irrigation as well as the total time spent on \n\
    irrigation, hence the development of the smart irriga-\ntion system provides design\
    \ data for prediction and \nforecasting as well secondary data scaling its devel-\n\
    opment or subsequent redesign.\n2.7 Numerical Experiment\nIn order to develop\
    \ a predictive model for the de-\ntermination of volume of required for irrigation\
    \ and \nstudy the effect of three critical factors that influences \nthe water\
    \ requirement of the soil namely; soil mois-\nture, ambient air temperature and\
    \ humidity, the dy-\nnamic modelling and simulation was carried out using \nthe\
    \ Response Surface Methodology (RSM). While the \nambient air temperature accounts\
    \ for the overall tem-\nperature of the outdoor air where the irrigation activity\
    \ \nis to be performed, humidity represents the amount of \nwater vapour present\
    \ in the air. A multifunctional tem-\nperature and humidity measurement device\
    \ (PCE-THA \n10-ICA) whose temperature measurement ranges from \n–15 to 50° and\
    \ humidity measurement ranges between \n5–95% was employed for measuring both\
    \ the temper-\nature and the humidity of the environment where irri-\ngation activity\
    \ is to be performed. The range of values \nof three critical parameters namely;\
    \ moisture content \n(20–40%), ambient temperature (15–35°C) and hu-\nmidity (10–30%)\
    \ were used as input parameters into \nthe Central Compose Design (CCD) and Response\
    \ Sur-\nface Methodology (RSM) to develop a predictive model \nthat correlates\
    \ the volume of water required for irriga-\ntion purpose as a function of the\
    \ three critical param-\neters. The essence of optimization is to provide an op-\n\
    timum solution for irrigation purpose. The optimum \nsolution include the determination\
    \ of the need for irri-\ngation and the right volume of water required. This will\
    \ \nsave water, time and cost thereby promoting effective \nirrigation process.\
    \ \n3. Results and Discussion\nThe irrigation of small farm land of cross section\
    \ \n100 m × 100 m was carried for three different soil \nsamples namely; sandy,\
    \ loamy and clay soil at five \ndifferent locations between 8:00–8:59 am. The\
    \ data \ncollected from the soil moisture sensor, the multifunc-\ntional temperature\
    \ and humidity measurement de-\nvice and the micro controller are presented in\
    \ Table 1.\nFigure 7 is a plot of volume of water used and the \ntime spent for\
    \ the irrigation for the three soil samples. \nThree critical factors namely;\
    \ soil moisture, ambient \ntemperature and humidity determined the volume of \n\
    water required for irrigation. The water requirement \nwas highest in sandy soil\
    \ and least in clay soil. This \nis due to the fact that the moisture content\
    \ is highest \nin clay and least in sandy soil. The clay soil has high \nwater\
    \ retention ability due to its structure hence the \nreason for the high value\
    \ of its moisture content, fol-\nlowed by loamy soil and then sandy soil. The\
    \ require-\nment of water by the soil was observed to increase as \nthe value\
    \ of soil moisture decreases. \nThe equation of the predictive model is expressed\

    \ irrigation\nThe developed model was validated using the \nAnalysis of Variance\
    \ (ANOVA). It was found to be high-\nly adequate for the prediction of the volume\
    \ of water \nneeded for irrigation as the regression model was \nfound to be highly\
    \ significant at 95% confidence lev-\nel. The correlation coefficients namely;\
    \ the R-squared \n(0.9695), adjusted R-squared (0.9533) and predicted \nR-squared\
    \ (0.9785) were within the same range and \nvery close to 1 for input parameters.\
    \ The closer the \ncorrelation coefficients to 1, the more efficient and re-\n\
    liable the predictive ability of developed model.\nFigure 8 is a 3 D plot that\
    \ studies the effect of the \ninteraction of humidity and temperature on the need\
    \ \nfor irrigation as well as the volume of water required. \nHumidity is the\
    \ amount of water vapour present in \nthe air. It is high when the amount of water\
    \ vapour in \nthe air is high while the ambient temperature is the \ndegree of\
    \ hotness or coldness of the air in the envi-\nronment.\nHumidity increases as\
    \ the amount of water vapour \nin the air is increases. From Figure 8, the relationship\
    \ \nbetween the humidity and temperature is inversely \nproportional. Keeping\
    \ the percent moisture content \nconstant at 23.02%, the percent humidity increas-\n\
    es as ambient temperature decreases. This is due to \nthe fact that air tend to\
    \ hold more water molecules as \nambient temperature increases hence the relative\
    \ hu-\nmidity decreases. The optimum volume of the water \nrequired for irrigation\
    \ is 1025 litres.\nFigure 9 is a 3 D plot that studies the effect of the \ninteraction\
    \ of soil humidity and temperature on the \nneed for irrigation as well as the\
    \ volume of water re-\nquired. As temperature increases, percent moisture \ncontent\
    \ decreases. This is due to the fact that the rate \nof evaporation increases\
    \ with increase in tempera-\nture with attendant decrease in the moisture content.\
    \ \nThe optimum value of the volume required for irriga-\ntion is 1060.9 litres.\n\

    The development of the automated irrigated was \nsuccessful carried out in a CAD\

    \ It offers the benefits of improved farming \npractices via automation which\
    \ enhances agricultural \nproductivity and encourages round – the – year farm-\n\
    ing, efficient water distribution and management, \nwhile reducing the drudgery\
    \ of manual labour, real \ntime monitoring and control as well as proper sched-\n\
    uling of irrigation activities and enhances multiple \nmode of operation with\
    \ query and feedback mecha-\nnism. The work is an improvement over existing work\
    \ \nin that the ease of operation comes with its multiple \nmodes of operation\
    \ which affords user convenient \nchoices of operation. Also, a predictive model\
    \ that \ncorrelates the volume of required as a function of \nthe soil moisture,\
    \ air temperature and humidity was \ndeveloped. This will assist in predicting\
    \ the time nec-\nessary for irrigation as well as the volume of water \nrequired\
    \ for the irrigation process. \nPUBLIC INTEREST STATEMENT\nThis work is in line\
    \ with the quest to improve \nfood security via the deployment of appropriate\
    \ tech-\nnology for farm irrigation in order to improve crop \nyields and ease\

    \ farming, \nand the need to meet up with the global challenge of \nfood demand,\
    \ deploying appropriate technologies to \nincrease productivity and to reduce\
    \ the burden often \nassociated with farm practices has become inevitable \nhence\

  description: Global urbanization and increasing water demand make efficient water
    resource management crucial. This study employs Multi-Criteria Decision Making
    (MCDM) to evaluate smart city water management strategies. We use representative
    criteria, employ objective judgment, assign weights through the Analytic Hierarchy
    Process (AHP), and score strategies based on meeting these criteria. We find that
    the “Effectiveness and Risk Management” criterion carries the highest weight (15.28%),
    underscoring its pivotal role in strategy evaluation and robustness. Medium-weight
    criteria include “Resource Efficiency, Equity, and Social Considerations” (10.44%),
    “Integration with Existing Systems, Technological Feasibility, and Ease of Implementation”
    (10.10%), and “Environmental Impact” (9.84%) for ecological mitigation. “Community
    Engagement and Public Acceptance” (9.79%) recognizes involvement, while “Scalability
    and Adaptability” (9.35%) addresses changing conditions. “Return on Investment”
    (9.07%) and “Regulatory and Policy Alignment” (8.8%) balance financial and governance
    concerns. Two low-weight criteria, “Data Reliability” (8.78%) and “Long-Term Sustainability”
    (8.55%), stress data accuracy and sustainability. Highly weighted strategies like
    “Smart Metering and Monitoring, Demand Management, Behavior Change” and “Smart
    Irrigation Systems” are particularly effective in improving water management in
    smart cities. However, medium-weighted (e.g., “Educational Campaigns and Public
    Awareness”, “Policy and Regulation”, “Rainwater Harvesting”, “Offshore Floating
    Photovoltaic Systems”, “Collaboration and Partnerships”, “Graywater Recycling
    and Reuse”, and “Distributed Water Infrastructure”) and low-weighted (e.g., “Water
    Desalination”) strategies also contribute and can be combined with higher-ranked
    ones to create customized water management approaches for each smart city’s unique
    context. This research is significant because it addresses urban water resource
    management complexity, offers a multi-criteria approach to enhance traditional
    single-focused methods, evaluates water strategies in smart cities comprehensively,
    and provides a criteria-weight-based resource allocation framework for sustainable
    decisions, boosting smart city resilience. Note that results may vary based on
    specific smart city needs and constraints. Future studies could explore factors
    like climate change on water management in smart cities and consider alternative
    MCDM methods like TOPSIS or ELECTRE for strategy evaluation.

    optimization 1. Introduction 1.1. Research Motivation The burgeoning urbanization
    and escalating demand for water resources in contemporary cities have propelled
    the need for innovative and effective water management strategies [1,2]. Smart
    cities, driven by technological advancements and data-driven decision making [3],
    provide an opportune platform to tackle these challenges [4,5]. Within this context,
    the selection and prioritization of optimal water management strategies assume
    paramount importance. However, this complex decision-making process necessitates
    a comprehensive evaluation that considers a multitude of criteria to determine
    the most viable strategies for smart cities. 1.2. Existing Research and Knowledge
    Gap Efficient and sustainable water management in urban areas, especially in the
    context of the fast-paced growth of smart cities, has been a subject of increasing
    research and attention [6]. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of
    implementing innovative strategies to address challenges related to water scarcity,
    pollution, and inefficient utilization [7]. Traditional approaches often focus
    on individual aspects of water management, neglecting the intricate connections
    between social, environmental, economic, and technological dimensions [8]. While
    existing research acknowledges the promise of smart city technologies, there is
    a notable gap in comprehensive evaluations that consider multiple criteria to
    rank and prioritize water management strategies tailored to smart city contexts.
    Some studies have investigated individual strategies, such as rainwater harvesting
    [9,10], desalination [11,12], and demand management [13], while others have focused
    on specific criteria like economic feasibility [14] or environmental impact [15].
    However, limited research combines a diverse range of strategies and criteria
    in a systematic framework that caters to the complexities of smart cities’ water
    management challenges. 1.3. Originality of This Study, Research Questions, and
    Methodology This article addresses this critical gap in the literature by conducting
    a rigorous and holistic evaluation of ten distinct water management strategies
    (“Smart Metering and Monitoring, Demand Management, and Behavior Change”, “Rainwater
    Harvesting”, “Graywater Recycling and Reuse”, “Distributed Water Infrastructure”,
    “Smart Irrigation Systems”, “Offshore Floating Photovoltaic Systems”, “Water Desalination”,
    “Policy and Regulation”, “Educational Campaigns and Public Awareness”, and “Collaboration
    and Partnerships”) within the framework of smart cities. Our evaluation framework
    encompasses a diverse range of criteria (“Effectiveness and Risk Management”,
    “Resource Efficiency, Equity, and Social Considerations”, “Scalability and Adaptability”,
    “Environmental Impact”, “Integration with Existing Systems, Technological Feasibility,
    and Ease of Implementation”, “Long-Term Sustainability”, “Community Engagement
    and Public Acceptance”, “Regulatory and Policy Alignment”, “Return on Investment
    (ROI)”, and “Data Reliability”) that collectively influence the efficacy and feasibility
    of these strategies. Recognizing the complexity of such evaluations, we employ
    the Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) technique, specifically the Analytic
    Hierarchy Process (AHP) [16,17], to assign relative weights to the criteria and
    rank the strategies accordingly. Specifically, this article seeks to answer the
    following research question: “How can water management strategies in smart cities
    be systematically evaluated and prioritized based on a comprehensive set of criteria
    using the MCDM-AHP? The integration of MCDM-AHP into the assessment process adds
    a layer of objectivity and rigor, enabling us to navigate the intricate interplay
    between diverse criteria and strategies (Figure 1). By utilizing AHP, we aim to
    derive an accurate representation of the strategies’ strengths and weaknesses
    while considering various dimensions crucial to their success in smart city contexts.
    Figure 1. Illustration of the study’s holistic framework: incorporating Multi-Criteria
    Decision Making (MCDM), particularly the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), to
    assess optimal water management strategies in the context of smart cities, considering
    diverse criteria. Source: Own elaboration. 1.4. Practical Implications This study
    is poised to make a significant contribution by not only presenting a comprehensive
    evaluation of water management strategies but also by offering actionable insights
    for urban planners, policymakers, and stakeholders. By leveraging the findings
    of this evaluation, decision-makers can make informed choices about water management
    strategies that align with their specific smart city goals and constraints. Ultimately,
    the synthesis of rigorous evaluation and intelligent decision making has the potential
    to drive sustainable and resilient water management practices, ensuring the prosperity
    of smart cities in an era of growing urbanization and resource constraints [18,19].
    1.5. Outline This article begins with an introduction (Section 1) that outlines
    the research motivation (Section 1.1), addressing the pressing need for efficient
    water management in the context of urbanization and smart cities. The existing
    research landscape is discussed, revealing a gap in comprehensive evaluations
    that combine multiple criteria to rank water management strategies tailored to
    smart city contexts (Section 1.2). Emphasizing the study’s originality and contribution,
    the introduction introduces the research questions and outlines the methodology
    involving the Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) technique of the Analytic
    Hierarchy Process (AHP) (Section 1.3). The introduction concludes by highlighting
    the practical implications of the study’s findings for urban planners, policymakers,
    and the broader advancement of smart city development (Section 1.4). Following
    the introduction, Section 2 delves into a comprehensive overview of smart cities.
    Subsequently, Section 3 presents the theoretical framework of MCDM-AHP, elucidating
    the methodology that will be employed to assess and prioritize the identified
    strategies (Section 3.3) based on the established criteria (Section 3.2). This
    section provides a foundational understanding of the context within which the
    study operates. Moving to Section 4, the article transitions to the presentation
    of results. This section entails the construction of pairwise comparison matrices
    between the criteria (Section 4.1), the derivation of relative weights for each
    criterion (Section 4.2), and the calculation of weighted sums associated with
    each water management strategy (Section 4.3). These quantitative outcomes offer
    a structured basis for strategy evaluation. Section 5 engages in an in-depth discussion
    of the advantages and challenges linked to each water management strategy. This
    section integrates the quantitative results with qualitative insights, providing
    a comprehensive understanding of the implications and nuances associated with
    each strategy’s adoption in smart cities. The article culminates with Section
    6, the conclusion. This section synthesizes the findings from the previous sections,
    reaffirms the study’s contribution to the field and limitations, and addresses
    the research questions posed at the outset. It also underscores the broader implications
    of the study’s outcomes for the advancement of smart city water management strategies
    and the sustainable development of urban environments. 2. Exploring Smart Cities:
    Harnessing Technology for Urban Evolution In recent years, the concept of smart
    cities has gained significant traction as a promising avenue for addressing the
    challenges of rapid urbanization, resource scarcity, and environmental sustainability.
    At the heart of this concept lies the integration of cutting-edge technologies,
    particularly Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and the Internet of
    Things (IoT), to revolutionize urban infrastructure, governance, and quality of
    life [5,6]. This holistic approach touches upon various facets of urban living,
    from transportation and energy to healthcare and governance [4] (Figure 2). Below,
    we delve into key aspects of smart cities, showcasing their potential and impact.
    Figure 2. The different components of a smart city are interconnected and work
    together to improve the efficiency and sustainability of the city. For example,
    smart transportation systems can use data from sensors to optimize traffic flow
    and reduce emissions. Smart energy systems can use renewable energy sources and
    energy-efficient technologies to reduce the city’s reliance on fossil fuels. Smart
    agro-hydro networks use data and technology to improve water efficiency, reduce
    leaks, monitor water quality, and improve food production, distribution, and safety.
    Smart buildings can use sensors to monitor energy usage and optimize comfort levels.
    And smart governance systems can use data to improve public services and make
    better decisions. Source: Author’s own elaboration. Information and Communication
    Technology (ICT) in the Smart City: At the core of smart cities is a robust ICT
    framework that acts as the nervous system of the urban landscape. Advanced data
    networks, high-speed internet, and cloud computing enable seamless communication
    between devices, systems, and citizens. This interconnectivity forms the backbone
    for real-time data collection, analysis, and decision-making processes that optimize
    urban functions [20,21]. Internet of Things (IoT) for Smart Cities: The IoT, a
    network of interconnected devices embedded with sensors and software, empowers
    smart cities by facilitating data-driven insights and automation. From smart traffic
    lights that adjust timings based on real-time traffic flow to waste bins that
    signal when they need emptying, IoT drives efficiency and resource optimization
    [22,23]. Smart Sensing: Smart sensing involves deploying various sensors across
    the urban landscape to monitor environmental conditions, energy consumption, and
    other parameters. These sensors provide invaluable data to city planners, helping
    them make informed decisions about resource allocation and infrastructure development
    [24,25]. Smart Grids and Smart Infrastructures: Smart grids leverage digital technology
    to optimize electricity distribution, manage demand, and integrate renewable energy
    sources. This results in a more reliable energy supply, reduced waste, and improved
    sustainability [26,27]. Similarly, smart infrastructures encompass intelligent
    designs that improve the efficiency of buildings, roads, and utilities, enhancing
    overall urban functionality [28,29]. Smart Transportation and Mobility: Smart
    transportation systems utilize data and technology to enhance mobility, reduce
    congestion, and minimize environmental impact. This includes intelligent traffic
    management, electric vehicle charging networks, and even autonomous vehicles that
    promise safer and more efficient transportation [30,31]. Smart Energy: Efficient
    energy use is a hallmark of smart cities [32,33]. Through real-time data analysis
    and monitoring, cities can identify patterns of energy consumption and implement
    strategies to reduce waste and reliance on fossil fuels [34]. Smart Water: Amid
    the array of smart city components, water management strategies emerge as a pivotal
    aspect. Harnessing technology to optimize water usage, prevent wastage, and ensure
    equitable distribution forms a cornerstone of smart city sustainability [15,35].
    Smart Buildings: Smart buildings employ automation and data-driven systems to
    optimize energy consumption, security, and occupant comfort. From adaptive lighting
    to climate control systems, these structures contribute to resource conservation
    and improved quality of life [36,37]. Smart Food and Agriculture: In the face
    of growing urban populations, smart cities explore innovative solutions for food
    production and distribution [38,39]. Vertical farming, urban agriculture, and
    intelligent supply chain management ensure a sustainable and resilient food ecosystem
    [40,41]. Smart Governance: Smart governance involves leveraging technology to
    enhance citizen engagement, streamline administrative processes, and foster transparency.
    E-governance platforms, digital service delivery, and data-driven decision making
    contribute to more responsive and efficient city management [42,43]. Smart People:
    The residents of a smart city play a pivotal role. Educated about sustainable
    practices and equipped with digital tools, citizens can actively contribute to
    resource conservation, waste reduction, and community well-being [44,45]. Smart
    Economy: Technology-driven innovation and entrepreneurship thrive in smart cities.
    By fostering an environment conducive to start-ups and tech industries, these
    cities generate economic growth while addressing urban challenges [46,47]. Smart
    Healthcare: Health services benefit from technology through telemedicine, wearable
    health monitoring devices, and predictive analytics that aid in disease outbreak
    detection and prevention [48,49]. Smart Living: The culmination of these efforts
    is an enhanced quality of life for residents. Reduced congestion, cleaner air,
    efficient services, and improved access to resources contribute to a more comfortable
    and sustainable urban lifestyle [50,51]. In essence, smart cities are poised to
    reshape the urban landscape by infusing it with technology, connectivity, and
    data-driven insights. By addressing challenges through a multidimensional approach,
    these cities offer a glimpse into a future where urbanization and sustainability
    coexist harmoniously. 3. Methodology The evaluation of water management strategies
    within the context of smart cities involves a complex decision-making process.
    To facilitate a structured approach to this assessment, we have employed the Multi-Criteria
    Decision Making (MCDM) with Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach. Appendix
    A outlines the theoretical framework of the MCDM-AHP. 3.1. Hierarchical Structure
    of the Decision-Making Framework Figure 3 illustrates the hierarchical structure
    of our decision-making framework, emphasizing the organization of key elements.
    Figure 3. Hierarchical structure of water management strategy evaluation in smart
    cities using Multi-Criteria Decision Making—Analytic Hierarchy Process (MCDM-AHP),
    with the overarching goal situated at the top level. Criteria (C) (Section 3.2)
    are positioned in the middle level followed by the specific alternatives (A) (Section
    3.3) at the bottom level. Source: Own elaboration, following a well-established
    and recognized hierarchy structure [16,17]. At the highest level of the hierarchy,
    we have the overarching goal of our study, which is to assess water management
    strategies in the context of smart cities. This goal serves as the ultimate objective
    that we aim to achieve through our evaluation. In the second level of the hierarchy,
    we have identified a set of criteria (Section 3.2) that are integral to our decision-making
    process. These criteria encapsulate the diverse aspects and dimensions that are
    critical in the evaluation of water management strategies. The criteria encompass
    considerations such as effectiveness and risk management (C1), resource efficiency,
    equity, and social considerations (C2), scalability and adaptability (C3), environmental
    impact (C4), integration with existing systems, technological feasibility, and
    ease of implementation (C5), long-term sustainability (C6), community engagement
    and public acceptance (C7), regulatory and policy alignment (C8), return on investment
    (C9), and data reliability. Finally, at the bottom level of the hierarchy, we
    have identified a range of water management strategies (Section 3.3) as our alternatives
    for evaluation. These alternatives encompass a broad spectrum of approaches, including
    Smart Metering and Monitoring, Demand Management, and Behavior Change (A1); Rainwater
    Harvesting (A2); Graywater Recycling and Reuse (A3); Distributed Water Infrastructure
    (A4); Smart Irrigation Systems (A5); Offshore Floating Photovoltaic Systems (A6);
    Water Desalination (A7); Policy and Regulation (A8); Educational Campaigns and
    Public Awareness (A9); and Collaboration and Partnerships (A10). This hierarchical
    structure is a well-known approach to decision making, which enables us to systematically
    assess and prioritize the water management strategies based on the defined criteria.
    3.2. Key Criteria for Evaluating Water Management Strategies in Smart Cities When
    evaluating water management strategies in smart cities, it is important to consider
    a range of criteria to ensure that the chosen strategies are effective, sustainable,
    and aligned with the city’s goals and needs [52]. Some common criteria to consider
    when evaluating water management strategies in smart cities are: (C1) Effectiveness
    and Risk Management: How well does the strategy achieve its intended goals, such
    as water conservation, improved water quality, or increased water availability
    [53,54]? Does the strategy address potential risks and vulnerabilities, such as
    water scarcity [1], extreme weather events [55,56,57], or technological failures
    [58]? (C2) Resource Efficiency, Equity, and Social Considerations: Does the strategy
    make efficient use of water resources, energy, and other inputs? Does it provide
    a positive cost–benefit ratio? Does the strategy ensure equitable access to water
    resources across different socioeconomic groups? Does it consider social and cultural
    factors [53,59,60]? (C3) Scalability and Adaptability: Can the strategy be scaled
    up or expanded to meet the needs of a growing population or changing urban landscape?
    Can the strategy be adjusted or modified as conditions change or new technologies
    emerge [61,62]? (C4) Environmental Impact: What are the environmental consequences
    of implementing the strategy? Does it minimize negative impacts on ecosystems
    and natural resources [63]? (C5) Integration with Existing Systems, Technological
    Feasibility, and Ease of Implementation: Can the strategy be integrated with the
    city’s existing water supply and distribution infrastructure without major disruptions?
    How complex is the implementation process? Are there potential barriers or challenges
    that need to be addressed [64,65,66]? (C6) Long-Term Sustainability: Will the
    strategy maintain its effectiveness and benefits over the long term [67]? Is it
    resilient to changing conditions and future challenges [68,69] (SMRY [70])? (C7)
    Community Engagement and Public Acceptance: How well does the strategy involve
    and engage the community in water conservation efforts? Is there public support
    and participation? Is the strategy likely to be accepted and embraced by residents,
    businesses, and other stakeholders [71,72]? (C8) Regulatory and Policy Alignment:
    Is the strategy in alignment with local regulations, policies, and sustainability
    goals [73]? (C9) Return on Investment (ROI): What is the expected return on investment
    in terms of water savings, reduced costs, and other benefits [74]? (C10) Data
    Reliability: Is the strategy based on accurate and reliable data, especially if
    it involves data-driven decision making [75]? By evaluating water management strategies
    against these common criteria, smart cities can make well-informed decisions that
    lead to sustainable, efficient, and resilient water management practices [76,77].
    3.3. Alternatives: Water Management Strategies in Smart Cities Water management
    is a critical aspect of creating sustainable and efficient smart cities. Smart
    cities use technology and data-driven approaches to enhance the management of
    water resources, reduce waste, and ensure equitable distribution [78,79]. Some
    water management strategies commonly implemented in smart cities include the following:
    (A1) Smart Metering and Monitoring, Demand Management, and Behavior Change: Integrating
    smart water meters offers real-time consumption data for tracking patterns, identifying
    leaks, and maintaining systems. Smart sensors monitor water quality, reservoir
    levels, and infrastructure conditions, with advanced networks detecting anomalies
    and alerting maintenance teams. Early warning systems predict flooding or contamination
    [80,81]. Additionally, smart cities foster water conservation through real-time
    consumption information, empowering individuals to make conscious usage decisions.
    Data analytics and predictive modeling anticipate demand, optimize resources,
    and enhance infrastructure planning for reduced demand and balanced supply [13].
    (A2) Rainwater Harvesting: Collecting rainwater from rooftops and paved surfaces
    and storing it for later use can help replenish groundwater levels and provide
    an additional source of water for non-potable purposes such as irrigation, flushing
    toilets, and washing [9,10]. (A3) Graywater Recycling and Reuse: Implementing
    systems to treat and recycle wastewater (e.g., from sinks and showers) for non-potable
    uses like irrigation, industrial processes, and toilet flushing can significantly
    reduce the demand for fresh water. This also minimizes pollution of natural water
    bodies and reduces the load on the sewage system [82,83]. (A4) Distributed Water
    Infrastructure: Implementing decentralized water treatment and distribution systems
    reduces energy and water loss associated with centralized systems [84]. (A5) Smart
    Irrigation Systems: Automated irrigation systems that use weather forecasts and
    soil moisture data can optimize irrigation schedules, reducing water consumption
    in urban landscaping [85,86]. (A6) Offshore Floating Photovoltaic (OFPV) Systems:
    OFPV systems consist of solar panels installed on floating platforms, typically
    in bodies of water. These platforms can be anchored or moored, and they have the
    advantage of utilizing underutilized water surfaces for solar energy generation.
    Offshore FPV systems offer several benefits: First, water bodies provide a cooling
    effect, which can enhance the efficiency of solar panels and increase their energy
    output. Second, by using water surfaces, offshore FPV systems free up land for
    other uses, such as agriculture or urban development. Third, offshore installations
    can help avoid conflicts over land use, which can be a challenge in densely populated
    areas. Fourth, the presence of solar panels on the water surface can reduce evaporation
    rates and enhance water quality through shading, potentially preserving water
    resources [2,87]. (A7) Water Desalination: Water desalination is the process of
    removing salt and other impurities from seawater or brackish water to make it
    suitable for human consumption, agriculture, and industrial use. There are different
    desalination technologies available, including reverse osmosis (RO) and multi-stage
    flash (MSF) distillation. Desalination requires a significant amount of energy,
    making it a suitable candidate for integration with renewable energy sources like
    OFPV [11,12]. (A8) Policy and Regulation: Implementing regulations that promote
    sustainable water management practices, such as water-use quotas and pricing structures,
    incentives for water-efficient technologies, and penalties for wasteful practices,
    can drive positive change [88,89]. (A9) Educational Campaigns and Public Awareness:
    Conducting campaigns and educational programs (i.e., workshops, seminars, and
    online resources) for residents, businesses, and students to raise awareness about
    water scarcity [1], conservation practices, and the impact of individual behaviors
    can foster a culture of responsible water usage within the community. Public awareness
    focuses on changing behavior through education, while other strategies involve
    implementing technology and infrastructure changes [90,91]. (A10) Collaboration
    and Partnerships: Smart cities often collaborate with academic institutions, technology
    companies, non-governmental organizations, and water utilities to leverage expertise,
    resources, and funding for effective water management solutions [92,93]. These
    strategies, when combined and tailored to the specific needs of a city, can contribute
    to improved water management in smart cities, fostering sustainability, resilience,
    and quality of life for residents. 3.4. Clarifying Dependencies between Criteria,
    Alternatives, and Criteria–Alternatives Interaction In our comprehensive evaluation
    of water management strategies using the MCDM-AHP methodology (Appendix A), it
    is imperative to acknowledge the intricate web of dependencies that exist between
    the criteria, alternatives, and their interactions. These dependencies play a
    pivotal role in shaping our decision-making process. Inter-Criteria Dependencies:
    Within the criteria layer (Level 2 of our hierarchy, Figure 3), there exist relationships
    among the individual criteria (C1–C10). For example, effectiveness and risk management
    (C1) may influence long-term sustainability (C6), as a strategy’s effectiveness
    in managing risks could determine its long-term viability. Similarly, the resource
    efficiency, equity, and social consideration (C2) criterion may interact with
    community engagement and public acceptance (C7), as social equity considerations
    can impact how a strategy is received by the community. Certain factors within
    our hierarchy exert dominance over others due to their significant influence on
    the decision-making process. These factors have a more substantial impact on the
    overall assessment of water management strategies (Section 4.2). Alternative Interactions:
    The water management strategy alternatives (A1–A10, at Level 3 of our hierarchy,
    Figure 3) do not exist in isolation. Instead, they interact with one another,
    sometimes complementing or conflicting with each other. For instance, the implementation
    of distributed water infrastructure (A4) could impact the feasibility and effectiveness
    of smart metering and monitoring (A1), as both strategies may involve the use
    of advanced technology and infrastructure within a city. Criteria–Alternative
    Interplay: Each criterion in Level 2 of our hierarchy, Figure 3, interacts with
    every alternative in Level 3, as the evaluation process involves assessing how
    well each strategy meets the specified criteria. These interactions are dynamic
    and can be highly context-dependent. For instance, the criteria related to environmental
    impact (C4) can influence the evaluation of individual water management strategies
    (A1–A10). Water desalination (A7), for example, may be more suitable in areas
    with limited freshwater resources, but its environmental impact must be weighed
    against its benefits. These dependencies are crucial to understanding the broader
    implications of each criterion for our decision-making process. In addition, policy
    and regulation alignment (C8) plays a role in evaluating the feasibility and compliance
    of all water management strategies (A1–A10) with the existing regulatory framework.
    The hierarchy itself (Figure 3) implies dependencies. For instance, the overarching
    goal of assessing water management strategies in smart cities (Level 1) fundamentally
    guides the selection and prioritization of criteria (Level 2) and alternatives
    (Level 3), setting the context for the entire evaluation process. Understanding
    these intricate dependencies is crucial for a holistic evaluation of water management
    strategies. It ensures that the evaluation process considers not only the individual
    merits of strategies but also how they align with the broader objectives and constraints
    defined by the criteria and the overarching goal. Our MCDM-AHP model accounts
    for these dependencies, enabling a nuanced and contextually rich assessment of
    the alternatives in the context of smart city water management. 3.5. Demonstration
    of the MCDM-AHP Model in Practice In this section, we provide a practical demonstration
    of how the Multi-Criteria Decision Making with Analytic Hierarchy Process (MCDM-AHP)
    (Appendix A) model operates in the evaluation of water management strategies within
    smart cities. 3.5.1. Data Collection and Assessment To begin, we gathered data
    and input from relevant stakeholders, experts, and decision-makers involved in
    the smart city water management domain. Through workshops found in the existing
    literature [94], we collected their preferences and judgments regarding the importance
    of each criterion (C1–C10). While the workshops found in the literature provided
    valuable insights, they often offered broad findings that did not directly align
    with the specific criteria and alternatives requiring evaluation in our study.
    To address this limitation, we purposefully conducted our own objective judgment
    process. This involved a meticulous and structured consideration of the criteria,
    alternatives, and their relationships, drawing upon both logical reasoning and
    the extensive knowledge base available in the literature. Our objective judgment
    process was meticulously designed to ensure that assessments of criteria and alternatives
    adhered to a clear and consistent logic rooted in the domain knowledge found in
    the literature. We applied established principles, best practices, and empirical
    evidence from the smart city water management field to inform our assessments.
    This approach allowed us to tailor the judgments to the unique context of our
    study, ensuring their direct relevance to the criteria and alternatives under
    evaluation. Ultimately, our objective judgment approach played a pivotal role
    in bridging the gap between the general findings of existing workshops in the
    literature and the specific requirements of our study. It facilitated the creation
    of a comprehensive and contextually relevant decision-making framework that not
    only synthesized diverse viewpoints but also remained firmly grounded in the logical
    and knowledge-driven principles of the field. The selection of criteria (C1–C10)
    (Section 3.2) and water management strategies (A1–A10) (Section 3.3) was driven
    by a comprehensive review of the existing literature [79], consultations with
    experts in the field [94], and an analysis of the specific challenges and goals
    of smart city water management [52]. We aimed to include criteria that cover a
    wide range of dimensions critical to the evaluation, such as environmental impact,
    social considerations, feasibility, and effectiveness. The chosen alternatives
    encompassed a diverse set of water management approaches to ensure a holistic
    evaluation of options commonly encountered in real-world scenarios. 3.5.2. Data
    Processing and Analysis Next, the collected data underwent a pairwise comparison
    process to derive the importance of criteria relative to one another and the performance
    of alternatives against each criterion. The Saaty scale (Table 1), a widely accepted
    method for AHP [16,17], was used to convert qualitative expert judgments into
    numerical values. Eigenvalue calculations determined the consistency of expert
    judgments. If necessary, adjustments were made to ensure the reliability of the
    decision-making model (Figure 4) (Section 4.1). Figure 4. Analytic Hierarchy Process
    (AHP) algorithm. Source: Own elaboration. Table 1. Saaty scale for pairwise comparisons.
    Experts or decision-makers use these values to make pairwise comparisons between
    criteria or alternatives. For example, if criterion A is considered to be moderately
    more important than criterion B, a value of 3 might be assigned. If criterion
    A is considered much more important than criterion B, a value of 5 would be appropriate.
    The Saaty scale ensures a structured and consistent way of capturing relative
    importance or preference in AHP [16,95]. Criteria and alternative weights were
    aggregated to establish the overall preference scores for each water management
    strategy, considering all criteria and their associated weights. With the aggregated
    scores, we ranked the water management strategies in order of preference, revealing
    which strategies best align with the objectives of our study, as represented by
    the overarching goal and criteria (Section 4.2 and Section 4.3). 3.5.3. Rationale
    for Method Selection The choice of the MCDM-AHP methodology for our analysis was
    rooted in its ability to handle complex, multidimensional decision-making problems
    effectively. AHP is well-suited for situations where criteria are interrelated,
    dependencies exist between criteria and alternatives, and subjective expert judgment
    is essential [16,95]. Its transparency and robustness make it an ideal choice
    for our study. In fact, the MCDM-AHP approach was deemed the best solution for
    our analysis due to its ability to achieve the following: Systematically Address
    Multiple Criteria: AHP provides a structured framework to consider a wide array
    of criteria, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of water management strategies.
    Capture Expert Knowledge: By involving domain experts and decision-makers, we
    harnessed their expertise to inform the decision-making process and ensure real-world
    relevance. Quantify Subjective Judgments: AHP’s pairwise comparison method allowed
    us to convert qualitative expert judgments into quantifiable data, enhancing the
    rigor and objectivity of our analysis. Handle Complex Dependencies: AHP accommodates
    the intricate dependencies between criteria, alternatives, and their interactions,
    aligning with the complexity of our evaluation problem. 4. Results Within this
    section, we conduct an exhaustive analysis of water management strategies (Section
    3.3) within the context of smart cities (Section 2). A thorough evaluation of
    these strategies is conducted based on a predefined set of criteria (Section 3.2).
    To facilitate this evaluative process, we construct a pairwise comparison matrix
    (refer to Table 2), enabling us to ascertain the relative significance of each
    criterion concerning others (as exemplified in Figure 5). Leveraging these established
    relative weights, we subsequently calculate cumulative weighted scores for each
    water management approach (refer to Figure 6). This computational approach yields
    a holistic score that comprehensively reflects the pivotal role of each criterion
    within the overarching assessment. Figure 5. Criteria weights indicate the proportional
    significance attributed to individual criteria during the assessment of water
    management strategies in smart cities. These weights offer transparency regarding
    the varying importance of each criterion in shaping the overall efficacy of the
    potential choices. Source: Own elaboration. Figure 6. Combined weighted ratings
    for each alternative. Higher weighted sums indicate enhanced overall performance.
    Source: Own elaboration. Table 2. Pairwise comparison matrix for criteria evaluation
    (Section 3.2) when assessing strategies (Section 3.3) for water management in
    smart cities. Employing a rating scale of 1 to 9, our approach signifies the relative
    importance of criteria, with 1 denoting equal significance and 9 indicating notably
    greater importance. Refer to Appendix A for comprehensive details. 4.1. Conducting
    Pairwise Comparison Matrix for Criteria Assessment The pairwise comparison matrix
    (Table 2) is a crucial component of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology
    (Appendix A, (A1)) used to quantify the relative importance of criteria when assessing
    water management strategies for smart cities. The matrix employs a rating scale
    from 1 to 9, where 1 signifies equal significance and 9 indicates notably greater
    importance. In this section, we provide an interpretation of this matrix, illustrating
    how the values can be obtained based on logical comparisons. C1 (Effectiveness
    and Risk Management) vs. Other Criteria: The value 3 in the cell (C1, C2) indicates
    that according to the judgment of experts or decision-makers, criterion C1 is
    considered three times more important than criterion C2 in the context of evaluating
    water management strategies. Similarly, the values in other cells in the same
    row (C1) reflect the relative importance of C1 compared to each of the other criteria
    (C3, C4, C5, etc.). C2 (Resource Efficiency, Equity, and Social Consideration)
    vs. Other Criteria: The value 1/3 in the cell (C2, C1) suggests that criterion
    C2 is considered one-third as important as criterion C1. This reflects the judgment
    that C1 holds higher significance than C2 in the assessment process. Similarly,
    the values in the row for C2 indicate its relative importance compared to the
    other criteria. Reciprocal Relationships: The matrix follows the principle of
    reciprocity, ensuring that if criterion A is considered x times more important
    than criterion B, then criterion B is seen as 1/x times as important as criterion
    A. For example, if C1 is three times more important than C2 (C1/C2 = 3), then
    C2 is considered one-third as important as C1 (C2/C1 = 1/3). This principle is
    maintained throughout the matrix. Other Criteria Interactions: The values in the
    matrix reflect the logical comparisons between each pair of criteria. For instance,
    the value 5 in the cell (C1, C3) suggests that criterion C1 is considered five
    times more important than criterion C3. The use of fractions like 1/5 or 2/3 indicates
    the relative strength of importance based on expert judgment. Diagonal Elements:
    The diagonal elements of the matrix have a fixed value of 1 since each criterion
    is equally important to itself (C1 compared to C1, C2 compared to C2, and so on).
    Consistency Check: After the matrix is completed, consistency checks can be performed
    to ensure that the judgments provided by experts are coherent and do not contain
    contradictions. These checks help ensure the reliability of the matrix and, subsequently,
    the calculated criteria weights. We find that the largest eigenvalue is approximately
    6.02, CI = 0.558. The RI for a 10 × 10 matrix is approximately 1.58. The CR is
    0.353. Since the calculated CR value (0.353) is less than 0.1, the consistency
    of the pairwise comparison matrix is considered acceptable. In summary, the pairwise
    comparison matrix captures expert judgments regarding the relative importance
    of criteria in the evaluation of water management strategies for smart cities.
    These judgments are based on logical comparisons and are later used in the AHP
    methodology to calculate criteria weights (Section 4.2), which play a crucial
    role in prioritizing and assessing the strategies in a structured and objective
    manner (Section 4.3). 4.2. Assessment of Criteria Weights for Smart City Water
    Management Strategies Figure 5 presents the relative weights assigned to different
    criteria used for evaluating water management strategies in smart cities. These
    weights indicate the proportional significance attributed to each criterion when
    assessing the effectiveness and overall viability of potential water management
    choices. The criteria are ranked based on their importance in shaping the success
    of the strategies. 4.2.1. High Relative Weights Effectiveness and Risk Management
    (C1)—15.28%: This criterion holds the highest weight, indicating that the ability
    of a water management strategy to effectively manage risks and ensure its overall
    success is of primary importance. 4.2.2. Medium Relative Weights Resource Efficiency,
    Equity, and Social Considerations (C2)—10.44%: This criterion considers how efficiently
    the strategy utilizes resources, promotes equitable distribution of benefits,
    and addresses social concerns. Its medium weight reflects its significant role
    in evaluating strategies but is not as critical as effectiveness and risk management.
    Integration with Existing Systems, Technological Feasibility, and Ease of Implementation
    (C5)—10.10%: The moderate weight assigned to this criterion indicates that integrating
    with existing systems, technological feasibility, and ease of implementation are
    important but not the sole determinants of a strategy’s success. Environmental
    Impact (C4)—9.84%: This criterion evaluates the environmental consequences of
    the strategy. Its medium weight signifies its relevance in the evaluation process,
    balancing environmental concerns with other considerations. Community Engagement
    and Public Acceptance (C7)—9.79%: The moderate weight assigned to this criterion
    suggests that involving the community and ensuring public acceptance are important,
    but they are not weighted as heavily as other factors. Scalability and Adaptability
    (C3)—9.35%: The ability of a strategy to scale up or adapt to changing conditions
    is moderately important. This weight suggests that while scalability and adaptability
    are vital, they are not the most crucial factors. Return on Investment (ROI) (C9)—9.07%:
    While the return on investment is considered, the lower weight indicates that
    financial gains are important but not the primary focus in evaluating water management
    strategies. Regulatory and Policy Alignment (C8)—8.8%: The weight placed on this
    criterion reflects its significance in ensuring that strategies align with regulations
    and policies, although it is not the most critical consideration. 4.2.3. Low Relative
    Weights Data Reliability (C10)—8.78%: This criterion has the lowest weight, suggesting
    that while data reliability is a consideration, it is not as critical as other
    factors in assessing the viability of strategies. Long-Term Sustainability (C6)—8.55%:
    While long-term sustainability is crucial for the success of smart city water
    management, the slightly lower weight suggests that it is considered moderately
    important compared to other criteria. In summary, the criteria with higher weights
    (C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C7, C8, and C9) collectively represent the core dimensions
    that influence the assessment of water management strategies, ranging from effectiveness
    and sustainability to societal acceptance and regulatory compliance. While the
    criteria with lower weights (C6, C10) are still significant, they might have a
    comparatively smaller impact on the overall evaluation process. 4.3. Evaluation
    of Smart City Water Management Strategies Based on Multiple Criteria Figure 6
    presents a list of different water management strategies for evaluating smart
    cities along with their corresponding overall weighted sums. The strategies are
    ranked based on these weighted sums, with higher values indicating enhanced overall
    performance. 4.3.1. High Weighted Sum Strategies with high relative weights (above
    7) are considered to be particularly effective and important for enhancing water
    management in smart cities. These strategies should likely receive significant
    focus and allocation of resources due to their potential to achieve substantial
    improvements. Smart Metering and Monitoring, Demand Management, and Behavior Change
    (A1): This strategy has the highest overall weighted sum of 7.9281, suggesting
    that it is considered the most effective strategy among the alternatives. This
    strategy likely involves using advanced technologies to monitor water consumption,
    manage demand through incentives or pricing mechanisms, and promote behavior change
    among residents and businesses to conserve water. Smart Irrigation Systems (A5):
    This strategy, with a score of 7.0204, likely involves using technology to optimize
    irrigation practices, minimizing water waste in landscaping and agriculture. 4.3.2.
    Medium Weighted Sum Strategies with medium relative weights (between 6 and 7)
    are still valuable and effective but might have certain limitations or dependencies
    that prevent them from being ranked as the highest. These strategies should be
    carefully considered and implemented alongside other strategies for a well-rounded
    water management approach. Educational Campaigns and Public Awareness (A9): With
    a score of 6.8861, this strategy focuses on educating the public and raising awareness
    about water conservation and sustainable practices. Policy and Regulation (A8):
    This strategy, with a score of 6.7465, emphasizes the importance of well-defined
    policies and regulations to govern water management practices effectively. Rainwater
    Harvesting (A2): With an overall weighted sum of 6.6989, this strategy ranks second.
    Rainwater harvesting involves collecting and storing rainwater for various uses,
    which can help reduce demand on traditional water sources. Offshore Floating Photovoltaic
    (OFPV) Systems (A6): This strategy, with a score of 6.2709, suggests using floating
    solar panels over bodies of water to generate renewable energy while reducing
    water evaporation. Collaboration and Partnerships (A10): This strategy, with a
    score of 6.2122, highlights the significance of collaborative efforts between
    stakeholders, such as governments, industries, and communities Graywater Recycling
    and Reuse (A3): This strategy focuses on recycling and reusing graywater (wastewater
    from sources like sinks and showers) for non-potable purposes. It has an overall
    weighted sum of 6.1812. Distributed Water Infrastructure (A4): With a score of
    6.0939, this strategy involves decentralizing water infrastructure, potentially
    reducing distribution losses and increasing efficiency. 4.3.3. Low Weighted Sum
    Strategies with low relative weights (below 6) might have areas for improvement
    or face challenges in terms of feasibility, cost-effectiveness, or impact. While
    these strategies could still contribute to overall water management, they might
    require further refinement or integration with other strategies to maximize their
    benefits. Water Desalination (A7)—With an overall weighted sum of 5.7211, this
    strategy involves the desalination of seawater or brackish water to augment water
    supplies in areas with water scarcity. It is important to keep in mind that the
    interpretation of the relative weights may depend on the specific criteria and
    methodology used to evaluate these strategies, and additional context about the
    evaluation process would provide a more comprehensive understanding. 5. Discussion
    Efficient water management is crucial for sustainable development in smart cities.
    Different strategies have been proposed to address water challenges, each with
    its own set of advantages and disadvantages. In this section, we will evaluate
    these strategies based on various criteria that encompass their effectiveness,
    feasibility, and impact. 5.1. Evaluation Criteria The criteria outlined below
    shed light on the diverse aspects that influence the success of these strategies.
    Effectiveness and Risk Management (C1): Effectiveness: This criterion assesses
    how well a water management strategy can address water-related challenges, such
    as scarcity, contamination risks, and supply–demand imbalances [2,87]. Effective
    strategies provide a foundation for secure water supplies and reduced risks. However,
    it is crucial to note that the effectiveness of a strategy may vary depending
    on the specific context in which it is applied [53]. Risk Management: Evaluating
    risk management involves considering how well a strategy can mitigate and manage
    risks associated with water management. Effective strategies should not only address
    current risks but also be adaptable to evolving challenges [54]. Resource Efficiency,
    Equity, and Social Considerations (C2): Resource Efficiency: This criterion measures
    how efficiently a strategy uses available water resources. Strategies that optimize
    resource use contribute to sustainable water management [53,59]. However, it is
    important to ensure that resource efficiency does not come at the expense of other
    factors, such as equity. Equity: Equity focuses on the fair distribution of water
    resources among all residents regardless of social or economic status. Strategies
    that address equity concerns help ensure that vulnerable or marginalized communities
    have access to clean water [59]. Social Considerations: In addition to equity,
    this criterion assesses how a strategy takes into account social factors and the
    well-being of the community. Strategies should consider the social impact of water
    management decisions and aim to improve the overall quality of life [60]. Scalability
    and Adaptability (C3): Scalability: Scalability evaluates a strategy’s capacity
    to accommodate increasing urban populations and changing water demands. Strategies
    that can expand or contract in response to population growth or fluctuations are
    better equipped to meet the evolving needs of smart cities [61]. Adaptability:
    Adaptability assesses how well a strategy can respond to changing circumstances,
    including shifts in climate, technology, or urban development. Strategies that
    can adjust and evolve are more likely to remain effective over time [62]. Environmental
    Impact (C4): This criterion measures the effect of a water management strategy
    on the natural environment. Low-impact strategies contribute to environmental
    sustainability by minimizing harm to ecosystems, reducing energy consumption,
    and conserving water resources. On the other hand, strategies relying heavily
    on energy or resources may have unintended negative environmental consequences,
    underscoring the importance of balancing environmental concerns in smart cities
    [63]. Integration with Existing Systems, Technological Feasibility, and Ease of
    Implementation (C5): Integration with Existing Systems: Strategies that seamlessly
    integrate with the existing water infrastructure in a city are more likely to
    be adopted. Compatibility with established systems reduces disruptions and costs
    associated with implementation [64]. Technological Feasibility: This criterion
    assesses whether the technology required for a strategy is readily available and
    can be effectively implemented in the smart city context. Strategies that align
    with technological capabilities are more likely to succeed [65]. Ease of Implementation:
    The ease with which a strategy can be put into practice is a crucial factor in
    its success. Strategies that are straightforward to implement and do not require
    extensive infrastructure changes are more likely to gain acceptance [66]. Long-Term
    Sustainability (C6): This criterion evaluates how well a water management strategy
    can ensure the continued availability and quality of water resources for future
    generations. Sustainable strategies consider the long-term impact of their actions
    and prioritize environmental and societal well-being [67]. Community Engagement
    and Public Acceptance (C7): Community Engagement: Strategies that actively involve
    the community and stakeholders in decision-making processes are more likely to
    gain support and be effectively implemented. Engaging the public fosters a sense
    of ownership and responsibility [72]. Public Acceptance: Public support and acceptance
    are critical for the success of any water management strategy. Strategies that
    resonate with local residents and address their concerns are more likely to be
    embraced [71]. Regulatory and Policy Alignment (C8): This criterion assesses how
    well a strategy aligns with existing laws and regulations. Strategies that are
    in sync with governing frameworks are more likely to receive support, resources,
    and legal clearance for implementation [73]. Return on Investment (ROI) (C9):
    ROI evaluates the financial viability of a water management strategy. Strategies
    that offer favorable ROI prospects can attract private investors and policymakers.
    However, high upfront costs associated with some strategies may act as barriers,
    especially if the benefits take time to materialize [74]. Data Reliability (C10):
    For data-driven strategies, the reliability of information is crucial. Accurate
    and dependable data aid decision making and enhance the effectiveness of strategies.
    However, strategies relying on data may suffer from inaccuracies or insufficient
    data availability, potentially hampering their performance [75]. By examining
    water management strategies within this comprehensive framework of evaluation
    criteria, smart cities can make informed decisions that promote sustainable, efficient,
    and equitable water management practices for the benefit of their residents and
    the environment. 5.2. Strategies Evaluation In this section, we will evaluate
    specific water management strategies within the framework of the criteria outlined
    above. Smart Metering and Monitoring, Demand Management, and Behavior Change (A1)
    [13,80,81] (a) Effectiveness and Risk Management (C1): These strategies excel
    in effectiveness by enabling real-time monitoring and data-driven decision making.
    This minimizes water waste, addresses supply–demand imbalances, and mitigates
    risks associated with water scarcity or contamination. However, initial implementation
    costs and the necessity for widespread behavior change may pose challenges. (b)
    Resource Efficiency, Equity, and Social Considerations (C2): They contribute to
    resource efficiency by optimizing water distribution. However, ensuring equity
    and social considerations can be challenging, as certain demographics may struggle
    with technology adoption, potentially exacerbating social disparities. (c) Scalability
    and Adaptability (C3): These strategies are scalable and adaptable, but their
    scalability might be limited by the availability of infrastructure and the willingness
    of residents to embrace behavioral changes. (d) Environmental Impact (C4): Generally,
    they have a low environmental impact, focusing on reducing water waste. However,
    the production and disposal of smart metering equipment may have environmental
    consequences. (e) Integration with Existing Systems, Technological Feasibility,
    and Ease of Implementation (C5): They seamlessly integrate with existing water
    systems and are technologically feasible. However, changing resident behavior
    can be challenging, and the initial investment in equipment and infrastructure
    can be significant. (f) Long-Term Sustainability (C6): These strategies contribute
    to long-term sustainability by reducing water consumption. However, maintaining
    behavior change over the long term and ensuring the longevity of technology infrastructure
    can be complex. (g) Community Engagement and Public Acceptance (C7): Success here
    depends on educating and engaging the community. Public acceptance may be challenging
    due to concerns about data privacy and technology adoption. (h) Regulatory and
    Policy Alignment (C8): Regulatory alignment is generally good, but data privacy
    regulations must be considered. Policies may need to evolve to fully support these
    strategies. (i) Return on Investment (ROI) (C9): While the long-term ROI is positive,
    high initial costs may deter some municipalities or residents from adoption. (j)
    Data Reliability (C10): Data reliability is high, given the use of advanced monitoring
    technology. However, data security and privacy must be carefully managed. Rainwater
    Harvesting (A2) [9,10] (a) Effectiveness and Risk Management (C1): Effective in
    harnessing rainwater as a local water source, reducing reliance on external supplies.
    However, effectiveness depends on local rainfall patterns, posing potential risks
    during dry periods [9,10]. (b) Resource Efficiency, Equity, and Social Considerations
    (C2): Promotes resource efficiency and equity by reducing pressure on centralized
    water systems. However, adoption may vary based on property ownership, potentially
    leading to inequities. (c) Scalability and Adaptability (C3): Scalability may
    be limited by available space and infrastructure. Adaptability is high, especially
    in areas with frequent rainfall. (d) Environmental Impact (C4): Generally, low
    environmental impact is preferable, as it reduces the energy required for water
    distribution. However, proper management is needed to prevent contamination and
    ecosystem disruption. (e) Integration with Existing Systems, Technological Feasibility,
    and Ease of Implementation (C5): Integrates well with existing systems but may
    require modifications to infrastructure. Technologically feasible but may require
    a learning curve for residents. Implementation can be straightforward for new
    constructions. (f) Long-Term Sustainability (C6): Contributes to long-term sustainability
    by reducing dependence on external water sources. However, maintenance and proper
    management are crucial to ensure system longevity. (g) Community Engagement and
    Public Acceptance (C7): Success depends on educating residents about the benefits
    of rainwater harvesting. Public acceptance is generally positive but can vary
    by region. (h) Regulatory and Policy Alignment (C8): Regulatory alignment varies
    by region. Policies supporting rainwater harvesting may need to be developed or
    modified. (i) Return on Investment (ROI) (C9): Positive ROI over the long term,
    but high initial costs can be a barrier. (j) Data Reliability (C10): Data reliability
    is less relevant for rainwater harvesting compared to technology-dependent strategies.
    Graywater Recycling and Reuse (A3) [82,83] (a) Effectiveness and Risk Management
    (C1): Effective in reducing the strain on freshwater resources by recycling graywater.
    However, it may not fully address water scarcity risks in arid regions [82,83].
    (b) Resource Efficiency, Equity, and Social Considerations (C2): Highly resource-efficient
    and promotes equity in water distribution. However, technological feasibility
    challenges and public acceptance may limit adoption. (c) Scalability and Adaptability
    (C3): Scalable, but adaptation may require modifications to plumbing systems.
    Effective in adapting to changing water demands. (d) Environmental Impact (C4):
    Generally low environmental impact, as it reduces the energy required for water
    treatment. However, improper treatment can lead to contamination concerns. (e)
    Integration with Existing Systems, Technological Feasibility, and Ease of Implementation
    (C5): Integration may require plumbing changes, and technological feasibility
    depends on local infrastructure. Implementation can be straightforward for new
    constructions. (f) Long-Term Sustainability (C6): Contributes to long-term sustainability
    by reducing freshwater consumption. Proper maintenance is key to ensuring sustainability.
    (g) Community Engagement and Public Acceptance (C7): Success depends on educating
    and gaining acceptance from residents. Concerns about water quality may need to

    evaluating water management strategies in smart cities involves a multidimensional
    analysis of criteria and strategies. Each strategy has unique advantages and disadvantages
    across these criteria, emphasizing the need for tailored approaches that address
    specific urban contexts and challenges. By considering these aspects comprehensively,
    smart cities can implement effective water management strategies that align with
    their long-term sustainability goals and the well-being of their residents. This
    systematic evaluation of strategies within the framework of various criteria provides
    valuable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and stakeholders in making
    informed decisions regarding water management in smart cities. 5.3. Impact of
    the Results on Current Smart Cities The findings of this study, which prioritize
    water management strategies based on a comprehensive set of criteria and weights,
    have significant implications for current smart cities striving to enhance their
    water management practices. These implications extend to urban planners, policymakers,
    and stakeholders involved in shaping the future of smart cities. Strategic Investment:
    The prioritization of criteria highlights the importance of “Effectiveness and
    Risk Management” as the most critical criterion. This underscores the need for
    smart cities to invest in strategies like “Smart Metering and Monitoring, Demand
    Management, and Behavior Change”, which can effectively address water challenges
    while managing associated risks. Resource Optimization: The emphasis on “Resource
    Efficiency, Equity, and Social Considerations” encourages smart cities to prioritize
    strategies such as “Rainwater Harvesting” and “Graywater Recycling and Reuse”
    that not only conserve water but also ensure equitable access to clean water for
    all residents. Smart cities must consider the social implications of their water
    management decisions and work toward resource optimization. Technological Integration:
    “Integration with Existing Systems, Technological Feasibility, and Ease of Implementation”
    is another key criterion. Smart cities should focus on strategies like “Smart
    Irrigation Systems” that seamlessly integrate with their existing infrastructure
    while leveraging available technologies. This approach can facilitate smoother
    implementation and reduce resistance to change. Environmental Responsibility:
    Recognizing the importance of “Environmental Impact” encourages smart cities to
    adopt strategies such as “Offshore Floating Photovoltaic Systems” that minimize
    harm to the environment while addressing water management challenges. Community
    Engagement: The criterion of “Community Engagement and Public Acceptance” emphasizes
    the role of the community in successful water management. Smart cities should
    actively involve residents and gain their support for strategies like “Educational
    Campaigns and Public Awareness”, recognizing that public acceptance is vital for
    strategy implementation. Balancing Financial and Governance Concerns: The inclusion
    of “Return on Investment” and “Regulatory and Policy Alignment” criteria highlights
    the need for smart cities to strike a balance between financial considerations
    and governance alignment. Policymakers must ensure that regulations support the
    adoption of effective water management strategies, such as “Policy and Regulation”.
    Data Accuracy and Sustainability: “Data Reliability” and “Long-Term Sustainability”
    are two criteria that underscore the importance of data accuracy and long-term
    planning. Smart cities should invest in reliable data collection and analysis
    while focusing on strategies that promote sustainability, including “Collaboration
    and Partnerships”. In summary, the prioritization of criteria and strategies provides
    a roadmap for smart cities to tailor their water management approaches to their
    unique contexts. While highly weighted strategies offer significant benefits,
    medium- and low-weighted strategies should not be overlooked, as they can complement
    and enhance the overall water management framework. Smart cities should consider
    these findings when developing and implementing their water management strategies
    to ensure sustainability, efficiency, and equity in the use of this vital resource.
    5.4. Limitations of Conducted Research While this research provides valuable insights
    into the evaluation of water management strategies in smart cities, it is essential
    to acknowledge its limitations to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the
    study’s scope and applicability: Scope of Criteria: The criteria used for evaluation
    were carefully selected, but there may be other relevant criteria that were not
    included in this study. Future research could explore additional criteria that
    may impact water management strategies, including the impact of climate change
    [68,69]. Weighting Process: The determination of criteria weights using the MCDM-AHP
    method relies on objective judgments, and the results may vary based on the perspectives
    of different stakeholders. It is essential to recognize that the weighting process
    involves inherent uncertainties. Context Dependency: The study’s findings are
    based on a generalized framework and may not fully capture the unique contexts
    and challenges of specific smart cities. Local factors and circumstances can significantly
    influence the choice and effectiveness of water management strategies. Dynamic
    Nature of Smart Cities: Smart cities are continually evolving, with technological
    advancements, population changes, and shifting priorities. The research may not
    account for the dynamic nature of smart city development and its impact on water
    management strategies over time. Policy and Governance Factors: The study assumes
    a certain level of policy and governance support for the implementation of strategies.
    In reality, policy dynamics and governance structures can vary widely among smart
    cities, affecting strategy adoption. Addressing these limitations and conducting
    further research that considers the specific contexts of individual smart cities
    can contribute to a more robust understanding of effective water management in
    the evolving landscape of urban development. 6. Conclusions 6.1. Research Motivation,
    Research Questions, and Methodology The efficient and sustainable management of
    water resources has become a critical concern for urban areas worldwide, particularly
    in the context of rapid urbanization and the increasing demand for water. Smart
    cities, characterized by the integration of digital technologies and data-driven
    approaches, offer a promising avenue to address these challenges. However, the
    selection of effective water management strategies for smart cities requires a
    comprehensive evaluation that considers multiple criteria. This study aims to
    fill a gap in the existing literature by providing a systematic and holistic assessment
    of water management strategies based on a diverse set of criteria, employing the
    Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) technique of Analytic Hierarchy Process
    (AHP). 6.2. General Findings and Limitations The relative weights assigned to
    different criteria provide insights into the importance of each criterion in shaping
    the success of these strategies. The results suggest that certain criteria hold
    higher significance than others, guiding the prioritization and allocation of
    resources for the implementation of water management strategies. The criterion
    of “Effectiveness and Risk Management” holds the highest weight (15.28%), underscoring
    its central role in evaluating water management strategies. The ability of a strategy
    to effectively manage risks and ensure its overall success is crucial for its
    adoption and long-term sustainability. This emphasizes the need for strategies
    that not only perform well in terms of water conservation but also demonstrate
    robustness in the face of uncertainties and potential challenges. Several criteria
    fall under the category of medium relative weights, indicating their significant
    but not dominant role in the evaluation process. The medium weight (10.44%) assigned
    to the “Resource Efficiency, Equity, and Social Considerations” criterion reflects
    its importance in promoting efficient resource use and ensuring equitable distribution
    of benefits. It also considers the social implications of the strategies, highlighting
    the need to address societal concerns such as accessibility, affordability, and
    inclusivity. The moderate weight (10.10%) assigned to the “Integration with Existing
    Systems, Technological Feasibility, and Ease of Implementation” criterion underscores
    the importance of strategies that can seamlessly integrate with existing systems
    and technologies, facilitating smooth implementation. However, this criterion
    is balanced with other considerations, acknowledging that technological feasibility
    is not the sole determinant of a strategy’s success. The weight (9.84%) assigned
    to “Environmental Impact” reflects the need to assess the consequences of strategies
    on the environment. This criterion acknowledges the importance of minimizing negative
    ecological outcomes while achieving water management goals. The moderate weight
    (9.79%) assigned to “Community Engagement and Public Acceptance” recognizes the
    role of involving the public and ensuring their buy-in for successful strategy
    implementation. While important, this criterion is not weighted as heavily as
    others, indicating a balanced approach. The moderate weight (9.35%) assigned to
    “Scalability and Adaptability” highlights their significance in responding to
    changing conditions and expanding the scope of the strategies. While vital for
    long-term success, these factors are not considered the most critical determinants.
    The consideration of “Return on Investment (ROI)” emphasizes the financial aspect
    of the strategies. However, the lower weight (9.07%) suggests that while financial
    gains are important, they are not the primary focus in evaluating water management
    strategies. The weight (8.8%) placed on “Regulatory and Policy Alignment” reflects
    the need for strategies to adhere to established regulations and policies. This
    criterion ensures that strategies are compliant and supportive of broader governance
    frameworks. Two criteria fall under the category of low relative weights, indicating
    their relatively lesser impact on the overall evaluation process. The lowest weight
    (8.78%) assigned to “Data Reliability” suggests that while data accuracy and reliability
    are considerations, they are not as critical as other factors in assessing the
    viability of strategies. This could be due to the availability of advanced data
    collection and analysis technologies that mitigate data-related concerns. The
    slightly lower weight (8.55%) assigned to “Long-Term Sustainability” underscores
    its importance for successful water management strategies. While a key consideration,
    it is deemed moderately important in comparison to other criteria. In conclusion,
    the evaluation of water management strategies in smart cities involves a multi-criteria
    approach that considers diverse factors. The hierarchy of relative weights assigned
    to different criteria provides a structured framework for decision-makers to prioritize
    strategies based on their potential impact. The strategies with high weighted
    sums, such as “Smart Metering and Monitoring, Demand Management, and Behavior
    Change”, and “Smart Irrigation Systems”, emerge as particularly effective and
    important for enhancing water management in smart cities. However, strategies
    with medium (i.e., “Educational Campaigns and Public Awareness”, “Policy and Regulation”,
    “Rainwater Harvesting”, “Offshore Floating Photovoltaic Systems”, “Collaboration
    and Partnerships”, “Graywater Recycling and Reuse”, and “Distributed Water Infrastructure”)
    and low (i.e., “Water Desalination”) weighted sums also play valuable roles and
    could be integrated with higher-ranked strategies to create comprehensive water
    management approaches tailored to the unique context of each smart city. It is
    crucial to recognize that the interpretation of these results may depend on the
    specific evaluation methodology employed and the unique circumstances of each
    smart city, warranting careful consideration and contextualization. 6.3. Significance
    of This Research Several factors underscore the significance of this research.
    First, the management of water resources in urban areas is a complex endeavor
    that involves various interconnected factors, including environmental sustainability,
    social equity, economic viability, and technological feasibility. Traditional
    approaches often focus on a single aspect, neglecting the broader picture. This
    study seeks to overcome this limitation by considering multiple criteria that
    collectively influence the success of water management strategies. Second, the
    concept of smart cities offers a new paradigm for urban development, leveraging
    technology to optimize resource utilization, enhance quality of life, and mitigate
    environmental impacts. However, there is a lack of comprehensive evaluations of
    water management strategies tailored to the unique context of smart cities. This
    study addresses this gap by analyzing strategies within the framework of smart
    city principles. Third, with limited resources available for implementing water
    management strategies, it is essential to allocate resources effectively to strategies
    that offer the highest impact. By assigning relative weights to different criteria,
    this study assists in identifying strategies that align with the priorities and
    goals of a particular smart city. The findings of this research hold practical
    implications for urban planners, policymakers, and other stakeholders involved
    in water resource management. The identified strategies, based on their relative
    weights, can guide the selection and implementation of water management initiatives,
    leading to more sustainable and resilient smart cities. 6.4. Future Directions

    of interest. Appendix A. Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) Using the Analytic
    Hierarchy Process (AHP) Appendix A.1. Defining Multi-Criteria Decision Making
    (MCDM) Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is a structured approach that helps
    individuals or groups make informed decisions when faced with complex choices
    involving multiple conflicting criteria. Unlike traditional decision-making methods
    that focus on single criteria, MCDM takes into account a variety of criteria that
    often have different units, scales, and levels of importance. By systematically
    analyzing and evaluating these criteria, MCDM provides a rational and comprehensive
    way to assess alternatives and select the most suitable course of action [97].
    Appendix A.2. Types of MCDM Methods In the realm of Multi-Criteria Decision Making
    (MCDM), the choice of technique hinges on the characteristics of the decision
    problem [98]. If the decision problem is well structured, it can be navigated
    through a hierarchical framework. In cases where preferences among alternatives
    are pivotal, the next distinction is whether the criteria are compensatory or
    non-compensatory. For compensatory criteria using additive models, the Analytic
    Hierarchy Process (AHP) offers a systematic approach to hierarchically structured
    decisions. Similarly, the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to an
    Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) ranks alternatives based on their proximity to an ideal
    solution, and it can be employed in both additive and multiplicative contexts.
    On the other hand, if the decision problem is unstructured and lacks a clear hierarchy,
    techniques like the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL)
    and its extension for complex systems (DEMATEL-CS) offer insights into unruly
    decision contexts. In structured decision scenarios that emphasize rankings rather
    than preferences, the nature of criteria becomes essential. Non-compensatory criteria
    prompt techniques such as Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality (ELECTRE),
    which is a tool that eliminates alternatives that do not meet specific thresholds.
    The Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE)
    is also adept at handling non-compensatory scenarios by aggregating preference
    relations. In both structured preference-based and ranking-based decision problems,
    the versatile TOPSIS technique can be utilized as it adapts to both scenarios.
    In summary, understanding whether a decision problem is structured or unstructured,
    preference-based or ranking-based, and whether it involves compensatory or non-compensatory
    criteria is pivotal in selecting an appropriate MCDM technique. This systematic
    approach ensures that decision-makers effectively navigate the complexities of
    their specific decision-making context, utilizing the appropriate MCDM tool to
    arrive at informed choices. Appendix A.3. Applications of MCDM MCDM finds applications
    in a wide range of fields, including business [99,100], engineering [101,102],
    environmental management [103,104], healthcare [105,106], finance [107,108], and
    public policy [109,110]. It is used for project selection [111], supplier evaluation
    [106], resource allocation [112], risk assessment [100,108], site selection (i.e.,
    photovoltaic and concentrated solar power [113], onshore wind [114], offshore
    wind [115], and offshore floating photovoltaic plants [2]), and more. Its versatility
    makes it a valuable tool for handling complex decision-making scenarios where
    numerous factors need to be considered. Appendix A.4. Analytic Hierarchy Process
    (AHP): Definition and Theoretical Framework The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)
    is a widely used MCDM technique that structures a decision problem as a hierarchical
    tree of criteria and alternatives. Developed by Thomas L. Saaty in the late 1970s,
    AHP enables decision-makers to decompose complex decisions into smaller, more
    manageable parts, facilitating a systematic evaluation process [16]. AHP has proven
    particularly effective when there are qualitative and quantitative criteria involved
    and when the decision involves both tangible and intangible factors. The AHP can
    be broken down into the following steps: Step 1—Define the Hierarchy: The first
    step in AHP involves structuring the decision problem hierarchically. Consider
    a decision problem with n alternatives and m criteria. The hierarchy consists
    of three levels: the goal (G), criteria (C), and alternatives (A). Figure 3 illustrates
    the hierarchical framework employed for evaluating water management strategies
    within smart cities using the MCDM-AHP. Step 2—Pairwise Comparisons: Next, pairwise
    comparisons are conducted to determine the relative importance of criteria and
    sub-criteria, using a scale, such as 1 to 9, where 1 represents equal importance
    and 9 represents extreme importance [16,17] (Table 1). For each pair of elements
    i and j at level k, a comparison matrix is created (A1): 𝐴 𝑘 𝑖𝑗 =Preference_Score(𝑖,𝑗)for𝑖,𝑗∈Level𝑘
    (A1) Step 3—Normalize the Comparison Matrices: The comparison matrices are normalized
    to obtain the corresponding normalized matrices (A2): 𝑁 𝑘 𝑖𝑗 = 𝐴 𝑘 𝑖𝑗 ∑ 𝑛 𝑗=1
    𝐴 𝑘 𝑖𝑗 for𝑖,𝑗∈Level𝑘 (A2) Step 4—Calculate Criteria Weights: The criteria weights
    are obtained by averaging the columns of the normalized comparison matrix (A3):
    𝑊 𝑘 = 1 𝑛 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑛 𝑁 𝑘 𝑖𝑗 for𝑗∈Level𝑘 (A3) Step 5—Consistency Check: A consistency
    ratio ( 𝐶𝑅 ) is calculated to ensure the consistency of the comparisons. The 𝐶𝑅
    is calculated as (A4): 𝐶𝑅= CI RI (A4) where CI is the Consistency Index (A5) and
    RI is the Random Index (A.4). If the CR value is acceptable (typically below 0.1),
    the pairwise comparisons are consistent. If the CR value is considered unacceptable,
    typically surpassing the threshold of 0.1, it indicates a lack of consistency
    in the pairwise comparisons. In such cases, it is recommended to review and revise
    the comparisons to improve their consistency (Figure 4). This can involve re-evaluating
    the relative importance assigned to certain elements, reviewing the decision-making
    process, or refining the criteria to enhance coherence and alignment. Consistency
    is crucial for the accuracy and reliability of the AHP results, so addressing
    inconsistencies is important to ensure robust decision outcomes. 𝐶𝐼= 𝜆 max −𝑛
    𝑛−1 (A5) RI= ⎧ ⎩ ⎨             0.00 0.00 0.58 0.90 1.12 ⋮ for𝑛=1 for𝑛=2
    for𝑛=3 for𝑛=4 for𝑛=5 ⋮ Step 6—Calculate the Priority Vector: The priority vector
    𝑃 𝑘 for each level k is calculated by finding the principal eigenvector of the
    normalized comparison matrix (A6): 𝑁 𝑃 𝑘 = 𝜆 𝑘 𝑃 𝑘 (A6) where 𝜆 𝑘 is the eigenvalue
    corresponding to the principal eigenvector. Step 7—Aggregate Priority Scores:
    The priority scores for each alternative at the lower levels are calculated by
    aggregating the priority vectors (A7): 𝑆 𝑖 = ∑ 𝑘=1 𝑚 𝑃 𝑘𝑖 · 𝑊 𝑘 for𝑖∈Alternatives
    (A7) Step 8—Rank Alternatives: Finally, the alternatives are ranked based on their
    priority scores 𝑆 𝑖 , and the alternative with the highest score is selected as
    the preferred choice. This comprehensive framework illustrates the detailed mathematical
    foundation of the AHP, highlighting the systematic approach to structuring decision
    problems, conducting pairwise comparisons, normalizing matrices, calculating criteria
    weights, ensuring consistency, and deriving the final alternative rankings. References

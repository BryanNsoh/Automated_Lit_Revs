    \ countries with water scarcity.\nThis also aﬀects\nagriculture, as a large amount\
    \ of water is dedicated to that use. The possible consequences of global\nwarming\
    \ lead to the consideration of creating water adaptation measures to ensure the\
    \ availability\nof water for food production and consumption. Thus, studies aimed\
    \ at saving water usage in the\nirrigation process have increased over the years.\
    \ Typical commercial sensors for agriculture irrigation\nsystems are very expensive,\
    \ making it impossible for smaller farmers to implement this type of\nsystem.\
    \ However, manufacturers are currently oﬀering low-cost sensors that can be connected\
    \ to\nnodes to implement aﬀordable systems for irrigation management and agriculture\
    \ monitoring. Due to\nthe recent advances in IoT and WSN technologies that can\
    \ be applied in the development of these\nsystems, we present a survey aimed at\
    \ summarizing the current state of the art regarding smart\nirrigation systems.\
    \ We determine the parameters that are monitored in irrigation systems regarding\n\
    water quantity and quality, soil characteristics and weather conditions. We provide\
    \ an overview of\nthe most utilized nodes and wireless technologies. Lastly, we\
    \ will discuss the challenges and the best\npractices for the implementation of\
    \ sensor-based irrigation systems.\nKeywords: irrigation; IoT; precision agriculture;\
    \ sensors\n1. Introduction\nThe lack of fresh water is a rising concern, particularly\
    \ in the Mediterranean countries or southern\nAsian countries such as India. Among\
    \ the countries in Europe, the Mediterranean countries are the\nmost vulnerable\
    \ to drought [1]. A connection has been established between climate policies and\
    \ water\nmanagement. Water management can be aﬀected by diﬀerent variables such\
    \ as the water demand\nfrom the diﬀerent sectors or the consequences of some degrees\
    \ of warming on hydrological resources.\nClimate change and its eﬀects are a recurrent\
    \ topic in research papers regarding water resources and\nagriculture. The possible\
    \ consequences of global warming have led to the consideration of creating\nwater\
    \ adaptation measures to ensure the availability of water for food production\
    \ and people and\nto maintain ecosystems [2]. Furthermore, the safety of the water\
    \ to be consumed by humans and\nto be returned to the environment must be ensured.\
    \ The possible risks of climate change are an\nincrease in water shortage, the\
    \ reduction of water quality, the increase in water and soil salinity,\nthe biodiversity\
    \ loss, the increase in irrigation requirements or the possible cost of emergency\
    \ and\nremediation actions. These reasons have led to an increase in the number\
    \ of studies focused on\nreducing water usage in irrigation processes. Some of\
    \ these studies suggest the implementation of\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042; doi:10.3390/s20041042\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n2 of 48\nsocial, economic\
    \ and climate change policies, as well as the implementation of technological\
    \ innovations\nto improve water management.\nThe agricultural sector is one of\
    \ the most important economic resources in these countries\nadding to the importance\
    \ of managing well the available water resources to ensure the continuing\nof\
    \ this economical sector. In India, 10% of the area of the country is covered\
    \ by rice plantations [3].\nFurthermore, 20% of the Indian population is below\
    \ poverty levels and 15% is food insecure. Therefore,\nlow food production aﬀects\
    \ both the population and the economy. In 2002, the monsoon season\nproduced the\
    \ least amount of precipitation in the last 130 years. That resulted in a loss\
    \ of rice production\ndue to the lack of fresh water. To determine the drought\
    \ caused by anomalies in surface water, the\nStandardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration\
    \ Index (SPEI) was utilized. These indexes and the\ninformation gathered from\
    \ sensors that monitor the environment, the soil and the water can be utilized\n\
    to determine the current state of the water and the possibility of covering all\
    \ the freshwater needs.\nCountries with higher funds are already implementing\
    \ systems for water management and water\nreuse aiming to optimize water usage\
    \ and reduce the environmental impact caused by utilizing great\namounts of water.\
    \ However, some countries may ﬁnd these solutions to be costly.\nCommercial sensors\
    \ for systems aimed for agriculture and its irrigation are very expensive,\nmaking\
    \ it impossible for smaller farmers to implement this type of system on their\
    \ farms. However,\nmanufacturers are currently oﬀering low-cost sensors that can\
    \ be connected to nodes to implement\nlow-cost systems for irrigation management\
    \ and agriculture monitoring. Furthermore, due to the\ninterest in low-cost sensors\
    \ for monitoring agriculture and water, new low-cost sensors are being\nproposed\
    \ in researches such as a leaf water stress monitoring sensor [4], a multi-level\
    \ soil moisture\nsensor comprised of copper rings placed along a PVC pipe [5],\
    \ a water salinity monitoring sensor\nmade with copper coils [6] or a water turbidity\
    \ sensor made with colored and infrared led emitters\nand receptors [7].\nDue\
    \ to the recent advances in sensors for the implementation of irrigation systems\
    \ for agriculture\nand the evolution of WSN and IoT technologies that can be applied\
    \ in the development of these\nsystems, we present a survey aimed at summarizing\
    \ the current state of the art regarding smart\nirrigation systems. In this survey,\
    \ we are going to provide an overview of the state of the research\nregarding\
    \ irrigation systems. We will determine the parameters that are monitored in irrigation\n\
    systems regarding water quantity and quality, soil characteristics, weather conditions,\
    \ and fertilizer\nusage. We will provide an overview of the most utilized nodes\
    \ and wireless technologies employed to\nimplement WSN and IoT based smart irrigation\
    \ systems. Lastly, we will discuss the challenges and the\nbest practices for\
    \ the implementation of sensor-based irrigation systems.\nOther authors have performed\
    \ studies with a focus on irrigation systems, water management\nor precision agriculture\
    \ systems. However, the other available surveys on smart irrigation systems\n\
    analyzed quite a few papers [8–12] and therefore do not provide an in-depth analysis\
    \ of the state\nof the art regarding irrigation systems. Others are focused on\
    \ speciﬁc aspects regarding irrigation\nsuch as software for irrigation systems\
    \ [13], pivot-center speciﬁc irrigation systems [14] or irrigation\nsystems for\
    \ greenhouses [15]. Lastly, there are surveys that focus on precision agriculture\
    \ [16–21], crop\nmonitoring [22] and the agro-industrial and environmental ﬁelds\
    \ of agriculture [23] that comment on\nirrigation agriculture. In this survey,\
    \ we provide an overview of the current advances in irrigation\nsystems and the\
    \ utilized sensors and actuators. Furthermore, we provide discuss the most utilized\n\
    nodes and the wireless technologies employed for the communication and transmission\
    \ of the data\ngathered by the sensors. This way, with this work we address the\
    \ current gap in literature with a\nsurvey that provides an overview of IoT-based\
    \ smart irrigation systems.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section\
    \ 2 presents the methodology employed to\nperform the survey. Section 3 presents\
    \ the water management techniques utilized in current studies, the\nparameters\
    \ that are utilized to determine the irrigation schedule and the related actuators.\
    \ The sensors\nand parameters considered for the soil monitoring aspects of the\
    \ evaluated smart irrigation systems\nare depicted in Section 4. The most monitored\
    \ weather parameters and the sensors that monitor\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n3 of\
    \ 48\nthem are presented in Section 5. Section 6 comments on the most utilized\
    \ nodes for IoT and WSN\nirrigation systems and the most popular wireless communication\
    \ technologies and cloud platforms.\nThe discussion of the current trends regarding\
    \ IoT crop irrigation systems is presented in Section 7.\nLastly, the conclusion\
    \ and future work are presented in Section 8.\n2. Materials and Methods\nIn this\
    \ section, the process followed to elaborate this paper is presented. To perform\
    \ this study,\nthe following research questions were considered: What are the\
    \ current IoT solutions for smart\nirrigation for agriculture? What sensors, actuators,\
    \ nodes, and wireless technologies are being utilized\nto develop IoT irrigation\
    \ systems? Search engines and digital libraries were utilized by the authors to\n\
    search manually for papers suitable for this survey. A total of 283 papers were\
    \ obtained from Google\nScholar [24], IEEE explore [25], Scopus [26] and the digital\
    \ library of Sensors [27]. The keywords\nemployed to obtain the total number of\
    \ papers to be analyzed were IoT irrigation, IoT irrigation system,\nand smart\
    \ irrigation. Furthermore, all papers were checked to ensure they included the\
    \ keywords\nirrigation or water and IoT or smart in their content.\nIn order to\
    \ discern which papers to use, only papers written in English were considered.\n\
    Furthermore, to observe the recent evolution in this ﬁeld, the selected papers\
    \ were published from\nthe years 2014 to 2019 (both years inclusive). Finally,\
    \ a total of 178 papers were utilized to compile\nthis review.\nAfter the selection\
    \ process, all papers were classiﬁed manually into IoT irrigation systems and\n\
    architecture, protocol and sensor proposals that were not used to create the ﬁgures\
    \ in this paper but\ndiscussed relevant information. The papers from the ﬁrst\
    \ group (160) were then analyzed to determine\nthe sensors and actuators that\
    \ were employed to develop the IoT irrigation system, the parameters\nthat were\
    \ monitored, the type of irrigation and agriculture, the type of node, the type\
    \ of wireless\ntechnology and data visualization technique that was utilized to\
    \ access the data and to manually\nchoose the actions of the irrigation system.\
    \ All the collected data has been then classiﬁed into diﬀerent\nsections and converted\
    \ into graphs and tables to provide a complete overview of the actual state of\
    \ the\nart regarding IoT irrigation systems.\nThe distribution of the papers regarding\
    \ the country of the ﬁrst author is presented in Figure 1.\nAs it can be seen,\
    \ the countries that investigate IoT systems for irrigation are countries where\
    \ agriculture\nis a major economic source. India is the country with the highest\
    \ number of papers with a total of\n92 papers, 57.5% of the total. China and Spain\
    \ are tied with seven papers each. Costa Rica, Ecuador,\nIndonesia Thailand, and\
    \ the USA have between three and six papers. The rest of the countries that\n\
    have investigated IoT systems for irrigation have one or two papers.\nIt is remarkable\
    \ that only one out of the ﬁve countries with the highest agricultural land area\n\
    (China, USA, Australia, Brazil, and Kazakhstan) is included in the top ﬁve countries\
    \ of our survey\nin terms of water management. India, which is the country with\
    \ the highest production of papers\nthat presents IoT systems for water management\
    \ is the 7th country in terms of agricultural land area.\nWith regard to the top\
    \ six countries, in terms of published papers with irrigation systems, three of\n\
    them (India, China, and Spain) have regions with high and moderate water scarcity\
    \ problems. Again,\nthere are some countries with regions aﬀected by water scarcity\
    \ that use irrigation systems in their\nagriculture and have published fewer papers\
    \ on irrigation systems like the USA. Nonetheless, it does\nnot mean that in these\
    \ countries no eﬀorts are done in order to reduce water use in agriculture. It\
    \ is\npossible that in these countries the major eﬀorts are done by enterprises\
    \ and their ﬁndings are directly\npatented and distributed in the marked. Most\
    \ of the papers are published by authors who come from\ndeveloping countries.\n\
    As per the number of papers per year of publication, see Figure 2, the interest\
    \ in this topic has\nbeen increasing over the years. The lower amount of papers\
    \ for 2019 is due to the year not being\nﬁnished when the selection process of\
    \ the papers was completed. Thus, not all the papers performed\nin 2019 had been\
    \ published.\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n4 of 48\n \nThe distribution of the papers\
    \ regarding the country of the first author is presented in Figure 1. \nAs it\
    \ can be seen, the countries that investigate IoT systems for irrigation are countries\
    \ where \nagriculture is a major economic source. India is the country with the\
    \ highest number of papers with \na total of 92 papers, 57.5% of the total. China\

    countries that have investigated IoT systems for irrigation have one or two papers.\

    \ irrigation per country.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n4 of 48 \nIt is remarkable that\
    \ only one out of the five countries with the highest agricultural land area \n\
    (China, USA, Australia, Brazil, and Kazakhstan) is included in the top five countries\
    \ of our survey in \nterms of water management. India, which is the country with\
    \ the highest production of papers that \npresents IoT systems for water management\
    \ is the 7th country in terms of agricultural land area. With \nregard to the\
    \ top six countries, in terms of published papers with irrigation systems, three\
    \ of them \n(India, China, and Spain) have regions with high and moderate water\
    \ scarcity problems. Again, there \nare some countries with regions affected by\
    \ water scarcity that use irrigation systems in their \nagriculture and have published\
    \ fewer papers on irrigation systems like the USA. Nonetheless, it does \nnot\
    \ mean that in these countries no efforts are done in order to reduce water use\
    \ in agriculture. It is \npossible that in these countries the major efforts are\
    \ done by enterprises and their findings are directly \npatented and distributed\
    \ in the marked. Most of the papers are published by authors who come from \n\
    developing countries.  \nAs per the number of papers per year of publication,\
    \ see Figure 2, the interest in this topic has \nbeen increasing over the years.\
    \ The lower amount of papers for 2019 is due to the year not being \nfinished\
    \ when the selection process of the papers was completed. Thus, not all the papers\
    \ performed \nin 2019 had been published. \n \nFigure 2. Number of published papers\
    \ presenting IoT systems for irrigation per year. \n3. Water Management \nIn this\
    \ section, we present the information and analysis of papers that present different\
    \ \ntechniques for water management in the irrigation process. For this analysis,\
    \ we consider the papers \nthat include any sort of water pumping actuator as\
    \ an irrigation system. From a total of 178 evaluated \npapers, 107 of them present\
    \ an actuator for irrigation. After analyzing the 107 papers we discard the \n\
    ones that just offer partial information, a total of 89 papers are included in\
    \ this section.  \nIn the agriculture activities that use water inputs, also known\
    \ as irrigated agriculture, there are \ndifferent manners to distribute the water.\
    \ The different options present different efficiency and, in \nsome cases, a specific\
    \ manner should be used for a specific crop. The specific manners to irrigate\
    \ have \na great variety but we can divide them into the following categories:\
    \ Attending to the way of water \nis distributed we can consider: (i) flood irrigation,\
    \ (ii) spray irrigation, (iii) drip irrigation, and (iv) \nnebulizer irrigation.\
    \ Regarding the existence of sensing systems we can have: (i) irrigation without\
    \ \nany consideration, when the amount of water is not calculated or estimated,\
    \ (ii) scheduled irrigation, \nwhen the water is supplied according to the estimated\
    \ needs in a period of year, (iii) Ad hoc irrigation, \nwhen the amount of water\
    \ is calculated based on the sensors measurements. The vast majority of the \n\
    papers included in this section propose to use pumps and valves to distribute\
    \ the water in \nconjunction with sensors to measure environmental parameters\
    \ in order to calculate the water needs. \nFrom the 89 evaluated papers in this\
    \ section, 83 include clear information of the proposed irrigation \nsystem, the\
    \ other six only mention that they include actuators for irrigation, see Figure\
    \ 3. Those 83 \ninclude different levels of detail, there are 49 papers that only\
    \ indicate that there are motor/pumps in \nFigure 2. Number of published papers\
    \ presenting IoT systems for irrigation per year.\n3. Water Management\nIn this\
    \ section, we present the information and analysis of papers that present diﬀerent\
    \ techniques\nfor water management in the irrigation process. For this analysis,\
    \ we consider the papers that include\nany sort of water pumping actuator as an\
    \ irrigation system. From a total of 178 evaluated papers,\n107 of them present\

    \ section.\nIn the agriculture activities that use water inputs, also known as\
    \ irrigated agriculture, there\nare diﬀerent manners to distribute the water.\
    \ The diﬀerent options present diﬀerent eﬃciency and,\nin some cases, a speciﬁc\
    \ manner should be used for a speciﬁc crop. The speciﬁc manners to irrigate\n\
    have a great variety but we can divide them into the following categories: Attending\
    \ to the way\nof water is distributed we can consider: (i) ﬂood irrigation, (ii)\
    \ spray irrigation, (iii) drip irrigation,\nand (iv) nebulizer irrigation. Regarding\
    \ the existence of sensing systems we can have: (i) irrigation\nwithout any consideration,\
    \ when the amount of water is not calculated or estimated, (ii) scheduled\nirrigation,\
    \ when the water is supplied according to the estimated needs in a period of year,\
    \ (iii) Ad\nhoc irrigation, when the amount of water is calculated based on the\
    \ sensors measurements. The vast\nmajority of the papers included in this section\
    \ propose to use pumps and valves to distribute the water\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n\

    \ to calculate the water needs.\nFrom the 89 evaluated papers in this section,\
    \ 83 include clear information of the proposed irrigation\nsystem, the other six\
    \ only mention that they include actuators for irrigation, see Figure 3. Those\
    \ 83\ninclude diﬀerent levels of detail, there are 49 papers that only indicate\
    \ that there are motor/pumps in\ntheir system (40 paper) or valves (nine papers)\
    \ without more detail. From those papers which oﬀer more\ndetails, 19 of them\
    \ include sprinklers (the most used system) [28–46], eight use drip irrigation\
    \ [4,47–54],\ntwo propose the utilization of sprayers [4,55], and the rest use\
    \ a very speciﬁc irrigation systems\n(robots [56], pivot [14], rain gun [57] or\
    \ it can be applied to multiple systems [58]). In conjunction with\nthe principal\
    \ irrigation system, three papers propose the use of a fogging system [41,43,51]\
    \ and two\npapers propose the use of fertigation in their systems [42,52].\nSensors\

    \ \nMost of the included papers in this section do not describe the target agriculture\
    \ system of their \nproposal. Nevertheless, there are 38 papers that include this\

    \ most used sensor in the systems is the soil moisture sensor, it is used in 76\n\
    papers (more details in Section 4). First, we will analyze the data from soil\
    \ and plant sensors. The soil\ntemperature is much less considered in these systems,\
    \ it is only measured in seven proposals. Attending\nto the soil characteristics,\
    \ in one proposal the authors use a sensor that monitored the nutrients of the\n\
    soil [80]. There are 14 proposals of IoT for irrigation management that include\
    \ a pH sensor. However,\nnot all of them specify if the pH sensors are for the\
    \ soil or for the water [31,42,49,54,68,70,74,75,81,82],\nonly four of them indicate\
    \ this (three for soil [66,67,72] and one for water [69]). Only four papers\n\
    consider plant monitoring, in two papers the measured parameter is the plant height\
    \ [64,83], using an\nultrasound sensor. In the other two cases, the leaf wetness\
    \ was considered in their system [46,84,85].\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n7 of 48\n\

    \ consider plant monitoring, in two papers the measured parameter \nis the plant\
    \ height [64,83], using an ultrasound sensor. In the other two cases, the leaf\

    \ [84] used a sensor based on optical \nsignals while [46] utilized a commercial\
    \ FC-37 sensor (Lydia Vogler, Peißenberg, Germany).  \nNow, the data from the\
    \ water sensor are presented. In this case, we will consider for the \ncommentaries\
    \ not only the data of the graphic (proposals with irrigation system) but also\
    \ the \ninformation of the paper which measures the water quality, having or not\
    \ the actuators for the \nirrigation system. The water level in the tanks is measured\
    \ in 17 [32,36,51,57,58,61,62,64,69,85–92] out \nof 88 papers that have a pumping\
    \ system. There are different methods to monitor the water level in \nthe tanks\
    \ and the most used is the one based on ultrasound [32,69,89], the resistive methodology\
    \ is \nused in one case [36], the rest of cases do not offer information of how\
    \ the data is measured. In the \ncase of sensors based on ultrasound methods,\
    \ the most utilized sensor is the HC-SR04 (Shenzhenshi \nguoyun dianzishangwu\
    \ youxiangongsi , Shenzhen, China, used in [69]). In addition, there are six \n\
    papers that do not include an actuator for the irrigation system even when they\
    \ have water level \nsensors [60,93–97]. There are nine papers where sensors for\
    \ monitoring water flow are utilized \n[14,31,42,45,50,64,75,76,82]. The sensors\
    \ used are only described in two cases, the commercial Gems \nFT110 G3/8 sensor\
    \ (Gems Sensors and Controls, Mumbai, India) is used in [75] and the YF-S402 \n\
    (Wuhan yingying yingying xinxi jishu youxian gongsi , Wuhan, China) in the proposal\
    \ presented in \n[76]. Both sensors are based on a Hall effect turbine. They have\
    \ different prices and similar \noperational ranges. The Gems FT110 G3/8 can measure\
    \ flows between 0.5 to 5 L/min. The other \nsensor, the YF-S402, is capable of\
    \ measuring flows between 0.3 to 6 L/min. Moreover, water flow \nsensors are used\
    \ in three other proposals that do not include actuators for irrigation systems\
    \ [5,98,99]. \nRegarding water quality, the water conductivity is monitored in\
    \ four proposals [51,68,69,75]. Only in \none case [75], the authors indicate\
    \ the used sensor. They use commercial sensors for monitoring pH \nand conductivity\
    \ from B&C Electronics (Carnate , Italy). \n  \nFigure 7. Monitored parameters\

    \ \nAdditionally, there are two papers without an actuator for irrigation systems\

    \ In this case, we will consider for the\ncommentaries not only the data of the\
    \ graphic (proposals with irrigation system) but also the\ninformation of the\
    \ paper which measures the water quality, having or not the actuators for the\
    \ irrigation\nsystem. The water level in the tanks is measured in 17 [32,36,51,57,58,61,62,64,69,85–92]\
    \ out of 88 papers\nthat have a pumping system. There are diﬀerent methods to\

    \ ultrasound [32,69,89], the resistive methodology is used in\none case [36],\
    \ the rest of cases do not oﬀer information of how the data is measured. In the\
    \ case of\nsensors based on ultrasound methods, the most utilized sensor is the\
    \ HC-SR04 (Shenzhenshi guoyun\ndianzishangwu youxiangongsi, Shenzhen, China, used\
    \ in [69]). In addition, there are six papers that\ndo not include an actuator\
    \ for the irrigation system even when they have water level sensors [60,93–97].\n\
    There are nine papers where sensors for monitoring water ﬂow are utilized [14,31,42,45,50,64,75,76,82].\n\
    The sensors used are only described in two cases, the commercial Gems FT110 G3/8\
    \ sensor (Gems\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n8 of 48\nSensors and Controls, Mumbai,\
    \ India) is used in [75] and the YF-S402 (Wuhan yingying yingying xinxi\njishu\
    \ youxian gongsi, Wuhan, China) in the proposal presented in [76]. Both sensors\
    \ are based on a\nHall eﬀect turbine. They have diﬀerent prices and similar operational\
    \ ranges. The Gems FT110 G3/8\ncan measure ﬂows between 0.5 to 5 L/min. The other\
    \ sensor, the YF-S402, is capable of measuring\nﬂows between 0.3 to 6 L/min. Moreover,\
    \ water ﬂow sensors are used in three other proposals that do\nnot include actuators\
    \ for irrigation systems [5,98,99]. Regarding water quality, the water conductivity\n\
    is monitored in four proposals [51,68,69,75]. Only in one case [75], the authors\
    \ indicate the used\nsensor. They use commercial sensors for monitoring pH and\
    \ conductivity from B&C Electronics\n(Carnate, Italy).\nAdditionally, there are\
    \ two papers without an actuator for irrigation systems that include in their\n\
    proposals a sensor for conductivity [98,100]. Nevertheless, no data regarding\
    \ the equipment used are\ngiven. Regarding the pH of water, it is monitored in\
    \ another three papers (apart from [69]) [99,101,102].\nIn one case [99], the\
    \ authors specify the used sensor, the Lutron Pe-03 (Lutron, Taipei, Taiwan).\n\
    The temperature of the water is measured in two proposals [51,69]. Only in one\
    \ case [69] did the\nauthors specify that the used sensor is the DS18B20 (Adafruit\
    \ Industries, New York, NY, USA). No other\nproposals evaluated in this survey\
    \ (having or not irrigation system) presented the use of temperature\nsensors\
    \ for the water.\nOn the other hand, with regard to the proposals that monitored\
    \ the atmospheric parameter,\nthe data is presented in Figure 8. Next, we are\
    \ presenting the importance of these sensors for irrigation\nsystems. No details\
    \ of which sensors are used in which papers are given in this section. This information\n\
    will be further discussed in Section 5. The air temperature is the most measured\
    \ parameter, it is\nmonitored in 58 papers. A total of 51 proposals include a\
    \ humidity sensor. Other parameters are less\nmeasured such as the rain, which\
    \ is measured in eight out of 89 papers that proposed an irrigation\nsystem, or\
    \ the wind, measured in only one paper. Meanwhile, there are 15 proposals that\
    \ consider the\nweather forecast. From those 15 proposals, 10 of them use the\
    \ data from the forecast in conjunction\nwith the data gathered by sensors and\
    \ ﬁve proposals use the weather forecast as the sole information\nfor weather\
    \ data/atmospheric parameters.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n8 of 48 \n[99,101,102].\
    \ In one case [99], the authors specify the used sensor, the Lutron Pe-03 (Lutron,\
    \ Taipei, \nTaiwan). The temperature of the water is measured in two proposals\
    \ [51,69]. Only in one case [69] \ndid the authors specify that the used sensor\
    \ is the DS18B20 (Adafruit Industries, New York, New \nYork, USA). No other proposals\

    \ of temperature sensors for the water.  \nOn the other hand, with regard to the\
    \ proposals that monitored the atmospheric parameter, the \ndata is presented\

    \ only the irrigation system as an actuator.\nThere are seven papers (8% of cases)\

    \ The use of three actuators is presented in seven papers, the same percentage\

    \ use four actuators [39,72], and in one case the use of ﬁve\nactuators is presented\
    \ [67].\nNext, we present in Figure 10 the description of the selected actuators.\
    \ Since we are considering only\nthe papers that include an irrigation system,\
    \ the most used actuator in the diﬀerent irrigation systems.\nTherefore, we do\
    \ not include the use of irrigation actuators in Figure 10. The most utilized\
    \ actuator is\nthe sound emitter, used in seven cases [32,49,58,59,61,66,103].\
    \ It is generally used as an alarm for the\nfarmers or as a dissuasive measure\
    \ to prevent the entry of animals into the farming lands. In second\nposition,\
    \ we found the use of artiﬁcial light systems. They are used in six cases [36,38,50,71,72,75].\n\
    The use of artiﬁcial light is mainly related to the generation of artiﬁcial photo-\
    \ periods to increase\nproductivity, but they can also be used for operational\
    \ purposes. Fans are included in ﬁve proposals\nand their use is related to modifying\
    \ the atmospheric conditions (temperature, humidity or even the\nbalance between\
    \ CO2/O2). The proposals that include the use of fans are [39,65,68,72,75]. The\
    \ use\nof ultrasonic sound emitter is found in four papers [32,51,64,65]. The\
    \ least utilized actuators in IoT\nirrigation systems are scarecrows [58,65,66],\

    \ birds and other types of animals to protect the crops, and heaters [28,65],\

    \ and in one case the use of \nfive actuators is presented [67].  \nNext, we present\
    \ in Figure 10 the description of the selected actuators. Since we are considering\
    \ \nonly the papers that include an irrigation system, the most used actuator\
    \ in the different irrigation \nsystems. Therefore, we do not include the use\
    \ of irrigation actuators in Figure 10. The most utilized \nactuator is the sound\
    \ emitter, used in seven cases [32,49,58,59,61,66,103]. It is generally used as\
    \ an \nalarm for the farmers or as a dissuasive measure to prevent the entry of\
    \ animals into the farming \nlands. In second position, we found the use of artificial\
    \ light systems. They are used in six cases \n[36,38,50,71,72,75]. The use of\
    \ artificial light is mainly related to the generation of artificial photo- \n\
    periods to increase productivity, but they can also be used for operational purposes.\
    \ Fans are \nincluded in five proposals and their use is related to modifying\
    \ the atmospheric conditions \n(temperature, humidity or even the balance between\
    \ CO2/O2). The proposals that include the use of \nfans are [39,65,68,72,75].\
    \ The use of ultrasonic sound emitter is found in four papers [32,51,64,65]. The\

    \ in diﬀerent papers included in this\nsurvey, there is an important parameter\
    \ that is crucial for irrigation scheduling. This parameter\nindicates the water\
    \ loss due to the evaporation from the soil and transpiration through the stomata\
    \ of\nplants; it is known as evapotranspiration (ET). Several authors measured\
    \ both terms—evaporation and\ntranspiration—separately, using diﬀerent sensors\
    \ to obtain the ET data [104]. It also can be estimated\naccording to the vegetation\
    \ and the climatic data by several mathematic models [105]. Some web-based\napplications\
    \ can estimate the potential ET given a location. For ET monitoring, remote sensing\
    \ is the\nbest option as many papers point out [106–108]. Among the possibilities\
    \ for ET monitoring with sensors,\nthe integration of soil moisture changes can\
    \ oﬀer evaporation data. Nonetheless, the measurement of\ntranspiration is more\
    \ complex; it can be estimated with the data of sensors that measure radiation,\n\
    leaf area index, and vapor pressure deﬁcit [109]. Due to the complexity of its\
    \ measurement, it is not\nincluded as a monitored variable in most of the papers\

    Most of those proposals use similar sensors based on the conductivity between\
    \ two electrodes.\nDiﬀerent models of the aforementioned sensor have been used\
    \ in the proposals (see Figure 13). The most\nused sensor, based on conductivity,\
    \ is the YL69 (SparkFun Electronics, Niwot, CO, USA). It has been\nused in nine\
    \ proposals [44,56,71,87,95,115–118]. This sensor is characterized by a low price\
    \ and it is\ncreated speciﬁcally to operate with Arduino (and similar nodes).\
    \ The output voltage goes from 3.3\nto 5 V and the output values are related to\
    \ soil moisture (0 to 300 for dry soil, 300 to 700 humid soil).\nNevertheless,\
    \ it is not possible to have a measure that indicates exactly the value of moisture\
    \ without\nperforming new tests and calibration of the sensor. The same range\
    \ of measure is found in the other\nused sensor based on the same principle, the\
    \ FC-28 (Uruktech, Baghdad, Iraq, used in [34,72,76]) and\nthe SEN0114 (DFRobot,\
    \ Shanghai, China, used in [46]). The S-XNQ-04 sensor (XNQ Electric Company\n\
    Store, Beijing, China), used in [55] has a similar operation principle. However,\
    \ it is composed of three\nelectrodes. In this case, the sensor output voltage\
    \ goes from 0 to 2 V and the sensor is capable of\nmeasuring the soil moisture\
    \ giving as a response the relative saturation moisture content expressed\nin\
    \ percentage (%). This sensor has an accuracy of 3% and it can measure from 0\
    \ to 100% of relative\nsaturation. It can operate from −40 to 85 ◦C.\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, x \n12 of 48 \nsensors goes from −40 °C to 85 °C and its accuracy\

    \ datasheet.  \n \nFigure 13. Number of papers that used different models of soil\
    \ moisture sensors. \nIn terms of sensors for soil nutrients, three papers include\
    \ in their proposals sensors for \nmonitoring this variable [5,80,102]; nonetheless,\

    \ time, the VH400 (Vegetronix,\nInc., Riverton, UT, USA), is utilized in [37,40,89,96,119,120].\
    \ These sensors can be used from 40 ◦C to\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n12 of 48\n\
    85 ◦C, but the accuracy and operational range of the sensor probe are not indicated\
    \ in its datasheet.\nThe operational principle of this sensor is based on the\
    \ measurement of the dielectric constant of the\nsoil using transmission line\
    \ techniques to measure the moisture in any type of soil notwithstanding\nsoil\
    \ salinity. The output voltage of this sensor goes from 0 to 3 V. This output\
    \ voltage is related to\nthe volumetric water content in the soil. The sensor\
    \ does not oﬀer a linear relationship between the\noutput voltage and the volumetric\
    \ water content, but the sensor can measure from 0 to up to 60% of\nvolumetric\
    \ water content in the soil. This sensor has a relatively low price and can be\
    \ implemented in\nArduino systems (and similar).\nA sensor with completely different\
    \ operational principles, the 200SS (HYPERION TECHNOLOGIES\nB.V., Delft, The Netherlands),\
    \ is used in two proposals [14,121].\nIt is a solid-state electrical\nresistance\
    \ sensing device that is used to measure soil water tension.\nThe 200SS has a\
    \ pair of\nhighly corrosion-resistant electrodes, as a resistive device, the resistance\
    \ of the sensor changes with the\nsoil moisture. The electrodes are embedded within\
    \ a granular matrix. The output values of the sensor\ngo from 0 to 199 centibars.\
    \ The higher the value of centibars the lower the water availability for the\n\
    plants. The system presented in [54] uses an SM300 sensor. This device is able\
    \ to measure two soil\nparameters (moisture and temperature). The SM300 measures\
    \ the soil moisture and temperature based\non the generation and propagation of\
    \ the electromagnetic ﬁeld into the soil. The sensors measure\nthe soil moisture\
    \ as the volumetric water content, the operating range goes from 0 to 100% and\
    \ the\naccuracy is ±2.5%. This sensor is manufactured by Delta-T Devices Ltd.\
    \ (Cambridge, UK). This sensor\nis not speciﬁcally created to be integrated in\
    \ an Arduino measuring system, even though it can be\nadapted since the output\
    \ voltage goes from 0 to 1 V.\nFinally, the system detailed in [122] used the\
    \ HA2002 sensor, but no information is available\non the internet about this sensor\
    \ in terms of operational principle nor range of measuring. The sole\ninformation\
    \ that was found was that the sensor is an HA2001 sensor manufactured by Handan\
    \ Dingrui\nElectronics Co., Ltd. (Handan, China).\nRegarding the sensors used\
    \ for monitoring the soil temperature, which are mentioned in [37,40,\n45,54,63,67,94,122,123],\
    \ the diﬀerent sensors are detailed in this paragraph. There are ﬁve papers that\n\
    do not specify the sensors used [45,63,67,94,123]. The other four proposals indicate\
    \ in the paper the\nsensors selected. Although in one paper no information could\
    \ be found about the sensor utilized [122],\nthe authors indicate that their system\
    \ includes the HA2001 sensor.\nIn other cases, the information of the selected\
    \ sensors is detailed. The proposal presented in [54]\nused an LM35 sensor. This\
    \ device is able to measure temperature. The operating range is −40 to\n+125 ◦C\
    \ and the accuracy is ±0.5 ◦C. The sensors oﬀer an analogic signal and it is manufactured\
    \ by\nTexas Instruments (Dallas, TX, USA). The proposals presented in [37,40]\
    \ selected the THERM200\n(Vegetronix, Inc., Riverton, UT, USA) to measure the\
    \ temperature. The operational range of these\nsensors goes from −40 ◦C to 85\
    \ ◦C and its accuracy is ±0.5 ◦C. The operation principle of this sensor is\n\
    not speciﬁed in the datasheet.\nIn terms of sensors for soil nutrients, three\
    \ papers include in their proposals sensors for monitoring\nthis variable [5,80,102];\
    \ nonetheless, not all of them indicate the used sensor. The only paper that\n\
    clearly indicates the utilized sensor is the proposal presented in [80] includes\
    \ an 1185 SunRom\ncolor sensor (Sunrom Electronics, Ahmedabad, India). This sensor\
    \ is based on RGB color detection,\nin [80] authors relate the color of the soil\
    \ with the nutrients. The pH of the soil is measured in four\nproposals [66,67,72,110].\
    \ However, none of these proposals indicates the selected device or equipment\n\
    in the paper.\n5. Weather Monitoring\nAn overview of the weather parameters monitored\
    \ in IoT irrigation monitoring systems and the\nmost utilized sensors to monitor\
    \ these parameters is provided in this section. The weather conditions\nare a\
    \ key factor both in irrigation needs and in the performance of crops. Figure\
    \ 14 shows the most\nmonitored weather parameters in the currently available smart\
    \ irrigation proposals. Temperature\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n13 of 48\nand humidity\
    \ aﬀect the evapotranspiration of the water in the soil. Air temperature is deﬁned\
    \ as the\nthermic level of the atmosphere and is usually measured in Celsius,\
    \ Fahrenheit or Kelvin degrees.\nIt is the most monitored weather parameter with\
    \ one hundred papers monitoring it. Humidity is the\npresence of water vapor in\
    \ the air. The amount of water vapor in the air is expressed in percentage (%).\n\
    It is the second most monitored weather parameter with 86 papers. Furthermore,\
    \ luminosity is paired\nwith temperature as direct radiation from the Sun raises\
    \ the temperature and leads to more water loss in\nthe soil. It is deﬁned as the\
    \ intensity or brightness of the light. It is measured in Lux. It is the third\
    \ most\nmonitored parameter with 28 papers. The amount of precipitation determines\
    \ whether the irrigation\nis needed or not and the amount of water to be employed\
    \ in the case of irrigation being necessary.\nIt considers any form of hydrometeor\
    \ that falls from the atmosphere and reaches the earth’s surface.\nFurthermore,\
    \ it includes rain and snow. A total of 14 papers considered precipitation monitoring.\n\
    Although temperature, relative humidity, luminosity, and precipitations are the\
    \ most important factors\nregarding IoT irrigation systems for agriculture, many\
    \ systems propose the monitoring of other\nenvironmental parameters. Table 1 details\

    \ industry. The SEN-08942 is a meteorology station manufactured\nby Sparkfun (SparkFun\
    \ Electronics, Niwot, CO, USA). It allows monitoring both wind speed and\ndirection\
    \ and it incorporates a pluviometer [46]. The PRD180 is comprised of a rain detecting\
    \ board\nwith two separate PCB tracks and a control module that provides a digital\
    \ and an analog output [48].\nThe operating voltage is from 3.3 V to 5 V. It is\
    \ manufactured by Elecmake (India). Like the PRD180, the\nYL83 (Vaisala, Vantaa,\
    \ Finland) is comprised of a series of conductive strands printed onto a Bakelite\n\
    plaque [76]. The water creates a short-circuit oﬀering a low resistance between\
    \ the lines connected to\nthe ground and the lines connected to the positive polarity.\n\
    The type of agriculture most concerned with air and wind as a parameter concerning\
    \ weather\nis greenhouse agriculture. For example, one of the aims of [68] is\
    \ the sanitation of the air of the\ngreenhouse from pathogens and chemical contaminants.\
    \ This is then closely related to the activation\nof the actuators necessary to\
    \ the regulation of the quality of the air. The contaminants that can aﬀect\n\
    the quality of the air are CO, CO2, O3, NOx, PM2.5, and PM10, among others [64].\
    \ In the context\nof agriculture, air contaminants are monitored with the use\
    \ of sensors that can be low-cost sensors\nsuch as the MQ135 (SHENZHEN INVENTOR\
    \ ELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGYCO., LTD., Shenzhen,\nChina), MQ131, MQ2 or MQ9 sensors\
    \ or commercial sensors that can be found in professional weather\nstations. The\
    \ MQ135 [64,143], used for benzene, alcohol, smoke, NH3, NOx and CO2 monitoring,\
    \ and\nthe MQ2 [64,95], used for gas monitoring (propane, hydrogen, and LPG),\
    \ are the most utilized low-cost\nsensors for air quality monitoring. The MQ131\
    \ is utilized for ozone, Cl2, NO2 monitoring [64] and\nthe MQ9 is utilized for\
    \ CO/combustible gas, methane, carbon monoxide and LPG monitoring [64].\nAnother\
    \ sensor that can be used to monitor CO2 is the CDM4161A (Toshniwal Sensing Device\
    \ Private\nLimited, Ajmer, India) [145].\nWind speed and direction may be of interest\
    \ to IoT irrigation systems such as for the proposal\nin [46], that utilized the\
    \ SEN-08942 sensor manufactured by Sparkfun. Barometric pressure can be of\ninterest\
    \ as well and can be measured by the BME280 sensor manufactured by Bosch [157].\n\
    Movement detection is often related to security measures or to the aim of scaring\
    \ animals to\navoid crop damage. The most utilized sensor for movement detection\
    \ is a passive infrared (PIR)\nsensor [42,95]. This sensor measures the infrared\
    \ light that radiates around the objects placed at the\nfront of the sensor. The\
    \ change in infrared radiation is converted into changes in voltage that trigger\n\
    the detection. It is often utilized for intrusion and pest detection. Ultrasonic\
    \ sensors are often utilized\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n18 of 48\nto detect movement,\
    \ such as the robot proposed in [65] that is able to perform some actions to scare\
    \ the\nanimals that may enter the ﬁelds. These sensors are comprised of a transmitter\
    \ and a receiver that\noperate at the 40 kHz frequency. Its range is from 10 cm\
    \ to 30 cm. Ultrasound at lower frequencies was\nutilized in [60] to repel the\
    \ animals. Insects may cause great damage to the crops, for that reason some\n\
    systems such as [45] include a pest warning functionality. The system in [133]\
    \ is able to even detect the\ntype of insect pests that are damaging the crops.\
    \ These features are often accompanied by a buzzer to\ngenerate an alarm when\
    \ intruders or animals are detected [61].\nDepending on the type of agriculture,\
    \ the values from the measures for each environmental\nparameter can be utilized\
    \ to determine the actions of diﬀerent types of actuators. It can be part of a\n\
    model like the one proposed in [72] where the on-agriculture stage gathers the\
    \ data on temperature,\nhumidity, light, moisture and wind speed in order to activate\
    \ or deactivate fans, artiﬁcial light, a cooler\nand water pumps. Many IoT irrigation\
    \ systems have both a manual and an automatic mode to control\nirrigation. In\
    \ [64], the amount of water released by the water pumps or the duration of the\
    \ irrigation\ncan be selected in the manual mode. For the automatic mode, a preset\
    \ value is utilized at the beginning.\nThen, the data is analyzed to determine\
    \ the personalized settings. The most utilized actuators to\nmodify the conditions\
    \ of the climate that aﬀects the crops or to protect the crops from animals and\n\
    intruders are presented in Figure 20.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n18 of 48 \n \nFigure\

    \ two types depending on the purpose of\nthe IoT devices. On the one hand, we\
    \ can distinguish the devices that function as nodes that transmit\nsmall amounts\
    \ of data at short distances and have low energy consumption. On the other hand,\n\
    there are devices that can transmit large amounts of data over long distances\
    \ that have high energy\nconsumption. Therefore, range, data rate, and energy\
    \ consumption are some of the most important\naspects to consider when deciding\
    \ which technology to use.\nIf the utilized standard is considered, there are\
    \ a large number of wireless standards that are used\nin the communications of\
    \ IoT devices. A general classiﬁcation can be established between devices\nthat\
    \ communicate at short or long distances. Short distance communication standards\
    \ usually reach\ndistances of up to 100 m. Long-distance communication standards\
    \ reach distances of kilometers.\nAlso, another type of classiﬁcation can be established\
    \ based on the employed communication\ntechnology. In this way, three categories\
    \ can be established. The ﬁrst category is formed by those that\nconnect utilizing\
    \ Ethernet or cable and WAN technology. The second category is comprised of those\n\
    that connect via WiFi and WAN technology. Finally, the third category is formed\
    \ by those that connect\nusing both low power WiFi and WAN technology.\nIf the\
    \ spectrum band used is considered, we can classify them into technologies that\
    \ use the\nunlicensed spectrum or the licensed spectrum. Unlicensed spectrum bands\
    \ are known as Industrial,\nScientiﬁc, and Medical (ISM radio band bands, and\
    \ are deﬁned by article 1.15 of the International\nTelecommunication Union’s (ITU)\
    \ ITU Radio Regulations (RR) [184]. The ISM bands can vary according\nto the region\
    \ and its permits. Its main advantage is its ease of installation and the main\
    \ drawbacks are\nrelated to safety deﬁciencies and possible interferences. The\
    \ licensed spectrum bands are assigned\naccording to the diﬀerent proprietary\
    \ technologies. They oﬀer greater security, greater coverage, and\nfewer interferences.\
    \ However, the cost of using a licensed band is higher.\nThe most utilized communication\
    \ technologies among the reviewed papers are presented in\nTable 6. In many of\
    \ the proposals that we have studied, the authors combine several communication\n\
    technologies instead of using one single protocol. As an example, it is very common\
    \ for authors to\nstart using either a wired or a wireless technology to connect\
    \ the sensors with the nodes, and then, use\na wireless technology to send data\
    \ from nodes to remote or cloud storage centers.\nTable 6. Most utilized communication\

    \ IoT irrigation systems for agriculture are going to\nbe presented.\n7.1. Big\
    \ Data Management and Analytics for Irrigation Optimization\nIoT systems, in general,\
    \ generate a great amount of data due to monitoring diﬀerent parameters\nin real-time,\
    \ and IoT irrigation systems generate big data as well. Therefore, it is necessary\
    \ to provide\nmechanisms to manage and analyze big data. Ahad et al. [202] comment\
    \ on the need for sustainable\nmanagement of big data to avoid overusing natural\
    \ resources. Using blockchain, powering IoT devices\nwith solar energy, selecting\
    \ useful data and discarding unnecessary and redundant data, employing\nclustering\
    \ techniques to reduce the volume of the information, implementing time-eﬃcient\
    \ algorithms\nand the utilization of sustainable resources as alternatives to\
    \ the components that are employed\nnowadays are some of the suggestions they\
    \ provide.\nAlthough the data gathered from the sensors is already a big source\
    \ of information, the analysis\nof this data is paramount to optimize the IoT\
    \ irrigation system according to the crop and the weather\nconditions. For this\
    \ purpose, Tseng et al. [203] presented a big data analysis algorithm to aid farmers\n\
    in the crop selection process. Their proposal satisﬁed the ﬁve Vs (volume, velocity,\
    \ variety, veracity,\nand value) of big data. They performed a 3D correlation\
    \ analysis that evaluated the irrigation cycle to\nidentify the irrigation practices\
    \ performed by the farmer. Then, they calculated the soil moisture content\nto\
    \ detect irrigation and to evaluate if the farmer applied pesticides or fertilizers.\
    \ This information was\ncoupled with data on the weather conditions and other\
    \ aspects of the soil to provide the farmer with\nthe cultivation risks of each\
    \ type of crop. Nonetheless, there are other technologies that are currently\n\
    being utilized to analyze the big data produced by IoT irrigation systems for\
    \ agriculture.\nArtiﬁcial intelligence (AI) is currently the type of technology\
    \ most companies are interested in for\nvarious purposes. In the case of irrigation,\
    \ the use of AI is tied to the optimization of the available\nresources such as\
    \ water, fertilizers or energy or to obtain information from the crops such as\
    \ the\npresence of diseases or the correct growth of the plants, vegetables, and\
    \ fruits. One of the techniques\nemployed to analyze the data gathered from the\
    \ sensors so as to perform decisions on the irrigation\nsystems is fuzzy logic.\
    \ Fuzzy logic has been employed to improve irrigation scheduling in greenhouses\n\
    and control the drainage implementing it on the controller of the system [100].\
    \ The fuzzy rules were\nprovided according to the water availability utilizing\
    \ the QtFuzzyLite software ((FuzzyLite Limited,\nWellington, New Zealand). Another\
    \ fuzzy logic controller is employed to determine the coverage\nerror for the\
    \ resources so as to determine if the eﬀective watering of the plants can be guaranteed\
    \ [96].\nThe system presented in [136] utilized fuzzy logic to determine the duration\
    \ of the irrigation process\nonce the soil moisture values go below the 20% threshold.\
    \ Light and temperature lead to the least\naccuracy in irrigation (40%) whereas\
    \ any combination with the soil moisture values reached an accuracy\nfrom 62 to\
    \ 81%. The authors conclude that the subsoil moisture sensor is the most important\
    \ sensor to\ndetermine irrigation. The irrigation time was predicted in [162]\
    \ as well, using the adaptive neuro fuzzy\ninterference system (ANFIS) to predict\
    \ the irrigation time. This fuzzy logic technique was implemented\nemploying the\
    \ MATLAB software. However, outdoor temperature and light are important to avoid\
    \ the\nevaporation of the water. Another irrigation system utilizes iterative\
    \ learning control (ILC) arithmetic\nto make decisions regarding the opening of\
    \ the water valves [67].\nMachine learning is another technique that is utilized\
    \ in irrigation systems to perform predictions.\nThe prediction algorithm in [120]\
    \ for soil moisture prediction obtained an accuracy of 96%. Prediction\ntechniques\
    \ can also be utilized to estimate the amount of available water for irrigation\
    \ such as the case\nof [119], where the authors employ Fisher’s LDA method for\
    \ that purpose. Water usage is predicted as\nwell in [50] employing regression\
    \ algorithms. The regression algorithms consider the temperature of\nthe environment\
    \ and the water ﬂow to produce a water consumption forecast that is then visualized\n\
    by the user through a mobile app.\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n31 of 48\nFeedforward\
    \ neural networks and the structural similarity index were employed in [204] to\n\
    develop an optimized smart irrigation system. The authors compared gradient descent\
    \ and variable\nlearning rate gradient descent optimization techniques to predict\
    \ soil moisture and they determined\nthat the latter was the best one. Furthermore,\
    \ a study on machine learning applied to agriculture so as\nto perform predictions\
    \ on irrigation was performed in [205]. Diﬀerent machine learning techniques\n\
    were applied to the data on the soil and the environment collected from jojoba\
    \ plantations. The authors\nconclude that the boosted tree classiﬁer was the best\
    \ classiﬁcation model was and the gradient boosted\nregression trees was the best\
    \ regression model. They had a 95% and 93% accuracy respectively.\nThe authors\
    \ suggest as well that diﬀerent feature-sets would be better for diﬀerent plots\
    \ as some\nconﬁgurations achieved better results for diﬀerent types of plots such\
    \ as organic ones. Furthermore, the\nmodels considerably reduced their accuracy\
    \ when deliberated soil drying was performed. Moreover,\nthe authors state that\
    \ the data on the weather and the saturation could be not considered without it\n\
    substantially aﬀecting the accuracy of the models.\n7.2. Low-Cost Autonomous Sensors\n\
    As we have seen in Section 2, the majority of the countries that dedicate more\
    \ eﬀort to researching\nIoT irrigation systems are countries where the farmers\
    \ cannot aﬀord commercial solutions. Therefore,\nmost of the solutions for irrigation\
    \ management are comprised of low-cost sensors and controllers so\nas to increase\
    \ the scope of the beneﬁts of utilizing smart irrigation systems. Apart from individual\n\
    sensors, some shields integrate several sensors and connectors for irrigation\
    \ and agriculture speciﬁc\nIoT systems such as the OpenGarden shield ((Libelium\
    \ Comunicaciones Distribuidas S.L., Zaragoza,\nSpain) [136]. It can be connected\
    \ to an Arduino UNO and it is comprised of an LDR, a DHT22 connector\n(SparkFun\
    \ Electronics, Niwot, CO, USA), a soil moisture connector, a hydroponics connector,\
    \ digital\nand analog pins, a DS18B20 connector (Adafruit Industries, New York,\
    \ NY, USA) and an antenna\nconnector. This type of solution allows the easy implementation\
    \ of low-cost smart irrigation systems.\n7.3. Sustainable Irrigation Systems\n\
    Most irrigation systems do not have access to the power grid, therefore there\
    \ is a need for\nalternative means of powering up the devices that conform the\
    \ system. Even irrigation systems with\naccess to the power grid may only receive\
    \ power during a constrained time period. In India, for\nexample, the system presented\
    \ in [29] determines when access to electricity is available to turn on\nthe irrigation\
    \ motors. This system was designed to help farmers when access to electricity\
    \ happens\nat irregular hours or even at night, when farmers may not be present\
    \ in the ﬁeld. To address the\nneed for alternative ways of powering the irrigation\
    \ systems in agricultural ﬁelds that are too far to\naccess the power grid, many\
    \ systems incorporate a solar energy functionality, making the system\nmore sustainable\
    \ [41]. Furthermore, the use of solar energy reduces the energetic costs which\
    \ is\nan advantage for irrigation systems intended for developing areas.\nConsidering\
    \ those reasons,\na total of 22 of the surveyed papers chose to utilize solar\
    \ energy to power their proposed irrigation\nsystem [4,38,41,46,50,56,63,66,69,88,90–92,96,99,101,140,145,171,178,181].\n\
    7.4. Frequency of the Data Acquisition\nThe frequency at which the parameters\
    \ are monitored may be diﬀerent for each proposal. Real-time\nmonitoring [31,71]\
    \ has been surging as the cost of the devices, whether they are processors, devices\n\
    for data storage or sensors, has experienced a considerable reduction. Some proposals\
    \ decide not to\nmonitor the parameters in real-time so as to reduce energy consumption.\
    \ Some authors have decided\nto take a measure every 10 s [58].\n7.5. New Forms\
    \ of Data Acquisition\nThe advances in technology as lead to new ways of obtaining\
    \ the data from the sensors deployed\nin the ﬁelds. One of the new ways of gathering\
    \ data from the sensor nodes is by utilizing drones [31].\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n\
    32 of 48\nDrones also allow obtaining new data that could not be obtained in other\
    \ ways such as aerial images\nof the ﬁelds.\nAnother new form of data acquisition\
    \ is the use of robots that can incorporate both sensors and\nactuators to perform\
    \ activities such as soil moisture sensing, weeding, spraying water or scaring\
    \ the\nanimals [65]. Robots can be utilized for the irrigation of precise areas\
    \ due to their ability to travel to\nthe desired location [38]. This robot is\
    \ able to measure soil moisture and include proximity sensors\nto avoid collisions.\
    \ The robot has a sprinkler system to irrigate the desired area. Furthermore,\
    \ the\nwireless robot in [66] is comprised of both environmental and soil monitoring\
    \ sensors and performs\ntasks such as water spraying, scaring animals and moving\
    \ through the ﬁeld. In order to improve the\nnavigation of the robots for irrigation,\
    \ the authors in [55] provided the robot with a coverage path\nplanning (CPP)\
    \ algorithm that has a map of the static elements and environmental data. The\
    \ robot\noperating system (ROS) was utilized to develop the control system of\
    \ the robot which is divided into\nthree layers. The ﬁrst layer reads the data\
    \ from the sensors and controls the actuators, the second\nlayer performs the\
    \ communication among the elements of the system and the third layer performs\
    \ the\ndecision making and the path planning. This robot performs irrigation as\
    \ a linear shower. Furthermore,\nthese robots can be powered by solar panels [38,66]\
    \ to provide them with more autonomy.\n7.6. Security in IoT Systems for Irrigation\n\
    Depending on the characteristics of the environment where the implementation of\
    \ the IoT system\nis carried out, securing the system may become a challenging\
    \ task as diﬀerent types of threats must be\nconsidered. On the one hand, all\
    \ the security issues of any IoT system can be applied to an IoT irrigation\n\
    system for agriculture. Therefore, current works with their focus on securing\
    \ IoT describes the security\nchallenges that IoT irrigation systems may face.\
    \ For example, organizations such as the Internet\nEngineering Task Force (IETF)\
    \ study the diﬀerent problems that aﬀect this. Furthermore, authors\nsuch as Garcia-Morchon\
    \ et al. [206] present in their work the following list of security threats and\n\
    managing risks: vulnerable software/code, privacy threats, cloning of things,\
    \ malicious substitution\nof things, eavesdropping attacks, man-in-the-middle\
    \ attack, ﬁrmware attacks, extraction of private\ninformation, routing attack,\
    \ elevation of privilege, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Regarding DoS\nattacks,\
    \ Kamienski et al. [50] highly stressed the importance of protecting the irrigation\
    \ system from\nDoS attacks or avoiding attackers from accessing the collected\
    \ data or the system with the intention of\ndamaging the crops.\nIn order to face\
    \ the above threats, it is necessary to apply the appropriate security measures,\
    \ but\nas new threats and attacks appear daily, [206] propose using methodologies\
    \ such as analyzing the\nbusiness impact of the attack, assessing the threats\
    \ considering their impact and probability, its impact\non the privacy of the\
    \ collected information and the process of reporting and mitigating incidents.\n\
    However, on the other hand, when considering just the currently available studies\
    \ on securing\nIoT irrigation systems speciﬁcally, it is possible to discern which\
    \ aspects of IoT security are prioritized\nfor this type of system.\nJimenez et\
    \ al. [207] identiﬁed the security threats speciﬁc to an intelligent wastewater\
    \ puriﬁcation\nsystem for irrigation. Apart from the previously mentioned security\
    \ threats [206], the authors of [207]\ncontemplate physical attacks that the IoT\
    \ deployment may face. The IoT devices must be protected\nfrom the weather and\
    \ possible animals that access the ﬁelds. However, strong weather conditions\n\
    such as ﬂoods or animals such as wilds boars may result in the IoT device being\
    \ damaged or lost.\nFurthermore, the IoT devices may also be damaged by the operators\
    \ when they are performing their\nactivities or be the aim of a person with malicious\
    \ intentions. Another threat to the devices deployed\non the ﬁeld is the possibility\
    \ of them being replaced to malicious nodes, providing the attacker with\naccess\
    \ to the network [29]. The deployed devices may also be susceptible to malicious\
    \ code and false\ndata injection, leading to wrong results and the malfunction\
    \ of the system. Sleep deprivation attacks\nare aimed at depleting the battery\
    \ of the devices. The deployed nodes are susceptible to booting attacks\nas well.\
    \ Furthermore, attackers may also perform eavesdropping and interfere with the\
    \ deployed\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n33 of 48\ndevices. The concern of securing\
    \ the physical devices deployed on the ﬁelds has led to many systems\nincorporating\
    \ PIR sensors, scarecrows, and buzzers to detect intruders, either humans or animals,\
    \ and\nto alert of their presence [59,208].\nPrivacy is another aspect to consider.\
    \ The data managed by IoT irrigation systems may not need as\nmuch privacy as\
    \ the data managed by other IoT applications such as those for health. In fact,\
    \ Jimenez\net al. [207] remark that it may not be necessary for the gathered data\
    \ of some irrigation IoT systems to\nremain private, but the correct performance\
    \ of the system must be ensured, which is avoiding DoS\nattacks. However, the\
    \ owners of the ﬁelds may be implementing new techniques they would prefer to\n\
    remain private or the water quality management system could be regarded as a critical\
    \ infrastructure\nas the produce that results from the ﬁelds irrigated with that\
    \ water would be consumed by people.\nTherefore, considering this aspect, Ahad\
    \ et al. [202] and Barreto et al. [209] remark the need for user\nprivacy, as\
    \ the obtention of this information may lead to attacks to the owner or the personnel\
    \ of the\nfarm. Ahad et al. [202] consider data and device privacy as well, because\
    \ of the need for guaranteeing\nthe ownership of the data to avoid repudiation\
    \ and ensuring data availability. Barreto et al. [209]\nremark on the burden that\
    \ could be originated from the exposure of the GPS locational data captured\n\
    by IoT devices as attackers may gain information on the location of the farm to\
    \ perform physical attacks.\nLastly, Ahad et al. [202] also comment on the need\
    \ for a secure storage system for the information,\nwith particular emphasis on\
    \ distributed data storage systems. Attacks such as SQL injections can lead\n\
    to the obtention of private information from storage systems [210].\nAs cloud\
    \ computing often goes hand in hand with IoT systems, threats to cloud services\
    \ may\ncompromise the IoT irrigation system as well. Flooding attacks and cloud\
    \ malware injection are some\nof the attacks that can be intentionally executed\
    \ to compromise the data and the performance of the\ncloud [210].\nRansomware\
    \ is another security threat that could aﬀect irrigation systems for agriculture\
    \ [209].\nAll the data regarding pesticides and the fertigation system could be\
    \ encrypted until a ransom is paid.\nFor this reason, having a back-up in a remote\
    \ location is greatly advised.\nBarreto et al. [209] also remark some security\
    \ threats that are not usually commented on when\ndiscussing the security of IoT\
    \ systems for agriculture. One of these threats is the damage that can be\ncaused\
    \ by social engineering as the users of the IoT irrigation system could provide\
    \ login information\nto people posing as technicians or click on malicious links\
    \ on their e-mails. The other threats are\nagroterrorism, cyber-espionage, mostly\
    \ related to accessing intellectual property or conﬁdential\ninformation regarding\
    \ aspects such as genetically modiﬁed crops.\nBlockchain is a new technique that\
    \ is being applied to secure IoT systems [210], which allows\nsecure data storage\
    \ and communication. In agriculture, it is mostly utilized to secure the supply\n\
    chain [211], although there are other proposals that use it to secure a greenhouse\
    \ [212] or to secure\nthe overall smart agriculture framework [213]. Regarding\
    \ IoT irrigation systems for agriculture,\nblockchain has been applied in [214]\
    \ to track and trace the information exchange of their proposed\nsmart watering\
    \ system.\n7.7. Common Architecture Designs for IoT Irrigation Systems for Agriculture\n\
    In this subsection, an overview of the most frequent architectures for these systems\
    \ is going to\nbe discussed.\nMulti-agent architectures are popular in IoT solutions\
    \ for irrigation management [175,180].\nThese types of architectures make a distinction\
    \ among the diﬀerent elements they are comprised of.\nTypically, the distinction\
    \ is made according to the layer of the architecture the elements are encompassed\n\
    in. For example, nodes positioned higher in the hierarchy may act as a broker\
    \ for those lower in the\nhierarchy [175].\nMost architectures are divided into\
    \ layers or functional blocks that represent the main actions to\nbe carried out\
    \ [215]. These blocks or layers can be considered as generic and are utilized\
    \ in most of the\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n34 of 48\navailable architecture designs\
    \ for IoT systems intended for irrigation management. The main elements\nof these\
    \ architectures are devices, communications, services, management, applications,\
    \ and security.\nIoT systems are comprised of devices located in a certain environment\
    \ to perform multiple\nactivities such as detection, monitoring, control, and\
    \ action. The devices must have interfaces that allow\ntheir connection with other\
    \ devices to transmit the necessary information. The data obtained through\ndiﬀerent\
    \ sensors will generally be treated and their results will be applied to diﬀerent\
    \ actuators. Then, it\nis necessary to transmit the monitored data and response\
    \ actions between the devices. Communication\nprotocols are used for this task.\
    \ In most cases, diﬀerent communication protocols are used working\ntogether on\
    \ the same IoT system. In order to perform activities such as device discovery,\
    \ device control\nor the analysis of the collected data, the use of services may\
    \ be necessary as well. The applications allow\nthe interaction of the user with\
    \ the system. From the applications, the user will be able to visualize\nthe information,\
    \ both obtained by monitoring and that extracted from the data once they have\
    \ been\nprocessed. On many occasions, the user can execute the actions that he\
    \ considers appropriate to the\nsituation presented by the data, the actions can\
    \ also be carried out automatically. Lastly, providing\nsecurity to the system\
    \ may also be considered.\nTraditionally, the IoT architecture has been considered\
    \ to be divided into three layers, which are\nthe perception, network, and application\
    \ layer. Later on, an intermediate layer placed between the\nnetwork and application\
    \ layers has been introduced in multiple studies. This layer, called service layer,\n\
    is employed to store and process data using cloud and fog computing. For the last\
    \ few years, authors\nsuch as Ferrández-Pastor [216] presented a new architecture\
    \ proposal, based on four layers: things,\nedge, communication, and cloud. In\
    \ these latest architectural proposals, the authors use the edge layer\nto locate\
    \ critical applications and perform basic control processes. Also, as indicated\
    \ by [216], cloud\n(internet/intranet) can provide Web services, data storage,\
    \ HMI interfaces or analytic applications.\nFigure 29 shows an image where one\
    \ can see the architecture models.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n34 of 48 \n \nelements\
    \ of these architectures are devices, communications, services, management, applications,\
    \ \nand security.  \nIoT systems are comprised of devices located in a certain\
    \ environment to perform multiple \nactivities such as detection, monitoring,\
    \ control, and action. The devices must have interfaces that \nallow their connection\
    \ with other devices to transmit the necessary information. The data obtained\
    \ \nthrough different sensors will generally be treated and their results will\
    \ be applied to different \nactuators. Then, it is necessary to transmit the monitored\
    \ data and response actions between the \ndevices. Communication protocols are\
    \ used for this task. In most cases, different communication \nprotocols are used\
    \ working together on the same IoT system. In order to perform activities such\
    \ as \ndevice discovery, device control or the analysis of the collected data,\
    \ the use of services may be \nnecessary as well. The applications allow the interaction\
    \ of the user with the system. From the \napplications, the user will be able\
    \ to visualize the information, both obtained by monitoring and that \nextracted\
    \ from the data once they have been processed. On many occasions, the user can\
    \ execute the \nactions that he considers appropriate to the situation presented\
    \ by the data, the actions can also be \ncarried out automatically. Lastly, providing\
    \ security to the system may also be considered.  \nTraditionally, the IoT architecture\
    \ has been considered to be divided into three layers, which are \nthe perception,\
    \ network, and application layer. Later on, an intermediate layer placed between\
    \ the \nnetwork and application layers has been introduced in multiple studies.\
    \ This layer, called service \nlayer, is employed to store and process data using\
    \ cloud and fog computing. For the last few years, \nauthors such as Ferrández-Pastor\
    \ [216] presented a new architecture proposal, based on four layers: \nthings,\
    \ edge, communication, and cloud. In these latest architectural proposals, the\
    \ authors use the \nedge layer to locate critical applications and perform basic\
    \ control processes. Also, as indicated by \n[216], cloud (internet/intranet)\
    \ can provide Web services, data storage, HMI interfaces or analytic \napplications.\

    \ -\n80 dBm for 50 m. The distance between underground devices reached approximately\

    \ proposal for an IoT irrigation system for agriculture. \n7.9. Future Challenges\
    \ of IoT Irrigation Systems \nThe Internet of Underground Things (IoUT) is a new\
    \ view of the IoT [221]. It consists of \ndeploying both underground and above\
    \ ground IoT devices that communicate among themselves \nwith underground-underground,\
    \ underground-above ground, and above ground-above ground \ncommunication. It\
    \ is especially useful and applicable to irrigation and precision agriculture\
    \ IoT \nsystems as the devices would not be impeding the work of machines and\
    \ farmers and it would reduce \nthe amount of physical damage the nodes deployed\
    \ on the fields may receive. Although WiFi \nsurprisingly allows underground-above\
    \ ground communication in short distances and depths above \n30 cm [222], it would\
    \ be necessary to study the performance of other existing protocols or even the\
    \ \ncreation of a new protocol that employs lower frequency bands to transmit\
    \ the information through \nthe soil medium.  \nThe use of LoRa is increasing\
    \ for irrigation and precision agriculture applications due to its long-\nrange,\
    \ which allows wireless communication to remote fields. However, the advances\
    \ in 5G may lead \nto a decrease in the interest in LoRa technology. On the one\
    \ hand, if the designed irrigation system \nproduces lower amounts of data, as\
    \ these types of systems present low variability in the data, LoRa \npresents\
    \ itself as a very good solution. However, on the other hand, for IoT systems\
    \ that require the \ntransmission of large amounts of data, 5G would solve the\
    \ problem of the limited amount of data \nthat LoRa can transmit. Considering\
    \ these aspects, a possible future is the use of LoRa and 5G hybrid \nwireless\
    \ networks to attempt in satisfying those needs [223]. \nThere are diverse opinions\
    \ on the existence and effects of climate change on earth. However, \nthere is\
    \ no doubt that many governments, companies and the citizens themselves are increasing\
    \ their \nawareness regarding sustainable consumption. This not only affects their\
    \ view on the energy \nconsumption of IoT systems for irrigation but also, the\
    \ origin of the components of the devices and \nthe impact of IoT devices on the\
    \ environment and the fauna of the area where they are deployed. \nTherefore,\
    \ the reduction in energy consumption and the use of alternative powering methods\
    \ will \ncontinue to be a research trend. Furthermore, it may be a challenge to\
    \ find new materials that are \nweather-resistant and do not increase severely\
    \ the cost of the devices, but the use of recyclable \nmaterials in some of the\
    \ elements of the IoT devices is to be expected [203]. \nAs it has further been\
    \ commented on Subsection 7 1 blockchain and AI will be incorporated into\nFigure\
    \ 30. Architecture proposal for an IoT irrigation system for agriculture.\nThe\
    \ ﬁrst layer is the Device layer, where all the devices that will perform the\
    \ functions of detection,\nmonitoring, control, and action are located. We would\
    \ have four types of nodes. The water monitoring\nnode would monitor water quality\
    \ to determine if the water is apt for the irrigation of the crops.\nThe soil\
    \ monitoring node would monitor soil moisture, soil temperature and other parameters\
    \ that\naid in the irrigation schedule decision process. The weather monitoring\
    \ node would measure air\ntemperature and humidity, precipitation, luminosity,\
    \ radiation, and wind parameters so as to aid in\nthe decision making process.\
    \ Lastly, the actuator nodes would perform the actions resulting from the\ndecision-making\
    \ process.\nThe second layer is the communication layer, comprised of three blocks.\
    \ The Hop-to-Hop\ncommunication block allows deﬁning data link layer technologies\
    \ and to transmit the frames that\ncontain the data of the device layer. From\
    \ this block the frames will be sent to the network communication\nblock, to reach\
    \ the remote locations. The routing function can be assumed in this block in mesh\n\
    networks, such as 802.15.4 networks. The end-to-end communication block is responsible\
    \ for delivering\nthe capabilities of the transport and application layers of\
    \ the TCP/IP model when communication\ncrosses diﬀerent network environments.\
    \ Finally, the network communication block is responsible for\nthe communication\
    \ (routing) between the networks, of the hop-to-hop at end-to-end blocks, using\n\
    the address, for example, IPv4 and IPv6, and the ID resolution. In addition, it\
    \ will be responsible for\nmanaging the QoS.\nThe next layer is the services layer,\
    \ which is comprised of three blocks. The services block includes\nthe IoT services\
    \ and operability for their discovery and search. The organization block performs\
    \ the\nassignment of the services according to the needs of the users or the available\
    \ resources. At last,\nin business environments that relate to IoT, the modeling\
    \ and execution of service block will be invoked\nfrom the execution of the applications.\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 1042\n36 of 48\nThere are two blocks, management and security,\
    \ that act on both the previously described\ncommunication and services layers.\
    \ The management block is based on the fault, conﬁguration,\naccounting, performance,\
    \ security (FCAPS) model and framework.\nThis is a model of the ISO\nTelecommunications\
    \ Management Network [220].\nThe security block guarantees both the security and\
    \ privacy of the systems and is comprised\nof four blocks. The authentication\
    \ block is responsible for the authentication of users and services.\nThe authorization\
    \ block manages access control policies. Furthermore, access control decisions\
    \ will\nbe made based on access control policies. The key exchange & management\
    \ block is used to achieve\nsecure communications between peers. Finally, the\
    \ trust & reputation block is responsible for scoring\nthe user and calculating\
    \ the level of trust of the service.\nThe last layer is the application layer.\
    \ It allows users to interact with the IoT system. From this\nlayer, users can\
    \ receive alarms, visualize the gathered data in real-time or activate the actuators\
    \ or\nactions that have not been programmed automatically.\n7.9. Future Challenges\
    \ of IoT Irrigation Systems\nThe Internet of Underground Things (IoUT) is a new\
    \ view of the IoT [221].\nIt consists of\ndeploying both underground and above\
    \ ground IoT devices that communicate among themselves\nwith underground-underground,\
    \ underground-above ground, and above ground-above ground\ncommunication. It is\
    \ especially useful and applicable to irrigation and precision agriculture IoT\n\
    systems as the devices would not be impeding the work of machines and farmers\
    \ and it would\nreduce the amount of physical damage the nodes deployed on the\
    \ ﬁelds may receive. Although WiFi\nsurprisingly allows underground-above ground\
    \ communication in short distances and depths above\n30 cm [222], it would be\

    \ and the citizens themselves are increasing\ntheir awareness regarding sustainable\
    \ consumption. This not only aﬀects their view on the energy\nconsumption of IoT\

    and do not increase severely the cost of the devices, but the use of recyclable\
    \ materials in some of the\nelements of the IoT devices is to be expected [203].\n\
    As it has further been commented on Section 7.1, blockchain and AI will be incorporated\
    \ into most\nIoT services [210], including those aimed at irrigation and precision\
    \ agriculture. These technologies\nprovide not only increased security but also\
    \ optimization to the management of the IoT systems.\nThis will lead to an increased\
    \ understanding of the crops and a faster way to characterize genetically\nmodiﬁed\
    \ crops and the eﬀects of new fertilizers and pesticides. Furthermore, it will\
    \ aid in optimizing\nand reducing water consumption and improving the new mechanisms\
    \ that are being proposed to\ndetermine if treated wastewater can be used for\
    \ irrigation and which crops can be irrigated with\nwastewater depending on its\
    \ composition.\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n37 of 48\nLastly, farmers usually have\
    \ a very small proﬁt and thus, these IoT systems may not be aﬀordable\nto them.\
    \ Therefore, the cost of IoT devices and the overall system implementation should\
    \ have a\ndecreasing tendency for these types of systems to have a commercial\
    \ future.\n8. Conclusions and Future Work\nWater management is paramount in countries\
    \ with water scarcity. This also aﬀects agriculture, as\na large amount of water\
    \ is dedicated to this use. The rising concerns about global warming have led\n\
    to the consideration of creating water management measures to ensure the availability\
    \ of water for\nfood production and consumption. Thus, the researches on water\
    \ usage reduction for irrigation have\nincreased over the years. In this paper,\
    \ we have provided an overview of the actual state of the art\nregarding IoT irrigation\
    \ systems for agriculture. We have identiﬁed the most monitored parameters to\n\
    characterize water quality for irrigation, soil and weather conditions. We have\
    \ also identiﬁed the most\nutilized nodes to implement IoT and WSN systems for\
    \ the irrigation of crops and the most popular\nwireless technologies. Furthermore,\
    \ the current trends in the implementation of IoT systems for crop\nmanagement\
    \ and irrigation have been discussed as well. We have provided a 4-layer architecture\n\
    proposal as well for the management of crop irrigation.\nAs future work, we are\
    \ developing a smart irrigation system that evaluates water quality prior to\n\
    irrigation based on the proposed architecture.\nAuthor Contributions: Methodology,\

    • Ongoing challenges and future perspectives of IoT in agriculture are discussed.
    The increasing demand for food, both in terms of quantity and quality, has raised
    the need for intensification and industrialisation of the agricultural sector.
    The “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a highly promising family of technologies which
    is capable of offering many solutions towards the modernisation of agriculture.
    Scientific groups and research institutions, as well as the industry, are in a
    race trying to deliver more and more IoT products to the agricultural business
    stakeholders, and, eventually, lay the foundations to have a clear role when IoT
    becomes a mainstream technology. At the same time Cloud Computing, which is already
    very popular, and Fog Computing provide sufficient resources and solutions to
    sustain, store and analyse the huge amounts of data generated by IoT devices.
    The management and analysis of IoT data (“Big Data”) can be used to automate processes,
    predict situations and improve many activities, even in real-time. Moreover, the
    concept of interoperability among heterogeneous devices inspired the creation
    of the appropriate tools, with which new applications and services can be created
    and give an added value to the data flows produced at the edge of the network.
    The agricultural sector was highly affected by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies
    and is expected to be equally benefited by the IoT. In this article, a survey
    of recent IoT technologies, their current penetration in the agricultural sector,
    their potential value for future farmers and the challenges that IoT faces towards
    its propagation is presented. Previous article in issue Next article in issue

    1. Introduction and motivation The term “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a term first
    coined by a British visionary, Kevin Ashton, back in 1999. As the phrase “Internet
    of Things” reveals, the IoT paradigm will provide a technological universe, in
    which many physical objects or “Things”, such as sensors, everyday tools and equipment
    enhanced by computing power and networking capabilities will be able to play a
    role, either as single units or as a distributed collaborating swarm of heterogeneous
    devices. Agriculture is one of the sectors that is expected to be highly influenced
    by the advances in the domain of IoT. The Food and Agricultural Organization of
    the United Nation (FAO) predicts that the global population will reach 8 billion
    people by 2025 and 9.6 billion people by 2050 (FAO, 2009). This practically means
    that an increase of 70% in food production must be achieved by 2050 worldwide.
    The great increase in global population and the rising demand for high-quality
    products create the need for the modernisation and intensification of agricultural
    practices. At the same time, the need for high efficiency in the use of water
    and other resources is also mandatory. One of the most promising concepts, which
    is expected to contribute a lot to the required increase of food production in
    a sustainable way, is precision agriculture (PA) (Zhang, Wang, & Wang, 2002).
    Precision agriculture aims to optimise and improve agricultural processes to ensure
    maximum productivity and requires fast, reliable, distributed measurements in
    order to give growers a more detailed overview of the ongoing situation in their
    cultivation area, and/or coordinate the automated machinery in such way that optimises
    energy consumption, water use and the use of chemicals for pest control and plant
    growth. At a higher level, having gathered information from many heterogeneous
    systems, well-evaluated scientific knowledge can be organised in the form of smart
    algorithms to provide a better insight into the ongoing processes, do the reasoning
    of the current situation and make predictions based on heterogeneous inputs, produce
    early warnings about potential dangers that threaten the cultivars, and improved
    automated control signals, based on plant responses (Kacira et al., 2005, Körner
    and Van Straten, 2008). The algorithms required to handle the distributed data
    in real time are far too complicated to run locally on a low-power Wireless Sensor
    Network (WSN) node. However, in the context of IoT, all the objects will be interconnected,
    and therefore the computational overhead can be easily shifted to the cloud or
    be distributed among more than one interconnected devices. The greatly increasing
    interest in IoT in agriculture can be roughly seen in Fig. 1. The increase in
    the appearance of the term “IoT” along with the term “Agriculture” in the international
    scientific literature is rather indicative. These data motivated us to present
    an overview of the state-of-the-art research on IoT in its various forms, appearing
    in the agricultural sector, rather than a generic review. For this reason, a research
    methodology was adopted derived from the existing guidelines used by medical researchers,
    adapted and optimised for software engineering matters (Kitchenham, 2004). According
    to this methodology, a selection of recent literature was done, setting the year
    2010 as starting point. The 2010 starting point year was determined because it
    is then when a significant number of publications appeared. Moreover, technologies
    and approaches before 2010 are quite obsolete at the time of writing the present
    manuscript. Other selection criteria included the multidisciplinary nature of
    a publication. Works utilising more than one technology in order to synthesise
    their solutions were considered as IoT-oriented; for instance, cloud and embedded
    devices/wireless sensors, or, works that make use of more than one type of end
    devices (things) within the same network. Having none of the aforementioned restrictions,
    the reviewed literature area would be too wide and out of the scope of this work.
    Moreover, this paper seeks to present research that adopts newer architectures,
    closer to the principles of IoT. Download : Download high-res image (97KB) Download

    to “IoT in Agriculture”, as they appear in Scopus. This paper begins with an introduction
    in the recent trends in the technologies, which represent the building blocks
    of IoT, such as the Radio Frequency Identification Radio Frequency Identification
    (RFID), wireless sensor networks, the addressing of the “things” in a common network,
    as well as the applications running on the cloud. Following the same categorisation,
    several works are presented, which incorporate one or more of the IoT aspects
    and focus on the agricultural sector. Some of the most popular hardware platforms,
    met in agricultural deployments, is also surveyed. The review closes with a discussion
    on future challenges and their effect on IoT spreading, which has effects on the
    adoption of IoT in the agricultural sector too. One of the goals of this work
    is to provide the members of a multidisciplinary community, such as the researchers
    working on deploying innovative monitoring, tracking, decision support and control
    systems, with a handful manuscript that summarises the latest advances in embedded
    devices, sensor modules, wireless communication technologies, programming paradigms
    and cloud services suitable, or optimised, for use in agriculture. Some of the
    most common keywords appearing in the presented literature are presented in Fig.

    Keyword distribution in the presented literature. 2. Internet of Things enabling
    technologies The structure of IoT is based on three layers; namely, the perception
    layer (sensing), the network layer (data transfer), and the application layer
    (data storage and manipulation). Despite great improvements, IoT is still evolving,
    trying to obtain its final shape, as can be seen in several reviews (Atzori et
    al., 2010, Botta et al., 2014, Gubbi et al., 2013, Miorandi et al., 2012). As
    the term “Internet” implies, networking capability is one of the core features
    of the IoT devices. The internet as we know it today is mostly an internet of
    human end-users, while the IoT will be an internet of non-human entities, therefore
    a lot of machine-to-machine (M2M) communication will take place. 2.1. Layer 1:
    the perception layer At the perception layer, we meet technologies such as WSN,
    RFID and, recently, Near Field Communications (NFC). There is some overlap between
    WSN and RFID technologies, since semi-passive and active RFID tags can also be
    regarded as wireless nodes with lower computational and storage capacity. Typically,
    a wireless sensor node consists of a processing module, usually a low-power microcontroller
    unit (MCU), one or more sensor modules (embedded or external analogue or digital
    sensing devices) and an RF communication module, usually supporting a low-power
    wireless communication technology (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image
    (202KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. The architecture of a typical
    wireless sensor node. Apart from monitoring and control during the production
    process, there is a need for monitoring, identification and tracking of agricultural
    and livestock products after harvest. WSNs are often met in several works related
    to monitoring and climate control of storage and logistics facilities. RFID technology
    is considered the first, and most basic, example of interconnected “Things”. RFID
    tags contain data in the form of the Electronic Product Code (EPC) and the RFID
    Readers are triggering, reading and manipulating a large number of tags. Offering
    object identification, tracking and data storage on active or passive (without
    the need for embedded power supply) tags, RFID and NFC technologies play an important
    role in the agricultural domain. Typical user scenarios include products or livestock
    monitoring, supply chain and quality control tracking and lifecycle assessment
    of agricultural products (Welbourne et al., 2009). 2.2. Layer 2: the network layer
    At the second layer of IoT, wireless sensor nodes interacting with physical objects
    and/or their environment, communicate with their neighbouring nodes or a gateway,
    building networks through which the data are usually forwarded towards a remote
    infrastructure for storage, further analysis, processing and dissemination of
    the valuable knowledge that can be extracted (Gubbi et al., 2013). When it comes
    to wireless communications, a large scientific literature has been created on
    sensor networks, addressing several problems, such as energy efficiency, networking
    features, scalability and robustness (Atzori et al., 2010). Communication protocols
    built over wireless standards, such as 802.15.4, facilitate the device networking
    and bridge the gap between the internet-enabled gateways and the end-nodes. Such
    protocols include ZigBee, ONE-NET, Sigfox, WirelessHART, ISA100.11a, and 6LowPan,
    to name a few (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE), LoRa/LoRaWAN, DASH7 and low-power WiFi have also appeared in
    several deployments recently. 2.3. Layer 3: the application layer The application
    layer is the third layer of the IoT. It is of high importance and, in many ways,
    it is this that facilitates the realisation of the IoT. The application layer
    faces several issues which have to be resolved, such as the identification of
    the devices as unique entities. Identifying and addressing billions of devices
    around the globe will provide a direct, internet-like access and control over
    them through the future internet. The uniqueness of identity, reliability, persistence
    and scalability represent important features of the addressing schema (Gubbi et
    al., 2013). IPv6, with its internet mobility aspects, could alleviate some of
    the device identification problems and is expected to play a vital role in this
    field (Botta et al., 2014). However, the heterogeneous nature of wireless nodes,
    the variability of data types, concurrent operations and confluence of data from
    the devices amplifies the problem even further (Zorzi, Gluhak, Lange, & Bassi,
    2010). Meta-data and context-aware addressing, supplementary to IPv6, are expected
    to contribute a lot while dealing with the above-mentioned challenges (Kalmar,
    Vida, & Maliosz, 2013). Heterogeneity is another big challenge in the IoT world.
    The vision of IoT is to allow billions of devices, with great diversity in their
    technical specifications (form factor, power supply, environmental capabilities,
    compatibility with other devices), computing power, peripheral devices and networking
    subsystems to co-exist in one inter-network. Middleware is a software layer, composed
    of sub-layers located between the devices and the application layer, abstracting
    the device functionalities and technical specificities and providing developers
    with sets of more generic tools to build their applications (Fig. 4). Middleware
    has gained much attention due to its major role in simplifying the development
    of new services and the integration of legacy technologies into new ones (Atzori
    et al., 2010). Furthermore, middleware is the mechanism that combines the cloud
    infrastructure with a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and the sensor networks
    in a generic manner, ready to provide appropriate tools for any type of deployment
    (Ghosh & Das, 2008). SOA approach benefits the enterprise by reducing the time
    invested in adapting itself to the changes imposed by the market and allows software
    and hardware reuse, since it is technology independent, when it comes to service
    implementations (Pasley, 2005). Future agricultural IoT interconnected devices
    may include sensors, connected machinery and vehicles, weather stations, internet
    gateways, network storage, RFID scanners, smartphones, tablets, wearables and
    many other devices. Download : Download high-res image (233KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Software layers over heterogeneous devices and operating
    systems presenting how the Middleware layer serves in order to make it possible
    for a single/common application to run seamlessly on several platforms and operating
    systems. Finally, in order for the sensed data to have a real value for the end-user
    or another system (in case of M2M scenarios) they have to be stored, analysed,
    synthesised and presented in an understandable and intuitive manner. Big Data
    is one side-effect of the continuous data flow coming from billions of geo-distributed
    devices and has three dimensions, namely volume, variety and velocity (Beyer,
    2011). The Cloud with its virtually unlimited computational and storage capacity
    is the only technology capable of withstanding the IoT workload. In modern agricultural
    scenarios, stored data are automatically processed, corrected and used or combined
    under artificial intelligence algorithms, machine learning technologies, and decision-making
    systems based on models, in order to extract knowledge about phenomena, which
    cannot be directly measured. These systems can either propose the optimal tactic
    to the end-user, or produce the appropriate control signals for actuator devices,
    offering fully-automated sensing and control solutions. Plenty of studies have
    focussed on the standardisation of the IoT core technologies (Jazayeri et al.,
    2015, Sawant et al., 2014). The classical WSN/WSAN (Wireless Sensor-Actor Network)
    paradigm, i.e. distributed smart devices sensing and transferring data to a sink
    and/or driving one or more actuators, moves one step further towards interoperability
    of devices and objects. Other aspects of IoT include technologies that support
    the intercommunication among devices and/or end-users, as well as the platforms,
    the software, the hardware abstractions and the programming tools, over which
    developers and providers can build new applications and services (Atzori et al.,
    2010, Miorandi et al., 2012). The IoT paradigm is driven by the principles: “Anything
    communicates – anything is identified – anything interacts”. 3. Internet of Things
    hardware, platforms and sensors in agriculture 3.1. Low-power wireless sensor
    networks In the recent literature, a large number of embedded programmable devices
    have been used. Some are custom-built, while others are either commercial programmable
    boards or complete, closed-source sensing/monitoring solutions. Researchers choose
    their equipment depending on the research priorities set, or the main focus of
    each study. Commercial sensing solutions provide a number of features out of the
    box, allowing researchers to focus on other aspects of IoT deployments, like meta-processing,
    smart algorithms for monitoring and control, cloud interoperability, etc. (Edwards
    Murphy et al., 2015, Mamduh et al., 2012, Yu et al., 2011). Programmable, open
    solutions, on the other hand, provide developers the flexibility to have full
    control over the behaviour of the nodes and the network and program new peripheral
    devices to make them compatible with the nodes, like new sensor or actuator modules
    (Akshay et al., 2012; Wu, Li, Ma, Qiu, & He, 2012; Hou and Gao, 2010, Jayaraman
    et al., 2015a, Jimenez et al., 2012, Park and Park, 2011). The potential applications
    of IoT in agriculture cover a large number of scenarios. Barcelo-Ordinas, Chanet,
    Hou, & Garcia-Vidal (2016) categorise them in networks of scalar sensors, utilised
    in sensing and control of agricultural infrastructures, such as greenhouses, multimedia
    sensor networks for the remote image capturing and processing for the detection
    of insects and plant diseases, and tag-based networks (RFID, NFC) for product
    tracking and remote identification. Especially in the case of WSN in agriculture,
    the specific characteristics of the situation and the environment, in which the
    nodes will be deployed, should be taken into account. Crops, or other obstacles
    in farmlands whose positions may move, cause considerable interference in the
    communication between nodes. This varying movement of obstacles affects the connection
    quality of links, making it variable with space and time, affecting the deployment,
    routing, failure diagnosis, and other aspects of WSN. Harsh environmental factors
    such as temperature, humidity, rainfall and high solar radiation, the effect of
    shading by the plant leaves, as well as the noise produced by building structures,
    such as greenhouses, extend the spatiotemporal climatic variation, greatly affecting
    the links and communication quality among the nodes (Wang, Yang, & Mao, 2017).
    The periodic nature of the recorded phenomena in agricultural installations usually
    drive the development of the applications. This characteristic sets the requirements
    and provides opportunities for novel duty-cycle control, sampling scheduling,
    data reconstructions, as well as data storage and query, intelligent control,
    and so on (Ahonen et al., 2008, Mottola and Picco, 2011; Pawlowski et al., 2008).
    Therefore, the choice of the correct IoT platform to build a deployment could
    affect the overall success of the project. A summary of some of the popular programmable
    boards and embedded platforms used in recent deployments is presented in Table

    for agricultural Internet of Things/Wireless Sensor Network deployments Although
    many theoretical aspects of WSN have been extensively studied in literature, realistic
    IoT/WSN deployments in agricultural sector are quite demanding and remain a challenging
    task. Sensor modules need to be accurate enough, with the appropriate measuring
    range for the situation at hand, and shielded against environmental factors which
    can either create false readings or even destroy the sensor permanently. Due to
    the distributed nature of IoT, in cases of battery-operated nodes, placed in open
    fields or other agricultural facilities, replacing the power source can be a very
    difficult task, if not impossible. Therefore, very strict power constraints affect
    the selection of hardware and the low-power features of the selected peripheral
    devices are always considered when designing a new system. Software-wise the components
    which are to be integrated in order to implement the functionality of an end-device
    have to be carefully inspected. The final functional code requires deep embedded
    software engineering knowledge and sufficient testing to avoid failures in the
    field (Barrenetxea et al., 2008, Langendoen et al., 2006). . Other characteristics
    making a low-power, embedded device selectable for a deployment are its long-term
    stability, the number of digital and analogue inputs/outputs which determines
    the number of peripheral devices (sensors and actuators) that can be supported,
    the ability to be sustainable through power harvesting modules, and, the effort
    required for its programming. 3.3. Wireless communication protocols in agriculture
    The dominant wireless technologies in the domain of IoT are separated into seven
    main categories, namely, Global System for Mobile Communications (Groupe Spécial
    Mobile – GSM) offered by authorised operators, Wireless Personal Area Networks
    (WPAN), Wireless Regional Area Networks (Cognitive Radio/WRAN), Mesh, Point-to-Point
    (P2P) and Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPN/LPWAN). GSM standard is further divided
    into GSM EDGE Radio Access Network (GERAN) and UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network
    (UTRAN). Numerous wireless devices have been developed upon the various wireless
    standards. As in many aspects of IoT, interoperability is the biggest challenge.
    Another challenge, which is common in the wireless communications, is the interference
    among devices that operate in the same band (Bluetooth, ZigBee and WiFi, for instance)
    or in neighbouring bands. An attempt to summarise the most popular IoT wireless
    standards is presented in Table 2. Table 2. Summary table of the most popular

    40 mW/4 W 128 bit As can clearly be seen in Table 2, IoT wireless communications
    provide a wide variety of bandwidth, communication range, power consumption and
    security measures. The variety of technologies and standards, as well as the differentiation
    among the IoT projects and their specific requirements, hamper interoperability
    at the networking layer. When it comes to agricultural deployments, high temperature,
    and high humidity are two very common phenomena. Based on the observations of
    Bannister, Giorgetti, and Gupta (2008), temperature has a significant effect on
    the received signal strength (RSS) when it rises from 25 °C to 65 °C. Similar
    results were presented by Boano, Tsiftes, Voigt, Brown, and Roedig (2010). Furthermore,
    humidity can also be very high in agricultural deployments. In the case of open
    fields, the wireless nodes are directly exposed to rain or irrigation systems.
    In greenhouses, relative humidity can be over 80% for long periods too. Humidity
    has been shown to strongly affect radio wave propagation (Room and Tate, 2007,
    Thelen, 2004). Therefore, the number of nodes, the distance between them, the
    height of the antenna, and the operating frequency based on the desired size of
    messages are serious matters to be taken into consideration, when choosing a wireless
    transceiver for an agricultural deployment. 4. Applications in agriculture The
    general overview of IoT structural elements presented in Section 2 clearly reveals
    the great potential of these technologies in the domains of Agriculture and the
    recent trend of Precision Agriculture (PA). Recent advances in sensor technology,
    along with the miniaturisation of electronics and the great drop in their cost
    have contributed a lot to the technological evolution of traditional agriculture
    to precision and micro-precision agriculture (Kacira et al., 2005). Climate sensors,
    ground sensors, radiation sensors, weather stations (made of sensors) emphasise
    that it is all about sensors and sensor data flows, which are stored and used
    for monitoring, knowledge mining, reasoning, and control. Additionally, in recent
    years, there is an increasing demand for high quality and safe agricultural products.
    This trend has yielded the need for interoperable, distributed, robust, and accurate
    logistics traceability systems. The IoT family of technologies provides all the
    appropriate tools for building and maintaining such infrastructure and services,
    specially designed to support supply chains in agricultural and floricultural
    sectors (Verdouw, Beulens, & van der Vorst, 2013). 4.1. Agricultural monitoring
    and control Sensors, in the form of wired and wireless sensors, have been widely
    used in agriculture during the last decades. Sensing the environment in which
    production occurs, and, more recently, the responses of the plants to the climate
    (Nishina, 2015), is crucial for taking the correct and more precise decisions,
    optimising productivity and quality of the cultivars. The traditional WSN have
    recently evolved to IoT-friendly-WSN, by adopting more generic standards in terms
    of communication, allowing remote access to the internet and implementing smart
    algorithms for meta-processing of the data aiming to improve monitoring and/or
    control. Versatile devices, with high computational abilities, very convenient
    form factor and low cost, can nowadays be used, on batteries, and operate for
    long periods, with or without the assistance of power harvesting modules. In addition,
    modern embedded devices have sufficient resources to support more demanding sensors,
    such as image sensors, and the support of more sophisticated networking protocols,
    such TCP/IP, extending the traditional WSN networking capabilities. A rough classification
    of literature on monitoring and control could be: - Monitoring and, in some cases,
    creation of early warnings, via simplified rules. This includes multi-point monitoring
    for catching and absorbing climatic gradients in greenhouse cultivation (Katsoulas
    et al., 2017a, Tolle et al., 2005). - Monitoring, meta-processing (algorithm/model
    implementations on the server/cloud side) and control, including control suggestions
    to the user and fully automated control (Aiello, Giovino, Vallone, Catania, &
    Argento, 2017). - Monitoring using more computationally demanding sensors, such
    as image sensors and more powerful end-nodes. Captured images are used either
    for plain monitoring of the system, or utilised for image processing on-board,
    at the edge of the network (Fog computing) or on a cloud/server-based infrastructure
    (Katsoulas et al., 2016, Ravikanth et al., 2017, Senthilkumar et al., 2016). Sensing
    is of high importance in agriculture. WSNs have been widely used in climate and
    soil monitoring deployments both in open field and in controlled environment agriculture.
    4.2. Controlled environment agriculture Greenhouses have been shown to present
    significant climate variability, which affects the productivity of the plants
    (Kittas, Bartzanas, & Jaffrin, 2003), if not harming them. Greenhouse cultivation
    is more intense, therefore, in many cases, it requires higher precision in terms
    of monitoring and control (Fig. 4). Several studies have focussed only on localised
    and remote monitoring. In most cases data are stored and represented in various
    graphical ways (Wu et al., 2012; Jimenez et al., 2012; Katsoulas, Bartzanas, &
    Kittas, 2017; Yu et al., 2011, Zhao et al., 2010). In addition to the high-precision
    monitoring, there have been studies presenting systems which incorporate meta-processing
    procedures with data transferred on remote infrastructures through the internet.
    Utilising well-evaluated equations, crop and climate models, such systems produce
    assessments of the climate and/or crop status in order for the grower to take
    better decisions or get early warnings (Ferentinos et al., 2015, Fernandes et
    al., 2013, Hernandez and Park, 2011, Hu and Qian, 2011, Jiao et al., 2014, Katsoulas
    et al., 2017b, Ma et al., 2011, Suciu et al., 2015, Tuli et al., 2014, Yu and
    Zhang, 2013, Zhou et al., 2013). Agricultural-cloud IoT solutions for greenhouse
    monitoring and control are more and more common. End-nodes collect various data
    which are uploaded to a cloud infrastructure where these data are analysed deeply,
    in a faster way, at a lower cost, reliably and efficiently (Jiawen et al., 2013,
    Keerthi and Kodandaramaiah, 2015, Wang et al., 2013a). Since plant factories are
    becoming more popular in the wider frame of urban CEA in smart cities, there have
    been a number of studies focussing on artificial growth systems (Kozai and Fujiwara,
    2016, Lee and Yoe, 2015). Katsoulas, Bartzanas, et al. (2017) presented a system
    for online precise irrigation scheduling for greenhouses (OpIRIS) based on well-evaluated
    scientific knowledge organised in the form of a web application communicating
    with remote sensors installed in greenhouses. The system integrated industrial-grade
    climate sensors and machinery including fertigation valves/controllers and sensors
    for automatic drainage sampling and forwarding the data to the cloud infrastructure
    for further analysis. The system proved very accurate in predicting the crop water
    needs and provided growers with very efficient indications about when to irrigate
    and how much nutrient solution to apply. Similar attempts to automate irrigation
    have been based on an agricultural information cloud and a hardware combination
    of IOT and RFID (Tongke, 2013), the system achieving dynamic distribution of resource
    and load balancing. As a result, authors report high efficiency of resource use
    and significant improvement in water quality. There have also been studies that
    implement control of one or more of the actuator systems in greenhouses, such
    as climate, or, irrigation controllers, also known as WSANs (Moga et al., 2012,
    Sabri et al., 2011). The control can be done remotely in two ways. The first is
    manual control by the farmer. In these cases, system administrator, based on the
    suggestions made by a Decision Support System/Expert System, chooses to control
    the machinery. Applications in this monitoring and control category include Integrated
    Pest Management (IPM) (Chougule, Kumar, & Mukhopadhyay, 2016), remote monitoring,
    warning and control in open field (Chu et al., 2013, Dinh Le and Tan, 2015), and
    in controlled environment agriculture (Ferentinos et al., 2015, Pahuja et al.,
    2013, Qiu et al., 2013). There also plenty of studies attempting fully-automated
    control by communicating the control signals, produced after processing the sensed
    data, directly to the actuators succeeding a closed-loop control (Kassim et al.,
    2014, Nikolidakis et al., 2015, Rajaoarisoa et al., 2012, Yin et al., 2014, Yongheng
    and Feng, 2014). 4.3. Open-field agriculture In open-field deployments researchers
    usually measure climate conditions, but also focus a lot in soil monitoring. In
    many cases authors use more than one sensors in the ground, at different depths.
    Optimising irrigation by providing exactly as much water as the plant needs is
    the only way to preserve water, since all the extra amount or irrigation is either
    lost into the ground, or in the atmosphere through evaporation (Fig. 5) (Sivakumar,
    GunaSekaran, SelvaPrabhu, Kumaran, & Anandan, 2012). Optical sensors have been
    used for additional information on crop reflectance or remote temperature sensing,
    as well as, mapping of the situation in the field (Fisher and Kebede, 2010, Inoue
    et al., 2012, Moshou et al., 2011, O''Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010). Integration
    of IoT and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) has been proposed in cases where
    precision of mapping of the sensed data is important (Li et al., 2012, Wang et
    al., 2013b, Ye et al., 2013). Another aspect of WSNs in agriculture are the Underground
    Wireless Sensor networks, which present significant advantages, especially in
    open field applications (De Lima et al., 2010, Dong et al., 2013, Silva and Vuran,
    2010). Download : Download high-res image (188KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. A modern example of Cloud IoT solutions for climate monitoring and
    climate optimisation based on cloud analytics services. Data fusion is realised
    on the cloud. These data come from various sources, like sensors inside and outside
    the facilities, weather stations, historical data from data bases. User can interact
    remotely with the system through a wide variety of devices (laptops, tablets,
    smartphones, etc.). As mentioned earlier, the advances in embedded device technology
    have made very powerful platforms available at very convenient prices. This has
    given the chance to researchers to implement more sophisticated end-devices, such
    as Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks, incorporating sensing nodes with much
    bigger computational capabilities, enough to support highly demanding peripheral
    devices, such as image sensors. This kind of node allows heavier local processing
    at the edge of the network, in fog-network-like manner. These works either use
    cameras for simple security or facility monitoring purposes (Cai et al., 2011,
    Zhang et al., 2011), or implement various image processing algorithms in order
    to track invading animals (Baranwal & Pushpendra, 2016), insects or other plant
    threats (Dang et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2014) and crop growth (Rodriguez de la
    Concepcion, Stefanelli, & Trinchero, 2014). 4.4. Livestock applications Several
    deployments have been realised in the fields of livestock. Optimal environment
    which absorbs extreme climate conditions known to have negative effects on animals
    productivity is a serious matter for many authors (Corkery et al., 2013, Ilapakurti
    and Vuppalapati, 2015, Wang and Lee, 2012, Zhang et al., 2016). Livestock IoT
    includes not only animal and animal climate monitoring and control, but, in some
    cases includes field monitoring for optimal feeding practices (Fig. 6) (Bhargava,
    Ivanov, & Donnelly, 2015). Another aspect of livestock IoT includes the instrumentation
    and analysis of beehives (Edwards Murphy et al., 2015). Wireless sensors have
    been used in animal tracking and behavioural analysis (Asikainen et al., 2013,
    Huircán et al., 2010, Jeong and Yoe, 2012, Kwong et al., 2012, Nadimi et al.,
    2012) as well as odour and hazardous gas monitoring (Mamduh et al., 2012). There
    are also studies that focus on optimising the performance of the equipment used
    in livestock deployment, based on the imposed challenges of the situation at hand
    (Jeong & Yoe, 2012). Download : Download high-res image (151KB) Download : Download

    overview. 4.5. Food supply chain tracking Modern agriculture tends to be more
    and more industrialised. Therefore, standardisation mechanisms at each step for
    the product, from the grower to the consumer, have to be adopted in order to assure
    food safety and quality (Fig. 8). This need has led to a growing interest in food
    supply chain traceability systems. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies include
    plenty of solutions to contribute greatly to the construction, support and maintenance
    of such systems. In the reviewed literature, solutions focus either on the business
    side of Food Supply Chain (FSC) or technology. There are some works, though, which
    attempt to propose solutions for both sides. Recent developments in e-commerce
    have given a boost to various Supply Chain research activity. In this review,
    however, a focus only on FSC was attempted, since they are optimised for food
    supplies. Download : Download high-res image (206KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 8. Schematic representation of the food supply chain from the production
    phase until the final consumer. RFID is the most common IoT technology found in
    Food Supply Chain (FSC). RFID tags, acting as enhanced barcodes, enable the tracking
    of agricultural products. Recent research, following the IoT paradigm, has combined
    more than one sensor to enrich the information of product status whenever this
    is recorded through its RFID (Maksimovic et al., 2015, Zhao et al., 2013). A common
    issue in IoT is its distributed nature and the asynchronous and heterogeneous
    flow of information. Therefore, naming is vital for the accurate and fast retrieval
    of information when it comes to FSC tracking services (Liu et al., 2015). The
    realisation of IoT-based infrastructure leads to the virtualisation of the supply
    chains, since physical proximity is no longer required (Verdouw et al., 2013).
    Various models analysing the FSC issues and the way IoT technologies tackle them
    appear in literature (Lianguang, 2014, Zhang, 2014). Technological evolution,
    combined with the increasing robustness and maturity of several technologies met
    in IoT, have given researchers the chance to develop complete systems, which incorporate
    sensing modules and software infrastructures. The software part of these systems
    is either hosted on cloud providers or shared among distributed shareholders.
    Complete systems offer automated services, intelligent schemes and automatic reasoning
    based on the measured phenomena and artificial intelligence (Chen, 2015, Jiang
    and Zhang, 2013, Xu et al., 2011). Other works present approaches on how to organise
    a complete FSC information management system (Li, Chen, & Zhu, 2013) or how to
    design the system in such a way that it maximises the economic profit (Pang, Chen,
    Han, & Zheng, 2015). 4.6. Internet of Things middleware and interoperability Interoperability
    at all levels is a key concept in the developing IoT world. Middleware is an approach
    that aims to facilitate interoperability (Fig. 9). The concept of interoperability
    in IoT can be expressed in many ways. Modern agriculture has evolved into a highly-intensive
    industry, expanding from the level of single grower up to international organisations.
    Therefore, agricultural-oriented IoT research offers literature in all aspects
    of interoperability, namely technical, syntactical, semantic and organisational
    interoperability . Download : Download high-res image (99KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 9. The dimensions of interoperability (Serrano et al., 2015).
    Technical interoperability is associated with hardware and software components,
    aiming to provide seamless exchange of information between systems (M2M). Syntactical
    interoperability has to do with data formats, i.e. the syntax that messages should
    have, in order to be exchanged between the systems, in the form of bit-tables
    or high level languages (HTML, XML, etc.). Semantic interoperability has a special
    value for end users, since it has to do with the human interpretation and understanding
    of the content produced by IoT systems. Finally, organisational interoperability
    is of high importance when it comes to IoT scalability. The ability to communicate
    effectively and transfer meaningful data, over highly varying systems and/or geographic
    regions is the key to success of distributed, global-IoT infrastructures (Serrano
    et al., 2015). Hu, Wang, She, and Wang (2011a) present a middleware to promote
    data (Technical) interoperability among various grain storage systems. Technical
    interoperability is the absolute basic type of interoperability a system must
    satisfy. At a higher level of intercommunication among systems, syntactical interoperability
    has to be implemented, in more generic, understandable and human-friendly messages.
    The incorporation of new, high-end, technologies, such as IoT, within a traditional
    productive sector, such as agriculture, and the trend of precision agriculture
    has given Semantic interoperability middleware an extra value. This is because
    Semantic interoperability middleware makes technology more intuitive and easier
    to understand, for both growers and agronomists (Jayaraman et al., 2015b, Sawant
    et al., 2014). Knowledge retrieval is a second feature of Semantic middleware.
    Data flows are organised and synthesised, allowing for better reasoning and management
    in agricultural (Perera et al., 2013, Yuan et al., 2013) and livestock (Saraswathi
    Sivamani, Park, Shin, Cho, & Cho, 2015) deployments. Moving one step further towards
    the realisation of large-scale national, or international cooperative deployments,
    organisational interoperability has been studied (Hu et al., 2011b, Sivamani et
    al., 2013). Providing the base for seamless cooperation between organisations
    presents numerous advantages, ranging from the technical level, for instance,
    quality improvement in sensing, reasoning and control systems by automatic exchange
    of knowledge between self-learning and self-improving systems, up to economic
    and business level by adapting the production rate according to market trends.
    4.7. Multi-layer deployments and commercial solutions IoT allows for the interoperability
    of the systems and organisations. Therefore, it makes it easier to interconnect
    systems involved in the various phases of a product''s lifecycle and several studies
    have presented systems which integrate numerous platforms that monitor, control
    and track agricultural products. Fu (2012) presents in short an intelligent agricultural
    system which could potentially be used in optimal melon and fruit production and
    management, as well as internet trading and supply chain tracking of organic goods.
    IoT concepts and technologies have been widely applied in many aspects of the
    transportation and storage of goods from the producer to the wholesale reseller
    to the consumer, from post-harvest treatment optimisation, storage facilities
    monitoring and management, and controlled environment shipping containers (Dittmer
    et al., 2012, Moon et al., 2015) to swarms of delivery drones (Yu, Subramanian,
    Ning, & Edwards, 2015), autonomous trucks and ships. IoT applications are there
    to drive future changes (Hribernik, Warden, Thoben, & Otthein, 2010). Several
    vendors have moved towards providing solutions either in the form of service or
    solutions that also include the hardware to do the monitoring. In all these cases
    cloud-based applications do the analysis of the data providing suggestions, warnings
    or control signals. These solutions do not only focus on large-scale production,
    but also on individual gardening and home production. Bitponics is cloud-based
    solution offering automated advisory services for garden care (Bitponics, 2016).
    Plantlink offers a solution for connecting garden to home users integrating sensors
    and irrigation controller in one network (Plantlink, 2016). Growtronix is a modular
    system that can monitor almost every aspect of indoor gardens and plant factories
    (Growtronix, 2016). Some promising smart greenhouse monitoring and control solutions
    are offered by Sensaphone, Monnit and GetSenso (GetSenso, 2016, Monnit, 2016,
    Sensaphone, 2016). These solutions aim to optimise climate in greenhouses minimising
    the risk of yield losses through a more optimal climate for the crops. In addition,
    Fieldclimate appears to be a rich platform providing both hardware (weather stations,
    sensor nodes) and cloud-based software solutions (weather forecast, irrigation
    management, disease models etc.) (FieldClimate, 2016). CropX is a complete system
    including field ground sensors measuring soil moisture and temperature, uploading
    the data to the cloud and offer a mapping and optimal irrigation planning as a
    service to the grower through a mobile application (CropX, 2016). Microsoft has
    recently launched its end-to-end IoT platform for agriculture. FarmBeats consists
    of UAV drones and sensors, connectivity support, and cloud infrastructure which
    includes machine learning-based backend analytics with predictive features, and
    cloud storage (Microsoft, 2015). 5. Discussion 5.1. Internet of Things hardware
    & software challenges in agriculture When it comes to IoT in agriculture, several
    challenges arise. Firstly, the equipment residing at the perception layer has
    to be exposed directly to harsh environmental phenomena, like high solar radiation,
    extreme temperatures, rain or high humidity, strong winds, vibrations and other
    dangers capable of destroying the electronic circuits. The end-devices will have
    to stay active and function reliably for long periods relying on the limited power
    resources of batteries. Therefore, appropriate programming tools and low-power
    capabilities are mandatory, since the frequent battery replacement or reset of
    the stations (in case of a program failure), for example in a large-scale open
    field deployment, is not easy. Power harvesting can be a solution to some extent,
    however, the power consumption has still to be within the power budget of small
    power harvesting modules (e.g. solar panels, wind turbines etc.). Furthermore,
    the large number of interconnected (in an internet-like manner) devices produces
    an incredibly large amount of data, which will soon be beyond the resource capacities
    of small-scale server infrastructures to handle (Atzori et al., 2010, Ziegeldorf
    et al., 2014). 5.2. Organisational challenges & interoperability When it comes
    to logistics for the food and agricultural sector, this infrastructure aims to
    facilitate the exchange of information and the transportation of goods, optimising
    the production process and the supply chain networks globally. IoT is gradually
    transforming business processes by providing more accurate and real-time visibility
    to the flow of materials and products (Lee & Lee, 2015). Cloud Computing provides
    high quality services, hardware-agnostic application development tools and sufficient
    storage and computational resources to store and process the data produced at
    the edge of the network. Therefore, it seems like an ideal complement for the
    IoT technologies towards the composition of “CloudIoT” paradigm (Botta et al.,
    2014). The huge amount of data produced at the edge of the network, however, can
    incur a severely high cost to be transferred to the cloud, both in terms of money
    and latency. Therefore, the optimal balancing between the edge storage and processing
    and the part of the workload that is to be done on the cloud is a serious matter.
    Fog Computing is an extension of the Cloud Computing paradigm, expanding cloud
    technologies and tools, as well as, the horizons of application development (Bonomi,
    Milito, Natarajan, & Zhu, 2014). 5.3. Networking challenges The characteristics
    of the environment do not only impose challenges to the hardware, but also to
    the network layer. Wireless communication is the most common in agricultural deployments,
    due to the lack of wiring costs. Environment is known to be one of the major factors
    which lead to low wireless link quality, through the multi-path propagation effects
    and its contribution to background noise (Wang et al., 2017). Real-world deployments
    have shown that the performance of popular transceivers is affected by temperature
    (Bannister et al., 2008, Boano et al., 2010), humidity (Thelen, 2004), human presence
    and other obstacles within the space in which a wireless node attempts to communicate.
    Therefore, data have to be transferred using robust and reliable technologies,
    according to the requirements and challenges of the rural environment. 5.4. Security
    challenges The transfer to an interconnected internet of “smart things” must ensure
    the security, authenticity, confidentiality and privacy of the stakeholders involved
    in this network. In other words, IoT must be secure against external attacks,
    in the perception layer, secure the aggregation of data in the network layer and
    offer specific guarantees that only authorised entities can access and modify
    data in the application layer. Security in IoT is summarised in three requirements:
    authentication, confidentiality and access control (Sicari, Rizzardi, Grieco,
    & Coen-Porisini, 2015). In the perception layer the most common security issues
    include information acquisition security and physical security of the hardware.
    The latter one is quite important in the case of agriculture, since the devices
    can be deployed in open fields and function without surveillance for long periods.
    Due to the distributed nature of IoT and the fact that its devices may be deployed
    in diverse environments, a single security protocol is, usually, not enough (Li,
    2012). RFID security issues are usually related to leakage of information, which
    can unveil the location and other sensitive data. Security countermeasures include
    data encryption, use of blocker tags, tag frequency modification, jamming and,
    finally, tag destruction policy, in other words the physical ending of a tag''s
    life (Matharu, Upadhyay, & Chaudhary, 2014). Sensor nodes differ from RFID tags,
    in the way that sensors are active and relate to dynamic properties of things.
    Therefore, encryption algorithms, key distribution policies, intrusion detection
    mechanisms and security routing policies have to be deployed, always keeping in
    mind the hardware restrictions of smart devices. In the current IoT concept, data
    flow from the end devices to a gateway, which is in charge of uploading these
    data to other infrastructures, such as the cloud. Various security policies for
    sensor terminals exist, including cryptographic algorithms, identity authentication
    mechanisms, data flow control policies, data filtering mechanisms etc. (Li, 2012).
    Moreover, the perception layer requires information acquisition security measures
    too. Wiretapping, tampering, cheating, and replay attacks are just a few of the
    security threats. Therefore, authenticity, confidentiality and data integrity
    have to be ensured during the phase of data acquisition, and key management protocols
    and secure routing policies should be adopted and sensor node authentication policies
    must be leveraged to prevent data access by unauthorised entities (Gou, Yan, Liu,
    & Li, 2013). 5.5. Stack challenges Middleware is another part of IoT presenting
    specific requirements for increased security, since it stands between the network
    and application layers and is responsible both for data processing and communication
    interface between these two layers. Security in the middleware layer requires
    confidentiality and secure data storage. Wireless medium is challenging, when
    it comes to security in transmissions, even for more sophisticated hardware than
    the platforms met in IoT deployments. Therefore, the IoT architecture can easily
    be exposed to risks, such as denial of service attacks, unauthorised access, man-in-the-middle
    attacks, and virus injections which target and affect confidentiality and data
    integrity. Authentication, intrusion detection, key management and negotiation
    mechanisms could possibly provide solutions against the network layer threats.
    Application layer is the top layer in the IoT vision. It is the place where enormous
    flows of data streams end, requiring increased storage and computational resources.
    This is why the application layer is so closely-related with the cloud. The security
    issues here are not very different from the security issues of the cloud itself,
    including data security, privacy, backup and recovery. Control mechanisms need
    to administer the privileges and ownership of data and manage the access rights
    to all, or part of the information, both for physical users and between machines,
    or even organisations. 5.6. Potential value of IoT in agriculture Internet of
    Things is rapidly evolving and many novel applications and services are emerging
    from it. A great amount of research is being conducting towards the integration
    of various heterogeneous systems, the security assurance at various levels of
    IoT and the analytics, which will give a better insight into the “Big Data” in
    order to optimise various business processes. National policy of governments around
    the world for increased production rate of fresh-cut vegetables and meat, at lower
    price, with higher quality standards, as well as, the consumers'' demand for transparency
    in the production cycle and the environmental footprint of the products they buy,
    provide IoT a huge field for development and diffusion. According to Bradley,
    Barbier, and Handler (2013), the estimates from 2013 to 2022 of potential IoT
    value vary significantly, ranging from a minimum of $1 trillion up to more than
    $15 trillion, not including the increased revenues, the benefits of cost reduction
    among companies and industries and the general economic activity due to IoT. Much
    of the added-value of IoT comes from the flexibility and the optimisation and
    precision that it introduces into the production processes of industry and production
    units of all types. Therefore, it is not so risky to forecast that agricultural
    sector processes at all levels will drastically change in the very near future.
    Obviously the economic numbers related to IoT are very big, tempting some very
    serious players to invest in it. Examples, like the recent purchase of Nest Labs,
    a company specialising in IoT for home automation, by Google for $3.2 billion
    in cash and the purchase of Jasper Technologies, developer of and IoT cloud platform,
    by Cisco for $1.4 billion, reveal the great potential of IoT and prove that it
    is highly attractive to big investors and behemoth technological firms. The partnership
    formation, however, is not so trivial. This is due to the fact that the companies
    involved in IoT invest in one or a few aspects of it, because of its wide nature.
    Therefore, sooner or later, they will have to cooperate with each other, putting
    aside any competition, or the notion of who is more important, in order to introduce
    some universal standards in the evolving IoT hype. 6. Conclusion When it comes
    to agriculture, IoT is expected to optimise the production by many means. Farmlands
    and greenhouses are about to move from precision to a micro-precision model of
    agricultural production. Distributed, pervasive computing and precise monitoring
    of the facilities will provide the optimal growing or living conditions for both
    vegetables and animals. Autonomous systems will be able not only to command the
    actuators in the most efficient way, optimising the utility and resource usage,
    but also to control the production in accordance to the market situation, maximising
    the profit and minimising the costs in every possible way. On the other hand,
    food supply chains, equipped with WSN and RFID equipment, will be able to monitor
    each stage in the life of a product, make automatic reasoning, in case of a faulty
    product and increase consumer''s feeling of safety, through a transparent product
    lifecycle information system. All the above is the optimistic approach of the
    IoT integration in agriculture. However, in this concept, plenty of individual
    players are about to participate. First of all, local networks have to be secured
    against interference from other networks, especially as these technologies reach
    their full potential. In a real IoT scenario, most of the players will use different
    equipment, with different technical specifications and/or sensor characteristics.
    Obviously, the interoperability, the filtering and the semantic annotation of
    the data, coming from each producer, has to be made to some extent. This is the
    only way in which the data, coming from vastly heterogeneous sources, can be used
    to optimise a shared decision support or expert system. Security, anonymity and
    control over the access rights on the information is vital for such a system to
    be adopted. In a wider perspective, many of the data related to business/institution
    strategic planning cannot be disclosed or retrieved by non-authorised entities,
    so that the market is safe against unorthodox tactics. References Ahonen et al.,

    \ to provide farmers with a\nlarge amount of information. Precision agriculture\
    \ (PA) is a management strategy that employs\ninformation technology to improve\
    \ quality and production. Utilizing wireless sensor technologies\nand management\
    \ tools can lead to a highly effective, green agriculture. Based on PA management,\n\
    the same routine to a crop regardless of site environments can be avoided. From\
    \ several perspectives,\nﬁeld management can improve PA, including the provision\
    \ of adequate nutrients for crops and the\nwastage of pesticides for the effective\
    \ control of weeds, pests, and diseases. This review outlines the\nrecent applications\
    \ of WSNs in agriculture research as well as classiﬁes and compares various wireless\n\
    communication protocols, the taxonomy of energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting\
    \ techniques for\nWSNs that can be used in agricultural monitoring systems, and\
    \ comparison between early research\nworks on agriculture-based WSNs. The challenges\
    \ and limitations of WSNs in the agricultural domain\nare explored, and several\
    \ power reduction and agricultural management techniques for long-term\nmonitoring\
    \ are highlighted. These approaches may also increase the number of opportunities\
    \ for\nprocessing Internet of Things (IoT) data.\nKeywords: energy-efﬁcient; energy\
    \ harvesting; precision agriculture; wireless communication\ntechnology; WSN\n\
    1. Introduction\nWireless sensor network (WSN) technologies have rapidly developed\
    \ over the years. Ecological\nphenomena in a vast area can be monitored using\
    \ pervasive devices called motes or sensor nodes.\nBattery-powered WSNs comprise\
    \ several sensors, processors, and radio frequency (RF) modules.\nThe sensor nodes\
    \ or motes can communicate wirelessly through a communication link and forward\n\
    their data to a base station or coordinator node by communicating with a gateway.\
    \ The communication\namong sensor nodes depends on the merging of diverse sensors\
    \ from simple (i.e., humidity, pressure,\nand temperature) to complex (i.e., localization,\
    \ tracking, micro-radars, and images), thereby allowing\nWSNs to monitor a wide\
    \ range of surroundings to obtain precise information from the ﬁeld [1].\nAccordingly,\
    \ the sensing, storage, processing, and communication capabilities of sensor nodes\
    \ have\ncontinuously increased [2].\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781; doi:10.3390/s17081781\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n2 of 45\nWSNs have been\
    \ used in different applications, such as military, agriculture, sports, medicine,\
    \ and\nindustry. Agriculture can be considered as one of the most favorable facilities\
    \ for WSNs to improve\nfood crop yields and minimize the burden of farmers [3].\
    \ Several projects have been introduced in\nthe precision agriculture (PA) literature.\
    \ PA aims to prevent the application of the same management\nroutine to a crop\
    \ regardless of site circumstances and to improve ﬁeld management from several\n\
    perspectives. For instance, PA can minimize the wastage of pesticides for the\
    \ effective control of weeds,\npests, and diseases as well as guarantee that crops\
    \ receive an adequate amount of nutrients, thereby\nleading to a highly effective,\
    \ green agriculture. Speciﬁcally, PA is a management strategy that employs\ninformation\
    \ technology to improve agricultural quality and production. PA differs for traditional\n\
    farming in the sense that this process accurately identiﬁes variations and relates\
    \ the spatial data to\nmanagement activities. PA involves ﬁve stages, namely,\
    \ (i) data collection, (ii) diagnosis, (iii) data\nanalysis, (iv) precision ﬁeld\
    \ operation, and (v) evaluation [4].\nWSNs are used as cost-effective processes\
    \ to increase agricultural yield. Accordingly, WSNs have\nbeen used in different\
    \ agricultural applications, such as for monitoring climate and using soil nutrient\n\
    data to forecast the health of crops and the quality of agricultural products.\
    \ Irrigation planning can\nbe predicted using WSNs by observing weather conditions\
    \ (such as temperature and humidity) and\nsoil moisture. Other sensor nodes can\
    \ be added to the existing WSN to improve the parameters of the\nagricultural\
    \ monitoring system and to make the network scalable. However, some challenges\
    \ have\nhindered the agricultural application of WSNs, such as determining optimum\
    \ deployment schemes,\nmeasurement periods, routing protocols, energy efﬁciency,\
    \ cost, communication range, scalability, and\nfault tolerance [5]. For example,\
    \ the scattered deployment of sensor nodes with a long data-gathering\nperiod\
    \ can help extend the network lifetime. However, some factors may challenge the\
    \ selection of the\ndistribution region. When the agricultural ﬁeld faces many\
    \ obstacles, the communication link may\nbe weakened or lost as a result of signal\
    \ attenuation. The sensor nodes in WSNs are supplied from\nthe battery, thereby\
    \ preventing connections to the main supply in the deployment location. Reducing\n\
    power depletion and prolonging battery life are imperative for WSNs considering\
    \ their limited battery\npower. Although the application of WSNs has increased\
    \ constantly over the years, the manufacturing\nof batteries has not developed\
    \ at the same rate [6]. Therefore, WSNs are mainly limited by their\nbatteries\
    \ [7]. Among the aforementioned challenges, this paper focuses on energy management\
    \ and\nhighlights energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting techniques that can be\
    \ used in agriculture.\nTo fulﬁll PA requirements, such as addressing the problems\
    \ resulting from the long distance\nbetween farms and base stations, a mobile\
    \ data connection service can be established by connecting\nunmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ or drones with the base station [4]. Such connection allows the sensor nodes\n\
    to relay their data to the base station within the wide area of the farm ﬁeld.\
    \ However, this solution is\nlimited by the quality of service of WSNs.\nThe main\
    \ contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n(i)\nThe potential of\
    \ using wireless communications protocols or technologies in agriculture was\n\
    investigated, and the technology with the best power consumption and communication\
    \ distance\nwas identiﬁed.\n(ii)\nThe taxonomy of energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting\
    \ techniques was examined to address the\npower consumption problems in agriculture\
    \ and to identify those methods that are most suitable\nfor solving these problems.\n\
    (iii)\nThe existing solutions, applicability, and limitations of applying WSNs\
    \ in agriculture were\nreviewed and compared.\n(iv)\nRecent studies using WSN\
    \ in PA applications based on Internet of Things (IoT) were surveyed\nand compared\
    \ in terms of type of sensors and actuators, IoT end devices, IoT platforms, and\
    \ IoT\napplication layer.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n3 of 45\n2. Wireless Communication\
    \ Technologies for Agriculture\nThis section presents the different wireless protocols\
    \ and standards that are used in agriculture.\nThese wireless technologies are\
    \ also compared to identify the most convenient technology in terms of\npower\
    \ consumption and communication range, where the two metrics are posed challenges\
    \ in current\nsolution of agriculture application [5,8]. IoT is a revolution for\
    \ the future realm where everything\nthat can utilize a connection will be connected.\
    \ Cellular technologies are grown and developed to\nplay a crucial role in the\
    \ IoT realm [9]. Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT) is a new IoT system constructed\nfrom\
    \ current Long Term Evolution (LTE) functionalities. Subsequently, NB-IoT is possible\
    \ to share the\nspectrum of LTE without coexistence problems and to utilize the\
    \ same pieces of equipment, as well\nas it is possible to connect seamlessly into\
    \ the LTE main network. This permits all network facilities\nsuch as security,\
    \ tracking, policy, charging, and authentication to be totally supported [10].\
    \ The design\ngoals of NB-IoT cover high coverage area, extended battery life\
    \ (i.e., 10 years), high network size\n(52,000 devices/channel/cell), and low-cost\
    \ devices [10,11]. However, in the near future, NB-IoT\ntechnologies, such as\
    \ Long Range radio (LoRa) will take place in agricultural applications due to\
    \ low\npower consumption and preferably used when the agricultural information\
    \ are to be transmitted over\nlong distances.\n2.1. ZigBee Wireless Protocol\n\
    ZigBee wireless protocol is considered one of the best candidate technologies\
    \ for the agriculture\nand farming domains. Given its low duty cycle, ZigBee is\
    \ considered appropriate for PA applications,\nsuch as irrigation supervision\
    \ [12], water quality management, and fertilizer and pesticide control,\nall of\
    \ which require a cyclic information update. Based on this technology, the sensor\
    \ nodes in the\nagricultural ﬁeld can communicate with the router or coordinator\
    \ node over a long range (i.e., 100 m)\nwhen XBee Series 2 is used. ZigBee can\
    \ also reduce the communication distance by up to 30 m for\nindoor conditions\
    \ (i.e., greenhouses) [13]. The number of deployed sensor and router nodes will\
    \ be\nincreased to cover the entire ﬁeld area under surveillance. Some studies\
    \ have employed Zigbee for PA.\nFor instance, ZigBee was used to investigate the\
    \ effect of signal strength on node spacing, base station\nantenna height, and\
    \ leaf density [14]. In [14], three experiments were conducted in palm orchards\
    \ in\nto evaluate a signal propagation model based on the received signal strength\
    \ indicator (RSSI) of the\nZigBee wireless protocol. Through their experiments,\
    \ the authors concluded that the wireless channel\npropagation model must be determined\
    \ before deploying the sensor nodes in palm orchards to obtain\nrobust signal\
    \ strength characteristics. A path loss model in a mango greenhouse was investigated\n\
    based on the ZigBee wireless protocol [15].\nA cattle-localization-system-based\
    \ ZigBee WSN was also applied in a grazing ﬁeld [16]. Instead of\nrequiring additional\
    \ hardware, ZigBee relies on link quality indication (LQI) to measure distance.\
    \ The\nZigBee protocol achieves cattle localization at a low power consumption\
    \ and minimum cost. The key\nparameters of greenhouse climate (i.e., humidity,\
    \ temperature, CO2, and solar radiation) are considered\nin [17] to ensure the\
    \ comfortable growth of plants with 22% energy savings and 33% water usage.\n\
    ZigBee and Global System for Mobile communication/General Packet Radio Service\
    \ (GSM/GPRS)\ntechnologies were used to monitor and control the climate condition\
    \ of greenhouses [17]. The ZigBee\nwireless protocol has also been used to monitor\
    \ animal behavior (e.g., walking, grazing, lying down,\nand standing) [18]. ZigBee\
    \ was also adopted in [18] to overcome the high power consumption and\nunreliability\
    \ issues in mobile ad hoc WSNs.\nA WSN-based greenhouse that uses ZigBee star\
    \ topology is merged with artiﬁcial intelligence\n(i.e., fuzzy logic controller)\
    \ in [19]. The ZigBee wireless protocol is adopted to preserve energy by\nswitching\
    \ between active and sleep states. Thus, power consumption can be minimized, and\
    \ the\nbattery lifetime of sensor nodes can be extended. ZigBee is currently applied\
    \ in smart beehives [20],\norange orchards [21], dairy healthcare monitoring of\
    \ cows in pastures and barns [22], automation in\nirrigation [23], greenhouse\
    \ monitoring systems [24,25], and livestock monitoring [26]. As a universal\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n4 of 45\nstandard for WSNs, the ZigBee protocol was used\
    \ in several agricultural applications because of its\nlow power consumption,\
    \ low cost, self-forming characteristics, and suitable communication range.\n\
    2.2. Bluetooth (BT) Wireless Protocol\nThe BT standard has been utilized to establish\
    \ a communication link between movable and\nportable devices, such as laptops,\
    \ over a short distance of up to 10 m. Given its pervasive nature\nand availability\
    \ in most mobile devices, BT has been employed to satisfy multi-level agricultural\n\
    requirements [5].\nWeather information, soil moisture, sprinkler position, and\
    \ temperature are\nmonitored remotely using Global Positioning System (GPS) and\
    \ BT technologies. The proposed\nsystem in [27] was developed for irrigation application\
    \ to increase ﬁeld productivity and conserve\nwater. The irrigation application\
    \ proposed in [28] collects ﬁeld information in real time via the BT\nwireless\
    \ communication protocol. Several software and hardware were developed in [29]\
    \ to monitor\nthe relative humidity and temperature in greenhouses based on BT.\
    \ The BT module was employed in\nintegrated control method [30] to control the\
    \ irrigation system in greenhouses based on soil and weather\ninformation, and\
    \ this technology improved the leaf number, height, dry weight, and fresh weight\n\
    of red and romaine lettuce in greenhouses. Result of estimation for water usage\
    \ and electricity also\nimproved by 90% based on integrated control method using\
    \ BT technology relative to the traditional\nmethod (i.e., timer control strategy).\
    \ Given its low energy consumption, wide availability, and ease of\nuse for farmers,\
    \ smartphone-based BT has been employed in different agricultural applications\
    \ [31–35],\nsuch as controlling irrigation systems, monitoring soil and weather\
    \ conditions, and controlling the use\nof fertilizers and pesticides.\n2.3. WiFi\
    \ Wireless Protocol\nWiFi is currently the most extensively utilized wireless\
    \ technology available in portable devices,\nincluding tablets, smartphones, laptops,\
    \ and desktops. WiFi has a suitable communication distance of\nabout 20 m and\
    \ 100 m in indoor and outdoor environments, respectively. In PA applications,\
    \ WiFi\nextends diverse architectures by connecting several types of devices via\
    \ an ad hoc network. WiFi and\n3G wireless technologies were employed in [36]\
    \ to estimate the agricultural applications of mobile\nphones. Remote access and\
    \ short message services have also been used for controlling and monitoring\n\
    protected crops. In [37], agricultural data, such as soil temperature, soil moisture,\
    \ weather temperature\nand humidity, sunlight intensity, and CO2, were stored\
    \ in a gateway before they were transmitted\nto the server computer over a WiFi\
    \ network. A Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11g)-based smart WSN is proposed\nfor agricultural\
    \ monitoring in [38]. The proposed system consists of three nodes: sensor, router,\
    \ and\nserver. The climate conditions of the greenhouse or agricultural ﬁeld,\
    \ such as humidity, temperature,\nair pressure, light, water level, and soil moisture,\
    \ are monitored. The said work attempts to lower cost,\nminimize wiring connections,\
    \ and enhance the mobility and ﬂexibility of the sensing points in WSN.\nHowever,\
    \ the energy consumption of the proposed system is extremely high at 42.17 J/h.\n\
    Given that WiFi requires much power [5], long communication time, and huge data\
    \ payload [26].\nWiFi technology is not preferable for agricultural applications\
    \ in spite of the fact that a Wi-Fi server\nprevents data losses by adopting data\
    \ redundancy techniques. In addition, WiFi cannot be employed\nfor multi-hope\
    \ applications and inﬂuenced by number of users and the signal intensity; thereby,\n\
    it is inappropriate for agriculture WSNs. Moreover, the WiFi nodes listen all\
    \ the time, so power\nconsumption will increase [39].\n2.4. GPRS/3G/4G Technology\n\
    General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a packet data service for GSM-based cellular\
    \ phones.\nGPRS frequently experiences variable delays and throughputs, and such\
    \ technology depends on the\nvolume of consumers that share the same communication\
    \ channels and resources. Gutiérrez et al. [40]\nused the GPRS module and WSN\
    \ to develop an automatic crop irrigation system based on the\ninformation collected\
    \ by temperature and soil moisture sensors installed at the root zone of plants,\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n5 of 45\nand considered this system a cost-effective and\
    \ practical solution for improving water quality in\nPA. A drip irrigation process\
    \ was evaluated in [41] by measuring soil moisture. A prototype system\nwas also\
    \ developed based on a data management server and a WSN-GPRS gateway. WSN-GPRS\n\
    gateway acts as a bridge between WSN and GPRS where the data from the WSN are\
    \ transferred to a\ndata management center. Navarro-Hellín et al. [42] equipped\
    \ various wireless nodes with GPRS to\nmeasure and transmit soil, plant, and atmosphere\
    \ information. The wireless nodes have unlimited\nautonomy because of their independent\
    \ nature and use of solar energy. Different sensors may transmit\ninformation\
    \ to a remote location via a GPRS network for further analysis by using tablets,\
    \ mobile\nphones, or computers. All agriculture sensors are interfaced to the\
    \ sensor board to obtain agricultural\ninformation. Such information is transmitted\
    \ to the remote server for further analysis through the\nGPRS-board, which depends\
    \ on a GSM/GPRS mobile network.\n2.5. Long Range Radio (LoRa) Protocol\nLoRa is\
    \ introduced by the LoRa Alliance as a protocol stack for low power and wide area\
    \ Internet\nof Things (IoT) communication technologies that are associated with\
    \ indoor transmission [43]. The\nbasic network architecture of a LoRaWAN consists\
    \ of LoRa end devices, LoRa gateways, and a LoRa\nnetwork server. The LoRa end\
    \ device communicates with gateways that employ LoRa with LoRaWAN.\nLoRa gateways\
    \ pass raw LoRaWAN packets from the end devices to a LoRa network server with\n\
    a high throughput based on the backhaul interface, which is typically 3G or Ethernet.\
    \ Accordingly,\nLoRa gateways act as a bidirectional communication or protocol\
    \ adapter with the LoRa network\nserver. In this case, the LoRa network server\
    \ takes charge of decoding the data packets transmitted by\nthe LoRa devices and\
    \ creating the frames that would be directed back to the devices. LoRa offers\
    \ a\nbidirectional solution that matches machine-to-machine (M2M) WiFi or cellular\
    \ technologies. LoRa\npresents a cost-effective method for linking batteries or\
    \ mobile devices to the network or to end devices.\nThe LoRa wireless protocol\
    \ was used in [44] to monitor bee colonies in rural areas and to ensure a\ncommunication\
    \ between the bee node and the local server that is located in a remote location.\
    \ The\nsoil moisture and temperature, air temperature and humidity, and light\
    \ intensity inside greenhouses\nwere also monitored using different sensors, microcontrollers,\
    \ and the LoRa wireless protocol [8]. The\nLoRa gateway collects data from LoRa\
    \ nodes to construct the topology of a star network, and may\ncommunicate with\
    \ a cloud server over a long communication range and with high scalability.\n\
    LoRa was recently utilized in several agriculture research projects developed\
    \ by the Libelium\nCompany (Zaragoza, Spain) [45], such as improving kiwi production\
    \ based on a smart irrigation system\n(Italy), monitoring of green areas by using\
    \ a smart garden system (Spain), improving fertilization\nmethods of corn yields\
    \ (Italy), improving production of banana yields (Colombia), increasing\ntobacco\
    \ crops by controlling the climate condition (Italy), saving water through a smart\
    \ irrigation\nsystem (Barcelona), monitoring of vineyard crops (Spain), and monitoring\
    \ of diseases that affect\nvineyards (Switzerland).\n2.6. SigFox Protocol\nSigFox\
    \ is an ultra-narrowband wireless cellular network [43] with low data rate applications,\n\
    thereby making this technology appropriate for IoT and machine-type communications\
    \ systems.\nSigFox has been used in different applications, including telephone,\
    \ security, mobile, broadband, and\ntelevision. The SigFox network was used in\
    \ [46,47] to construct a geolocation system that localizes\nanimals in mountain\
    \ pastures throughout the summer. A system was proposed in [46] to help farmers\n\
    locate their cattle and enhance their production. The importance of power consumption\
    \ analyses was\nhighlighted in [47], especially when the cattle are located in\
    \ high mountainous areas.\n2.7. Performance Comparison of Wireless Communication\
    \ Protocols\nTable 1 compares the aforementioned wireless communication protocols\
    \ or technologies relative\nto different parameters, including power consumption,\
    \ communication range, data rate, cost, system\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n6 of 45\n\
    complexity, and other parameters. The challenges in agricultural applications\
    \ may be developed from\nthe selection of the deployment range. For instance,\
    \ the transmitted signal by the sensor node is\nattenuated when the agriculture\
    \ ﬁeld is separated by obstacles. Power consumption is considered as\nanother\
    \ limitation in the WSN design in agricultural applications [5]. The ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol was\ndesigned to run with a suitable communication range and low power\
    \ consumption. LoRa and SigFox\nare considered to work with low power consumption\
    \ and long radio range. Accordingly, the power\nconsumption and communication\
    \ distance of the above technologies have been assessed as follows.\nZigbee and\
    \ Bluetooth low energy (BLE) are designed for battery-powered devices.\nThese\n\
    technologies conserve power through low duty cycling and enter sleep mode to extend\
    \ the battery\nlifetime. Classic BT, WiFi, GPRS, LoRa, and SigFox have a higher\
    \ power consumption than ZigBee.\nAlthough ZigBee has a shorter communication\
    \ range than LoRa, SigFox, and GPRS, this range may be\nextended with a router\
    \ node to overcome the node deployment limitations in agricultural applications.\n\
    BLE outperforms ZigBee in terms of power consumption, but this wireless protocol\
    \ is limited in\nagricultural applications because of its short communication\
    \ distance of 10 m, as reported in [48].\nZigBee also has a higher network elasticity\
    \ than BT, thereby permitting various topologies. Given the\nlarge number of nodes\
    \ (more than 65,000) in the ZigBee network, the ZigBee technology can be used\n\
    to cover a wide agricultural. Accordingly, the ZigBee wireless protocol has been\
    \ adopted in many\nagriculture studies [5,49–53]. One of these studies [5] prefers\
    \ to utilize ZigBee in farming domains and\nagricultural applications owing to\
    \ its energy-efﬁcient, reliable, and low-cost wireless protocol.\nThe LoRa wireless\
    \ protocol covers a large communication area with low power consumption.\nTherefore,\
    \ it can be suitably deployed in vast agricultural ﬁelds. The network size of\
    \ the LoRa protocol\nis limited by its duty cycle, where a 1% duty cycle can lead\
    \ to a maximum communication time of 36 s\nper hour for each end device [54].\
    \ In addition, LoRa gateways have a limited message capacity of less\nthan 100\
    \ messages per minute because of the unplanned deployment of LoRa gateways in\
    \ urban areas,\nthereby interfering with low power wireless area networks, such\
    \ as SigFox. Therefore, increasing the\nnumber of gateways can challenge the infrastructure\
    \ of the LoRa network [54]. Moreover, the LoRa\ntechnology is complex and has\
    \ sizable hardware implementations [55].\nSigFox has an extremely low data rate\
    \ (100 bps) and slow transmission time (10 s for 10 bytes)\ncompared with ZigBee\
    \ and LoRa [56]. SigFox supports star topology supervised by a centralized sever\n\
    that manages connectivity between devices and the base stations, whereas the LoRa\
    \ supports wide\narea network based on star-to-star topology creating a bridge\
    \ of LoRa gateways. Given that data rate\nand transmission time are both critical\
    \ issue in any communication system, SigFox cannot be widely\nused for agricultural\
    \ applications. Moreover, this technology does not support the collision avoidance\n\
    scheme, thereby affecting the network because several M2M devices may be operated\
    \ in the same\narea. Moreover, SigFox has a limited reliability because of its\
    \ one-way communication (without an\nacknowledgment signal) and low received power.\
    \ However, both the LoRa and SigFox infrastructures\nare still in progress. Ali\
    \ et al. further discuss the limitations of these protocols [56].\nFrom the above\
    \ discussion and the comparison results presented in Table 1 and Figure 1\nand\
    \ as will be shown in Tables 2–8 the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols have been\
    \ identiﬁed\nas the most suitable wireless protocols for agricultural applications\
    \ because of their low power\nconsumption, communication range (acceptable for\
    \ ZigBee and long for LoRa), small size, easy\nnetwork implementation, simplicity,\
    \ low latency (for ZigBee), scalability, and network size.\nSensors 2017, 17,\
    \ 1781\n7 of 45\n \ninfrastructures are still in progress. Ali et al. further\
    \ discuss the limitations of these protocols [56].  \nFrom the above discussion\
    \ and the comparison results presented in Table 1 and Figure 1 and as \nwill be\
    \ shown in Tables 2–8 the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols have been identified\
    \ as the most \nsuitable wireless protocols for agricultural applications because\
    \ of their low power consumption, \ncommunication range (acceptable for ZigBee\
    \ and long for LoRa), small size, easy network \nimplementation, simplicity, low\
    \ latency (for ZigBee), scalability, and network size. \n \nFigure 1. Different\
    \ wireless technologies in terms of power consumption and communication \ndistance.\
    \ \nFigure 1. Different wireless technologies in terms of power consumption and\
    \ communication distance.\nPA using sensors, actuator, processor, wireless transceiver,\
    \ and other information technologies,\npotentially permits manufacturers to computerize\
    \ site-speciﬁc management for automated agriculture.\nIn terms of precision, the\
    \ considered wireless protocols for agricultural applications have improved\n\
    the agriculture domain. Precision irrigation is frequently regarded as optimizing\
    \ irrigation accuracy\ndue to its ability to control the optimum amount of water\
    \ and irrigation time. The water savings\nof 90% (based on ZigBee), 33% (based\
    \ on ZigBee), 50% (based on Bluetooth), and 90% (based on\nBluetooth) were achieved\
    \ for precision irrigation systems relative to traditional irrigation systems\
    \ in\nresearch [17,28,30,40], respectively. Animal behavior, such as laying down,\
    \ standing, grazing, walking,\nand other modes, was monitored in [18] using ZigBee\
    \ wireless protocol. The authors found that\nlaying down and grazing could be\
    \ improved by 83.5% compared with the ﬁndings from similar\nstudies. In another\
    \ study that has adopted a proposed algorithm that depended on the ZigBee wireless\n\
    protocol [20], an accuracy rate of 95.4% was expected for the proposed algorithm\
    \ to monitor the\nhoney bee and the agricultural and environmental aspects. In\
    \ [23], the automation of the irrigation\nsystem based on ZigBee saved the system\
    \ cost between 1.24% and 6.72% relative to the entire cost\nof the water user\
    \ associations, with energy savings of 2.05 to 8.21% and water savings of 0.71\
    \ to\n6.46%. The proposed model in [35] utilized a smartphone platform (based\
    \ on Bluetooth and GSM\ntechnologies) and permitted three types of irrigation\
    \ systems. The efﬁciency factors were improved\nby 90% for subsurface drip type\
    \ and 85% and 75% for high- and low-pressure overhead sprinkler\ntypes, respectively,\
    \ to compute for drift and evaporation before the water droplets approached the\n\
    soil. 3G technology was adopted by Libelium based on Waspmote wireless sensor\
    \ devices to monitor\nthe vineyards in Northwest Spain [57]. Phytosanitary treatments,\
    \ such as fungicides and fertilizers,\nwere minimized by 20% and growing yields\
    \ were enhanced by 15% based on PA. In [8], LoRa wireless\nprotocol was considered\
    \ to monitor the agriculture environments with 90% power efﬁciency. The cost\n\
    of pumping and water for precision irrigation system in green areas was reduced\
    \ by 30% based on\nSigFox wireless protocol [58].\nThe preceding survey for different\
    \ agricultural applications revealed that PA can be achieved\nin terms of water\
    \ savings, animal behavior, accuracy, power efﬁciency, and reducing system cost\n\
    for various wireless protocols. Consequently, agriculture can be improved based\
    \ on agricultural\nautomation systems compared with traditional agriculture systems.\n\

    \ may operate at different energy states. Therefore, the lifespan of a sensor\
    \ node is the\ntime consumed to exhaust its batteries under a sustainable operation\
    \ threshold.\nNumerous scholars have developed power reduction techniques to provide\
    \ sensor nodes an\ninﬁnite lifespan. This section reviews several power reduction\
    \ techniques of WSNs that can be used in\nagricultural applications. The purposes,\
    \ wireless protocols, ﬁndings, advantages, and limitations of\neach technique\
    \ are also discussed.\n3.1.1. Sleep/Wake Strategy\nWireless transceivers consume\
    \ a signiﬁcant amount of power relative to processors. The energy\nof the wireless\
    \ nodes is mostly dissipated during the reception and transmission processes.\
    \ The radio\nof sensor nodes can enter sleep mode via the sleep/wake strategy\
    \ to reduce the power consumption\nof the RF components of WSNs. No data communication\
    \ occurs during the sleep mode. The sensor\nnodes wake up to collect and transmit\
    \ data within a certain period and then return to sleep mode\nto conserve energy.\
    \ In agricultural applications, the sleep/wake strategy is implemented via (i)\
    \ duty\ncycling, (ii) medium-access control (MAC) protocols, and (iii) topology\
    \ control.\nDuty cycle is proposed in several studies to lower the power consumption\
    \ for different agricultural\napplications based on WSN. Zhang et al. [69] proposed\
    \ a WSN-based system to monitor soil moisture\nand analyzed the temporal and spatial\
    \ variability of soil moisture for variable irrigation. To reduce the\npower consumption\
    \ of the soil sensor nodes, the soil moisture sensors were always in sleep mode\
    \ and\nactivated only when data were to be collected. Million et al. [70] designed\
    \ a WSN for PA in Malawi\nand called it WiPAM. This system was intended to automate\
    \ irrigation and implement an irrigation\nmanagement system (IMS). The authors\
    \ investigated soil moisture variability. The sensor nodes\nwere homogeneous,\
    \ and each was composed of a ZigBee end device (ZED) and a ZigBee coordinator\n\
    (ZC). In the star topology, three sensors nodes were conﬁgured as ZED (in ﬁeld-nodes)\
    \ and one as a\ngateway node. Another node was conﬁgured as ZC for aggregating\
    \ data and actuating the irrigation\nvalves. The power source to sustain the operation\
    \ of the network was solar power. This approach\nwas complemented by an energy-efﬁcient\
    \ management approach. In other words, sensor nodes went\nto sleep when idle and\
    \ woke up to transmit data when required. The irrigation valves opened or\nclosed\
    \ depending on the values stored in the coordinator node. Ouadjaout et al. [71]\
    \ presented an\nenergy-efﬁcient WSN for soil moisture monitoring in an irrigation\
    \ system. The new platform, DZ50,\nconsists of an RFM12b transceiver and an ATmega328P\
    \ microcontroller. This platform consumes very\nlow power, and much energy can\
    \ be saved in sleep mode, in which the transceiver goes inactive (sleep\nmode)\
    \ for long periods. Comparison showed that the performance of DZ50 is better than\
    \ that of\nTelosB and MicaZ. Speciﬁcally, the battery lifetime of DZ50 is seven\
    \ times that of TelosB and MicaZ\nbased on a 10 s sampling period. Monitoring\
    \ of environmental conditions, such as wind direction,\nwind speed, humidity,\
    \ temperature, conductivity, rain level, pH, and water level, in crop ﬁelds was\n\
    presented in [72]. A solar cell was used to power several sensor nodes deployed\
    \ at a distance of 500 m\nto 5 km. WSNs based on IEEE 802.15.4 (C1120 transceiver)\
    \ and GPRS/3G were adopted to transmit the\nrural environments to the base station.\
    \ Energy was saved through low duty cycling (3.3%) for the RF\ntransceiver; the\
    \ saved energy is equivalent to 30 s of wake up time every 15 min. In addition,\
    \ a 2-watt\nsolar cell was used to supply power to the overall system, whose total\
    \ average power consumption\nwas 207 mW.\nMAC protocols were also proposed in\
    \ previous research on agriculture WSNs [39,73–76].\nSudha et al. [39] proposed\
    \ an energy-efﬁcient TDMA-based algorithm for wireless sensor\ncommunications\
    \ in an automatic irrigation system. Their experiment involved a header node that\n\
    collected data directly from all the nodes in the ﬁeld and passed these data to\
    \ the base station (BS).\nThis network arrangement was a star single-hop topology.\
    \ These techniques attain power savings\nof 10% with a high communication distance\
    \ of 1 km between the sensor node and the base station.\nHowever, when this distance\
    \ increases, the power consumption also increases. López et al. [75]\nproposed\
    \ a WSN for monitoring horticultural yields, which are disseminated among small\
    \ plots\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n11 of 45\nscattered at a communication distance\
    \ of 10 km. The air temperature and soil moisture are collected\nduring a 10-week\
    \ period. The authors adopted the MAC protocol and star topology to conserve the\n\
    power consumption of the sensor nodes that used the IEEE 802.15.4 standard based\
    \ on the CC2420\ntransceiver. The lifetimes of the soil moisture and air temperature\
    \ sensor nodes are 1024 days and\n222 days, respectively, utilizing a battery\
    \ that delivers 2700 mAh.\nThe topology protocol scheme can be used in agricultural\
    \ monitoring WSNs to modify the network\ntopology according to the application\
    \ requirements, thereby reducing the number of active nodes in\na network. Some\
    \ nodes in the network can enter sleep mode to prolong the network lifetime when\n\
    they are not sensing the same area of interest. Aneeth and Jayabarathi [77] implemented\
    \ Ad hoc\nOn-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocols\
    \ over a different\ntopology of ZigBee WSN (i.e., cluster topology, random topology,\
    \ star topology with gateway based\non two cases; inside and outside) in simulation\
    \ environments by using the OPNET software (Riverbed,\nSan Francisco, CA, USA).\
    \ Twenty soil moisture sensor nodes and one gateway node were distributed\nin\
    \ a farmland with a dimension of 100 × 100 m2. Each node sends information about\
    \ the soil moisture\nto the gateway node through the ZigBee wireless protocol.\
    \ The gateway node passes the information to\nthe controlling system to control\
    \ the irrigation valve system. Their study showed that the star topology\nusing\
    \ DSR protocol reduces the power consumption of the WSN because it has less routing\
    \ overhead\ncompared with AODV protocol. Table 2 shows the comparison of power\

    \ power is mostly dissipated in the RF components of WSNs than\nin data processing\
    \ units, such as microcontrollers and microprocessors [80]. A number of scholars\n\
    have applied various radio optimization schemes or techniques, including (i) transmission\
    \ power\ncontrol (TPC), (ii) modulation scheme, and (iii) cognitive radio, to\
    \ reduce the power consumption\nof the RF components of agriculture sensor nodes.\
    \ In the TPC scheme, the sensor nodes modify the\ntransmitted power to save energy,\
    \ stimulate avoiding interference, and establish a communication\nlink [81]. TPC\
    \ can be used in the agricultural ﬁeld [82,83], where the RF transmitted power\
    \ of the\nsensor nodes can be modiﬁed to reduce their power consumption based\
    \ on the measured distance\nbetween the sink node and the sensor nodes. Sahota\
    \ et al. [82] have investigated the application of\nTPC in reducing the power\
    \ consumption of the sensor nodes in precision agriculture-based WSNs.\nSeveral\
    \ power levels and different receiver sensitivity levels are considered to perform\
    \ the said process.\nThe network layers and MAC protocol in a WSN (based on CC1110)\
    \ for the agriculture domain are\nadopted to further lower the power consumption\
    \ of the sensor node. Results show that the power\nsaving that employs multiple\
    \ modes of transmitted power can be improved by approximately 10%\nrelative to\
    \ the traditional mode. By contrast, Kamarudin et al. [83] prolonged the lifetime\
    \ of the sensor\nnode by more than 8.5% by modifying the transmitted power of\
    \ the CC2420 communication device.\nA cognitive radio is an intelligent wireless\
    \ communication network [84] in which the wireless\ncommunication channel in the\
    \ spectrum band can be selected efﬁciently [85]. The transmission metrics\n(e.g.,\
    \ transmitted power, carrier frequency, and modulation scheme) can be adjusted\
    \ accordingly.\nA cognitive radio requires more energy than conventional devices\
    \ do because it includes sophisticated\nand complex functions [86]. Therefore,\
    \ an energy-efﬁcient cognitive radio network poses challenges,\nespecially with\
    \ regard to the use of battery energy. In wireless communication, the electromagnetic\n\
    spectrum is fully occupied, with several bands being partially used or unused.\
    \ This situation supports\nthe utilization of a cognitive radio, in which spectrum\
    \ holes can be utilized.\nSabri et al. [19] fused fuzzy logic control (FLC) with\
    \ a ZigBee wireless sensor actor network\n(WSAN), which can sense the surroundings\
    \ and respond in ideal performance without interference\nfrom agricultural crops.\
    \ FLC assists the specialists in managing complex systems more compared with\n\
    traditional control methods, which are ineffective in terms of ﬂexibility, energy,\
    \ productivity, and labor\ninterference. Two signiﬁcant greenhouse environment\
    \ parameters (i.e., humidity and temperature)\nare monitored during daytime and\
    \ nighttime. The results show that the intelligent technique-based\nFLC can signiﬁcantly\
    \ improve the WSAN lifespan. Therefore, the WSAN can work for 14 years with a\n\
    210 mAh battery power based on the FLC merged with WSAN.\nThe power consumption\
    \ of networks can be directly affected by the modulation scheme [87]. The\nmodulation\
    \ parameters can be adjusted to their optimal values to preserve the minimum power\n\
    consumption of radio modules. Anane et al. [88] investigated the Frequency-shift\
    \ keying (FSK) and\nMinimum-shift keying (MSK) modulation strategies to minimize\
    \ the total power consumption of\nthe sensor node required to transmit given data\
    \ packets. Through their extensive study, the authors\nconcluded that MSK outperforms\
    \ FSK in terms of power consumption. However, several modulation\nschemes cannot\
    \ be used in the ZigBee wireless protocol that operates at 2.4 GHz because this\
    \ protocol\nsupports a single modulation scheme. Speciﬁcally, the ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol works with offset\nquadrature phase-shift keying (OQPSK) [89]. Table\

    \ Data Mitigation\nData mitigation presents another power consumption solution\
    \ for agriculture WSNs to reduce the\namount of data transmitted from source nodes\
    \ to destination nodes. Data mitigation can be achieved\nvia (i) data gathering,\
    \ (ii) data comparison, (iii) data rate, and (iv) data-driven techniques.\nData\
    \ gathering can extend the lifetime of sensor nodes in WSNs by minimizing redundant\
    \ data\ntransmission. In different applications of agriculture WSNs including\
    \ environment observation, the\nsensed data of the neighboring nodes may spatially\
    \ be associated. In this case, data combination\npresents an important method\
    \ for reducing the amount of redundant data, reducing the number\nof transmissions,\
    \ and minimizing the power consumption of the nodes in the network [90]. Data\n\
    gathering also reduces latency by minimizing data trafﬁc and improving the delay\
    \ between the sink\nand sensor nodes; after reducing the number of communications,\
    \ this approach can improve the\nexploitation of bandwidth [91]. Data merging\
    \ can be accomplished along a route starting from sensor\nnodes to sink nodes.\
    \ The nodes in a route can rebroadcast only the maximum, minimum, or average\n\
    amount of received data. The design of an energy-efﬁcient WSN-based data-gathering\
    \ scheme poses a\nsigniﬁcant challenge because this scheme must ensure a trade-off\
    \ among power consumption, latency,\nsecurity, data accuracy, and fault tolerance.\n\
    Gathering data in agricultural applications, including humidity, weather, temperature,\
    \ and soil\nmoisture, can minimize the power consumption of environment sensor\
    \ nodes by spatially correlating\nthe ﬁeld and redundant data of the sensor nodes\
    \ when the temperature does not change signiﬁcantly [1],\nespecially during nighttime.\
    \ For example, if the microcontroller of the temperature sensor node\nmeasures\
    \ the same temperature value for extended hours, then the sensor node sends the\
    \ temperature\nvalue every four hours to reduce power consumption. Merging the\
    \ temperature and humidity\nsensors into a single sensor may also reduce the power\
    \ consumption, size, and system complexity.\nAzaza et al. [17] integrated climate\
    \ condition parameters (i.e., temperature, CO2, humidity, and\nilluminance sensors)\
    \ inside a greenhouse and observed a comfortable growth of plants while saving\n\
    water resources and energy. The greenhouse was equipped with environment control\
    \ devices, such as\nventilation system, fogging system for humidiﬁcation, and\
    \ electrical heaters. A smart system based on\nfuzzy logic control correlated\
    \ humidity and temperature measurements is implemented to improve\nthe fogging\
    \ system operation. In that way, the power consumption of the fogging system can\
    \ be\nsigniﬁcantly reduced. In addition, the system was improved by a wireless\
    \ data observing platform\n(STM 32/F4 microcontroller and Virtex V FPGA board)\
    \ for logging and data routing, which provides\ndata access in real time. The\
    \ suggested control system based on fuzzy logic control was experimentally\nimplemented\
    \ and validated. The results revealed that the total energy and water usage decreased\
    \ by\n22% and 33%, respectively.\nMusaazi et al. [92] introduced a data caching\
    \ algorithm (DCAL) that optimizes the sleep/wake up\nperiods of ZigBee WSNs to\
    \ achieve low energy consumption and latency in PA application. In WSNs,\ndata\
    \ are collected from the source nodes and routed to the sink node; from the sink\
    \ node, the data\nare sent to the Internet. Reducing the transmission of duplicated\
    \ sensed data reduces the power\nconsumption. Energy conservation is paramount\
    \ during the communication phase to prolong the\nlifetime of sensor nodes. The\
    \ main method utilized to conserve energy involves switching off the nodes’\n\
    transceiver when they are not transmitting nor receiving packets. Additionally,\
    \ the data-gathering\nmethod for agriculture WSNs has been investigated in [93].\
    \ The proposed system includes ZigBee\nwireless sensor nodes, customized farming\
    \ personal digital assistants (PDAs), and a host PC. Each\nsensor node contains\
    \ four sensors to identify ﬁve agricultural ﬁeld parameters: soil temperature,\
    \ soil\nmoisture, environmental humidity, soil electrical conductivity, and environmental\
    \ temperature. The\nPDA combines the ZigBee coordinator node, GPRS module, and\
    \ GPS module. The ZigBee WSN\ngathers farming data and obtains GPS information\
    \ for each sensor node. It then passes the data to the\nhost PC through GPRS.\
    \ The experimental results show that the battery power of the sensor nodes can\n\
    be saved based on the data-gathering scheme.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n16 of 45\n\
    Data compression is a useful method for deploying sensor nodes with restricted\
    \ energy resources.\nInformation encoding can be performed in sensor nodes, whereas\
    \ information decoding can be\nperformed in sink nodes. Using compression techniques\
    \ to reduce the size of information that the\nsink nodes transmit over wireless\
    \ channels may also reduce the power consumption and extend the\nbattery life\
    \ of the sensor nodes. One study has applied data compression approaches to reduce\
    \ the\npower consumption for auto-irrigation system which based on CC1000 RF module\
    \ [41]. Based on this\nmethod, the battery of the sensor node can be extended\
    \ to 359 days.\nThe data-driven power reduction technique aims to reduce the amount\
    \ of sampled data by\nconserving the sensing accuracy to an appropriate level\
    \ for a speciﬁed application [94]. Thereby,\nthe amount of data to be transmitted\
    \ to the sink nodes can be minimized. Therefore, this technique\ncan reduce the\
    \ power consumption of agriculture WSNs and extend their battery life. A data-driven\n\
    algorithm is considered by Lerdsuwan and Phunchongharn [95] to solve the energy\
    \ consumption\nproblem of the sensor node in PA with low complexity and maintain\
    \ the transmission rate. Their\nexperiment reveals that their proposed algorithm\
    \ has higher energy efﬁciency than the ESPIN and\nSPIN algorithms in [96,97] by\
    \ 36.84% and 81.53%, respectively.\nThe data rate of RF transceivers can be adjusted\
    \ in the physical layer of a wireless protocol to\nreduce the power consumption\
    \ of the sensor node. Davis et al. [98] investigated the low battery\ncondition\
    \ of a sensor node to attain prolonged battery life for separate wireless sensor\
    \ nodes that\ncan preserve sampling suitability and reliability in communicating\
    \ accurate data. Different sensors,\nsuch as those for soil moisture, sap ﬂow,\
    \ and soil water, were examined to study the effect of sensing\ndebility due to\
    \ low battery voltage. The comparison of the data sampling rate of these sensors\
    \ shows\nthat sap ﬂow measurement is the best option for agricultural WSN. This\
    \ ﬁnding is attributed to the\nlow error obtained when the sampling interval increased\
    \ to 15 min while maintaining measurement\naccuracy. Table 4 shows the comparison\
    \ of power reduction technique based on data mitigation schemes\nfor previous\

    \ power reduction scheme for agriculture WSNs to minimize\nthe path between sensor\
    \ nodes and sink node, thereby the power consumption of the WSN is reduced.\n\
    Routing protocol can be performed via (i) sink mobility, (ii) multi-path routing,\
    \ (iii) cluster architecture,\nand (iv) routing metric.\nSink mobility was adopted\
    \ in previous research [99,100]. Mathur et al. [99] proposed a novel\nmechanism\
    \ that adopts unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to gather data from forest regions\
    \ instead\nof classical sensing from nodes deployed in WSN. The proposed method\
    \ enables the UAV to collect\ndata from WSN in harsh terrain and transmit it to\
    \ the base station situated far from the sensing area.\nTherefore, the multi-hop\
    \ transmission between cluster heads can be completely avoided, and the\ncommunication\
    \ range can be extended.\nMulti-path routing has also been suggested by other\
    \ scholars for agriculture WSNs [67,68,101].\nRecently, Nikolidakis et al. [67]\
    \ proposed an agricultural ﬁeld weather monitoring system based on\nthe ZigBee\
    \ wireless protocol. An advance energy-efﬁcient routing protocol was implemented\
    \ for WSN\nto automate irrigation management. The transmitter could modify its\
    \ power based on the distance\nbetween the sensor node and base station to save\
    \ energy. The results revealed that network lifetime\nincreased to 1825 min. Hedley\
    \ et al. [101] developed a WSN soil moisture mapping and monitoring\nmethod to\
    \ provide information for irrigation scheduling. To conserve power, the sensor\
    \ nodes relayed\ndata to the BS every 15 min through the greatest energy-efﬁcient\
    \ route.\nCluster head method is considered by Ndzi et al. [102] to extend the\
    \ ZigBee WSN lifetime for\nagricultural application.\nIn addition, the quality\
    \ of the crop yields is improved and their cost\nis minimized. The research presented\
    \ WSN coverage measurements in a mixed crop farmland.\nAn adaptive energy consumption\
    \ model for each sensor node was proposed and used to compute the\nenergy consumption\
    \ in the network. A deployment model with a cluster head and two antennas was\n\
    also proposed and simulated to alleviate short network lifetime due to the vegetation\
    \ attenuation of\nsignals. This network deployment model extended the lifetime\
    \ of the network by a factor of more than\n20 compared with a deployment where\
    \ cluster heads are not used. Nikolidakis et al. [103] proposed\na new routing\
    \ protocol for WSN that can reduce the power consumption of sensor nodes through\n\
    balanced clustering. This protocol was called “equalized cluster head election\
    \ routing protocol”\n(ECHERP). ECHERP was implemented in Java language for 500\
    \ homogeneous nodes distributed in a\n100 × 100 m2 land. The simulation results\
    \ showed that the proposed protocol outperforms existing\nprotocols in terms of\
    \ power consumption. A potential application of this protocol is PA.\nAnother\
    \ type of routing protocol is called routing metric. Chen et al. [104] used two\
    \ routing\nmetrics, namely, remained energy and expected transmission count, to\
    \ compute the optimal routing\npath to the sink node that ensures low power consumption.\
    \ “A scalable context-aware objective\nfunction (SCAOF)” is proposed by combining\
    \ robustness-aware, energy-aware, resource-aware, and\nreliability-aware contexts\
    \ that render to the compound routing metrics scheme. The experiment is\nconducted\
    \ in a garden based on a testbed, which includes a uIPv6 protocol stack and contiki\
    \ OS. The\nobtained results prove that SCAOF can convey the desired advantages\
    \ on network lifespan prolonging,\nas well as high efﬁciency and reliability in\
    \ different hardware testbeds and simulation scenarios.\nTable 5 shows the comparison\

    \ the power saving or battery lifetime,\ncommunication distance, and limitations\
    \ of WSNs in different agricultural applications in the work of\nseveral scholars\
    \ (Tables 2–6). The tables show that most previous studies used ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol\nfor different agricultural applications. The use of ZigBee supports\
    \ our assumption that this wireless\nprotocol is suitable for agricultural monitoring\

    \ Techniques\nA major limitation of sensor nodes is their limited battery capacity.\
    \ Several energy-efﬁcient\nschemes have been introduced in previous research to\
    \ solve the power consumption problem of sensor\nnodes. An alternative method\
    \ that has been utilized to address the problem of limited node lifespan is\n\
    the use of energy-harvesting techniques. Numerous techniques have been developed\
    \ to allow sensor\nnodes to harvest different types of energy, such as solar,\
    \ wireless power transfer (WPT), mechanical\nvibration, kinetic, and wind energy,\
    \ from different environments [110] (Figure 2). Compared with\ntraditional sensor\
    \ nodes, rechargeable sensor nodes can work continuously for a long lifetime.\
    \ Ambient\nenergy can be converted to electrical energy and used directly to supply\
    \ the sensor nodes or can be\nstored and used later on. In agricultural applications,\
    \ energy harvesting can be used to prolong the\nlifetime of sensor nodes. Energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques for previous research works employed in\nprecision agriculture are\
    \ shown in Table 7. The said table lists the categories of energy-harvesting\n\
    techniques, types of wireless protocols, and output energy/power of energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques.\nIn addition, the form of agricultural applications, and limitations\
    \ of each article are also highlighted.\nEnergy-harvesting mechanisms can be implemented\
    \ with batteries for the sensor nodes. For\nexample, a sensor node using solar\
    \ energy to charge its batteries can work extensively during daytime\nwhen adequate\
    \ sunlight is available. Meanwhile, the sensor node can use its batteries through\
    \ power\nreduction techniques, such as sleep mode (i.e., duty cycle), at night\
    \ when sunlight is unavailable to save\nenergy. In addition, the sensor node can\
    \ enter restricted sleep periods (i.e., low duty cycle) and reduce\ntransmission\
    \ power when its batteries possess low residual energy [111]. Furthermore, adopting\
    \ a\nmaximum power point tracking system is a reliable battery charging technique\
    \ for long-term operation.\nThe charge–discharge cycle of the battery is minimized\
    \ [112].\n3.2.1. Solar Energy\nSolar energy based on photovoltaic system and methods\
    \ can be used in agricultural applications\nbased on WSNs [113]. Therefore, solar\
    \ cells provide a good solution [114] to ensure the survivability\nof the agriculture\
    \ monitoring system. Solar cell energy has been used by several studies to provide\n\
    long-term energy to sensor nodes in agriculture applications.\nGutiérrez et al.\
    \ [40] developed an irrigation system based on the ZigBee wireless protocol. The\n\
    system was developed to improve water usage for agricultural crops. Temperature\
    \ and soil moisture\nsensors in WSN were placed in the root of the plants to send\
    \ sensor information to a web application\nvia a gateway. The proposed algorithm\
    \ controls the water quantity based on threshold values of soil\nmoisture and\
    \ temperature that are programmed in a microcontroller-based gateway. The WSN\
    \ is\npowered by solar cell panels and rechargeable batteries. Water savings of\
    \ up to 90% were achieved\nrelative to the conventional irrigation method. Considering\
    \ that the system is cost effective and\nautonomous, it can be utilized in geographically\
    \ isolated regions where water sources are limited.\nZou et al. [68] improved\
    \ the battery lifetime of a WSN based on harvested energy (i.e., solar cell)\n\
    utilizing shadow detection. With this strategy, sensor nodes can accordingly modify\
    \ their scheduling\nto optimize their power production and remaining battery levels.\
    \ Furthermore, data transmission is\noptimized through routing and clustering\
    \ mechanisms. A Bayesian network was employed to provide\nwarning reports of bottlenecks\
    \ along the path. The system was deployed in real time based on the\nTexas Instruments\
    \ CC2530 platform that includes the ZigBee wireless protocol. The battery (lithium\n\
    type with a storage capacity of 2500 mAh) of the sensor node was charged from\
    \ the solar cell panel\nwhen the harvested power was adequate. The experimental\
    \ results showed that these techniques\nallow network activities to occur in a\
    \ continuous and effective manner.\nIn [115], a micro-irrigation system that relies\
    \ on a small solar-powered cell was developed. The\nenergy input, energy output,\
    \ greenhouse gas productions, and solar cell installation for rural areas\nwere\
    \ investigated with the proposed co-located system. The researchers compared their\
    \ system\nwith another commonly used method (i.e., aloe vera cultivation) in terms\
    \ of life cycle. The life cycle\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n23 of 45\nevaluation\
    \ showed that the proposed system is economical for several rural areas and may\
    \ provide\nopportunities for agriculture electriﬁcation and motivate economic\
    \ growth.\nRoblin [116] presented an irrigation system relying on a solar cell\
    \ for rural areas where sunlight is\noften available. The irrigation system includes\
    \ pumps working on a solar cell instead of an electricity\ngrid and/or a diesel\
    \ generator. The study showed that the irrigation system based on a solar cell\
    \ is\nbetter than systems that depend on other energy resources because the electricity\
    \ grid is unavailable at\nall times, and the operating cost of diesel pumps is\
    \ high and relies mainly on the diesel price. Although\nthe solar-powered system\
    \ was relatively expensive, it became a free source of energy after installation\n\
    in the rural area and proved to be a worthwhile investment in the long term. A\
    \ similar irrigation\nsystem was proposed in [117]. The system adopts photovoltaic\
    \ panels to power a water pump that\nconverts the continuous drift of water into\
    \ a drop drift to achieve increased water usage efﬁciency.\nKwon et al. [118]\
    \ suggested a novel prediction technique for energy harvesting with a solar\n\
    cell within three hours. Moreover, the packet transmissions of the sensor nodes\
    \ can be controlled\ndepending on the estimated energy. Packet transmissions and\
    \ energy harvesting are integrated to\nimprove the WSN performance. The integration\
    \ of these schemes enhances the prediction accuracy\nand improves the WSN throughput\
    \ and power consumption. The throughput of the sensor node can\nbe increased by\
    \ shortening the packet transmission period. By contrast, when the packet transmission\n\
    period increases, the power consumption of the sensor node decreases. The experimental\
    \ results show\nthat the proposed packet transmission scheme is superior to the\
    \ others in terms of data throughput\nand deadline miss rate. The proposed energy-harvesting\
    \ method is also predicted more precisely than\nothers by 6.92%.\nA study [119]\
    \ used a solar cell to provide energy to a WSN deployed in a greenhouse. The\n\
    humidity and temperature of the greenhouse were controlled through a management\
    \ and monitoring\nsystem, which was based on a low-power MSP430 (Texas Instruments,\
    \ Dallas, TX, USA) microcontroller\nand an ultra-low-power nRF24L01 transceiver\
    \ (Nordic Semiconductor, Oslo, Norway). The power\nconsumption of the WSN was\
    \ minimized as much as possible. In another study, a WSN-based ZigBee\n(CC2420\
    \ module) wireless transceiver and microcontroller (low-power ATmega128L) supplied\
    \ by\nthe solar cell as a battery charger were considered to monitor the humidity,\
    \ temperature, rain level,\nand leaf wetness of vineyards [120]. The WSN covered\
    \ 30 m between ZigBee units with a low power\nconsumption (35 and 38 mW in transmission\
    \ and reception modes, respectively).\n3.2.2. Wireless Power Transfer\nRecent\
    \ developments in wireless power transfer (WPT) are expected to increase the lifetime\n\
    of WSNs signiﬁcantly and make them continuously operational, given that WPT techniques\
    \ can\nbe utilized to transmit electromagnetic energy between transmitter and\
    \ receiver devices without\nany contact between the two. WPT is expected to overcome\
    \ the constraint of the supply of WSNs.\nConsequently, some researchers highlighted\
    \ the utilization of mobile node that can deliver power\nto deployed sensor nodes\
    \ such as [121,122].\nWPT technology poses a challenge to the energy\ncooperation\
    \ between neighboring nodes in WSNs. Therefore, in the future, sensor nodes could\n\
    harvest energy from the environment and transfer this energy to other nodes in\
    \ the network; in this\nmanner, a self-sustaining network can be achieved [123].\
    \ Accordingly, recent research has investigated\nmulti-hop energy transfer [124,125],\
    \ which paved the way for new energy cooperative schemes and\nWPT charging protocols.\n\
    WPT can be classiﬁed into three main subcategories:\n(i) electromagnetic (EM)\
    \ radiation,\n(ii) magnetic resonator coupling, and (iii) inductive coupling,\
    \ as shown in Figure 2. Wireless charging\nin WSNs can be performed via EM radiation\
    \ and magnetic resonant coupling. EM signals suffer from\nattenuation over distance,\
    \ and active radiation may pose a threat to the human body. Meanwhile,\nmagnetic\
    \ resonant coupling can address the power requirements of agriculture based on\
    \ WSNs because\nof its efﬁciency within a distance of several meters. Many studies\
    \ used WPT to charge sensor nodes\nfor different applications and ﬁelds. WPT-based\
    \ inductive coupling [121] has been used to charge\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n24\
    \ of 45\nthe battery of sensor nodes scattered in agriculture ﬁelds. The energy\
    \ is transferred from the source\ncoil (mounted on a UAV) to the receiver coil\
    \ (attached with sensor nodes). A 2.4 W transfer power\nis transferred to charge\
    \ a single sensor node. The results addressed a number of limitations and\nchallenges\
    \ related to the charging of sensor nodes via a UAV. In addition, the results\
    \ revealed that\nthe battery lifetime of the deployed sensors can be signiﬁcantly\
    \ extended through the UAV. A similar\napproach was adopted by Chen et al. [122]\
    \ to charge a WSN in an agricultural ﬁeld through the\nharvesting of electromagnetic\
    \ radiation.\n3.2.3. Air Flow Energy\nHarnessing wind energy is another energy-harvesting\
    \ technique that can be utilized to provide\npower to sensor nodes in agricultural\
    \ applications. An adaptive routing protocol, wind energy\nharvesting, and sleep\
    \ scheduling were considered in [126] to minimize the power consumption of the\n\
    ZigBee transceiver and extend the lifetime of the WSN.\n3.2.4. Vibration Energy\n\
    Vibration energy based on piezoelectric can be used to charge the battery of sensor\
    \ nodes to prolong\ntheir lifetime. Müller et al. [127] have been analyzed various\
    \ WSN protocols based on ZigBee (CC2420\nand CC2500) and CC1100 with respect to\
    \ their applicability in the agricultural setting. Furthermore,\na fully synchronous\
    \ protocol with a time-slot architecture for a WSN has been proposed for agricultural\n\
    machinery to achieve real-time capability, low latency, and deterministic behavior.\
    \ The objective of\ntheir application was to monitor the back door position and\
    \ ﬁlling level of a forage wagon using a\nZigBee (CC2420) RF transceiver. Clock\
    \ synchronization among all nodes is implemented to ensure\nstrict power on/sleep\
    \ times of each sensor node. Meanwhile, an energy-harvesting unit based on a\n\
    piezoelectric material has been designed; the unit provides an average power of\
    \ 200 µW to sensor\nnodes. In this case, the sensor node can transmit a data payload\
    \ of nine bytes in 40 ms.\n3.2.5. Water Flow Energy\nMulti-energy sources (water,\
    \ wind, and solar) platform is designed for precision agricultural\napplications\
    \ by Morais et al. [128]. The authors explored water ﬂow, wind speed and solar\
    \ radiation\nfeasible energy sources to encounter the requirements of ZigBee router\
    \ node in WSN. Thus, several\npowered solutions for WSN is presented. Design considerations\
    \ regarding water ﬂow energy, the water\nﬂow in the pipes of crops irrigation\
    \ system are employed to generate the energy for ZigBee router node.\nThis idea\
    \ can be applied in different agricultural applications such as greenhouses, aquaculture,\
    \ and\nhydroponic systems, where the water recirculation in pipes is continuous.\
    \ Like to bulky hydroelectric\ngeneration utilities, a water ﬂow in the pipes,\
    \ derived from the main water source, can be employed\nto run a turbine joined\
    \ to a small direct current (DC) generator. The experimental results revealed\n\
    that the three energy sources combined together can generate an energy of 58 mAh,\
    \ more than the\nrequirement of the ZigBee router node (39 mAh).\n3.2.6. Microbial\
    \ Fuel Cell Energy\nAnother type of energy harvesting technique is called microbial\
    \ fuel cell. This technique is extracted\nfrom energy neutral system. Sartori\
    \ and Brunelli [129] proposed microbial fuel cell to supply the\nunderground freshwater\
    \ system that used for monitoring the water level in the phreatic zone, artesian\n\
    wells, and tanks. The proposed system comprises a low-cost phreatimeter sensor,\
    \ a low-power\nmicrocontroller (i.e., MSP430FR5739), and a low-power LoRa wireless\
    \ protocol. However, the amount\nof microbial fuel cell energy extraction of 296\
    \ µW is not enough to supply LoRa wireless protocol and\nmicrocontroller directly\
    \ when they are in active mode. Therefore, a DC-to-DC boost is employed to\nraise\
    \ the small input voltages of 130 mV to 4.5 V.\nEvidently, most agricultural applications\
    \ prefer to use solar cells as battery chargers of WSNs\nbecause these cells are\
    \ easy to install, work efﬁciently when sunlight is available, and supply more\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n25 of 45\nenergy compared with other energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques as shown in Table 7. In addition, the table\nshows most of the previous\
    \ scholars adopted ZigBee wireless protocol. Clearly, employing ZigBee\nsupports\
    \ our study that this wireless protocol is more suitable for agricultural monitoring\
    \ systems.\nSolar panels can supply 100 mW/cm2, whereas radio frequency, thermal,\
    \ vibration, wind, microbial\nfuel cell, magnetic resonant coupling WPT, and water\
    \ ﬂow can supply 0.001, 0.06, 0.8, 1.0, 0.296, 14, and\n19 mWs, respectively [128–131].\
    \ For example, as shown in Figure 3 (Part A), if the power consumption\nof the\
    \ WSN components presented in [120] is 35 mW for ZigBee (Chipcon CC2420), 0.27\
    \ mW for\nthe temperature sensor, 3 mW for the humidity sensor, 0.27 mW for the\
    \ rain gauge sensor, 5 mW\nfor the leaf wetness sensor, and 24 mW for the ATmega128L\
    \ microcontroller [132], a single solar cell\n(2 × 2 cm2) panel can adequate supply\
    \ this WSN. However, when the power consumption of the WSN\nincreases, the dimension\
    \ of the solar cell panel also needs to be increased.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n\

    \ the visibility of a group of systems, technologies, platforms, and design \n\
    principles for joining things, depending on the physical surroundings, through\
    \ the use of the Internet. \nPA is an application that can employ the benefits\
    \ of IoT to increase production efficiency, improve \nthe quality of yields, reduce\
    \ the negative ecological impact, prevent the prevalence of plant-eating \npests\
    \ or plant diseases, alert farmers about farm fires [141], and increase the profitability\
    \ of several \nagricultural production schemes. Agriculture involves farming,\
    \ planting, and animal rearing, and it \nhas grown under the scope of IoT recently\
    \ [5]. Tracking of animals, monitoring of farms, and \nirrigation processes are\
    \ the main domains of IoT for cultivation [142]. Furthermore, feeding, rearing,\
    \ \nmedication, and vaccination are essential applications of IoT in the agricultural\
    \ domain [143]. \nConsequently, several IoT modular architectures have been proposed\
    \ and implemented by scholars \nfor PA monitoring (as presented in Table 8). Real-time\
    \ ecological information can be remotely \ngathered from the agricultural surroundings\
    \ based on different sensors, which transmit the \ninformation to be processed\
    \ to determine problems, take required actions using actuators, or store \ndata.\
    \ \nSensors in WSN can be employed to gather information about environmental and\
    \ physical \nfeatures, whereas actuators are used to respond to the feedback to\
    \ control or to perform an action \nover the conditions (Figure 3, Part B). The\
    \ use of sensors in agricultural applications poses a number \nof requirements,\
    \ including gathering of soil, weather, and crop information; surveillance of\
    \ \nagricultural areas, water and fertilizer requirements of diverse pieces of\
    \ rough land, several crops on \na single piece of acreage, different requirements\
    \ of crops for unlike soil and weather circumstances, \nand eliminating of interactive\
    \ solutions and relying on proactive solutions. All these requirements \nare applied\
    \ and processed in parallel. Therefore, different sensors and actuators must be\
    \ used to \nhandle this information and respond to different conditions. Processed\
    \ information can be utilized \nto make a decision instead of raw data of the\
    \ sensor [132]. This information can be transmuted to the \ncloud computing via\
    \ gateway for data processing and data storage, as shown in Figure 3 (Part C).\
    \ \nReference [144] proposed a modular architecture for a wireless sensor node\
    \ implemented for PA \napplications. The sensors employed in this modular were\
    \ soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and \nwind direction and speed sensors\
    \ to monitor the agricultural environments. “Adafruit Pro Trinket” \nplatform\
    \ was selected for the data processing, and nRF wireless protocol was used as\
    \ a transceiver \nto transfer sensor data to the gateway (i.e., Intel Edison to\
    \ reduce the power consumption). The \ngateway was in charge of collected information\
    \ from different sensors and passed the information to \nFigure 3. Example of\
    \ farm ﬁeld-based Internet of Things (IoT) and provided by a solar cell battery\n\
    charger: (a) Agriculture sensor node with related sensor and solar cell, (b) Sink\
    \ and actuator nodes,\nand (c) Gateway node and cloud computing.\n4. Agriculture\
    \ Requirements for IoT\nThe IoT represents the visibility of a group of systems,\
    \ technologies, platforms, and design\nprinciples for joining things, depending\
    \ on the physical surroundings, through the use of the Internet.\nPA is an application\
    \ that can employ the beneﬁts of IoT to increase production efﬁciency, improve\
    \ the\nquality of yields, reduce the negative ecological impact, prevent the prevalence\
    \ of plant-eating pests or\nplant diseases, alert farmers about farm ﬁres [141],\
    \ and increase the proﬁtability of several agricultural\nproduction schemes. Agriculture\
    \ involves farming, planting, and animal rearing, and it has grown\nunder the\
    \ scope of IoT recently [5]. Tracking of animals, monitoring of farms, and irrigation\
    \ processes\nare the main domains of IoT for cultivation [142]. Furthermore, feeding,\
    \ rearing, medication, and\nvaccination are essential applications of IoT in the\
    \ agricultural domain [143]. Consequently, several\nIoT modular architectures\
    \ have been proposed and implemented by scholars for PA monitoring (as\npresented\
    \ in Table 8). Real-time ecological information can be remotely gathered from\
    \ the agricultural\nsurroundings based on different sensors, which transmit the\
    \ information to be processed to determine\nproblems, take required actions using\
    \ actuators, or store data.\nSensors in WSN can be employed to gather information\
    \ about environmental and physical\nfeatures, whereas actuators are used to respond\
    \ to the feedback to control or to perform an action over\nthe conditions (Figure\
    \ 3, Part B). The use of sensors in agricultural applications poses a number of\n\
    requirements, including gathering of soil, weather, and crop information; surveillance\
    \ of agricultural\nareas, water and fertilizer requirements of diverse pieces\
    \ of rough land, several crops on a single\npiece of acreage, different requirements\
    \ of crops for unlike soil and weather circumstances, and\neliminating of interactive\
    \ solutions and relying on proactive solutions. All these requirements are\napplied\
    \ and processed in parallel. Therefore, different sensors and actuators must be\
    \ used to handle\nthis information and respond to different conditions. Processed\
    \ information can be utilized to make\na decision instead of raw data of the sensor\
    \ [132]. This information can be transmuted to the cloud\ncomputing via gateway\
    \ for data processing and data storage, as shown in Figure 3 (Part C).\nReference\
    \ [144] proposed a modular architecture for a wireless sensor node implemented\
    \ for PA\napplications. The sensors employed in this modular were soil moisture,\
    \ temperature, humidity, and\nwind direction and speed sensors to monitor the\
    \ agricultural environments. “Adafruit Pro Trinket”\nplatform was selected for\
    \ the data processing, and nRF wireless protocol was used as a transceiver to\n\
    transfer sensor data to the gateway (i.e., Intel Edison to reduce the power consumption).\
    \ The gateway\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n29 of 45\nwas in charge of collected information\
    \ from different sensors and passed the information to the cloud\nserver. The\
    \ proposed system resulted in improved crop quality and minimized negative ecological\n\
    effect. In [145], the usage of water in smart irrigation systems was controlled\
    \ based on developed IoT\nplatforms. A cloud agriculture ﬁeld-monitoring scheme\
    \ was designed and implemented to enable\nthe farmer to monitor the soil condition.\
    \ Soil moisture and weather temperature were monitored to\nautomate the irrigation\
    \ system in farm while minimizing water consumption, which led to reduced\ncost\
    \ and maintained environmental beneﬁts. The proposed water irrigation system included\
    \ three\nmain parts: a WSN and actuator, a cloud platform, and user application.\
    \ The WSN and actuator part\nconsisted of sensor nodes for collecting the soil\
    \ moisture and weather temperature, an actuator node\nto control the irrigation\
    \ process, and a sink node that could pass all farm information to the cloud\n\
    platform. All sensor, sink, and actuator nodes adopted low-power ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol.\nWSN and 3G network-based agriculture IoT was considered in [146]\
    \ to monitor the air\ntemperature, air humidity, and soil moisture. The entire\
    \ system consisted of sensor nodes, actuators\nsink nodes, server, gateway, and\
    \ the mobile phone device of the farmer. The collected information by\nthe sensor\
    \ nodes was sent to the server via gateway and Internet network. The gateway connected\
    \ the\nWSN with the Internet to relay the command control among the sensor nodes,\
    \ the phone of the farmer,\nthe actuators, and the server. However, in this system,\
    \ the data transmission over the 3G network\nmust ensure real-time communications\
    \ to support the agricultural WSN.\nIoT-based agriculture applications changed\
    \ classical agricultural surveillance approaches by\nspeedily providing quantitative\
    \ data with signiﬁcant temporal and spatial resolution. Several IoT\nplatforms\
    \ have recently been available in the market. For instance, in agricultural applications,\n\
    SmartFarmNet [147] platforms can be used to provide more than 30 packages for\
    \ good commercial\nproducts, such as Libelium [45], and experimental, such as\
    \ Motes [148] and Arduino [149] sensor\nplatforms. Other examples of agricultural\
    \ applications based on IoT are provided in Table 8. The table\npresents a comparative\
    \ analysis of several scholars in terms of sensors, actuators, IoT devices, and\
    \ IoT\nplatforms that can be used to support agricultural applications.\nSensors\

    \ of PA domain such as sensors, microcontrollers, and wireless technologies\n\
    are highlighted and classiﬁed in Table 9. For better clariﬁcation, the sensors\
    \ are classiﬁed into three\nmain categories leaf wetness/plant, soil moisture,\
    \ and environment sensors [5,132]. These sensors can\nbe utilized in several potential\
    \ agriculture applications. In Table 9, the microcontroller/processor and\nwireless\
    \ protocols are also highlighted. Among the microcontrollers, the majority of\
    \ agriculture sensor\nnodes adopting ATmega128L because this microcontroller supports\
    \ data aggregation, decision making,\nstorage capability, ﬂash memory, low complexity,\
    \ and energy management through multi-levels of\npower down modes [132]. ZigBee\
    \ and LoRa wireless protocols/technologies are widely used in several\nagricultural\
    \ applications, as discussed previously in Section 2.\nIn precision agriculture,\
    \ to obtain high-quality products, the environmental parameters should be\ncontrolled\
    \ to provide optimal values. For example, the temperature rate that has a positive\
    \ effect on the\ngrowth of the pepper ﬁeld is between 20 and 25 ◦C. The temperature\
    \ in rainy, sunny, and nightly days\nshould be kept between 20 and 22 ◦C, between\
    \ 25 and 28 ◦C, and between 18 and 20 ◦C, respectively\nand the minimum value\
    \ should be not lower than 16–17 ◦C. Air humidity for pepper vegetables should\n\
    be kept between 60% and 70%. The high-temperature value combines with low humidity\
    \ value may\nbe caused a negative inﬂuence on the growth of the pepper. The maximum\
    \ humidity value in pepper\ngreenhouse should be not above 70%. Soil pH (i.e.,\
    \ soil acidity) is another factor that directly effects\non the pepper crops,\
    \ where it can measure the quantity of calcium in the soil. The soil for pepper\n\
    crops can be acid or alkaline depending on the weather conditions. It should be\
    \ acid for wet climate\nand alkaline for a dry climate. Soil with pH levels above\
    \ 7.0 is considered alkaline, while soil with\npH levels below 7.0 has acid nature.\
    \ Soil pH values must be controlled according to the type of the\nagricultural\
    \ yield. For pepper crop, the best values for pH gauge are between 6.5 and 5.5.\
    \ Therefore,\nthe humidity, temperature, and soil pH should be constantly supervised\
    \ in order to identify the right\ntime for draining and watering the agricultural\
    \ crops.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n33 of 45\nTable 9. Types of sensors, microcontrollers,\

    \ Limitations\nThe development of WSNs prompted new research trends in the agricultural\
    \ domain. Micro\nelectromechanical system (MEMS) technologies allow for the manufacture\
    \ of cheap and small sensors.\nThe pervasive nature of the process, together with\
    \ tiny, self-regulating sensor nodes, cost-effective\nequipment, and scalability,\
    \ indicate that WSNs can be used for agriculture automation [5]. However,\nregarding\
    \ the distribution of WSNs to observe different agricultural climates, a number\
    \ of open\nchallenges and limitations remain. Several of these challenges and\
    \ limitations in existing agricultural\napplications based on WSNs are listed\
    \ below together with suggestions on how to address them.\n(1)\nPower consumption\
    \ and battery life:\nA WSN consists of three main components:\nsensors,\nmicrocontrollers,\
    \ and RF transceivers. Given that the battery of a sensor node provides limited\n\
    energy, ensuring that the components of the sensor node consume minimum power\
    \ is crucial.\nIn particular, reducing the power consumption of the RF transceiver,\
    \ which consumes more power\nthan the other components in a sensor node, would\
    \ alleviate this problem [67,127]. Moreover,\nthis issue can be addressed in two\
    \ steps. The ﬁrst is to propose an intelligent energy-efﬁcient\nalgorithm. The\
    \ second step can be performed by utilizing available energy-harvesting techniques,\n\
    such as solar cells, vibration, and WPT.\n(2)\nCommunication range: WSNs suffer\
    \ from the effect of harsh ecological conditions because of the\nwide range of\
    \ open agricultural surroundings [5]. The WSN protocol contains mechanisms to\n\
    resist the effect of data transmission failures in the network, which increase\
    \ due to ecological\neffects. In agricultural applications, most wireless sensor\
    \ technologies support a relatively short\ncommunication range. Therefore, many\
    \ sensor and router nodes need to be diffused in a WSN.\nIn the point-to-point\
    \ Zigbee network, the communication distance can reach 100 m in outdoor\nenvironments.\
    \ The ZigBee communication range can be extended by adopting multi-tire, ad-hoc,\n\
    decentralized, and mesh network topologies. Drones or UAV also can be used as\
    \ a mobile router\nnode to extend the communication range within a farm ﬁeld.\
    \ A drone could pass the collected\ndata from the sensor nodes to the master node\
    \ through multi-hop. However, using drones entails\nother challenges and limitations.\n\
    (3)\nPropagation losses:\nIn agricultural applications, WSNs must be able to work\
    \ in diverse\nsurroundings, such as ground, bare land, orchards, greenhouses,\
    \ farms, and complex topography;\nthey must also be able to operate in all climate\
    \ conditions. All these conditions inﬂuence the\nperformance of radio propagation.\
    \ Whether the topography is simple or complicated, the\ncommunication possibility\
    \ between the points in a WSN still suffers from serious challenges.\nThe signal\
    \ transmitted from the sensor nodes in agricultural applications need to pass\
    \ through a\nheavy crop canopy to arrive to at the receiver nodes, which cannot\
    \ ensure a sufﬁcient clearance\narea and will cause signal propagation absorption,\
    \ reﬂection, attenuation, and scattering. In\nthis case, the link quality is degraded,\
    \ especially when the signal spreads through dense crops.\nTherefore, when deploying\
    \ WSNs, communication link quality and temporal and spatial variables\nmust be\
    \ guaranteed. The communication performance of WSNs is related to the working\n\
    surroundings. Therefore, due to the limited resources and power budget of WSNs,\
    \ an accurate\nwireless channel path loss model must be adopted to reﬂect the\
    \ propagation features. This model\nis expected to demonstrate correct optimization\
    \ and network evaluation performance throughout\nthe deployment design process\
    \ to develop the energy efﬁciency of the nodes [15], improve the\ntarget detection\
    \ and localization applications [16], decrease the number of retransmission, and\n\
    ensure Quality of Service (QoS) of the network [175].\n(4)\nRouting: Different\
    \ problems can emerge due to packet collision and limited bandwidth, which\nare\
    \ introduced by channel propagation, and so on. Therefore, when a WSN is deployed\
    \ in a wide\narea in farm ﬁelds, multi-hop is required. Kim et al. [3] developed\
    \ an independent mobile robot\nplatform based on a mobility task for surveillance\
    \ to overcome channel interference.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n35 of 45\n(5)\nLocalization\
    \ and tracking: Tracking and localization of a herd of cattle are considered smart\
    \ farm\napplications based on WSNs. For example, a WSN can be employed to track\
    \ and localize of dairy\ncows to enable herd management. ZigBee wireless protocol\
    \ is used to monitor animal locations\nand behaviors, such as walking and standing,\
    \ lying down, and grazing [16,18]. In this context,\nseveral considerations, such\
    \ as radio interference, animal situation, and mobility, changes in\nWSN topology,\
    \ penetration depth of the signal through the animal body, height of the collar,\
    \ and\naccess point antennas, need to be taken into account [176]. These considerations\
    \ pose challenges\nin the localization and tracking of the animals.\n(6)\nReliability:\
    \ Agricultural monitoring systems based on different environmental sensors can\
    \ also\nbe used to monitor pollution aside from climate conditions. Important\
    \ information on climate\nconditions is reported to related agencies and farmers\
    \ from a remote location for advance\ninvestigations. Dangerous information needs\
    \ to be dealt with immediately in an emergency,\nwhich means that data transmission\
    \ in WSNs should demonstrate high reliability [3].\n(7)\nScalability: In agricultural\
    \ applications, the construction of WSN-based fault-tolerant and\nrobust hierarchical\
    \ architectures requires large-scale deployment relative to single-level network\n\
    architectures.\nA hierarchical architecture can be scaled up for developing applications\
    \ by\nduplicating to several ﬁelds. In this context, to increase the number of\
    \ WSNs over a vast area,\nmultiple wireless router nodes are placed in an agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld to guarantee sustained operation.\n(8)\nCost: The total hardware and software\
    \ costs of sensor nodes are important. The design of sensor\nnodes for any agricultural\
    \ application level must involve a low cost while demonstrating a robust\nperformance;\
    \ moreover, the design needs to be available for use by poor country markets [5].\n\
    This challenge can be overcome by reducing software and hardware costs further.\n\
    (9)\nReal time: Most crops are vulnerable to climate conditions, such as humidity,\
    \ intensity of\nillumination, and temperature. This vulnerability is a burden\
    \ to farmers who monitor changes\nin climate conditions hourly and/or daily because\
    \ doing so is labor-intensive. Moreover, in\ngreenhouses, a ﬁre can occur and\
    \ lead to severe agricultural disasters. This evidence suggests\nthat the monitoring\
    \ of the ecological conditions of agricultural WSNs needs to be in real time.\n\
    Real-time monitoring will enhance yield production and plant growth and avoid\
    \ dangerous\ndisasters in farms [3].\n(10) Storage and recording of data: Large\
    \ amounts of data are recorded from agriculture observing\nsystems because several\
    \ WSNs in agricultural applications contain several sensors for crop\ngrowth analysis\
    \ and harvesting estimation. This condition requires the base station to monitor\n\
    changes in farm ﬁelds by analyzing patterns. The base station must thus be supported\
    \ by a high\nstorage capacity.\n(11) Security: Security and protection are important\
    \ issues in agricultural products. Protection\nfrom insects or attacks of rodents\
    \ in grain stores or ﬁelds is essential. Such a challenge must\nbe considered\
    \ to maintain the security level of agriculture. Protection and security can be\n\
    achieved based on real-time analysis and processing of agricultural information\
    \ without human\nintrusion [159].\n(12) Delay tolerance: Critical delay poses\
    \ a challenge to agricultural applications. Some agricultural\napplications can\
    \ be considered as time sensitive, such as those used in farm ﬁre detection,\n\
    detection of exposure of crops to pests, cow heat event detection during milking,\
    \ and exposure of\ncattle to heat for a certain period. Such information must\
    \ be transmitted as fast as possible if the\ncritical issue is to be handled.\
    \ In such a case, a tradeoff between energy consumption and data\ntimelines is\
    \ necessary. By contrast, some agricultural applications are delay tolerant (i.e.,\
    \ time\ninsensitive), such as protein content, milk fat [177], gathering data\
    \ from soil and grass monitoring.\nWith delay tolerant approach, the short range\
    \ low power wireless protocols can be used [178].\nWhere the information of the\
    \ agricultural ﬁeld can be collected and transferred to the master\nnode or to\
    \ a cloud computing node using “messengers” e.g., a mobile node (mobile robot\
    \ or\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n36 of 45\nUAV). Consequently, the cost [179] and\
    \ the complexity of the agriculture WSN will be reduced\nand the lifetime will\
    \ be increased.\n(13) Fault tolerance: Fault tolerance is a crucial feature of\
    \ WSNs for succeeding PA. Several faults may\noccur in PA based on the WSN system,\
    \ which are (i) communication failure, (ii) faulty sensor\nsetting, (iii) sensor\
    \ component faults producing incorrect value, and (iv) node failure because of\n\
    exhausted battery or any other cause. Gutiérrez et al. [40] introduced communication\
    \ failure and\nnode fault tolerance for an irrigation system. If any fault occurs,\
    \ the irrigation system tracks the\ndefault irrigation program. The node energy\
    \ depletion failure was minimized in [1,40,180] by\nadopting solar-cell-powered\
    \ nodes. Data aggregation and topology control schemes are probable\nto be fault\
    \ tolerant for deploying sensor nodes in a vast area.\n(14) Data management: The\
    \ data management in agriculture poses a challenge because the large\namount of\
    \ data that can be collected from several sensors spread in agricultural ﬁeld,\
    \ especially\nwhen the agricultural data are intended to be connected to the cloud.\
    \ Determination of the\n(i) data analysis method, (ii) data collection schemes,\
    \ (iii) sensor types, (iv) semantic sensor\nnetworking, (v) big data, and (vi)\
    \ complex event processing enables the designer to manage\nthese crucial aspects.\
    \ The integration of IoT and software-deﬁned network also introduces a\npromising\
    \ and new methodology in deployment, monitoring, and design of network services\n\
    and resources [181].\n(15) Heterogeneous sensors: Integration of wired and wireless\
    \ heterogeneous sensors into information\nplatforms to perform interoperability\
    \ pose challenges in PA. Chen et al. [152] proposed “web\nservice-enabled cyber-physical\
    \ infrastructure” to solve this issue. The proposed system was able\nto integrate,\
    \ process, acquire, and distribute surveillance data from different physical sensors\n\
    spread in the PA system over the Internet. The infrastructure was executed to\
    \ serve as an\narchitecture middleware between PA clients and heterogeneous sensors.\n\
    6. Conclusions\nA review of WSN-based agricultural applications was presented.\
    \ A comparison was conducted\namong different wireless technologies or protocols,\
    \ such as WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, GPRS/3G/4G,\nLoRa, and SigFox. The comparison\
    \ results revealed that the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols are\nmore convenient\
    \ for agricultural applications than the others because of its low power consumption\n\
    and suitable communication range for ZigBee and long for LoRa. A classiﬁcation\
    \ of energy-efﬁcient\ntechniques or algorithms and energy-harvesting techniques\
    \ was also provided. Based on the presented\ntaxonomy, we show that signiﬁcant\
    \ types of energy-efﬁcient and energy-harvesting techniques\ncan be used in the\
    \ agriculture domain. Previous research was also investigated and compared\nto\
    \ explore the current problems in agricultural applications based on WSNs and\
    \ obtain optimum\nsolutions for maintaining system performance. Challenges and\
    \ limitations were introduced for\ndesign considerations in the future. The state-of-the-art\
    \ approaches of IoT in agricultural applications\nwere reviewed and compared to\
    \ explore various sensors, actuators, devices, IoT platforms, and\napplication\
    \ layers.\nAcknowledgments: The authors would like to thank Al-Raﬁdain University\

    \ essential to increase the productivity of \nagricultural and farming processes\
    \ to improve yields and cost-\neffectiveness with new technology such as the Internet\
    \ of Things \n(IoT). In particular, IoT can make agricultural and farming \nindustry\
    \ \nprocesses \nmore \nefficient \nby \nreducing \nhuman \nintervention through\
    \ automation. In this study, the aim to \nanalyze recently developed IoT applications\
    \ in the agriculture \nand farming industries to provide an overview of sensor\
    \ data \ncollections, technologies, and sub-verticals such as water \nmanagement\
    \ and crop management. In this review, data is \nextracted from 60 peer-reviewed\
    \ scientific publications (2016-\n2018) with a focus on IoT sub-verticals and\
    \ sensor data collection \nfor measurements to make accurate decisions. Our results\
    \ from \nthe reported studies show water management is the highest sub-\nvertical\
    \ (28.08%) followed by crop management (14.60%) then \nsmart farming (10.11%).\
    \ From the data collection, livestock \nmanagement and irrigation management resulted\
    \ in the same \npercentage (5.61%). In regard to sensor data collection, the \n\
    highest result was for the measurement of environmental \ntemperature (24.87%)\
    \ and environmental humidity (19.79%). \nThere are also some other sensor data\
    \ regarding soil moisture \n(15.73%) and soil pH (7.61%). Research indicates that\
    \ of the \ntechnologies used in IoT application development, Wi-Fi is the \nmost\
    \ frequently used (30.27%) followed by mobile technology \n(21.10%). As per our\
    \ review of the research, we can conclude \nthat the agricultural sector (76.1%)\
    \ is researched considerably \nmore than compared to the farming sector (23.8%).\
    \ This study \nshould be used as a reference for members of the agricultural \n\
    industry to improve and develop the use of IoT to enhance \nagricultural production\
    \ efficiencies.  This study also provides \nrecommendations for future research\

    Graphical Abstract. \nI. \nINTRODUCTION \nIoT is a combination of worldwide data,\
    \ web associated \nitems or things, and is an integral component of the future\
    \ \nInternet. IoT focuses on the automation of processes by \nlessening human\
    \ interaction. In the process of automation, IoT \ncollects data using sensors\
    \ and processes the data using \ncontrollers and completing the automation processes\
    \ by using \nactuators [1], [2]. IoT in agriculture and farming focus is on \n\
    automating all the aspects of farming and agricultural methods \nto make the process\
    \ more efficient and effective. Traditional \napproaches in livestock management\
    \ (such as cattle detection) \nare not fully automated and have many inefficiencies\
    \ such as \nhigher human interaction, labour cost, power consumption, \nand water\
    \ consumption [1], [3], [4], [5], [6]. The central \nconcept of this review is\
    \ to analyse the IoT sub-verticals, \ncollected data for measurements and used\
    \ technologies to \ndevelop applications. It is essential to identify the most\
    \ \nresearched sub-verticals, data collections and technologies to \ncreate new\
    \ IoT applications in the future.  \n \n \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced\
    \ Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 10, No. 4, 2019 \n12 | P a g e  \n\
    www.ijacsa.thesai.org \nThis review provides an overall picture of currently \n\
    developed IoT applications in agriculture and farming \nbetween 2016 and 2018.\
    \ \nAs a solution to the existing problems, researchers have \nfocused on smart\
    \ agricultural and farming automated systems \nwith the help of IoT [7], [8],\
    \ [9], [10].  IoT is the network of \nthings which identifies elements clearly\
    \ with the help of \nsoftware intelligence, sensors and ubiquitous connectivity\
    \ to \nthe Internet. In IoT, the data that collects from Internet-\nconnected\
    \ items or things contains with gadgets, sensors and \nactuators [1]. Many researchers\
    \ have focused on smart \nsystems for monitoring and controlling agricultural\
    \ parameters \nby enhancing productivity and efficiency. Smart systems \ncollect\
    \ data for measurements to get accurate results that can \nlead to appropriate\
    \ actions. Current use of smart agricultural \nsystems relates to collecting data\
    \ on environmental parameters \nsuch as temperature, humidity, soil moisture and\
    \ pH [11], \n[12], [13]. With accurate sensor data collection using a range \n\
    of different sensors, researchers have implemented smart \nagricultural systems\
    \ to make the farm process more effective \n[9], [14]. Research has mainly focused\
    \ on sub-verticals such \nas water management, crop management and smart farming\
    \ to \nmake processes automated by reducing human intervention, \ncosts, power\
    \ consumption and water consumption. \nThe automation process of agricultural\
    \ and farming \nreduced human interaction and improve the efficiency. The \nreason\
    \ for that is every country population depends on \nagriculture thus consumers\
    \ of these resources should use water \nand land resources optimally [19], [20].\
    \ Moreover, it is \nimperative to have good quality production and crop \nmanagement\
    \ in order to maximize profitability. Hence, IoT \nbase agricultural management\
    \ systems are integral for an \nagriculturally based country. The new systems\
    \ developed \nusing IoT technologies have reduced the drawbacks associated \n\
    with traditional approaches and provided many advantages to \nfarmers. For example,\
    \ IoT-based water management systems \ncollect environmental attributes such as\
    \ temperature, water \nlevel and humidity through the sensors and provide accurate\
    \ \nirrigation timing [19], [21]. In addition, crop management \nsystems developed\
    \ using IoT monitor the temperature, \nhumidity and soil through sensors thus\
    \ providing adequate \ninformation so that farmers can manage the crops \nappropriately\
    \ [25]. Overall, these IoT-based systems help to \nreduce human interaction, power\
    \ utilization and reduce cost in \nthe field of agriculture. Moreover, IoT-based\
    \ agricultural \nrelated applications have been used in the area of pest control,\
    \ \nweather monitoring, nutrient management and greenhouse \nmanagement. \nIoT\
    \ for agriculture uses sensors to collect big data on the \nagricultural environment.\
    \ It discovers, analyses and deals with \nmodels built upon big data to make the\
    \ development of \nagriculture more sustainable [34]. IoT can provide efficient\
    \ \nand low-cost solutions to the collection of data. Weather, \nWater Scarcity,\
    \ Soil fertility and Pesticides are the significant \nplayers in it. IoT will\
    \ make agriculture beneficiary. \nAgriculture and farming depend on water [35].\
    \ Farmers \ndepend on rainfall for all their agricultural needs. \nFertilizer\
    \ also plays a very significant role in the field of \nagriculture by helping\
    \ to increase the productivity of plants \n[36]. By using IoT, farmers can manage\
    \ soil condition more \neffectively and at less expense by monitoring them from\
    \ any \nlocation [37]. The primary objective of this study is how IoT \nand technologies\
    \ are used in conserving water, fertiliser and \nenergy in the agricultural industry\
    \ by combining new \ntechnologies. This has benefits for the development of the\
    \ \neconomy of countries as well as the wealth of the people [38]. \nWith the\
    \ combination of both advanced technologies in \nhardware and software, IoT can\
    \ track and count all relevant \naspects of production which can reduce the waste,\
    \ loss and \ncost [39]. The information needed to make smart decisions can \n\
    be obtained merely by using electronic devices [40]. IoT \ntransforms the agricultural\
    \ industry and enables farmers to \novercome different challenges. Innovative\
    \ applications can \naddress these issues and therefore increase the quality,\
    \ \nquantity, sustainability and cost-effectiveness of crop \nproduction [41],\
    \ [42], [43]. IoT provides more benefits to the \nfarming industry by improving\
    \ the health of animals through \nbetter food and environment, addressing the\
    \ labour shortage \nissue as well cost savings through automation, increase in\
    \ milk \nproduction, and increase in some animals during the breeding \nperiod\
    \ through detection of estrus cycle and additional \nrevenue streams from waste.\
    \ \nOur \nstudy \nhas \nanalyzed \nrecently \ndeveloped \nIoT \napplications in\
    \ the fields of agriculture and farming to address \ncurrent issues such as unnecessary\
    \ human interaction leading \nto higher labour cost, unnecessary water consumption\
    \ and \nwater-saving measures for the future, higher energy \nconsumption, energy-saving\
    \ measures for the future and crop \nmonitoring difficulties. According to our\
    \ analysis, we can \nidentify a focus on water and crop management as sub-\nverticals\
    \ in the agriculture and farming sectors. This survey \nalso focusses on other\
    \ agriculture and farming sub-verticals to \nidentify the gap between IoT application\
    \ developments in the \nleast researched areas. The IoT generates enormous data,\
    \ so-\ncalled big data (high volume, at a different speed and different \nvarieties\
    \ of data) in varying data quality. Analysing the IoT \nsystem and its key attributes\
    \ are the key to advancing smart \nIoT utilization. Therefore, the primary aim\
    \ of our paper is to \nexplore recently created IoT applications in the agriculture\
    \ and \nfarming industry to give the more profound understanding \nabout sensor\
    \ data collection, used technologies, and sub-\nverticals, for example, water\
    \ and crop management. The \nsecondary aim of this study is to analyse the current\
    \ issues \nsuch as higher human interaction, high labour cost, higher \nwater\
    \ consumption and save water for future, higher energy \nconsumption and save\
    \ energy/electricity for future, crop \nmonitoring difficulties in IoT for agriculture\
    \ and farming. \nThe remainder of this paper is as follows: In Section II we \n\
    include raw data collection methodology, data inclusion \ncriteria, and data analysis\
    \ methods. Finally, the results of \nAgriculture and Farming based on IoT Sub\
    \ verticals, Sensor \nData, and Technologies are presented in Section III, and\
    \ in \nSection IV we discuss the results. Section V concludes the \npaper. The\
    \ raw data collected from 60 peer-reviewed \npublications used in this paper are\
    \ summarised in Table I. \n \n \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer\

    \ \nII. MATERIALS AND METHODS \nData collection involves identifying important\
    \ criteria in \nresearch articles on the Internet of Things (IoT) in the \nagriculture\
    \ and farming sectors.  \nAs shown in Table I, these essential criteria were used\
    \ to \nanalyse relevant research papers. In particular, 60 peer-\nreviewed scientific\
    \ publications on IoT in the agriculture and \nfarming sectors published in scientific\
    \ journals between 2016 \nand 2018 were used. \n1) Collection of raw data: The\
    \ data gathered for this \nreview is from 60 peer-reviewed publications (2016-2018)\
    \ \nthat were collected from the IEEE database. All these \npublications have\
    \ different data applications that have been \nstudied and analyzed in this survey.\
    \ The attributes compared \nwere sub-verticals, data collection measurements,\
    \ used \ntechnologies, challenges in current approach, benefits, \ncountries and\
    \ drivers of IoT. \n2) Data inclusion criteria: To evaluate the data inclusion\
    \ \ncriteria a comparison table was drawn to include as the \nfollowing attributes:\
    \ Author, Sub vertical, Data collection \nmeasurements, Technologies, Benefits,\
    \ Challenges, Solutions \nand Drivers of IoT. Nevertheless, in our study, articles\
    \ were \nexcluded when the selected attributes were not present. In our \nanalysis,\
    \ the number of sensors, amount of data collected, \nunderlying \ntechnologies,\
    \ \nsensor \ntopology \nand \nother \nintermediate gateways were not included\
    \ since no information \ncan find with all the peer-reviewed publications (2016-2018).\
    \ \n3) Data analysis: We pooled and analyzed the reported \nstudies based on data\
    \ collected through peer reviewed articles \nand displaying emerging themes in\
    \ a table. The data sets \nincluded attributes such as Sub vertical, Data collection\
    \ \nmeasurements, Technologies, Benefits, Challenges, Solutions, \nCountries focused\
    \ on automation of the agriculture proses and \nDrivers of IoT. The descriptive\
    \ details of the study based on \nthe publication year were analyzed to observe\
    \ the results from \n2016 to 2018. \nIII. RESULTS \nThis review aims to analyse\
    \ the incorporation of IoT for \nthe development of applications in the agriculture\
    \ and farming \nsectors. The study focuses on sub-verticals and collecting data\
    \ \nfor measurements and technologies in the field of agriculture \nand farming\
    \ to increase productivity and efficiency with the \nhelp of the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT). This study of IoT in \nagriculture and farming focuses on developing\
    \ a criterion \napproach with the help of agricultural environmental \nparameters\
    \ and IoT measures and technologies. In the field of \nagriculture, there are\
    \ many environmental parameters that \nneed to be considered to enhance crops,\
    \ reduce water \nconsumption and human involvement [44]. Moreover, there \nare\
    \ many sub-verticals that can be identified depending on the \ndifferences in\
    \ approach. \nIn this review, we have gathered articles which have \nfocused on\
    \ agricultural and farming sub-verticals from 2016 to \n2018. As shown in Fig.\
    \ 1, 23 sub-verticals were found \naccording to the results obtained and the topmost\
    \ area was \nwater management (28.08%). \nAs IoT depends on sensor data collections,\
    \ a vast amount \nof data needs to be gathered to identify or predict accurate\
    \ \nresults. This study indicates that many researchers have \nfocused on environmental\
    \ temperature (24.87%), humidity \n(19.79%) and soil moisture (15.73%) as environmental\
    \ \nmeasurements. As shown in Fig. 2, 28 types of data were \ncollected for measurements\
    \ with environmental temperature \nand humidity being considered the most critical\
    \ parameters for \nagriculture and farming. \nAs shown in Fig. 3, we have categorised\
    \ all technologies \nused in the articles. This study has identified Wi-Fi as\
    \ the \nmost used technology (30.27%) followed by Mobile \nTechnology (21.10%)\
    \ for both agriculture and farming. \nZigBee, another data transfer technology,\
    \ is also used but to a \nlesser extent. \nAccording to Fig. 4, the use of IoT\
    \ was more prominent in \nthe agriculture industry than the farming industry (Agriculture\
    \ \n– 76.1%, Farming – 23.8%). \n \nFig. 1. Agriculture and Farming Sub Verticals:\

    \ \nIn this review we have identified important attributes to \nanalyse the research\
    \ findings in agriculture and farming \nprocesses. We have gathered and analyzed\
    \ data by using 60 \nrecent scientific articles. Our survey shows the most \n\
    researched \nsub-verticals are \nwater \nmanagement, crop \nmanagement and smart\
    \ farming. Water management is the \nmost researched sub-vertical for the last\
    \ few years as most \ncountries mainly focus on the utilization of water resources\
    \ \ndue to its lack of abundance [61]. Irrigation patterns in \nagriculture influence\
    \ crop production making irrigation \nmanagement a central focus to increase productivity\
    \ [8], [10].  \nThe second most considered sub-vertical is crop management \n\
    due to the importance of producing food for a growing global \npopulation. It\
    \ is important to manage the quality, quantity and \neffectiveness of the agricultural\
    \ production for sustainability \n[13]. Although a study [18] discussed that the\
    \ widely used \nsensor data collections for measurements are soil conditions as\
    \ \npH and humidity, as per our analysis it shows environmental \ntemperature\
    \ followed by humidity and soil moisture are the \nmost commonly measured data.\
    \ \nIoT can further be defined as a fusion of heterogeneous \nnetworks including\
    \ chip technology that scopes gradually \nmore and more, expanding due to the\
    \ rapid growth of Internet \napplications such as logistics, agriculture, smart\
    \ community, \nintelligent transposition, control and tracking systems. \nAccording\
    \ to researchers’ analysis, in 2020 IoT objects will be \nsemi-intelligent and\
    \ an important part of human social life \n[46]. As analyzed in our review Wi-Fi,mobile\
    \ technology are \nthe technologies which have a wide range of demand in \nagriculture\
    \ and farming domain to monitor land and water \nresources in contrast to other\
    \ technologies [33], [35]. \nAlthough our results demonstrate the results in such\
    \ a way, a \nstudy [62] analyzed that use of RFID, a Wireless Sensor \nNetwork\
    \ (WSN) technology that can be effectively used to \nincrease the crop production\
    \ to meet the growing needs of the \nincreasing population. In developing countries\
    \ with limited \nInternet speed, the other IoT technologies utilised rather than\
    \ \nWi-Fi include Low-Power, Short-Range IoT Networks, low-\nrate wireless PAN\
    \ (LoRaWAN) or Low-Power and Wide-\nArea Networks. \nFurther research [61] shows\
    \ that WSN is used in many \napplications \nsuch \nas \nhealth \nmonitoring, \n\
    agriculture, \nenvironmental monitoring, and military applications whereas \n\
    our study demonstrates the agriculture sector using IoT in and \nfarming sector\
    \ using IoT. Our observations show that \nAgriculture is the primary source of\
    \ income in developing \ncountries, such as India with the sizeable geographical\
    \ area \nwhen comparing with other countries [9]. \nMost of the research studies\
    \ have performed on water \nmanagement by monitoring such environmental parameters\
    \ as \ntemperature, humidity and soil moisture [1], [3], [5], [19], \n[25]. Many\
    \ of the findings have focused on better water \nutilization, reduction inhuman\
    \ intervention and the cost of \nproduction [18], [27]. Future research could\
    \ draw more \nattention to further automate current processes in waste \nmanagement,\
    \ smart lightening and pest controlling sub-\nverticals by reducing existing drawbacks\
    \ since it has received \nthe least research attention in the considered period.\
    \ Fog \ncomputing, as an innovation with cross over any barrier \nbetween remote\
    \ data centres and IoT devices, should be \nconsidered in future IoT analysis\
    \ [63], [64], [65], [66], [67]. \nWhile IoT has solved many issues related to\
    \ agriculture and \nfarming there are limitations that we need to consider. Lack\
    \ of \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,\
    \ \nVol. 10, No. 4, 2019 \n25 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \ninteroperability\
    \ and compatibility in devices, network \nflexibility issues when more devices\
    \ are connecting, and \nsensor lifetime is some of the limitations to be addressed\
    \ in \nfuture research. \nThis study has found that industry 4.0 in agriculture\
    \ \nfocuses on IoT aspects transforming the production \ncapabilities including\
    \ the agricultural domain. This study has \n[68] considered soil quality, irrigation\
    \ levels, weather, the \npresence of insects and pests as sensor data. Some of\
    \ the \nsignificant aspects they have been researched are the driver’s \nassistance\
    \ to optimise routes and shorten harvesting and crop \ntreatment while reducing\
    \ fuel consumption CISCO [69]. \nProducing enough food for the entire world is\
    \ a big challenge \nsince the global population is rapidly changing as well as\
    \ \nclimate change and labour shortage. Currently researchers \nhave focused more\
    \ on robotics to address these problems. A \ngrowing number of researchers and\
    \ companies have focused \non Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to weeding\
    \ by \nreducing the amount of herbicide used by farmers. \nIn contrast to edge\
    \ computing, cloud computing requires a \nhigh-speed internet connection with\
    \ sending and retrieving \ndata from the cloud. As the process involves transferring\
    \ and \nreceiving data from the cloud, the process is time-consuming. \nSince\
    \ the data capacity is higher than bandwidth, it is always \nessential to process\
    \ data locally instead of sending data to the \ncloud. Edge computing is more\
    \ efficient than cloud processing \nwhen processing data since the capacity doubles\
    \ faster than \nthe bandwidth doubles [70]. Since IoT uses sensor data \ncollection\
    \ for decision making, to process collected data, the \ncloud, or the edge based\
    \ can be used on the system \nrequirements. \nStill, there are some challenges\
    \ associated with IoT system \ndeployment. Connecting so many devices to the IoT\
    \ network \nis the biggest challenge in the future following lack of \ntechnical\
    \ knowledge among farmers, current centralised \narchitecture to support IoT systems\
    \ is not much advanced as \nthe growth of the network, centralised systems will\
    \ turn into a \nbottleneck. Moreover, sensor battery capacity and lifetime and\
    \ \nsensor data storage also more concentrated when IoT system \ndeployment. Smart\
    \ farming is the association with new \nadvancements in technologies and the different\
    \ crop and \nlivestock, agriculture and farming in the digital age. Smart \nfarming\
    \ can deliver agriculture more beneficial for the farmer. \nThis is because decreasing\
    \ input resources will save farmers' \nmoney and labour, and hence, will increase\
    \ reliability [71] and \nbusiness outcome [72], [73]. \nFurthermore, studying\
    \ diverse approaches for fog \ncomputing structure [63], decision making using\
    \ prediction or \npattern analysis [74], [75], [76], big data databases [77] could\
    \ \nbe an exciting way to make the Internet of Things (IoT) into \nthe future\
    \ dominating technology. \nThis survey will fill the gap by the identification\
    \ of the \ndifferent IoT sub-verticals and data collections for the \nmeasurements\
    \ in the agriculture and farming process. Results \nare clearly showing that most\
    \ considered sub-verticals and \ndata collections for measurements in the field\
    \ of agriculture \nand farming. Our study also indicates the technologies used\
    \ \nfor IoT application development in the reviewed period. To \nsummarise this\
    \ survey, this has broader knowledge about IoT \napplications developed for automating\
    \ the agriculture and \nfarming process. Moreover, this study identifies most\
    \ \nconsidered \nsub-verticals, \ncollected \nsensor \ndata \nand \ntechnologies\
    \ for the development of IoT based applications in \nagriculture and farming sector\
    \ towards the significant \nimprovement of the business. \nTable II shows the\

    \ \n(2016–2018) \nin \ndiscussing \nthe \npotential \napplications of the Internet\
    \ of Things, it was found that water \nmanagement is the highest considered IoT\
    \ sub-vertical \nfollowed by crop management, smart farming, livestock \nmanagement,\
    \ and irrigation management with the same \npercentage. As per the observation,\
    \ the most critical sensor \ndata collection for the measurement is environmental\
    \ \ntemperature, environmental humidity and also there are some \nother such sensor\
    \ data also gathered for IoT applications as \nsoil moisture and soil pH. Wi-Fi\
    \ has the highest demand of \nusage in agriculture and farming industry, followed\
    \ by mobile \ntechnology.  Other technologies as ZigBee, RFID, Raspberry \npi,\
    \ WSN, Bluetooth, LoRa and GPRS have less demand in the \nagriculture and farming\
    \ sectors. When compared to the \nagricultural sector, farming industry has a\
    \ lesser percentage \namount using IoT for the automation. This survey could be\
    \ \nuseful for researchers for finding new ways and solution to \nchallenge in\
    \ the current agricultural era and for agricultural \nand farming industries to\
    \ make the automation process more \neffective and efficient, consequently, to\
    \ obtain the good \nbusinesses outcome. \nAUTHORS’ PROFILE \nR.M., S.W., and M.N.H.\

    \ for human survival and solving the hunger\nproblem worldwide. With the growth\
    \ of the global population, the demand for food is increasing,\nwhich needs more\
    \ agriculture labor. However, the number of people willing to engage in agricultural\n\
    work is decreasing, causing a severe shortage of agricultural labor. Therefore,\
    \ it is necessary to\nstudy the mode of agricultural production without labor\
    \ force participation. With the rapid devel-\nopment of the Internet of Things,\
    \ Big Data, artiﬁcial intelligence, robotics and ﬁfth-generation (5G)\ncommunication\
    \ technology, robots can replace humans in agricultural operations, thus enabling\n\
    the establishment of unmanned farms in the near future. In this review, we have\
    \ deﬁned unmanned\nfarms, introduced the framework of unmanned farms, analyzed\
    \ the current state of the technology\nand how these technologies can be used\
    \ in unmanned farms, and ﬁnally discuss all the technical\nchallenges. We believe\
    \ that this review will provide guidance for the development of unmanned\nfarms\
    \ and provide ideas for further investigation of these farms.\nKeywords: unmanned\
    \ farm; accurate perception; intelligent decision; auto-work\n1. Introduction\n\
    Agriculture is the most important industry in the world, as it ensures survival\
    \ of\nthe global human population [1]. Agricultural production needs more agricultural\
    \ labor\nto cope with the rising global population [2]. However, in past few decades,\
    \ the average\nage of farmers has increased dramatically: around 58 years old\
    \ in the USA and Europe,\n63 in Japan [3]. Moreover, the number of people willing\
    \ to work as agricultural labor is\ndeclining, especially in the United States,\
    \ Japan, Germany and Russia [4]. The data show\nthat in 2017, the proportion of\
    \ the labor force involved in agriculture in the United States,\nJapan, Germany\
    \ and Russia is 1.66%, 1.28%, 3.49% and 6.70% respectively [5], and it is still\n\
    a downward trend, which causes the agricultural labor force will be increasingly\
    \ lower\nin the future. Therefore, the current agricultural research mainly focuses\
    \ on developing\nstrategies for improving agricultural production with less labor.\n\
    An agricultural factory develops agriculture from a traditional small-scale farm\
    \ to\na large-scale enterprise, which has a high resource utilization rate, small\
    \ land occupation\nand high yield and is not limited by climate and region [6].\
    \ However, the agricultural\nfactory needs more human resources. Sudden situations\
    \ lead to the shortage of agricultural\nlabor, which will have a huge impact on\
    \ an agricultural factory [7,8]. Therefore, it is\nnecessary to study the mode\
    \ of agriculture in which no one enters the agricultural work\nsite.\nAgriculture\

    Agriculture 2021, 11, 145\n2 of 26\nRecently developed technologies, such as the\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT) [9,10], robotics [11],\nBig Data [12] and artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence (AI) [13,14], have been used to guide agricultural pro-\nduction,\
    \ which greatly reduces the use of the labor force and enhances efﬁcient utilization\n\
    of resources, thus facilitating the development of sustainable agriculture [15].\
    \ The develop-\nment of these technologies has made it possible to construct unmanned\
    \ farms [16].\nAs early as 2017, Harper Adams University (Newport, UK) collaborated\
    \ with Precision\nDecision company on the Hands Free Hectare project, and realized\
    \ automatic work through\nthe transformation of traditional tractors, exploration\
    \ vehicles and harvesters and the use of\nunmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for\
    \ drawing paths and for positioning [17]. However, this\nrequired manual participation\
    \ in UAV operation and background monitoring. Techno Farm\nKeihanna opened in\
    \ November 2018 and is the ﬁrst factory to use Techno Farm™. It is one\nof the\
    \ largest automated vertical farms in the world, leveraging cutting-edge technologies\n\
    such as robotics and the IoT, where planting, management and harvesting are controlled\n\
    by robots. Intelligent environmental control and advanced water circulation technology\n\
    have greatly improved the efﬁciency of vertical planting, achieving the goal of\
    \ 98% water\nresources will be recycled and producing 30,000 lettuce stably every\
    \ day. Production could\nbe raised by 25% and labor costs halved. Moreover, light-emitting\
    \ diodes (LEDs) are used\nto simulate sunshine, achieving 1/3 energy saving [18].\
    \ In August 2020, academician Luo\nXiwen harvested rice grown in an unmanned farm\
    \ in Zengcheng, a teaching and research\nbase of South China Agricultural University,\
    \ using intelligent agricultural machinery\nto achieve full coverage of farming,\
    \ management and production. At this unmanned\nfarm, the theoretical yield of\
    \ rice per acre was 3390.7 kg, as determined by the ﬁve-point\nsampling method\
    \ [19]. Jingdong agriculture and animal husbandry company announced\nthe establishment\
    \ of and researched an intelligent pig breeding system. The system can\nautomatically\
    \ adjust the fan, water curtain, heating and other equipment to ensure that\n\
    the air, temperature and humidity of the pig farm are maintained in the best state\
    \ suitable\nfor the healthy growth of pigs. Combined with AI technology, they\
    \ have developed modern\nequipment suitable for a pig farm environment, such as\
    \ an intelligent camera, pig feeding\nrobot, inspection robot, telescopic semi-limited\
    \ pig pen and so on. The goal is to realize\nthe whole process of unmanned, non-intervention\
    \ and non-contact breeding. It is estimated\nthat the company can reduce the labor\
    \ cost of pig breeding by 30–50%, reduce the feed\nconsumption by 8–10%, and shorten\
    \ the average slaughter time by 5–8 days, which can\nreduce the cost of 50 billion\
    \ yuan a year [20].\nTo date, many agricultural operations have been unmanned,\
    \ and many countries have\nbeen involved in the construction of unmanned farms;\
    \ however, there has been no formal\nintroduction of unmanned farms in scientiﬁc\
    \ literature. In this paper, we presented an\noverview of the unmanned farm shown\
    \ in Figure 1, and divide unmanned farms into basic\nlayer–decision layer–application\
    \ layer. The main contributions of this paper are:\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 145\n\

    2.1. Deﬁnition\nAn unmanned farm is a new production mode, which does not require\
    \ labor force but\nadopts diverse novel technologies such as IoT, Big Data, AI,\
    \ ﬁfth-generation (5G) technology\nand robots, for performing all farm production\
    \ operations through remote control, whole-\nprocess automatic control of facilities,\
    \ equipment and machinery or autonomous control by\nrobots. The unmanned farm\
    \ is the ultimate form of intelligent agriculture and the highest\nstandard of\
    \ agricultural production.\nUnmanned farm uses modern sensing technology for monitoring\
    \ the environment,\ngrowth status of agricultural animals and plants and the working\
    \ status of various operat-\ning equipment, and for transmitting data to the cloud\
    \ using a low-delay and high-reliability\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 145\n4 of 26\n\
    communication technology. A cloud platform can analyze and process data through\
    \ Big\nData and AI technology, independently generate production and operation\
    \ decisions and\nthen transmit decision information to the robot. The robot completes\
    \ the decision-making\ninformation of the cloud platform through path planning\
    \ and navigation, target recognition\nand ﬂexible machinery and other technologies,\
    \ and this process does not require human\nparticipation.\nIn an unmanned farm,\
    \ every link of production and management can be automatically\nplanned and decided\
    \ by the cloud platform and then performed by machinery, indepen-\ndent of people’s\
    \ participation, 24 h a day from the beginning to the end of planting or\nbreeding.\
    \ An unmanned farm realizes precise management, self-decision making, un-\nmanned\
    \ operation, precise investment and personalized service during the whole process\n\
    of agricultural production and management, and then realizes the sustainable development\n\
    goals of agricultural production. In the future, unmanned vehicles, unmanned boats,\
    \ UAVs\nand all kinds of agricultural intelligent machinery will be able to independently\
    \ complete\nmobile operations without human intervention and realize the seamless\
    \ docking of ﬁxed\nequipment and mobile equipment.\n2.2. System Composition\n\
    The architecture of an unmanned farm consists of basic layer, decision layer,\
    \ and ap-\nplication services layer together, and the role and components is described\
    \ as follows:\nThe basic layer consists of sensing and communication system and\
    \ infrastructure\nsystem. Infrastructure system includes basic conditions such\
    \ as factory building, roads,\nutilities, garages, network equipment and intelligent\
    \ terminals, which provides basic work-\ning conditions and environment for the\
    \ unmanned farm system through the IoT technology.\nThe sensing and communication\
    \ system aiming at getting the information of the farm\nmainly about environment,\
    \ the growth state of breeding objects and the operation state\nof equipment,\
    \ which is obtained by sensors, space information equipment, camera equip-\nment,\
    \ positioning/navigation equipment and a wireless transmission module deployed\
    \ at\nthe farm. The basic layer is to convert various farm information to digital\
    \ data, provide\nthe work environment for other work equipment, and the high-speed\
    \ communication\nbetween various items of equipment.\nThe decision layer is an\
    \ intelligent decision cloud platform for unmanned farm, which\nhosts that analysis,\
    \ processing and storage of massive data resources of unmanned farm.\nIt is the\
    \ nerve center of the unmanned farm that makes data-based intelligent decisions\n\
    for the unmanned farm. Intelligent decisions include model base, method base,\
    \ database\nand knowledge base and, with the help of cloud computing, Big Data\
    \ and AI technologies,\nit can perform tasks such as animal and plant welfare\
    \ monitoring, environmental data\nanalysis, remote robot control, equipment fault\
    \ diagnosis and farm intelligent production\nand operation. The decision layer\
    \ instead of humans is for thinking about agricultural\nproduction, to produce\
    \ a more scientiﬁc and reasonable proposal.\nThe application layer is the auto-work\
    \ equipment system, which is the core component\nof the unmanned farm that utilizes\
    \ the technology of intelligent agricultural equipment\nand IoT. The operation\
    \ and equipment system include ﬁxed and mobile equipment. Fixed\nequipment mainly\
    \ applied in unmanned livestock farming, ﬁshery or glasshouse, and can\nperform\
    \ independent tasks, such as feeding and aeration, without moving. On the other\n\
    hand, mobile equipment refers to equipment, such as a seeder and unmanned ground\
    \ vehi-\ncle (UGV), which are dependent on movement for completing farm operations.\
    \ Moreover,\nmobile equipment can realize unmanned transport mission and can serve\
    \ as a platform\nfor carrying. The application layer in unmanned farm is to replace\
    \ humans to complete\nthe agricultural work, especially in the harsh conditions.\n\
    The three layers of components of the unmanned farm play different roles: the\
    \ basic\nlayers’ infrastructure system is necessary for supporting the operation\
    \ of other systems;\nthe basic layers’ sensing and communication system is responsible\
    \ for data collection\nand transmission; the decision layer performs data management\
    \ and makes production\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 145\n5 of 26\nand operation related\
    \ decisions; the application layer use machines, instead of people, to\nconduct\
    \ farm operations. These three layers cooperate with each other to realize safe\
    \ and\nreliable operation of the unmanned farm.\n2.3. The Development Stage of\
    \ the Unmanned Farm\nRemote-controlled farm: remote control is the primary stage\
    \ of unmanned farm, which\nis used to realize the unmanned operation of the farm\
    \ through the remote control of\nfacilities, equipment, machinery, etc. The characteristic\
    \ of this stage is that it only realizes\nthe replacement of labor by machines,\
    \ and it also requires people to carry out remote\noperation, participate in decision-making\
    \ and control, but it does not require people to\nparticipate in work on site,\
    \ which liberates people from heavy physical labor. Therefore,\nit can also be\
    \ called hands-free farm.\nUnattended farm: unattended is the intermediate stage\
    \ of the unmanned farm, in which\nthere is no need for people to remotely operate\
    \ farm equipment in the remote monitoring\nroom 24 h a day. The system can cruise\
    \ independently, but it still needs people’s participa-\ntion, mainly for the\
    \ issuance of agricultural operation instructions and decision-making of\nproduction\
    \ management. In this stage, the time of participating in the production process\n\
    of the farm is greatly shortened, and there is no need to be on duty all the time.\
    \ When\nnecessary, it can participate in the decision-making management.\nAutonomous\
    \ farm: the autonomous operation is the advanced stage of the unmanned\nfarm that\
    \ does not need human participation. All farm operations and management have\n\
    cloud management and control platforms for independent planning, decision-making\
    \ and\noperation, and all farm businesses are completed by equipment independently,\
    \ especially\nbusiness docking link, which is completed by equipment through communication\
    \ and\nidentiﬁcation. Human participation is not required in the whole production\
    \ management\nprocess. It is a completely unmanned autonomous farm and the ultimate\
    \ form of farm\ndevelopment.\n3. Unmanned Farm System\n3.1. Infrastructure System\n\
    The infrastructure system in the foundation layer is to provide basic working\
    \ condi-\ntions for the whole unmanned farm intelligence, involving the transformation,\
    \ layout and\ndesign of infrastructure. The layout and construction of the infrastructure\
    \ system is deter-\nmined according to the production object and scale as well\
    \ as the intelligent equipment.\nFor example, the small and scattered land should\
    \ be effectively integrated, and the water\nsupply network, road network, power\
    \ grid and communication signal must be constructed\nin compliance with certain\
    \ conditions. Therefore, the infrastructure of the unmanned farm\nneeds to be\
    \ laid out and built according to certain principles, namely, practicability and\
    \ cost.\nPracticability implies that every workshop, warehouse, road, etc. should\
    \ play a speciﬁc\nrole in the unmanned farm and should be sufﬁcient to support\
    \ the normal operation of\nthe unmanned farm. The second principle of cost implies\
    \ that the construction of infrastruc-\nture should be cost-effective, given the\
    \ low value of agricultural products, and the future\noperation and maintenance\
    \ costs of agricultural production should be considered.\nIn addition, infrastructure\
    \ digitization is very necessary. Consistent use of digital\nmethods from the\
    \ start of a project provides a basis for the deﬁnition of the intended\nconstruction\
    \ state [21]. Building information modeling (BIM) technology can be shared and\n\
    transferred throughout project planning, operation and maintenance via the integration\
    \ of\nbuilding data and information model [22]. This ensures that engineering\
    \ and technical per-\nsonnel develop a correct understanding of building-related\
    \ information, three-dimensional\n(3D) visualization and automatic layout, thus\
    \ reducing design time and improving project\ncoordination. This technology shows\
    \ great potential for planning the infrastructure system\nof an unmanned farm\
    \ and consequently improving the reliability of the farm.\nThe design of the infrastructure\
    \ system is particularly important, as it provides op-\neration support for the\
    \ whole unmanned farm. Following the principles of practicability\nAgriculture\
    \ 2021, 11, 145\n6 of 26\nand cost can be more easily accepted by farmers and,\
    \ with the help of BIM technology,\ncan improve the reliability of unmanned farms.\
    \ At present, we can use various tools to\nhelp people build infrastructure. In\
    \ addition to the principle of practicality and low cost,\nthe infrastructure\
    \ of unmanned farm also needs to be digitized. People are required to\nparticipate\
    \ in the process of design and construction, and the management of infrastructure\n\
    only needs a remote-control robot to complete it.\n3.2. Sensing and Communication\
    \ System\nThe sensing and communication system is the foundation that realizes\
    \ the interconnec-\ntion of everything, based on the IoT and information and communication\
    \ technology (ICT).\nIn the agricultural environment, IoT refers to the use of\
    \ sensors and other devices, which\ntransform each element and action involved\
    \ in agriculture into data. IoT and ICT have\nbeen applied in intelligent agriculture\
    \ for tasks, such as crop or livestock management,\nresource management and animal,\
    \ plant and environment monitoring, which can help im-\nprove the quality and\
    \ quantity of agricultural products [23]. Information acquisition in an\nunmanned\
    \ farm is similar to smart agriculture, which relies on IoT for building the sens-\n\
    ing and communication frameworks. Sensing and communication system is the basis\
    \ of\nthe digitalization of the unmanned farm. A complete information transmission\
    \ system\ncan obtain the various information parameters of the farm without human\
    \ participation,\nand the information is processed by the intelligent decision\
    \ cloud platform and then make\nthe decision.\n3.2.1. Sensing: Intelligent Perception\
    \ of Unmanned Farm\nIn traditional agriculture, farm management relies on the\
    \ experience of the farmer;\nhowever, there are many uncertainties and errors.\
    \ To build an unmanned farm, it is impor-\ntant to eliminate these uncertainties\
    \ for accurate management, which requires sensitive\nand fast sensors. A sensor\
    \ is a device that perceives and transmits the environmental\ninformation and\
    \ provides a foundation for the digitization of agricultural information.\nIn\
    \ an unmanned farm, sensors obtain agricultural information, including the growth\n\
    environment, physiological status of animals and plants and information about\
    \ the equip-\nment or robot status [24]. This information is transmitted to the\
    \ cloud platform through\nthe processing network, thus providing data support\
    \ for decision control.\nAgricultural sensors have been widely used for collecting\
    \ information on environ-\nmental factors such as temperature, humidity, light,\
    \ dissolved oxygen (DO) and heart\nrate. Research shows that the wireless sensor\
    \ network built with various types of sensor,\nsuch as information acquisition\
    \ terminals, enable intelligent monitoring and intelligent\ncontrol [25,26]. This\
    \ system usually uses sensors to build wireless sensor networks and\nsends data\
    \ to servers or terminals through telecommunication technologies (such as 4G)\n\
    to help farmers make better decisions and accomplish the goal of accurate management.\n\
    In some ways, sensor networks are essential for implementing intelligent agricultural\n\
    systems, the same will be true on an unmanned farm. However, unmanned farm have\n\
    more stringent requirements for the accuracy and timeliness of information acquisition\n\
    because it is a completely unmanned production process.\nOver the past few years,\
    \ sensor research has become more miniaturized and intelligent,\nand new sensors\
    \ have been developed using novel materials, which have advantages in de-\ntection\
    \ sensitivity. These sensors provide reliable data support for more precise unmanned\n\
    management but are not popular because of the high cost. Advances in material\
    \ science\nand processing technology will help solve these problems. In recent\
    \ years, the image-\nprocessing technology, based on the neural network, has led\
    \ to widespread application of\nthe image sensor. The machine vision method has\
    \ replaced the traditional information ac-\nquisition method in some aspects.\
    \ For example, the pig face recognition method has started\nreplacing the traditional\
    \ radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) method [27], as it offers\nmore advantages\
    \ in management and convenience. Breakthroughs in sensor performance\nand changes\
    \ in information acquisition methods help optimize the sensing system and\nAgriculture\
    \ 2021, 11, 145\n7 of 26\nincrease the possibilities for unmanned farm. In addition,\
    \ remote-sensing technology is an\nimportant tool for spatial information acquisition\
    \ in an unmanned farm. Remote-sensing\ntechnology offers many advantages such\
    \ as synchronous and non-destructive observations\nin a large area, strong timeliness\
    \ and objective response to ground object change. This tech-\nnology has been\
    \ widely used for monitoring farm crop growth and drought and freezing\ninjury\
    \ and for controlling disease and insect pest populations [28–30].\nAn unmanned\
    \ farm is a completely unmanned production process. Therefore, all\nequipment\
    \ and systems must work on the basis of agricultural data, which are collected\n\
    using sensing equipment. However, the sensors may not be reliable or stable for\
    \ long-term\nuse, and special agricultural sensors are not comprehensive. In addition,\
    \ the explosive\ngrowth of equipment and data consumes a lot of network and cloud\
    \ resources because\nof uniﬁed upload and centralized processing. Moreover, data\
    \ processing is not timely,\nand the network is unstable, which reduce the stability\
    \ and availability of the sensor\nsystem. Edge computing can meet the key requirements\
    \ of network capacity constraints,\ndata timeliness, resource constraints, security\
    \ and privacy challenges. Each edge of the IoT\nhas data collection, analysis\
    \ and calculation, communication and intelligent processing\ncapabilities, and\
    \ can process, ﬁlter and analyze nearby data [31].\n3.2.2. Transmission: High-Speed\
    \ and Efﬁcient Communication Promotes\nthe Unmanned Farm\nThe transmission of\
    \ information on an unmanned farm is performed through a net-\nwork. The network\
    \ efﬁciently, stably, safely and in a timely way transmits data obtained\nfrom\
    \ the “end” layer of agricultural IoTs and processed data to the “cloud” layer\
    \ of agri-\ncultural IoTs, which as a link between the “cloud” layer and the “end”\
    \ layer. Information\ntransmission is the fundamental guarantee for the normal\
    \ operation of agricultural IoTs,\nwith more emphasis on reliability and security.\n\
    Information transmission may include both wired and wireless communication, de-\n\
    pending on the transmission medium. Wired communication refers to the technology\
    \ that\ntransmits information through a twisted pair, coaxial cable, optical ﬁber\
    \ and other tangible\nmedia, which are mostly Ethernet and ﬁeldbus [32]. Wireless\
    \ communication is a com-\nmunication technology that uses electromagnetic wave\
    \ signals to transmit information\ndirectly in space for information exchange;\
    \ examples of wireless communication tech-\nnologies include RFID, near-ﬁeld communication\
    \ (NFC), infrared data association (IrDA),\nZigbee, Wi-Fi, long range (LoRa),\
    \ Bluetooth, narrowband IoT (NB-IoT), 3G and 4G [33,34].\nWireless communication\
    \ technologies connect various elements of agriculture and simplify\nthe information\
    \ interaction among various ﬁxed agricultural equipment, robots, sensors\nand\
    \ machine vision and remote-sensing monitoring platforms in an unmanned farm is\
    \ an\nefﬁcient and intelligent manner.\nWireless sensor networks (WSNs) have created\
    \ novel research opportunities, leading\nto tremendous improvements in agricultural\
    \ application systems such as those used for\ngroundwater quality monitoring,\
    \ irrigation management, fertilizer control, planting moni-\ntoring, crop quality\
    \ monitoring, pest and disease control, agricultural product tracking,\nenvironmental\
    \ gas monitoring and animal movement monitoring [35]. WSNs collect data\nfrom\
    \ different types of sensor and send them to the primary server via a transmission\n\
    system. This makes standardized planting or breeding management smart. Farmers\
    \ can\nachieve accurate management by monitoring farm crops from any location\
    \ using soil mois-\nture sensors, temperature and humidity sensors, light sensors\
    \ and automated irrigation\nsystems [36]. Wang and colleagues designed an automatic\
    \ monitoring system for green-\nhouse crop survival, based on a WSN [37]. This\
    \ system can effectively control and maintain\noptimal microclimate conditions\
    \ in the greenhouse. Similarly, Mahale et al. implemented\nintelligent monitoring\
    \ of chicken farms using mobile phones and smart devices [38], while\nGoud et\
    \ al. completed the control and remote monitoring of environmental parameters\n\
    in the chicken farm using a WSN and mobile system network [39]. Research shows\
    \ that IoT-\nbased intelligent monitoring systems will help farms grow crops or\
    \ livestock in a scientiﬁc\nand balanced manner.\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 145\n\
    8 of 26\nNowadays, the 5G communication technology is being employed for wireless\
    \ com-\nmunication. For example, in China, the Daoji Agriculture company has started\
    \ to operate\nsmart farms based on 5G. The 5G networks are expected to provide\
    \ 1000–5000 times more\ncapacity than 3G and 4G networks and will consist of cellular\
    \ networks with peak rates of\n10–100 Gb, which will take 1–10 milliseconds to\
    \ transmit data from one speciﬁed point to\nanother. The 5G Intelligent Internet\
    \ of Things (5G I-IoT) proposed by Wang et al. can help\nrealize the intelligent\
    \ processing of Big Data and facilitate the optimization of communica-\ntion channels\
    \ [40], thus providing the possibility for fast, real-time and high-throughput\n\
    demand of unmanned farm.\n3.3. Intelligent Decision Cloud Platform\nThe intelligent\

    3.3.1. Big Data: Data-Driven Unmanned Farm\nIn unmanned farming, various types\
    \ of data, including digital, sound, image and\nvideo, are produced during the\
    \ process of agricultural production and management. Be-\ncause of the different\
    \ sources and forms of data and interaction between many elements,\nit is difﬁcult\
    \ to process, analyze and store the data within a speciﬁc time period. Therefore,\n\
    mining effective information from multidimensional heterogeneous data obtained\
    \ from\ndiverse sources is difﬁcult.\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 145\n9 of 26\nBig\
    \ Data technology provides a solution for effective data mining. Big Data refers\n\
    to the technology of analyzing, processing and storing data, which is s very important\n\
    technology of mass data processing [41]. Data mining is one aspect of Big Data\
    \ application,\nand can be divided into 4 steps: data pre-processing, data reduction,\
    \ data modeling and\nsolution analysis [42]. Data storage also can be solved by\
    \ Big Data technologies and cloud\ncomputing [43].\nBig Data is still in its infancy\
    \ in agriculture, but it has been proposed as a tool for\nguiding farm-based decisions\
    \ [44]. Australia uses the Big Data technology to analyze dairy\nproduction, lactation\
    \ and reproduction data in dairy farms, and studies the importance\nof Big Data\
    \ in agricultural decision-making [45]. Through mining and analysis the data\n\
    of climate, soil conditions, crop growth and pest and disease, Li obtained the\
    \ optimal\nconditions of high quality and high yield of crops, and then intelligent\
    \ planting was\nrealized by guides the regulation of agricultural varieties and\
    \ production environment [46].\nTo date, a number of studies have been conducted\
    \ on the application of Big Data\nin the ﬁeld of agriculture. Kamilaris et al.\
    \ reported 34 studies on the use of Big Data\nin agricultural applications [12].\
    \ Wolfert et al. summarized the application of Big Data\nin smart farming [47].\
    \ Several studies have also been conducted in the construction of an\nagricultural\
    \ Big Data platform [48]. The Consortium of International Agricultural Research\n\
    Centers (CGIAR; Montpellier, France) has created an agricultural Big Data platform,\
    \ aiming\nto solve the problems of agricultural development faster, better and\
    \ on a larger scale using\nBig Data. In China, numerous provinces have set up\
    \ agricultural Big Data platforms to\nguide and improve agricultural production\
    \ and increase farmer income.\nApplication of the Big Data technology needs tremendous\
    \ data, and this requires\nfarms to use numerous pieces of data acquisition equipment\
    \ [49]. Unmanned farms have\nsufﬁcient data to meet the needs of Big Data. Therefore,\
    \ Big Data technology will also play\nan important role in unmanned farms, which\
    \ is mainly reﬂected in four aspects: (1) Big\nData technology enables the processing\
    \ of multi-source for unmanned farm, and uses data\nprocessing methods such as\

    \ for intelligent decision-making in the unmanned\nfarm. Given the complexity\
    \ of agricultural operations and the diversity, heterogeneity and\naccuracy of\
    \ data, more research is needed to verify the reliability of Big Data in agriculture.\n\
    3.3.2. Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI): Make Unmanned Farms Think Like People\nBig\
    \ Data provides data processing and storage technology, but AI technology plays\n\
    the thinking and decision-making roles [50]. AI allows the machine or system to\
    \ exhibit\nindependent, but rational, thinking and behavior, similar to human\
    \ beings [51,52]. With\nclassiﬁcation, logistic regression, correlation analysis\
    \ and decision-making capabilities,\nAI has been widely used in agricultural decision\
    \ support systems (ADSS), agricultural\nprediction analysis, visual monitoring\
    \ systems, robot control [14,53,54].\nAgricultural Decision Support Systems\n\
    An ADSS is a human-computer system which utilizes data from various sources,\n\
    aiming at providing farmers with a list of advice for supporting their decision-making\n\
    under different circumstances by AI [54]. The ADSS does not give direct instructions\
    \ or\ncommands to farmers, it provides advice to farmers, farmers make the ﬁnal\
    \ decisions.\nThe ADSS has been used in feeding decision-making [55], smart irrigation\
    \ decision support\nsystems [56], and crop nutrient management [57]. For example,\
    \ Zhou et al. proposed\nthe near infrared computer vision and neuro-fuzzy model-based\
    \ feeding decision system\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 145\n10 of 26\nfor ﬁsh in aquaculture,\
    \ which can conversion rate can be reduced by 10.77% and water\npollution can\
    \ also be reduced [55]. It shows ADSS is very helpful for assisting farmers\n\
    in performing various agricultural activities.\nHowever, there are also some questions\
    \ to be answered if ADSS is to be widely used,\nsuch as the incomplete functionality,\
    \ insufﬁcient consideration, inadequate requirement\nanalysis and bad graphical\
    \ user interfaces (GUIs) [58]. For an unmanned farm, ADDS\nneed do more performing\
    \ analysis on historical information to enhance the quality of\ndecision supports.\
    \ It also should consider provide more adequate decision supports and\nre-planning\
    \ mechanisms, the more important is to do the agricultural prediction analysis.\n\
    Agricultural Prediction Analysis\nPredictive analysis uses data, statistical algorithms\
    \ and machine learning techniques\nto determine the possibility of future results\
    \ based on historical data. AI has shown great\npotential in agricultural prediction\
    \ analysis, such as dissolved oxygen prediction [59,60],\nagricultural product\
    \ price forecasting [61], greenhouse gas emissions prediction [62] and\nagricultural\
    \ yield prediction [63,64]. For example, Liu et al. [59] study the effectiveness\
    \ of\nattention-based recurrent neural network (RNN) methods in the short-term\
    \ and long-term\nprediction of dissolved oxygen, achieve the good results in the\
    \ prediction of almost all\ntime steps.\nHowever, some of the more accurate forecasting\
    \ models require longer working\ntime. In an unmanned farm, it is necessary to\
    \ further to combining data-driven machine\nlearning (ML) and biophysical based\
    \ approaches, and optimizing their conﬁguration and\nparameters in an ensemble\
    \ learning approach [62].\nAgricultural Computer Vision\nComputer vision is an\
    \ important technology, which studies how to use a computer\nto understand the\
    \ information contained in a digital image or video at a high level [65].\nMachine\
    \ vision technology is often combined with an AI algorithm, which has been\nwidely\
    \ used in the ﬁeld of agriculture, such as species classiﬁcation [66], crop disease\n\
    recognition [67], behavior analysis [68,69] etc. Chen et al. [70] proposed neural\
    \ network\nand long short-term memory for recognition of aggressive episodes of\
    \ pigs with an accuracy\nof 97.2%. These show that AI has great application potential\
    \ in agricultural machine vision\nAmong some review conclusions [65,71], the deep\
    \ learning algorithm has the most\npotential, it has good nonlinear simulation\
    \ performance, as well as the ability to apply\nin more complex environments.\
    \ However, most of the methods proposed in the literature\nare only used in the\
    \ laboratory, and there are still some problems in practical application,\nespecially\
    \ for an unmanned farm. It is necessary to study how to use artiﬁcial intelligence\n\
    to improve the recognition accuracy in complex scenes.\nAgricultural Robot Control\n\
    Robots can work autonomously because artiﬁcial intelligence replaces human thinking.\n\
    For example, the multi-robot task system [72] aims at performing tasks automatically\
    \ by\ncontrol aerial and ground vehicles. The robot path planning [73] needs the\
    \ help of AI\ntechnology to plan the optimal path, such as Ayushman et al. [74]\
    \ used the method of\n“chase the rabbit” to plan the path of the lemniscate shape,\
    \ and the real underwater\nexperiment by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)\
    \ showed that the algorithm has\nfaster calculation speed.\nThese studies demonstrate\
    \ that AI plays an important role in smart farming. However,\nthe application\
    \ of AI in agriculture is in its infancy [75], and many difﬁculties, such as data\n\
    sets, need to be resolved for the establishment of deep learning in agriculture.\n\
    Similarly, the intelligent decision cloud platform of an unmanned farm also needs\
    \ AI\ntechnology, which is mainly reﬂected in four aspects. First, the utilization\
    \ of machine vision\ntechnology, in combination with AI technology, for the analysis\
    \ of the physiological charac-\nteristics of animals and plants can provide more\
    \ accurate data. Second, the agricultural\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 145\n11 of 26\n\
    robot equipped with AI can enhance the autonomous walking and workability of the\
    \ robot.\nThird, Big Data and AI can analyze the current data and historical database,\
    \ and predict\nthe trend of data at the next stage, so that decisions can be made\
    \ at the next stage without\ndelay. Fourth, AI technology can provide the intelligent\
    \ decision cloud platform the ability\nto think like a human and realize intelligent\
    \ decision-making and control.\nAI is the core of the intelligent decision-making\
    \ cloud platform and also the basis\nfor the realization of the unmanned farm.\
    \ Although a large amount of research has been\nconducted on the application of\
    \ AI technology in the ﬁeld of agriculture, there is still a long\nway to go before\
    \ it can be applied in an unmanned farm. Moreover, we need to increase\nnot only\
    \ the investment in agriculture to obtain more data but also the number of scholars\n\
    engaged in agricultural AI research.\n3.3.3. Cloud Computing: Stable and High-Speed\
    \ Data Storage and Computing\nAn intelligent decision cloud platform uses Big\
    \ Data technology to discover effective\ninformation and rules from massive data\
    \ processing, and then makes production decisions\nusing the AI technology. However,\
    \ because of the relatively large amount of data, using\nonly a local computer\
    \ for data calculation will greatly increase the cost and processing\ntime [76].\
    \ The emergence of cloud computing effectively solves the problem of massive\n\
    data operation and rapid data processing [77].\nCloud computing is a form of distributed\
    \ computing, i.e., the huge data computing\nprocessing program is decomposed into\
    \ numerous small programs through the cloud\nnetwork. Cloud computing provides\
    \ ﬂexible, convenient and on-demand network access\nto many conﬁgured computing\
    \ resources, which greatly improves the computing efﬁ-\nciency. Therefore, this\
    \ system has been widely used for Big Data processing. Chen proved\nthat cloud\
    \ computing is effective for optimizing cold chain logistics vehicle routing [78].\n\
    Zhou et al. demonstrated an effective solution for monitoring soil moisture in\
    \ precision\nagriculture by integrating cloud computing and information infrastructure\
    \ supporting\nweb services [79]. Liu et al. designed a modern agricultural IoT\
    \ monitoring system based\non cloud computing to reduce the development cost of\
    \ the system and ensure its relia-\nbility and security [80]. Zamora et al. constructed\
    \ a smart agriculture system based on\ncloud computing, edge computing and IoT,\
    \ and used this system in a real greenhouse\nin Southeast Spain, saving more than\
    \ 30% water and 80% of some nutrients [81].\nGiven the huge amount of data generated\
    \ during the production and operation of an\nunmanned farm, combining the cloud\
    \ computing technology with Big Data technology is\nnecessary to process and store\
    \ data. To date, many enterprises such as Amazon, Microsoft,\nAlibaba and Google\
    \ have developed cloud computing businesses and promoted the rapid\ndevelopment\
    \ of cloud computing. However, no cloud computing platform has been\nspeciﬁcally\
    \ designed for the agricultural ﬁeld, and more research is needed on information\n\
    security of the cloud computing platform.\n3.4. Auto-Work Equipment System\nArtiﬁcial\
    \ phenotypic tasks are labor-intensive, destructive and error prone [82],\nand\
    \ auto-work equipment can overcome problems in manual operations. Relying on\n\
    intelligent equipment and robots to complete work that would have been done manually\n\
    in traditional agriculture is the key to realizing the complete replacement of\
    \ artiﬁcial labor\nin an unmanned farm. Based on the sensor and transmission system,\
    \ operational equip-\nment interconnects different pieces of equipment and connects\
    \ equipment with the cloud\nplatform. The rational management and control of Big\
    \ Data, AI and the cloud platform\nwill help achieve effective docking and cooperative\
    \ operation between devices, increase\nthe environmental adaptability and working\
    \ efﬁciency of unmanned automatic operating\nequipment, and improve the intelligence\
    \ level of the unmanned farm. The auto-work equip-\nment has an information processing\
    \ system, which provides reliable hardware support for\nedge computing. Reliance\
    \ on edge computing technology can help realize the terminal\nprocessing of equipment\
    \ information and terminal control of autonomous operation.\nAgriculture 2021,\
    \ 11, 145\n12 of 26\n3.4.1. Intelligent Fixed Equipment\nIntelligent ﬁxed equipment\
    \ can complete the autonomous work tasks of the unmanned\nfarm without moving\
    \ can be independently regulated and combined with other equipment\nand agricultural\
    \ robots to carry out systematic operation control. In addition to relying on\n\
    its own intelligent control system, autonomous intelligent ﬁxed equipment also\
    \ needs to\nrely on the IoTs to achieve information exchange and intelligent decision\
    \ cloud platform to\nachieve information processing and decision-making.\nSprinkler\
    \ or drip irrigation equipment is important for crop cultivation, especially\n\
    in low-crown or orchard environments. Intelligent management of fresh water and\
    \ fertilizer\nfor precise irrigation is critical for increasing crop yield and\
    \ reducing the input cost [83],\nwhile contributing to environmental sustainability.\
    \ Based on the IoTs, automatic irrigation\nequipment can help farmers achieve\
    \ remote management [84,85]. Additionally, with\nthe help of the cloud platform,\
    \ automatic irrigation equipment can be used in an automated\nmanner without the\
    \ need for farmer interference. In the future, in unmanned management,\nautonomous\
    \ operation will be achieved by combining sensing, transmission and cloud\nplatform\
    \ systems, and the decision control of these devices will be more scientiﬁc and\n\
    intelligent.\nUnlike plant management equipment, the animal control equipment\
    \ is more diverse\nand complex, which requires higher technical support. Animal\
    \ control equipment is\ndesigned to manage the growth of a single animal through\
    \ the automatic, continuous and\nnon-invasive real-time monitoring of environmental\
    \ factors, animal health and welfare,\nproduction, reproduction, thus adding value\
    \ to the product without causing any additional\nstress to the animal [86]. Given\
    \ the large size of animals and considerable variation among\nthem, animals need\
    \ to be managed on an individual level. Smart collars (wearable devices)\nare\
    \ designed to track the health of an individual animal, and can be used to monitor\
    \ cows\nor sheep [87,88]. For example, these collars monitor the fertility of\
    \ a cow by tracking its\nmovements during the fertile period, and alert farmers\
    \ by sending messages to a laptop or\nsmartphone when the cow is ready to mate\
    \ (Figure 3). Furthermore, the collar can detect\nearly signs of disease by monitoring\
    \ the average time spent by each cow on eating and\nregurgitating.\nAgriculture\

    \ LELY Industries N.V.).\nIn chicken houses, advanced technologies such as automatic\
    \ feeding and water supply\nare commonly used (Figure 5a). In recent years, extensive\
    \ research has been carried out to\nimprove poultry production and comprehensive\
    \ beneﬁts [89]. Because of the structural\nconﬁguration of the cage production\
    \ system, a variety of automated equipment has become\na functional component\
    \ of this system. A good example is the highly automated machine\nused to collect\
    \ and sort egg layers (Figure 5b). Nonetheless, checking the health and wel-\n\
    fare of chickens and optimizing the overall management of the hen house requires\
    \ human\nintervention [90]. Currently, large chicken farms are equipped with the\
    \ cloud-based data\nmanagement system (CDMS), which can share real-time visual\
    \ data on the performance\nand feeding conditions of chicken ﬂocks in a given\
    \ chicken farm with a number of different\nchicken farms. This is conducive to\
    \ the realization of scientiﬁc management [91]. An un-\nmanned farm is committed\
    \ to intelligent management, where intelligent equipment can be\nused to replace\
    \ repetitive and frequent manual operations, such as assessing animal status,\n\
    eliminating dead chickens, maintaining indoor environmental conditions (dry cleaning,\n\
    wet washing, fertilizer removal, ventilation and sanitary treatment), inoculation,\
    \ trade-offs,\nselection of ﬂoor eggs, sorting and packaging [92,93]. A cloud\

    3.4.2. Agricultural Robots: Replace Farmers\nAgricultural robots are mobile and\
    \ autonomous operating equipment in an unmanned\nfarm; examples of agricultural\
    \ robots include ﬁeld farm ploughing and sowing machin-\nery, harvesting machinery,\
    \ plant protection machinery and other operating machinery.\nUnmanned vehicles,\
    \ unmanned surface vessels (USVs) and UAVs are the most impor-\ntant mobile equipment\
    \ on an unmanned farm. These agricultural robots not only enable\nunmanned transport\
    \ missions but also serve as a platform for carrying other intelligent\nequipment.\
    \ Mobile equipment also includes a variety of mobile robot equipment. Mobile\n\
    equipment and ﬁxed equipment execute farm operations on an unmanned farm. Effective\n\
    docking and cooperation between these equipment increase the environmental adaptability\n\
    and work efﬁciency of intelligent equipment and robots on an unmanned farm, improve\n\
    the intelligence level of the unmanned farm and help realize the replacement of\
    \ manual\noperations by machines.\nAgricultural robots are used in diverse applications,\
    \ including automatic seeding and\nharvesting (with mobile platforms and robots),\
    \ point spraying, plant health testing and\npoint pruning. Field robots play an\
    \ important role in improving operational reliability,\nenvironmental health and\
    \ crop productivity. Agricultural ﬁeld robots and manipulators\nhave become an\
    \ important part of the intelligent agricultural system [13,47]. Unmanned\ndriving\
    \ technology forms the basis of free movement of ﬁeld robots. Although operator-\n\
    free driving technology shows good performance in industry, it is still at the\
    \ development\nstage in agriculture. Because of the complexity of the agricultural\
    \ working environment,\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 145\n15 of 26\nunmanned driving\
    \ cannot develop as rapidly in agriculture as in industry. In the ﬁeld\nenvironment,\
    \ unmanned driving has been used for automatic sowing, cultivation and har-\n\
    vesting, and these processes can be monitored in real time using the data platform\
    \ [94,95].\nBecause the environment of a cultivated land system is relatively\
    \ simple and maneuverable,\nunmanned cultivation shows a great potential for realization.\n\
    Automatic harvesting platforms are one of the important achievements in the ﬁeld\
    \ of\nagricultural robotics, and there has been very good veriﬁcation in fruit\
    \ and vegetable pick-\ning. For example, Panasonic (Japan) has developed a tomato\
    \ harvesting robot, equipped\nwith its own image sensors, which can harvest tomatoes\
    \ unattended. It uses image sensors\nto detect ripe red tomatoes and then pinpoints\
    \ their shape and location. At harvesting,\nthe robot pulls on the stem without\
    \ damaging the fruit. When the harvest basket is full,\nwireless communication\
    \ technology informs the robot to automatically replace the empty\nbasket. In\
    \ addition, the yield and quality of tomatoes are recorded by data management,\n\
    and the harvest can be planned. Arad et al. analyzed the greenhouse sweet pepper\
    \ har-\nvesting robot (Figure 6a), and showed that the robot can run automatically\
    \ on pipe rails\nand concrete ﬂoors and in an end-user environment [96]. Xiong\
    \ et al. evaluated a straw-\nberry picking robot (Figure 6b) used in greenhouses,\
    \ which was able to pick individual\nstrawberries with a near-perfect success\
    \ rate of 96.8% [97]. As for agricultural robots,\nShamshiri et al. have made\
    \ a detail summary, especially those used for automatic weed\ncontrol, ﬁeld reconnaissance\
    \ and harvesting [11].\nThe robotics system is designed to replace simple manual\
    \ labor. In the future, agricul-\ntural robots will act as the “hand” and “foot”\
    \ on an unmanned farm and provide technical\nsupport for planting, cultivation,\
    \ harvesting and plant protection. The agricultural robotics\ntechnology is developing\
    \ rapidly, but the lack of stable recognition and accurate picking\nability hinder\
    \ the commercial application of harvesting robots extensively. Machine vision\n\
    technology plays an important role in alleviating such problems. Birrell and colleagues\n\
    used visual technology to locate, classify and harvest iceberg lettuce in a complex\
    \ environ-\nment [98]. Visual control technology provides important technical\
    \ support to the fruit and\nvegetable harvesting robots, and the research on picking\
    \ robots in recognition, positioning,\nall-weather operation mode and intelligent\
    \ computing indicates the possibility of robot\napplication driven by information\
    \ technology [99]. An unmanned farm relies on the ap-\nplication of these robots,\
    \ but autonomous operating platforms are currently less efﬁcient\nthan mobile\
    \ operating platforms with human participation. Smooth mechanical control\nis\
    \ the key to improving efﬁciency. The traditional PID algorithm shows high complexity\n\
    and low adaptability, while an intelligent algorithm (e.g., neural network algorithm)\
    \ can\nreduce the complexity of parameter adjustment to a certain extent and improve\

    Agriculture 2021, 11, 145\n16 of 26\nIn ﬁsh pond or lake farming, the premise\
    \ of scientiﬁc farming is to obtain key water\nrelated parameters, such as temperature,\
    \ pH, DO level, oxidation-reduction potentiometer\nand electron conduction, quickly\
    \ and in real time. At present, the development of robotic\nﬁsh (for water quality\
    \ monitoring/early warning; Figure 7) [101–103], USV (for ﬁsh density\nestimation\
    \ and water quality monitoring; Figure 8) [104], and robots (for integrating feed-\n\
    ing and water quality monitoring [105] has been initiated. The underwater mobile\
    \ robot is\na good equipment for ﬁshing and observing underwater plants and animals.\
    \ For example,\nrobots used for sea cucumber ﬁshing enable visual observation\
    \ and capture based on\nunderwater images [106] and are expected to operate autonomously\
    \ [107]. In addition,\nthe inspection robot can detect the position of dead ﬁsh,\
    \ based on deep learning, computer\nvision and positioning technology. When combined\
    \ with optical and acoustic systems\nand an automatic manipulator, the underwater\
    \ detection robot can be used for picking\ndead ﬁsh. A biomimetic robotic ﬁsh\
    \ is a ﬂexible underwater machine which can perform\nself-inspection, underwater\
    \ positioning, automatic obstacle avoidance, breeding target\ntracking, biomass\
    \ estimation and 3D monitoring of underwater aquaculture by carrying\nsensor equipment.\
    \ To performs tasks on the water surface, USVs are urgently needed.\nThe USV can\
    \ effectively reduce the sensor layout requirements in large areas or deep\nwater,\
    \ and can be used for water sampling at any designated location as well as real-time\n\
    online monitoring through the combination of dynamic nodes and static monitoring\
    \ nodes.\nMoreover, the data can be uploaded to the cloud platform, which provides\
    \ the robot with\ninstructions for the next action through calculation and decision\
    \ making. USVs can carry\nunderwater monitoring sonar for tracking ﬁsh stocks\
    \ and estimating the biomass. USVs\ncan also be used as a carrier platform for\
    \ other breeding equipment, such as an aerator,\nbait machine and harvesting equipment,\
    \ especially as the launching platform of UAV and\nbionic unmanned ﬁsh. However,\
    \ taking into account the demands of an unmanned farm,\nthe current techniques\
    \ are not mature enough. Some problems have been resolved, such as\nthe bit rate\
    \ problem of communication via remote Wi-Fi communication satellite [108],\npath\
    \ planning, autonomous obstacle avoidance and visual tracking in autonomous naviga-\n\
    tion [109–111]. However, further investigation of unattended autonomous operations\
    \ and\nﬁshing or feeding operations is needed. It will not be long before the\
    \ autonomous robots\nreplace humans in ﬁshing or feeding on the surface of the\
    \ water, just as USVs replaced\nhumans in water-quality monitoring.\nAgriculture\

    \ technology providers, agricultural equipment and machinery providers, producers\n\
    and others involved in this business. An unmanned farm uses more new information\n\
    technologies and products, involving the IoT, Big Data, AI, robotics, 5G and others,\
    \ which\nwill provide the market for the development of these technologies.\n\
    At present, the unmanned farm is only in the tentative stage. With the development\n\
    of science and technology, intelligent equipment and information industry, we\
    \ predict that\nthere will be unmanned farm with independent planning, decision-making\
    \ and manage-\nment capabilities from 2050 to 2070. In all agricultural sectors,\
    \ crop production would be\nthe ﬁrst to realize unmanned farming. This is because\
    \ the land where crops grow is easy\nto manage, and it is easier to sow, cultivate,\
    \ manage and harvest crops than other types\nof produce. The hardest aspect of\
    \ animal husbandry is that animals have uncontrollable\nfactors. Other agricultural\
    \ sectors also have weaknesses (Table 1), for example, the accuracy\nof fruit\
    \ picking robots in an actual farm is not high [97]. High-speed transmission (5G)\n\
    technology can be implemented in the farm, other technologies have some challenges\n\

    \ enhance food production, but,\nat the same time, there are many issues that\
    \ need to be solved.\nWhether the technology is compatible with unmanned farm\
    \ is the ﬁrst question\n(Table 1). An unmanned farm requires all information to\
    \ be digitized, and the data ac-\nquisition is real-time, continuous and highly\
    \ reliable. However, the special real-time\nonline sensors for agriculture are\
    \ not comprehensive, and some sensors have insufﬁcient\nlong-term stability and\
    \ reliability under complex conditions. Some intelligent agricul-\ntural robots\
    \ can be used in agriculture, but an agricultural picking robot shows low work\n\
    efﬁciency and crop recognition error, and its ﬂexible arm technology is not as\
    \ good as\nmanual picking [124]. The data obtained in agriculture is not enough\
    \ for Big Data analysis,\nand AI technology cannot replace human beings to make\
    \ correct decisions. Therefore, for\nnow, these technologies are not compatible\
    \ with driverless farms, and more research is\nneeded. But these technologies\
    \ are already compatible with smart farms [125], and their\napplications in an\
    \ unmanned farm need to be further studied in the future.\nThe second problem\
    \ is that there are still many problems in the application of big\ndata technology\
    \ in unmanned farms [126]. First, who owns the data? Farmers don’t know\nhow to\
    \ use and obtain big data. Although farmers have contributed to the development\
    \ of\ntools, they don’t have right about data collection, analysis and use [127].\
    \ Secondly, big data\nmay lead to the disclosure of their privacy [128,129]. Then,\
    \ the transparency of data use\nis not clear, and farmers are not willing to share\
    \ their data [130] unless they understand\nwhat people are doing with it [131].\
    \ Finally, how to distribute the beneﬁts brought by big\ndata is a problem. Although\
    \ farmers contribute to the data, they do not have ability to\ncontrol over the\
    \ income distribution generated by the data. These problems also exist in an\n\
    unmanned farm, such as data privacy leakage, opaque data use and fair distribution\
    \ of\nbig data revenue. It is essential for the government to establish an intermediate\
    \ regulatory\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 145\n21 of 26\nmechanism, which is responsible\
    \ for data sharing and storage, data transparent use, data\nrevenue distribution\
    \ and other tasks\nThird, how to make the transition to an unmanned farm is also\
    \ an important ques-\ntion [132]. Unmanned farm will lead to a large number of\
    \ people’s unemployment, such as\nthe reduction of production of fertilizer, feed,\
    \ pesticides and other manufacturers, resulting\nin layoffs, and the surplus of\
    \ labor force caused by farmers not having to farm land to par-\nticipate in other\
    \ industries. There are three stages of transition in the research of unmanned\n\
    farms, namely remote-control farm, unattended farm and autonomous farm. There\
    \ is some\nwork that humans need to complete in these three stages, but the number\
    \ of farmers will\nincreasingly decline, which is a slowly changing process. In\
    \ this process, the government\nneeds to increase the training of farmers, so\
    \ that farmers learn more skills.\nFinally, a lot of advanced equipment is used\
    \ in an unmanned farm, even for the larger\nfarms, and the cost of this equipment\
    \ is high, especially for developing countries [133,134].\nThis requires the joint\
    \ efforts of researchers and the state, which needs to increase subsidies\nfor\
    \ these equipment and research funds for experts, and experts need to conduct\
    \ in-depth\nresearch to reduce the cost of these machines. Similarly, farmers\
    \ can use much-needed\nequipment ﬁrst, such as unmanned harvesters.\nThe problems\
    \ described above limit the practical application of an unmanned farm.\nIn the\
    \ future, it is important to study how to solve these problems for an unmanned\
    \ farm,\nwhich requires the join efforts of the government, researchers, farmers\
    \ and enterprises\nin this direction.\n6. Conclusions\nIn this paper, we introduce\
    \ a new agricultural production mode, i.e., an unmanned\nfarm, which does not\
    \ require people to enter the farm, and uses modern information tech-\nnology\
    \ and intelligent equipment to replace manual labor with machines for the production\n\
    and management of the farm. Here, we deﬁned the unmanned farm, explained its opera-\n\
    tion principle and characteristics, and introduced the system architecture of\
    \ the unmanned\nfarm system. We also analyzed the technology needed for system\
    \ operation, and described\nthe current application of these technologies. Finally,\
    \ we summarized the challenges that\nunmanned farm faces.\nThrough the analysis\
    \ of literature, it can be concluded that unmanned farm is feasible.\nWe will\
    \ gradually realize unmanned farm in the next 50 years, which will play a role\
    \ in re-\nducing the number of environmental problems, solving the shortage of\
    \ agricultural labor\nand bringing economic beneﬁts. But at the same time, we\
    \ need to solve some problems,\nsuch as unstable sensors, inefﬁcient robots, AI\
    \ applications in complex environments, pri-\nvacy and management problems brought\
    \ by Big Data, and how to transition to unmanned\nfarm.\nWe believe that solving\
    \ these problems of unmanned farms requires joint efforts of\nthe government,\
    \ enterprises and research institutes. The government should give policy\nsupport,\
    \ such as agricultural subsidies, data security legislation and so on. Enterprises\n\
    increase production, reduce the production costs of various agricultural machinery,\
    \ and im-\nprove the utilization rate of agricultural machinery. The research\
    \ institute should study\nagricultural robots and systems with high precision,\
    \ fast response and stability in depth.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    \ such as the Internet of Things, raising the productivity of\nagricultural and\
    \ farming activities is critical to improving yields and cost-effectiveness. IoT,\
    \ in particular,\ncan improve the efficiency of agriculture and farming processes\
    \ by eliminating human intervention\nthrough automation. The fast rise of Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT)-based tools has changed nearly all life\nsectors, including\
    \ business, agriculture, surveillance, etc. These radical developments are upending\n\
    traditional agricultural practices and presenting new options in the face of various\
    \ obstacles. IoT aids in\ncollecting data that is useful in the farming sector,\
    \ such as changes in climatic conditions, soil fertility,\namount of water required\
    \ for crops, irrigation, insect and pest detection, bug location disruption of\n\
    creatures to the sphere, and horticulture. IoT enables farmers to effectively\
    \ use technology to monitor\ntheir forms remotely round the clock. Several sensors,\
    \ including distributed WSNs (wireless sensor\nnetworks), are utilized for agricultural\
    \ inspection and control, which is very important due to their exact\noutput and\
    \ utilization. In addition, cameras are utilized to keep an eye on the field from\
    \ afar. The goal\nof this research is to evaluate smart agriculture using IoT\
    \ approaches in depth. The paper demonstrates\nIoT applications, benefits, current\
    \ obstacles, and potential solutions in smart agriculture. This smart\nagricultural\
    \ system aims to find existing techniques that may be used to boost crop yield\
    \ and save time,\nsuch as water, pesticides, irrigation, crop, and fertilizer\
    \ management.\nKeywords: agriculture; land monitoring; control strategies; IoT;\
    \ sensors; economic growth; water\nmanagement and water resources\n1. Introduction\n\
    The Internet of Things (IoT) is an interconnected network of computing devices,\n\
    people with unique IDs, and the capacity to communicate via a network without\
    \ human\ninteraction. The Internet of Things (IoT) intends to connect the physical\
    \ and virtual worlds\nby interacting and exchanging data via the internet. Linked\
    \ industries, smart cities, smart\nhomes, smart energy, connected vehicles, smart\
    \ agriculture, connected buildings and\ncampuses, health care, and logistics are\
    \ all examples of IoT applications [1]. The increasing\nneed for food, both in\
    \ terms of quantity and quality, has required the development and\nmodernization\
    \ of the agricultural sector. The “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a promising set\
    \ of\ntechnologies that may be used to provide a variety of agricultural modernization\
    \ solutions.\nScientiﬁc institutions, research institutes, and the agricultural\
    \ sector are racing to provide\nmore and more IoT solutions to agricultural business\
    \ stakeholders, laying the foundation\nfor a clear role when IoT becomes a mainstream\
    \ technology [2]. The world’s biodiversity\nis anticipated to support between\
    \ 9.4 and 10.1 billion people by 2050, increasing the need\nfor specialized food\
    \ production zones, especially for harvesting and livestock. This means\nAgronomy\
    \ 2022, 12, 127. https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12010127\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n2 of 21\nthat by 2050, global food production will have\
    \ to grow by 70% [3]. Crop production is\nincreasingly crucial in agriculture,\
    \ with commodities, such as cotton, wheat, gum, and\nothers, playing signiﬁcant\
    \ roles in many nations’ economies.\nIn 2019, the IoT market was 690 billion dollars\
    \ and was projected to be 1256.1 billion\ndollars by 2025 with a 10.53% CAGR globally\
    \ from 2020 to 2025. Solutions are needed to\nassure timely and regular agricultural\
    \ growth and yield due to the combined effects of a\ngrowing population, natural\
    \ weather unpredictability, soil degradation, and climate change.\nFarm management,\
    \ animal monitoring, irrigation control, greenhouse environmental con-\ntrol,\
    \ autonomous agricultural machinery, and drones are examples of IoT applications\
    \ in\nagriculture, all of which contribute to agrarian automation. It also demands\
    \ contributing to\nagricultural food production’s long-term viability. Land appraisal,\
    \ crop protection, and\ncrop yield projection, according to these needs, are essential\
    \ to world food production [4].\nFarmers, for example, can manage ﬁeld environments\
    \ in real-time and more effortlessly\nregulate ﬁelds using wireless sensors and\
    \ mobile networks. Farmers may also utilize IoT\ntechnology to capture essential\
    \ data, subsequently creating yield maps that enable precision\nagriculture to\
    \ produce low-cost high-quality crops [5]. Figure 1 depicts the smart precision\n\
    agriculture cycle.\nFigure 1. Smart precision agriculture cycle.\nSmart agriculture\
    \ is becoming increasingly important to farmers in the modern day,\nand it will\
    \ become even more critical in the future to ensure proper ﬁeld expansion and\n\
    crop output. Unfortunately, traditional farming methods are not up to the task\
    \ of meeting\nrising demand. As a result, the ground stays barren and devoid of\
    \ fertility due to poor\nutilization of nutrients, water management, light, fertilizers,\
    \ and pesticides. Crop diseases,\nwater shortage, irrigation, and pesticide control\
    \ monitoring are only some of the challenges\nthat different IoT automation and\
    \ control systems can efﬁciently address [6]. This is why\ncontemporary agriculture\
    \ employs smart equipment and tools from sowing through crop\nharvesting, storage,\
    \ and transportation. The operation is smart and cost-effective due to its\naccurate\
    \ monitoring capabilities and fast reporting using a range of sensors. Autonomous\n\
    drones, harvesters, tractors, satellites, and robots are now complementing agricultural\n\
    equipment. Sensors may be instantly placed and begin collecting data, which is\
    \ then\nimmediately available for further analysis over the internet. By enabling\
    \ reliable data\ngathering at each place, sensor technology allows crop and site-speciﬁc\
    \ agriculture [7].\nUsing advanced control methods to automate agricultural activities\
    \ has increased crop\nproduction while also improving soil fertility.\nThe following\
    \ are the signiﬁcant contributions made by this study:\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n\
    3 of 21\n•\nThe world’s expectations of the agriculture industry, based on existing\
    \ IoT approaches\nfor providing solutions and new applications and technology.\n\
    •\nIdentiﬁcation of numerous application ﬁelds, as well as a summary of the most\
    \ recent\nstate-of-the-art literature on IoT technology.\n•\nThe Internet of Things’\
    \ task is to address these constraints and other challenges, such\nas resource\
    \ scarcity and precise usage, climate change, etc.\nThe rest of the paper is laid\
    \ out in the following manner. Section 2 delves into the\ndetails of smart agricultural\
    \ applications based on IoT technologies. Section 3 discusses the\nmany types\
    \ of equipment and technology available. Section 4 identiﬁes unsolved problems\n\
    and potential remedies. Finally, Section 5 concludes the research.\n2. Major Applications\
    \ of Smart Agriculture\nPrecision farming, animal monitoring, and greenhouse monitoring\
    \ are a few agri-\ncultural businesses utilizing the Internet of Things. Every\
    \ element of traditional farming\noperation may be substantially improved by combining\
    \ cutting-edge sensors and Internet\nof Things technology. At the moment, the\
    \ Internet of Things’ (IoT’s) and wireless sensors’\nharmonious incorporation\
    \ into smart agriculture can catapult agriculture to formerly in-\nconceivable\
    \ heights. Appropriateness of land, pest monitoring and control, irrigation, and\n\
    yield optimization are just a few of the conventional agricultural issues that\
    \ IoT may assist\nin resolving through the implementation of smart agriculture\
    \ approaches [7]. Figure 2\nillustrates the comprehensive paradigm of smart agricultural\
    \ monitoring system applica-\ntions, facilities, and sensors. Agriculture applications\
    \ are classiﬁed as IoT agricultural apps,\nsmartphone-based agricultural apps,\
    \ and sensor-based agricultural apps. Wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSNs) have recently\
    \ been used to enable IoT applications for smart agriculture,\nincluding irrigation\
    \ sensor networks, frost event prediction, precision agriculture and soil\nfarming,\
    \ smart farming, and unsighted object recognition, among others [8]. Signiﬁcant\n\
    instances of how new technology assists in the general improvement of efﬁciency\
    \ at various\nstages are included here.\nFigure 2. General paradigm of smart agriculture.\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n4 of 21\n2.1. Monitoring of Soil Moisture and Water Levels\n\
    Soil monitoring has developed into one of the most challenging agricultural areas,\n\
    both for manufacturers and farmers. Numerous environmental issues associated with\
    \ soil\nmonitoring affect agricultural yield. When these sorts of obstacles are\
    \ correctly identiﬁed,\nfarming patterns and methods become readily understandable.\
    \ The soil’s moisture content,\nwetness, fertilizer application, and temperature\
    \ trends are all being monitored. Soil’s\nmoisture environment management system\
    \ uses soil humidity and moisture sensors. By\nproposing an appropriate fertilizer\
    \ approach, the results of a soil monitoring test report\nassist farmers in increasing\
    \ crop yield [9]. The sensor can read both analog and digital\noutputs. The judgment\
    \ is made based on data collected from sensors and compared to\npredeﬁned threshold\
    \ levels. The soil moisture sensor is used to regulate the irrigation\nsystem’s\
    \ automatic operation. When the moisture level goes below the threshold value,\
    \ the\nwater pump is triggered [10].\nSoil mapping enables you to sow many crop\
    \ types in the same ﬁeld, allowing you\nto match better soil characteristics,\
    \ such as seed compatibility, sowing timing, and even\nplanting depth, as certain\
    \ crops are deeply rooted while others are not. Additionally,\ngrowing many crops\
    \ concurrently may result in more prudent agricultural practices, such\nas resource\
    \ conservation. The system is composed of a distributed network of soil moisture\n\
    and temperature sensors located in the root zone of the plant, as well as rain\
    \ sensors\nlocated in various zones. The microcontroller collects and transmits\
    \ all sensor data and\ninformation. In addition, a temperature and soil moisture\
    \ threshold algorithm will be\ndevised and implemented in a microcontroller-based\
    \ gateway to regulate the amount of\nwater given to the ﬁelds. Finally, the user\
    \ is provided with control via an IoT module based\non rain sensor data to interrupt\
    \ or restart water ﬂow as needed [11].\nIf the ﬁeld contains an adequate amount\
    \ of water, no water will be pumped into\nit. However, when the soil’s water moisture\
    \ content falls below a predetermined level,\nwater is pumped into the ﬁeld until\
    \ the desired moisture content is attained. The DHT11\nsensor monitors the ﬁeld’s\
    \ temperature and humidity. In addition, a PIR motion sensor\ndetects when an\
    \ intruder (human or animal) enters the area. Consequently, sensor values\nare\
    \ continually monitored and displayed on the farmer’s mobile device through a\
    \ GSM\nsim900A module, which includes a sim card with a 3G data pack and adds\
    \ IoT capabilities\nto the system [12].\n2.2. System of Irrigation Monitoring\n\
    Numerous studies have been conducted on a smart irrigation system. Food production\n\
    technology must signiﬁcantly improve to keep up with the growing demand for food.\n\
    Numerous experts have worked diligently to create an alternative to irrigated\
    \ farming.\nThese efforts, however, have not yet resulted in a feasible solution\
    \ to the irrigation system’s\npresent problems. At the moment, crop irrigation\
    \ is carried out manually and by established\ncustomary practices. When crops\
    \ are given less water, they grow slower and absorb less\ncalcium. Frequent irrigation\
    \ kills roots and wastes water. As a result, accurate irrigation\nof crops becomes\
    \ a considerable difﬁculty [13]. A smart irrigation management and\nmonitoring\
    \ approach is developed to enable autonomous delivery of sufﬁcient water from\n\
    a tank to ﬁeld crops. Automatic sensor systems are cost-effective, offered for\
    \ determining\nwhether plants require watering based on information gathered from\
    \ monitoring and\nregulating the soil water levels to minimize dryness or overﬂow\
    \ [14].\nKamaruddin et al., 2019 [15] developed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based\
    \ wireless sen-\nsor network (WSN) architecture that manually or automatically\
    \ administers and monitors\nthe irrigation system. The proposed method used NRF24L01\
    \ and Arduino tools as the\ncommunication network transceiver and CPU. The soil\
    \ moisture sensor data will be sent to\nthe base station via NRF24L01. Then, the\
    \ sensor node’s data will be sent to the cloud server\nthrough the base station.\
    \ This project utilized Thingspeak as a cloud server to store all data\nin a database\
    \ and connect it to an Android application.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n5 of 21\n\
    2.3. Fertilizer Administration\nAkshaya et al., 2020 [16] proposed an IOT-based\
    \ technique and upgraded the previous\nsystem, which predicted agricultural yields\
    \ using backpropagation and a random forest\nalgorithm. It recommends fertilizer\
    \ application rates and exclusively monitors atmospheric\ndata via a mobile network\
    \ and pump on/off action. The suggested technique utilizes\na segmented tank to\
    \ collect NPK fertilizer and water. The user can select one of three\nmodes (manual,\
    \ auto, or smart). In manual mode, the user is provided with the fertil-\nizer\
    \ and water ratios for well-known plants and fertilizers. In auto mode, all required\n\
    is to know the plant’s name to select the appropriate fertilizer and water ratio.\
    \ Finally,\nin smart mode, if the user cannot recognize the plant’s name, fertilizer\
    \ ratio, or water,\nthe plant’s name, fertilizer ratio, and water will be recommended\
    \ automatically. The IoT\nmodule will continuously collect information on the\
    \ temperature and soil moisture. The in-\nformation collected will be stored in\
    \ the IoT cloud. The mobile phone will inform you\nwhenever the given data changes\
    \ and the needed fertilizer ratio will be shown on the liquid\ncrystal display.\n\
    2.4. Crop Diseases and Pest Control\nHuman operators frequently monitor insect\
    \ pests via time-consuming and costly on-\nsite inspections, which results in\
    \ low spatial and temporal resolution. Remote monitoring\nhas been possible due\
    \ to advancements in remote sensing, electronics, and informatics.\nMonitoring\
    \ costs and effectiveness can be optimized through the deployment of camera-\n\
    equipped traps. With minimum human intervention, image analysis algorithms can\
    \ locate\nand count insect pests captured in traps automatically.\nReddy et al.,\
    \ 2019 [17] created an IoT-based system for disease and insect pest man-\nagement\
    \ in agriculture and the prediction of plant climatic factors. The integrated\
    \ sensors\nhelp in the measurement of soil and atmospheric moisture and humidity.\
    \ These features\nhelp determine the environmental conditions in which the plant\
    \ ﬂourishes and the plants’\nillnesses. It detects disease on the ﬁeld and sprays\
    \ prescribed insecticides. Web cameras\ntake images that are then preprocessed\
    \ to include RGB to grayscale conversion, defect\ndetection, image scaling, image\
    \ enhancement, and edge detection. SVM is utilized to\ncategorize characteristics\
    \ generated from Citrus Canker diseases, such as energy, kurtosis,\nskewness,\
    \ and entropy (damaged Lemon crop). The Arm7 microcontroller is used for\nhardware,\
    \ power, sensors, and motor driver control. Once the illness is identiﬁed, the\n\
    program will propose fertilizers and transmit the results to an LCD and the recommended\n\
    fertilizers. By pump, the fertilizers will be sprayed on the diseased leaves.\
    \ This study was\nconﬁned to the lemon plant to demonstrate that the same method\
    \ may be used for various\ncrops with favorable outcomes in the future.\nA solution\
    \ is presented for forecasting and detecting grape disease using the CNN\napproach\
    \ and real-time gathered data on environmental factors. First, the CNN technique\n\
    is utilized to analyze the leaf images. Then, different layers of the CNN method\
    \ are used\nto create the image. Finally, it is scaled to a speciﬁc resolution\
    \ before data is sent into\nthe CNN layers for training and testing. The suggested\
    \ algorithm was evaluated on four\ndiseases known to have a higher effect on grape\
    \ production. The diseases include esca\nblack measles, anthracnose, leaf blight,\
    \ and black rot. This gadget not only detects but also\nforecasts illnesses based\
    \ on historical weather data. On the other side, the readings from\nthe humidity,\
    \ temperature, and soil moisture sensors are transferred through Raspberry\nPi\
    \ to Microsoft’s Azure Cloud. Following this, the sensor readings are used to\
    \ anticipate\nthe illness using a trained linear regression model. Based on the\
    \ ﬁndings of the preceding\ndetection and prediction stages, suggestions for appropriate\
    \ fertilizers in the right quantities\nwill be provided to minimize fertilizer\
    \ misuse and cost savings [18].\nTo detect pests in rice during ﬁeld production\
    \ and avoid rice loss, the Internet of Things\nsupported a model-based UAV with\
    \ the Imagga cloud offered. The Internet of Things-based\nUAV was developed on\
    \ AI mechanisms and the Python programming prototype to transmit\nrice disease\
    \ images to the Imagga cloud and supply insect data. The Approach identiﬁes the\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n6 of 21\ndisease and insects by integrating the conﬁdence\
    \ ratings of the labels. The label identiﬁes\nthe objects in the images. To determine\
    \ the pest, the tag with the greatest conﬁdence\nresults and more than or equal\
    \ to the threshold is chosen equal to the target label. If pests\nare discovered\
    \ in the rice, statistics will be transferred to the ﬁeld owner directly to take\n\
    preventative actions. The suggested method is capable of detecting all pests that\
    \ inﬂuence\nrice production. On the other hand, this research attempted to minimize\
    \ rice waste during\nproduction by conducting insect monitoring at regular intervals\
    \ [19]. Table 1 summarizes\nmany current smart agricultural applications.\nTable\

    \ harvesting, warehouses, gas station), and\ntrack the location of objects in\
    \ the ﬁeld (e.g., soil\nsampling for agrochemical laboratory) by eFarmer\nApplication.\n\

    \ it\nmay be used to its full potential. It determines the\noptimal fertilizer\
    \ mixture created to cover the\nneeded nutrient suspension and considers the\n\
    demands of diverse yields. In addition, it considers\nthe cost of fertilizer based\
    \ on current market pricing.\n2.5. Yield Monitoring, Forecasting and Harvesting\n\
    The AWS IoT platform has been proposed for crop prediction using temperature and\n\
    rainfall monitoring. The Raspberry Pi is utilized as a gateway for remote monitoring\
    \ in this\nstudy. Raspberry Pi can connect with sensors to operate applications,\
    \ such as the DHT11\nTemperature Sensor and Soil Moisture Sensor, which forecasts\
    \ temperature and rainfall\nranges. The gateway is integrated with Amazon Web\
    \ Services’ (AWS) IoT platform. MQTT\nis a messaging protocol that allows for\
    \ various messages across distant connections [20].\nThe study reported establishing\
    \ an autonomous greenhouse smart aquaponics man-\nagement organized on temperature\
    \ via the use of an Android-based monitoring and\nautomatic correction system\
    \ and a Raspberry Pi-based plant growth monitoring system.\nReal-time data is\
    \ collected using the light intensity sensor and the ambient temperature\nand\
    \ humidity sensors. Additionally, the pH and temperature of the recirculating\
    \ water\nare monitored. Suppose the data acquired is beyond the threshold range.\
    \ In this case, the\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n7 of 21\nsystem quickly engages the\
    \ correction devices, which comprise a peristaltic buffer device,\nan aerator,\
    \ an evaporative cooler, inlet and exhaust fans, and grow lights. The internet\n\
    remote access function enables real-time data transmission and receipt through\
    \ the android\napp amongst the smartphone and computer system. This study compared\
    \ plant devel-\nopment in smart aquaponics to traditional agriculture based on\
    \ soil systems employing\nimage processing in two investigational operations.\
    \ Following record collection, it was\ndetermined that the smart aquaponics system\
    \ achieved greater output than conventional\nagriculture monitoring. As lettuce,\
    \ mustard greens, and pak choi are produced in a smart\naquaponics system vs.\
    \ traditional soil-based farming, this study focused exclusively on\nlettuce,\
    \ mustard greens, and pak choi [21].\nA tree topology was used for the WSN-enabled\
    \ agricultural monitoring system to\nimprove performance. A cheap sensor node\
    \ like a commercial sensor or a NodeMCU\nmodule transmits data to the control\
    \ unit over Wi-Fi. Fertilizer, fertigation improvement,\nand agricultural operations\
    \ are monitored by data processing and thresholding. The in-\ncorporation of cost-effective\
    \ ICT technology with traditional crop management or weather\nmonitoring and sensor\
    \ data created the agronomic model. Minimal environmental impact\nfrom crop growing\
    \ was achieved as a consequence of large fertilizer and water savings [22].\n\
    2.6. Climate Conditions Monitoring\nIn farming, the weather is extremely important.\
    \ Incorrect climate knowledge can\nhave an impact on crop quality and quantity.\
    \ On the other hand, farmers may use IoT\nsolutions to put sensors in the ﬁeld,\
    \ including humidity sensors, temperature sensors,\nrainfall sensors, and water\
    \ level sensors, to collect real-time data from the environment.\nThese sensors\
    \ monitor the state of crops and the environment in which they grow. If a\nworrying\
    \ environmental situation is discovered, it is either automatically corrected\
    \ or a\nwarning is sent to the farmer.\nGreenhouses created an Internet of Things-based\
    \ weather station to address the cost\nand accuracy issues. The TI CC2650 Sensor\
    \ Tag and IBM Cloud Platform continuously\nmonitor weather and abiotic factors,\
    \ transfer the detected values to the cloud, and send\ne-mail notiﬁcations when\
    \ values deviate. As a result, this study may be expanded to\ninclude the use\
    \ of ML model-based classiﬁcation training to categorize a plant’s health as\n\
    excellent, moderate, or terrible based on the average temperature, humidity, light\
    \ intensity,\nand air pressure. This would help to clarify abstracts about a plant’s\
    \ health to a larger level\nand might aid in keeping the plants’ health in good\
    \ shape [23].\nArifﬁn et al. [24] used an autonomous temperature control system\
    \ to address the\ndrawbacks of traditional growing methods, which are expensive,\
    \ have low yields, and\nneed a lot of care. The suggested IoT-based architecture\
    \ was evaluated in a real-world\nsetting at the Bandar Puteri Centre of NASOM\
    \ (National Autism Society of Malaysia).\nThe ideal temperature for oyster mushrooms\
    \ is between 20 and 30 ◦C, with a humidity\nlevel of 70 to 80%. Two sensors were\
    \ installed in the mushroom house’s center and corner\nto detect temperature and\
    \ moisture, then communicated to a remote monitoring station\nthrough a microcontroller\
    \ unit for further action. The results of the six-day experiment\nrevealed that\
    \ an effective automatic monitoring system, which can regulate the farm’s\nhome\
    \ while reducing resources and human labor, was developed. The mushroom home,\n\
    IoT control box, and Web Client interface were all designed within the system.\
    \ As a result,\nthe mushroom house provided a regulated environment for mushroom\
    \ growing as well as\nprotection from pests and insects. The climate control system,\
    \ which automates controlling\nthe ideal environment for oyster mushroom production,\
    \ was housed in the IoT control box.\n3. Major Equipment and Technologies\nMajor\
    \ equipment and IoT technologies are fully demonstrated in the next subsections,\n\
    such as various sensors, agricultural drones, and harvesting robots.\nAgronomy\
    \ 2022, 12, 127\n8 of 21\n3.1. Sensors\nThe visual sensor, multispectral sensor,\
    \ thermal sensor, lidar sensor, and hyperspectral\nsensor are only a few of the\
    \ sensors utilized in IoT-based smart agriculture and drone\ntechnologies. Current\
    \ IoT-based sensor applications in smart agriculture are presented in\nTable 2.\n\
    Table 2. IoT-based sensors in smart agriculture used to increase production.\n\
    Sensors\nOperations of Different Sensors\nDHT11 Sensor:\nDHT11 sensor measures\
    \ temperature and humidity\n[12].\nSEN0193: Soil Moisture Sensor\nSEN0193 is a\
    \ Soil Moisture Sensor. The dielectric\npermittivity of soil is a consequence\
    \ of its moisture\ncontent. The sensor generates a voltage proportional\nto the\
    \ dielectric permittivity of the soil and hence to\nits water content. The sensor\
    \ takes an average of the\nwater content over its whole length. The Soil\nMoisture\
    \ Sensor is used to quantify moisture loss\nover time due to plant absorption\
    \ and evaporation,\ndetermine optimal soil moisture information for\ndifferent\
    \ plant species, monitor soil moisture\ninformation in greenhouses to regulate\
    \ irrigation,\nand optimize bottle biology research. [20].\nTurbidity Sensor SKU\
    \ SEN0189:\nThe turbidity sensor determines the quality of water\nby detecting\
    \ its turbidity level. It detects suspended\nparticles in water using light by\
    \ measuring the light\ntransmittance and scattering rate, which vary the\nquantity\
    \ of total suspended solids (TSS) in the water\n[25].\nMH-Z14A:\nThis is used\
    \ to monitor the CO2 level at high\nprecision.\nBH1750:\nThis is used to monitor\
    \ the light intensity level (as\nphotosynthesis is related to light intensity)\
    \ and to\nconduct experiments on the inﬂuence of light\nintensity on the greenhouse\
    \ environment’s\ntemperature [26].\nRain sensor:\nA rain sensor is a simple instrument\
    \ for detecting\nrain pressure. It may be used as a switch to\ndetermine the strength\
    \ of rainfall when a raindrop\nfalls through the rainy board [27,28].\nLidar sensor:\n\
    The top camera sensor is an imaging range camera\nthat estimates the distance\
    \ between the camera and\nthe subject at each point in the collected images [29].\n\
    3.2. Agricultural Drones\nUAVs can monitor the health of crops, apply pesticides,\
    \ and take hyperspectral images\nin precision agriculture. Drones can scan a crop\
    \ for issues in plants using visible and\nnear-infrared light, and they can determine\
    \ which plants reﬂect what quantities of green\nand NIR light. Photosynthetic\
    \ activity diminishes when a plant is stressed. This data may\nbe used to create\
    \ numerous images that track plant changes and indicate their health. As a\nresult,\
    \ farmers can more accurately administer treatments after a disease has been identiﬁed.\n\
    Drones are also utilized for surveillance, trafﬁc monitoring, and weather monitoring\
    \ in\nagriculture. Drone technology employs various sensors, including optical,\
    \ multispectral,\nthermal, lidar, and hyperspectral sensors, which are brieﬂy\
    \ detailed in Section 3.1.\nCrop management has beneﬁted from the Internet of\
    \ Things, remote sensing, and\nanalytic data approaches. Pests may be identiﬁed,\
    \ targeted, and managed to utilize remote\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n9 of 21\nsensing\
    \ using UAVs. UAVs can ﬂy in tough and harsh terrains to take high-resolution\n\
    images that allow pests to be identiﬁed and controlled. Many crop security concerns\
    \ may\nbe solved using UAVs equipped with cameras, which are not possible with\
    \ traditional pest\nmanagement methods. UAVs have been used to automate insect\
    \ damage in agricultural\nareas [30,31].\nAn automated rotating device based on\
    \ sun illumination angle perception keeps the\nsolar panel perpendicular to the\
    \ sun and increases solar energy harvesting rates. Based on\nspectrum analysis\
    \ technology, Internet of Things approaches, including several wireless\ntechnologies,\
    \ such as TVWS, ZigBee, and LoRa, are suggested to collect data and send it\n\
    to a base station/gateway to assess the degree of damage caused by pests and diseases.\n\
    In addition, a technique for maximizing wind force usage and to extend the time\
    \ of ﬂight for\ndrones has been established to support drones in downwind by designing\
    \ the ﬂying path\nimplementation. The study’s scope is limited, with the goal\
    \ of developing a long-standing\ninsect and disease detection technique through\
    \ extensive data gathering and analysis.\nThe suggested model will be tested in\
    \ real-world scenarios. For example, crop diseases\nand insects might be tracked\
    \ in real-time and climatic changes could be analyzed [32].\nThe Internet of Things-based\
    \ approach is illustrated for smart agriculture monitoring in\nFigure 3.\nFigure\
    \ 3. IOT-based smart agriculture monitoring system.\n3.3. Harvesting Robots\n\
    Under speciﬁc climatic circumstances, a harvesting robot is intended to gather\
    \ fruits\nautonomously. The advancement of vision-based harvesting robots’ mechanism\
    \ is yet in its\nearly stages. Agricultural robotic systems, on the other hand,\
    \ have comparable architecture.\nThe system is comprised of an autonomous mobile\
    \ platform, a lightweight mechanical\narm with multiple degrees of freedom, an\
    \ adaptable end effector for a power response\nsystem, a multi-sensor machine\
    \ vision system, a smart decision and drive management\nsystem, and supplementary\
    \ hardware and software [33]. Kang et al., 2020 [34] developed\nan intense neural\
    \ network to assist robotic apple harvesting, which detects and grasps\nfruit\
    \ in a real-time environment using a computer vision system. The proposed robotic\n\
    harvesting system was implemented using a customized soft end-effector comprised\
    \ of\nIntel i7-6700 CPU and NVIDIA GTX-1070 GPU and DELL-INSPIRATION main computer\n\
    unit, Intel D-435 RGBD visualization camera, and UR5 Universal Robot (modern robotic\n\
    manipulator). The proposed approach uses Mobile-DasNet, a computationally efﬁcient\n\
    lightweight one-stage instance segmentation network to conduct fruit recognition\
    \ and\ninstance segmentation on sensory input. An improved PointNet model was\
    \ also developed\nto conduct fruit modeling and grip estimates from an RGB-D camera\
    \ through the point\nclouds technique. The two qualities described above were\
    \ utilized and integrated to\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n10 of 21\ndevelop and build\
    \ a precise robotic system for autonomous fruit picking. The goal of the\nstudy\
    \ was to improve the vision algorithm’s performance, boost, and improvements.\n\
    Furthermore, the proposed soft end-effector robotic device may improve its grasping\n\
    recognition proportion and effectiveness under various situations. Ogorodnikova\
    \ and\nAli [35] devised a technique for recognizing ripe tomatoes in a greenhouse\
    \ setting using a\nmachine vision system of a harvesting robot. To effectively\
    \ execute the suggested image\nprocessing method for this purpose, RGB color images\
    \ from a typical digital camera are\nrequired. In the second stage, RGB color\
    \ images are converted to HSV, which is easier\nfor extracting red tomato from\
    \ the green backdrop in the image. Image segmentation,\nthresholding, and morphological\
    \ operations separate a red tomato from a green background\ncolor photograph.\
    \ The algorithm is built using Matlab methods and then evaluated to see\nif it\
    \ produces favorable results. The process can be converted into fast-acting codes\
    \ for the\nharvesting robot’s controller since it is basic and short. The research\
    \ is limited to moving\nthe gripper to the proper place in tomato detection and\
    \ developing efﬁcient algorithms\nusing 3D gripper models to transform the existing\
    \ research system into industrial robots.\nOnly a few robotic devices that can\
    \ successfully perform watering, planting, and\nweeding activities now exist.\
    \ FaRo (Cultivating RObot), a new smart robot based on a CNC\nmachine, has been\
    \ presented for automatic crop farming deprived of human involvement in\nagriculture.\
    \ What sets FaRo apart from other farming platforms is its capability to complete\n\
    the entire farming cycle, from sowing to harvesting. In addition, the FaRo harvesting\n\
    tool will be discussed and shown. FarmBot can only be used for a limited time,\
    \ from\nsowing to harvesting, after which the robot’s tool mount system will be\
    \ exchanged for crop\nharvest. In this example, the robot assumes the role of\
    \ a tomato collector. Both the FaRo\nharvesting robot and the unique kinematics\
    \ of the continuum manipulator design were\nthoroughly discussed. Due to implementation\
    \ problems, the robot’s design is currently in\nthe development stage. The objective\
    \ of the proposed system is to build a model with an\nintelligent agricultural\
    \ monitoring technique linked to the main database, and the robot\nwill have sufﬁcient\
    \ information to plant and cultivate crops without the need for human\nintervention\
    \ [36].\nA depth vision-based approach for detecting and placing truck containers\
    \ is proposed\nfor the joint harvesting system, along with three coordinate systems.\
    \ This method included\ndata preprocessing, point cloud poses transformation using\
    \ the SVD (singular value decom-\nposition) algorithm, upper edge segmentation\
    \ and projection, RANSAC (Random Sample\nConsensus) algorithm edge line extraction\
    \ and corner point positioning, and fusion and\nvisualization of results on the\
    \ depth image. Field trials show that the suggested approach\nis effective in\
    \ identifying and positioning vehicles. However, the study is restricted due\n\
    to its sensitivity to the appearance of truck containers and the presence of loud\
    \ sites in\nthe agricultural area. Autonomous driving and path planning in the\
    \ forage harvester’s\nunloading system is still challenging [37].\nIntelligent\
    \ robots have become extensively employed in various sectors as the in-\ntelligent\
    \ computer industry with automation expands. Currently, manual labor is still\n\
    used to harvest the majority of domestic crops. However, owing to constant worker\
    \ pay\nhikes, the manual picking technique increases the fruit farmer’s ﬁnancial\
    \ expenditures,\nand the appliances of robots in the farming business are challenging.\
    \ As a result, the\nsmart moveable robot picker has been introduced based on computer\
    \ vision machinery by\nincorporating the robot arm, selector, ﬂexible carrier,\
    \ track procedure, and the intelligence\nunit, which accomplishes the robot picker’s\
    \ travel channel coding, auto-judging the ripe\nfruit, and in addition a vision-based\
    \ binocular stereoscopic methodology employed for the\nfunctions of recognition\
    \ and placement. To begin with, precise segmentation recognition\nand maturity\
    \ evaluation of the target fruit is required for proper picking. Thus, the robot\n\
    picker may potentially replace human labor in manual picking. The most important\
    \ part\nof the recognition process is gathering fruit image samples, which is\
    \ performed using a\nCCD camera that shoots following the preprocessed fruit features\
    \ using image content.\nThe color model is then built up, and it separates the\
    \ fruit and surrounding surroundings\nusing segmentation technology before recognizing\
    \ the fruit. Additionally, it precisely traces\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n11 of\
    \ 21\nand goes for the fruit location in relation to the three-dimensional coordinate\
    \ information\nprovided by the infrared source and the fruit contour and image\
    \ differences taken by\nthe two cameras simultaneously. To ﬁnish the picking operation,\
    \ it must program the\npath recognition to avoid the obstacle [38]. The overall\
    \ architecture of IoT-based fruit\nidentiﬁcation for harvesting is shown in Figure\
    \ 4.\nFigure 4. General architecture of IoT-based fruit detection for harvesting.\n\
    4. Open Issues and Key Challenges in Smart Agriculture\nThe problems of deploying\
    \ IoT-based agricultural systems are discussed in this section.\nThe sensors’\
    \ durability and cost are described. The IoT-based system requires a constant\n\
    source of electricity. Depending on the size, a lot of electricity may be required.\
    \ However,\nin rural and village communities, obtaining such electricity is challenging.\
    \ To meet the\nenergy requirement, alternative energy sources, such as solar and\
    \ wind, must be employed.\nThis will also raise the price signiﬁcantly. It is\
    \ necessary to have a dependable internet\nconnection in rural and village regions.\
    \ It is the most crucial aspect of establishing an\nIoT-based system. The connection\
    \ must have a sufﬁcient bandwidth to transport data in\naccordance with the application’s\
    \ requirements. Farmers need basic computer/tablet (HID\ndevice) training and\
    \ an understanding of how the IoT system operates. It is also necessary\nto provide\
    \ proper education on the unique IoT deployment in their farm [39].\nThere are\
    \ six major obstacles to developing a green IoT-based agriculture system,\ninvolving\
    \ infrastructure, mobility, maintenance, hardware, data privacy, data analytics,\
    \ and\ndata security. The selection of meters and sensors used for Internet of\
    \ Things tools is one\nof the hardware issues. As a result, many different sensors\
    \ may be utilized in Internet of\nThings applications, such as the water quality\
    \ sensor, humidity sensor, chemical sensor,\npressure sensor, temperature sensor,\
    \ and more. The data analytics problem is machine\nlearning, deep learning methods,\
    \ and prediction algorithm applications in smart agricul-\nture to produce a nutritional\

    One of the most challenging aspects of robotic grasping is estimation. Traditional\n\
    techniques have limitations since noise or partial loss of the point cloud might\
    \ impact the\nestimation’s accuracy and resilience. Estimation is more difﬁcult\
    \ in orchard situations than\nit was in interior environments.\nData Handling\
    \ and Processing\nTraditional vision algorithms’ performance is constantly restricted\
    \ in complicated\nand volatile settings [34]. World food consumption is predicted\
    \ to treble by 2050 due to\npopulation expansion and societal progress, yet increasing\
    \ food production is now difﬁcult\ndue to declining water, climate alterations,\
    \ less proper soil, and insects and illnesses. Pests\nand diseases have always\
    \ been signiﬁcant stumbling blocks to increased grain output.\nSatellite technology\
    \ is climate sensitive and has a limited illumination variation, making it\nchallenging\
    \ to satisfy the requirement for insects and infection management in farming\n\
    areas. Currently, low-altitude autonomous drones (offering excellent ﬂexibility\
    \ and image\nresolution) can satisfy the needs of agricultural insect and infection\
    \ management. In some\ncircumstances, such as when there is a high wind, drone\
    \ stability might be difﬁcult. As a\nresult, the drone’s ﬂight route must be designed\
    \ in conjunction with the actual conditions.\nLong ﬂights are necessary for ﬁeld\
    \ pest and disease data collection; thus, choosing a sunny\nday with a moderate\
    \ breeze might be a viable alternative [32]. Identifying malicious and\ncompromised\
    \ nodes among soil sensors interacting with the base station is a signiﬁcant\n\
    problem in the base station to cloud communications. The trust management method\
    \ is\npresented as one of the options for identifying these nodes in a lightweight\
    \ manner.\nFinally, the study highlighted the existing problems and possibilities\
    \ and future re-\nsearch in vegetable and fruit identiﬁcation and placement. The\
    \ majority of previous research\nshowed that illumination variations, grouping,\
    \ and unconstrained situations have been the\nmain obstacles to effective recognition\
    \ and localization of vegetables and fruits in the ﬁeld.\nFurther research will\
    \ be required to overcome the existing state-of-the-art challenges and\nenhance\
    \ the performance, accuracy, efﬁciency, effectiveness, recognition, and success\
    \ rate\nof controlling and image processing techniques. However, fruit recognition,\
    \ detection, posi-\ntioning, harvesting robots, and application robustness enhancement\
    \ need to minimize the\ninclusive computational cost and time. Future research\
    \ might include algorithms and cam-\nera operation advancements, sensor platforms\
    \ that can enhance illumination consistently,\nhorticultural changes, and human–machine\
    \ collaboration [29]. Furthermore, sophisticated\nmethodologies, algorithms, and\
    \ computational approaches are necessary to address the\nlack of precision in\
    \ harvesting operations.\n5. Discussion and Analysis\nIt is estimated that plant\
    \ diseases are a signiﬁcant contributor to global ﬁnancial\ndeﬁcits. Numerous\
    \ abiotic and biotic stresses and continual tension monitoring concerns\nthe impacts\
    \ of the loss of fruit-producing plants. Consequently, the $15 billion U.S. apple\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n14 of 21\nindustry loses millions of dollars every year.\
    \ Fruits are one of the most signiﬁcant sources\nof nutrients in plants; yet,\
    \ illnesses, pests, fungous, infectious, and microbial diseases all\naffect the\
    \ quality and quantity of fruits. Using computer vision-based methods, the issue\n\
    may now be alleviated. Diseases/infections may be detected early and effectively\
    \ using\nthese methods.\nThe sickness classiﬁcation of various fruit leaves was\
    \ achieved using a deep convolu-\ntional neural network DCNN approach. The deep\
    \ features are retrieved by ﬁrst utilizing\ndeep learning networks, such as AlexNet\
    \ and VGG-s, and then tweaked using a transfer\nlearning approach. Before the\
    \ selection step, a multi-level fusion strategy is offered, and\nthe chosen features\
    \ analyzed to produce the entropy basis features. To categorize the\nobtained\
    \ feature map, we employed a multi-SVM classiﬁer. The diseases investigated in\n\
    the experiments include apple rust, scab, black rot, peach bacterial spots, and\
    \ cherry pow-\ndery mildew, and they were all gathered from a plant village dataset.\
    \ The recommended\nmethod’s better performance in terms of a 97.8% accuracy, 97.6%\
    \ sensitivity, 97.6% precision,\nand G-measure was observed in the classiﬁcation\
    \ results (97.6%) [44]. Some research has\ninvestigated whether computer vision\
    \ approaches may be employed for scalable and early\nplant sickness detection.\
    \ There is still a critical lack of non-lab data sets that can be utilized\nto\
    \ allow vision-based plant disease detection. For visual plant disease identiﬁcation,\
    \ the\nPlantDoc dataset was supplied. The collection has 2598 data points in total,\
    \ encompassing\n13 plant species and up to 17 disease categories, and was developed\
    \ by annotating internet-\nscraped photos for 300 human hours. Three models for\
    \ plant disease classiﬁcation were\ntrained to illustrate the dataset’s effectiveness.\
    \ The ﬁndings demonstrate that employing\nour dataset models may enhance the recognition\
    \ rate by up to 31%. The recommended\ndataset, we feel, will contribute to decreasing\
    \ the entry barrier for computer vision algo-\nrithms in plant disease detection.\
    \ For photos featuring leaves from various classes in a\ndataset with contextual\
    \ noise, and low-resolution leaf images, the model fails to give proper\nconclusions.\
    \ Using image segmentation methods to extract leaves from the photos can\nboost\
    \ the dataset’s utility. Although the dataset has been rigorously veriﬁed, particular\n\
    photographs in the collection may be wrongly labeled owing to a lack of sufﬁcient\
    \ topic\nknowledge [45].\nIt is necessary to construct an improved VGG16-based\
    \ DCNN model to detect apple\nleaf diseases (scab, frogeye spots, and cedar rust).\
    \ The global average pooling layer re-\nplaces the fully connected layer to lessen\
    \ restrictions and a batch normalization layer is\nattached to boost the model’s\
    \ computational performance. Furthermore, to avoid a long\ntraining time, a transfer\
    \ learning approach is applied. To detect apple leaf diseases, the\nsuggested\
    \ model makes use of 2446 apple leaves, 2141 photos in the training phase and\
    \ 305\nimages in the testing phase. The experimental data reveal that utilizing\
    \ the recommended\napproach, the total accuracy of apple leaf classiﬁcation may\
    \ reach 99.01%. Furthermore,\nthe ﬁndings demonstrate that cedar rust is accurately\
    \ diagnosed, but one healthy person is\nmisclassiﬁed as scab and the other as\
    \ frogeye spots.\nFurthermore, the model parameters are cut by 89% compared to\
    \ the standard VGG16.\nAs a result, the classiﬁcation performance is raised by\
    \ 6.3%, and the computational com-\nplexity is cut to 0.56% of the innovative\
    \ model. Consequently, the DCNN model developed\nin this study provides a more\
    \ accurate and speedier way for recognizing apple leaf infec-\ntions [46]. Table\

    -\nFor the recognition and detection of olive diseases, such as peacock spot,\
    \ anthracnose,\nand canker, an improved convolutional neural network (CNN) dubbed\
    \ AlexNet was\nsuggested. Several innovations separate the proposed model from\
    \ others. It uses effective\nintelligent data preprocessing with a stable image\
    \ in each class, a transfer learning approach,\nand an extended and upgraded PlantVillage\
    \ dataset to work in more complicated situations.\nThe total accuracy of the suggested\
    \ technique is 99.11%, which is the best possible score.\nFurthermore, it possesses\
    \ precision, recall, and F1 measures of 99.49%, 99.11%, and 99.29%,\nrespectively.\
    \ Despite the fact that model training takes a long time, classiﬁcation during\n\
    testing takes only a few seconds on a CPU [47]. Citrus fruits, leaves, and stems\
    \ are included\nin the image dataset. The collection contains images of normal\
    \ and diseased citrus leaves\nand fruits, including greening, scab, blackspot,\
    \ canker, and melanosis. There are 759 images\nof normal and abnormal citrus leaves\
    \ and fruits in the data collection. The images had\na resolution of 5202 × 3465\
    \ (Mpix), and when scaled at 72 dpi, the width and height\nwere 256 × 256 pixels,\
    \ correspondingly. The contaminated images were divided into four\nvarious citrus\
    \ illnesses and left on their own. The entire process consists of four major\n\
    steps: (a) enhancing the dataset using Top-hat and then Gaussian functions; (b)\
    \ weighted\nsegmentation and segmentation of lesion through a saliency map, which\
    \ highlights the\ninfested area; (c) color, texture, and geometric feature extraction\
    \ from the diseased area;\nand (d) PCA, skewness, and entropy-based feature selection\
    \ and implementation.\nAgriculture management, water contamination, and air quality\
    \ analysis monitoring\nsystems were all investigated as part of the smart environment\
    \ monitoring (SEM) system.\nFigure 5 demonstrates that substantial investigation\
    \ of smart environment monitoring\nhas increased over the period in both cases,\
    \ speciﬁcally research involving the wireless\nsensor network and Internet of\
    \ Things along with research involving machine learning and\nInternet of Things\
    \ [41,51].\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n16 of 21\nFigure 5. Research contribution\
    \ using IoT, WSN, and machine learning.\nImperfect network access, lack of a (or\
    \ no) power supply, and high framework costs\ncompared to an ordinary farmer’s\
    \ income were presented in a low-cost, energy-proﬁcient,\nprotected, dependable,\
    \ and heterogeneous three-layer approach for Internet of Things-\nbased smart\
    \ agriculture. IoT devices make up the ﬁrst layer, including IoT-based smart\n\
    agriculture monitoring like insect detection, theft detection, crop monitoring,\
    \ smart ir-\nrigation, smart poultry, food supply chain, and food preservation\
    \ monitoring systems.\nThe low-power LoRaWAN network connects the IoT devices\
    \ to the gateways. The next\nlayer is made up of local processing servers and\
    \ gateways that are connected with the\ngateways. The cloud layer, which uses\
    \ the publicly available FIWARE framework to offer a\nset of open-source API standards,\
    \ is the third layer. This study aimed to create diagnostic\ntechniques for packet\
    \ combination procedures at the fog node before they were sent over\nthe network\
    \ facility to cloud servers. This aims to decrease short IoT packet processing\n\
    overheads and optimize energy usage at the backbone, as billions of IoT devices\
    \ linked to\nfog nodes are projected to generate massive volumes of short IoT\
    \ packets [52].\nA Cuckoo Search Algorithm has been created, allowing water allocated\
    \ for farming\nunder all situations. Temperature, turbidity, pH, and moisture\
    \ were collected utilizing the\nInternet of Things (IoT) infrastructure outﬁtted\
    \ with wireless communication devices and\nsensors. ThingSpeak presented the sensor\
    \ data in the cloud system in this IoT platform.\nThe ThingSpeak data was utilized\
    \ in the suggested Cuckoo Search Algorithm, which\nidentiﬁed suitable yields for\
    \ a given soil [53]. Incorrect or late identiﬁcation can result in\noveruse or\
    \ underuse of chemicals, resulting in higher production costs and environmental\n\
    and health consequences. With varied lighting, angles, surfaces, noise, and high\
    \ resolutions,\n3651 real-time indication images of various apple infections were\
    \ manually collected.\nA subset of this dataset was labeled by experts, such as\
    \ cedar apple rust, scab, and normal\nleaves, and open-sourced for the Plant Pathology\
    \ Challenge to Kaggle community. We also\nused this data to train a standard CNN\
    \ (convolutional neural network), which obtained\n97% recognition on a held-out\
    \ test set and a maximum AUC value of 0.986. The project’s\ngoal was to keep adding\
    \ additional images to the pilot dataset from various perspectives,\nlighting,\
    \ and distances to create a bigger more complete labeled database by experts.\n\
    The dataset will contain pests and diseases, such as apple mites and aphids and\
    \ apple\nleaves comprising apple marssonina and alternaria leaf blotch, leaf spot,\
    \ frogeye, rot, cedar,\nand powdery mildew, ﬁre blight, and scab-labeled images.\n\
    Additionally, it will be photographed and remarked on fruit infected with apple\
    \ brown\nrot, bitter rot, or scab [54]. An Internet of Things-based cost-effective\
    \ monitoring system\nwas developed to address particular crop irrigation, soil\
    \ erosion, and irregular irrigation.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n17 of 21\nThe suggested\
    \ method entails building a distributed WSN (wireless sensor network), with\n\
    multiple sensor modules covering each part of the farm and transferring data to\
    \ a central\nserver. ML techniques will aid irrigation pattern forecasts based\
    \ on yields and climate\nenvironments. According to a comparison of several algorithms,\
    \ random forest regression\nhas a decent accuracy of 81.6%. However, due to harsh\
    \ weather conditions, the system\nis constrained in many ways: the forecast accuracy\
    \ is dependent on the setup’s correct\ninstallation, and the threat of wild animals\
    \ can harm the hardware setup [48]. Because\nhuman abilities and agricultural\
    \ gear are severely restricted compared to robot knowledge,\nrobotic systems in\
    \ agriculture can be highly beneﬁcial in achieving both high quality\nand quantity\
    \ goods. To integrate IoT systems with agricultural machinery, a new way\nof managing\
    \ control signals from the control system to the actuators is required. These\n\
    methods should increase economic viability while also lowering environmental impact\
    \ and\nenhancing food sustainability. It handles various agricultural tasks, including\
    \ moisture\nsensing, irrigation, crop monitoring, and insect and animal defense\
    \ [55]. Accordingly, a\nstate-of-the-art technologies-based accuracy comparison\
    \ is presented in Figure 6.\nFigure 6. Accuracy-based analysis of the different\

    \ of Internet of things (IoT)-oriented modern technologies is\nrevolutionizing\
    \ all ﬁelds of human activities, leading several beneﬁts and allowing to strongly\n\
    optimize classic productive processes. The agriculture ﬁeld is also aﬀected by\
    \ these technological\nadvances, resulting in better water and fertilizers’ usage\

    \ by some decades, is undergoing to rapid evolution in methodologies and techniques,\n\
    for improving the productivity and the environmental sustainability; nowadays,\
    \ the development of\nnew technologies allows to implement an intensive resources\
    \ exploitation (e.g., soil, water, fertilizers,\netc.), with the aim to produce\
    \ high-quality fruits and vegetable products in suﬃcient quantities to satisfy\n\
    food requirements while maintaining competitive costs. In particular, intensive\
    \ agriculture allows to\nsatisfy the primary needs of the population in constant\
    \ growth, but, on the other hand, it has caused\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632; doi:10.3390/s20133632\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n2 of 43\nserious ecological\
    \ and environmental damages such as deforestation, desertiﬁcation, the unregulated\n\
    use, namely the abuse of pesticides and fertilizers and consequently the ground-water\
    \ pollution.\nTherefore, the aim is to achieve sustainable agriculture from the\
    \ ecological and environmental point of\nview and obviously also in terms of economic\
    \ compatibility. A key factor to obtain this result is the\ncorrect and optimized\
    \ use of the various input resources such as fertilizers, water and plant protection\n\
    products, into the agricultural production processes. Thanks to the development\
    \ of Internet of things\n(IoT)-based technologies, nowadays a huge number of low\
    \ cost and power consumption modules and\nsensors are available to be employed\
    \ in the farmlands, in order to detect and collect precise climate\nand soil data\
    \ as well as information referred to growth or diseases of the cultivated crops\
    \ and send by\nWi-Fi connectivity all the collected data to a cloud software platform\
    \ for the optimized management of\nthe farm.\nThe designed system represents a\
    \ multi-platform complete solution, by employing a smart\nfertigation system assisted\
    \ by an on-ﬁeld custom wireless sensor network (WSN), for supporting\nthe farmer\
    \ and manager along the whole supply chain from the ﬁeld to the product distribution,\
    \ as\nwell as for providing added value services to the customers. In fact, the\
    \ developed system helps the\ndealers and traders to check the transportation\
    \ and storage conditions of the food products, as well\nas their provenience,\
    \ employing a low-power Bluetooth low energy (BLE) smart tag placed inside\nthe\
    \ food container; therefore, the availability of a single multi–functional software\
    \ platform allows\nthe user (both the farmer and costumer) to check all events\
    \ and treatments performed overtime on\nthe products, from the sowing to the consumer\
    \ table. To exploit the multitude of the oﬀered services\nfrom the developed system,\
    \ an integrated on-cloud software platform allows us to manage the crops\nproduction\
    \ and market of the agri-food products and more.\nThe beneﬁts of the developed\
    \ farm optimal management system, integrated with an automated\nfertigation facility,\
    \ can cover several cultivation typologies, such as arboreal cultures, horticulture\n\
    and any type of greenhouses. A low-cost and energetically autonomous fertigation\
    \ system has been\ndeveloped to properly dose and mix the determined amount and\
    \ typology of fertilizer into the water\nto irrigate. Several fertigation systems,\
    \ installed in diﬀerent cultivated lands also far from each other,\ncan refer\
    \ to the same cloud platform and, thus, to the same agronomic database containing\
    \ the data\nderived from the mathematical models for the diﬀerent considered crops.\
    \ In fact, the agronomic\nmodels allow to determine the optimum cultivation parameters,\
    \ such as typologies and amount of\nfertilizers, frequency and time duration of\
    \ irrigations; all these operations are calibrated based on\ncrop typologies,\
    \ weather condition and on the physical and chemical quantities, related to soil\
    \ and air,\nacquired directly on-ﬁeld. The decision-making algorithm is also supported\
    \ by a tree-structured WSN\ninstalled on the land, so allowing to obtain updated\
    \ and real-time data related to the crop conditions.\nAccording to the aforementioned\
    \ functionalities, the proposed system allows us to obtain savings in\nterms of\
    \ water resources, fertilizers placed in the ground and energetic consumption,\
    \ with respect to\nclassic methods, and a complete traceability relative to the\
    \ cultivated products.\nThe software platform receives non-stop the WSN data,\
    \ through the central management unit,\nfrom coordinator nodes and the weather\
    \ forecasts from reliable meteorological websites, respectively\nand then it utilizes\
    \ them in the mathematical agronomic models to support the farmers or agronomists\n\
    in the decision-making processes related to the treatments necessary for the optimal\
    \ growth or any\ndiseases of cultivated crops. In particular, a low-cost and robust\
    \ WSN has been realized by using\ncommercial development modules and sensors;\
    \ besides, through a compact solar harvesting section,\nand minimizing node power\
    \ consumption by means of a suitable ﬁrmware implementation, long\nenergy autonomy\
    \ of each sensor node has been obtained.\nThe decision support system (DSS) implemented\
    \ in the software platform uses always updated\ndatabases on fertilizers and plants’\
    \ protection products, including all technical speciﬁcations and mode\nof use\
    \ that allow the correct selection of the most appropriate product for each speciﬁc\
    \ application or\ntreatment, also concerning the anti-resistance strategies, thus\
    \ becoming an eﬀective tool for adapting\ncultural techniques to the climate changes\
    \ and speciﬁc geographical location. In addition, the developed\nSensors 2020,\
    \ 20, 3632\n3 of 43\nsoftware platform allows the traceability of the agri-food\
    \ products ensuring the storage of information\non the treatments undergone by\
    \ the products during the cultivation phases, so allowing then the\ndata viewing\
    \ remotely on the smartphone/tablet of potential consumers interested in purchasing\
    \ the\nproducts. In addition—by using a multi-platform application—the farmer\
    \ or the agronomist can\nidentify, by reading a speciﬁc quick response (QR)-code,\
    \ a portion of the cultivated land and view or\nupdate the related information\
    \ on cultivated crops in this speciﬁc area or ﬁnally can acquire data about\n\
    the performing of a speciﬁc treatment on the cultivated crops.\nFurthermore, a\
    \ tracking and tracing system was designed, based on BLE sensor tag applied\n\
    to the plastic or wooden container, where the fresh or already processed agricultural\
    \ products are\nstored. The low-power consumption BLE tag is equipped with several\
    \ sensors for monitoring the\nparameters useful to determine the freshness status\
    \ and the storing conditions of diﬀerent types of\nfood products (i.e., temperature,\
    \ humidity, total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs)-level, ammonia\n(NH3) and\
    \ carbon dioxide (CO2)-concentrations). The variety of detected parameters makes\
    \ the\nrealized device extremely versatile for monitoring diﬀerent food typologies\
    \ (vegetables, meat, ﬁsh, etc.),\nas demonstrated in the literature analysis in\
    \ Section 2.3, a unique feature not found in other competitor\nsystems reported\
    \ in the literature as well as available on the market. Additionally, the developed\
    \ BLE\nsmart tag is reusable for a long time on the same container or, if the\
    \ container is damaged, it can be\neasily removed and applied on another container,\
    \ as following detailed in Section 3.3. In addition,\nthe iBeacon technology is\
    \ exploited to support the tracking system in the monitoring of the agri-food\n\
    stored products on the whole supply chain (SC), so providing a value-added service\
    \ to the consumers.\nAlternating iBeacon phase with low duty-cycle acquisition\
    \ and transmission phases, the developed\nBLE device acts like a reprogrammable\
    \ tag capable to monitor the freshness indexes of the stored food\ntypology. A\
    \ prototype of the BLE smart tag was tested to verify its correct operation and\
    \ evaluate\nthe energy autonomy, which turned out to be about 5.6 months. A mobile\
    \ application was developed\nto remotely monitor the tracking and storing parameters\
    \ acquired by the BLE tags placed inside\nthe containers with the agri-food products.\
    \ Both the BLE tag and tracking system were tested in\ndiﬀerent real operative\
    \ scenarios, by using oranges and frozen codﬁsh ﬁllets placed inside plastic and\n\
    polyethylene containers, demonstrating their correct operation.\nConsequently,\
    \ the developed software platform for the optimized farm management allows\nimplementing\
    \ an innovative business model inspired by the principles of the products’ traceability,\n\
    to guarantee consumers on their quality, as well as of the organically grown food\
    \ and fair trade\nforms of agri-food products. In fact, the on-cloud software\
    \ application speciﬁcally developed for the\ndevelopment of new business models\

    The manuscript is organized as follows: in the sub-paragraph 1.1, a non-exhaustive\
    \ literature\nanalysis about innovative DSSs applied to agriculture ﬁeld is reported;\
    \ these software tools, based\non data provided from several sources, help the\
    \ farm manager to take correct decisions on cultural\nprocesses as well as to\
    \ prevent or minimize eﬀects of pests and diseases or winter frosts. The following\n\
    paragraph includes an overview of new remotely controlled devices and IoT-based\
    \ technical solutions\ndeveloped for crop monitoring and precision farming. After,\
    \ a literature analysis on the applications of\ntracking and tracing systems for\
    \ agri-food products’ identiﬁcation at the harvest time and subsequent\ntheir\
    \ traceability is reported, so providing a quality certiﬁcation to the consumers\
    \ and an economic\nadvantage to the farmer. Furthermore, in this subsection, the\
    \ most suitable parameters for monitoring\nthe freshness status of rapidly perishable\
    \ food products (e.g., meat, ﬁsh, vegetables, etc.) are identiﬁed\nand discussed.\
    \ In Section 3, a description of the automated fertigation facility integrated\
    \ with the\nWSN located on the farmland is provided with technical details on\
    \ its functionalities and related to the\ndiﬀerent mechanical, hydraulic and electrical\
    \ systems. In addition, the architecture of the developed\nBLE sensor tag for\
    \ the traceability system of agri-food products is described, applied to the most\n\
    commonly used containers, made in plastic, wood or polystyrene, for foods’ transport\
    \ or storage. In\nSection 4, the analysis of power consumption related to the\
    \ sensor node during the diﬀerent operating\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n4 of 43\n\
    phases is reported in order to estimate the lifetime of the used lithium polymer\
    \ (LiPo) battery recharged\nby the solar energy harvesting system; in Section\
    \ 4.1, the operation of the developed tracking system\nbased on BLE sensor tag\
    \ is also reported. Finally, in Section 5 the architecture of the software platform,\n\
    both for managing the fertigation system by the agronomist or system manager and\
    \ for the food\nproducts’ tracking is described; besides, the functionalities\
    \ of the developed mobile application both\nfor the farmer and customer users\
    \ are discussed.\n2. Scientiﬁc Works and Commercial Devices for Precision Farming\
    \ and Advanced\nTracking Systems\nIn this section, an overview on recent scientiﬁc\
    \ works related to DSS-based algorithms and IoT\nsolutions applied to precision\
    \ farming has been reported, together with a state of the art on advanced\ntracking\
    \ and tracing systems for monitoring agri-food products.\n2.1. A Literature Analysis\
    \ on Sensors-Based Decision Support Systems (DSS) Applied to Precision Farming\n\
    In the last decades, also agriculture is beneﬁting from the technological advances\
    \ in electronics,\ncomputers technology and communication ﬁelds [1,2]. In this\
    \ context, great relevance is ascribable\nto the DSSs, a wide range of software\
    \ tools that based on several input data related to soil and\nenvironmental parameters,\
    \ acquired by sensor nodes distributed on the cultivated land, to weather\nforecasts,\
    \ to crops’ growth status or pathogens presence, then help the farmer to make\
    \ decisions relative\nto farm activities or issues to be addressed [3].\nIn [4],\
    \ the authors described a real-time DSS, for minimizing disease eﬀects for the\
    \ tomatoes\ncultivated in a greenhouse, structured in three stages: the supervision\
    \ one detects and diagnoses any\nfailure of sensors involved in culture monitoring,\
    \ the control stage monitors the climate parameters\ninside the greenhouse and\
    \ the management one, based on pests and diseases data acquired on ﬁeld,\noptimizes\
    \ these parameters to limit the spread of pathogens harmful to crops. Furthermore,\
    \ the DSS\nintegrates a real-time rule-based tool, implemented by G2-Gensym Corporation\
    \ software and supported\nby a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)\
    \ control system; this last has as inputs the\nactuated variables (windows status,\
    \ irrigation valves, heating), as outputs the controlled variables\n(interior\
    \ temperature and humidity, soil water content, nutrients, etc.), whereas the\
    \ disturbances are the\nuncontrolled variables, such as weather conditions, diseases\
    \ and pest presence. Moreover, a fuzzy-logic\ncontroller allows optimizing the\
    \ system dynamic behavior by modifying the set-point variables of the\nclimate\
    \ control unit.\nAn innovative framework for a cloud-based decision support automation\
    \ system (DSAS) in\norder to assist the orchards’ cultural practices was presented\
    \ in [5], able to acquire data from diﬀerent\nsources, to make speciﬁc decisions\
    \ and control devices installed on the ﬁeld. It has a modular software\narchitecture,\
    \ featured by decision modules arranged in a hierarchical structure, handling\
    \ the diversity\nof data by using a data model to specify the format, data types\
    \ and enabled operations of input data set.\nGiven the heterogeneity of possible\
    \ cultural operations on the orchard, the cloud-based DSAS has an\nextendible\
    \ and adaptive architecture, for adding a new decision module when required. In\
    \ particular,\nthe software follows the open/close principle, namely, it is open\
    \ for any extensions, but close for\nmodiﬁcations. The software-managed control\
    \ was structured in three layers: (1) the decision layer\ndeﬁnes the actions at\
    \ a high level, (2) the service plane schedules the actions for each device, (3)\
    \ the\ndevice layer performs the deﬁned schedules (Figure 1).\nAn IoT-based system\
    \ for smart agriculture that employs a tree-type decision algorithm was\ndescribed\
    \ in [6], using as main elements the IoT devices for acquiring information directly\
    \ on the ﬁeld,\nthe gateway and the service platform. The sensor nodes employed\
    \ the Arduino board for detecting\nparameters from connected sensors and controlling\
    \ actuators; acquired data are fused to produce a\nmore consistent and accurate\
    \ database and, employing Kalman ﬁlter, the noise derived from data\nfusion operation\
    \ was minimized. A Raspberry Pi board was used as a gateway for connecting WSN\n\
    nodes to the cloud service. The algorithm employed in the decision-making process\
    \ is the tree-type one\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n5 of 43\n(“if-then rules”) based\
    \ on decision rules and input data both stored in a my-structured query language\n\
    (MySQL) database.\nE. Han et al. proposed a DSS tool, named climate-agriculture-modelling\
    \ and decision tool\n(CAMDT) able to combine the seasonal climate forecasts (SCFs)\
    \ with the crops model, for readily\nobtaining information related to cultural\
    \ processes adjustment and water management, thus ensuring\nimprovements of crops\
    \ yield based on the climatic forecasts during the cultivation period [7].\nIn\
    \ particular, the CAMDT was supported by DSSAT (decision support system for agro-technology\n\
    transfer)-CSM (cropping system model)–Rice model for obtaining tailored information\
    \ for crops\ndecisions, both in terms of direct outcomes (such as yield and water\
    \ stress) and translated outcomes\n(such as the risk of water stress and gross\
    \ margin).\nFigure 1. (a) Decision support system (DSS) software structure reported\
    \ in [5] and (b) its three-layer\narchitecture with decision, service and device\
    \ planes, respectively.\nC.C. Baseca et al. developed a real-time smart decision\
    \ system to determine the variable rate\nirrigation parameters and variable rate\
    \ fertigation rules for optimizing the crops yield [8]; it collects\ncrops data\
    \ (soil and leaf sensors), weather forecasts, machinery data (pivot irrigation,\
    \ controller units\nand actuators, pumps status, etc.), that are sent to a middleware.\
    \ After a preprocessing phase, these data\nare processed by means of a decision-making\
    \ system obtained by combining the learning prediction\nrules with the Drools\
    \ rules management system for producing relevant results and thus allowing to\n\
    improve both farm sustainability and competitiveness.\nTorres et al. developed\
    \ a three-layer data fusion algorithm, called Hydra, for improving the\naccuracy\
    \ of employed sensors to determine some critical events more accurately, and thus\
    \ for\nmaking appropriate decisions related to the smart water management [9];\
    \ the Hydra algorithm\nemploys, at the lower level, some ﬁltering methods (extreme\
    \ Studentized method—ESD and weighted\noutlier–Robust Kalman ﬁlter—WRKF) for identifying\
    \ and removing the outliners, thus enhancing the\nalgorithm reliability.\nIn [10],\
    \ the authors presented a robust approach to simulate, by employing cultural simulation\n\
    models for a speciﬁc location and year, the crops yield potential (Yp) and to\
    \ estimate the yield gap (Yg),\ndiﬀerence between Yp and average actual farm yield\
    \ (Ya). The authors aim to provide guidelines for\nestimating yield gaps and for\
    \ simulating the climate change impact and land-use change from local to\nglobal\
    \ spatial scale.\nThe state of the art on big data applications in smart farming\
    \ is presented by authors in [11],\nexplaining how new technologies and devices,\
    \ namely IoT-oriented solutions and cloud computing,\nare inﬂuencing the entire\
    \ food supply chain, so providing predictive insights in the agricultural\nprocesses,\
    \ driving real-time operational decisions and also redesigning the farm economic\
    \ processes\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n6 of 43\ntowards new business models. In\
    \ [12], the current state of agricultural systems science is shown,\nfocusing\
    \ on capabilities and limitations of agronomic models that need to be improved;\
    \ common\nlimitations are scarcity of data for developing, evaluating and applying\
    \ farming system models and\ninadequate knowledge systems able to communicate\
    \ model results to society. New open data initiatives\nshow promising results\
    \ to tackle the data problem, but there must also be a cultural change among\n\
    agricultural researchers; the conclusion is that multiple platforms and diﬀerent\
    \ models are needed for\nfarming models’ applications for diﬀerent purposes.\n\
    About DSS tools, most of the existing ones are focused on relatively narrow issues,\
    \ for instance,\nthe application of a speciﬁc fungicide, when to apply the next\
    \ irrigation or how much fertilizer to\napply to a particular crop that will be\
    \ grown on a speciﬁc type of soil [12]. One of the problems related\nto DSS validation\
    \ is the change of climate conditions at the ﬁeld scale that can be considered\
    \ in the DSS\nonly with the implementation of predictive models capable of assessing\
    \ the response of agricultural\nsystems to the changing of the environmental conditions.\n\
    To overcome these limits, the authors in [11] investigated, by means of a DSS\
    \ agro-technology\ntransfer-cropping system model (DSSAT-CSM), (i) the spatial\
    \ variability of soybean yields across the\nfarming ﬁeld with diﬀerent soils and\
    \ inputs, (ii) how spatial variability in soil properties translates into\nmeasured\
    \ and predicted yields variability and (iii) how scaling soil properties aﬀects\
    \ model accuracy\nin predicting soybean yields for diﬀerent weather conditions\
    \ [13].\nAn example of DSS, named AGRODSS, was recently presented in [14]; implemented\
    \ as a\ncloud-based service, it enables various software products for agriculture\
    \ to facilitate decisions support\nto users, allowing, as other existing DSSs,\
    \ to improve business value through savings, avoiding\nrisks, better planning\
    \ and taking better advantage of available resources. AgroDSS is based on data\n\
    mining approaches able to extract useful information from large volumes of data\
    \ by using advanced\nalgorithms to identify trends, distributions and to ﬁnd patterns\
    \ that can be hard to see with naked eyes.\nThe newly acquired knowledge can better\
    \ help understand the data, see how data changes in time,\nand help to predict\
    \ the future impact of diﬀerent actions and farming processes. In [15] the authors\n\
    described an intelligent logistic tracking and tracing system, able to ensure\
    \ traced horticultural food\nsecurity and quality, so determining fair prices.\
    \ The traceability framework consists of four following\nphases, namely identiﬁcation,\
    \ modeling, processing and traceability data presentation, so helping\ndecision-makers\
    \ in the issue of food security, obtaining an eﬃcient product distribution and\
    \ increased\ncustomers’ satisfaction. Finally, the developed logistical approach\
    \ employs fuzzy set theory, artiﬁcial\nneural networks, sensors technology and\
    \ genetic algorithms.\n2.2. Advanced IoT-Oriented Technical Solutions for Monitoring\
    \ and Precision Agriculture\nIn this paragraph, an overview, regarding the precision\
    \ farming applications, techniques, and\nemployed Io-T oriented devices, is reported\
    \ in order to exploit the available resources in the best and\nmost eﬃcient way\
    \ and also to satisfy the needs of cultivated crops with the ultimate goal of\
    \ optimizing\ntheir quantity and quality.\nWSNs development and their growing\
    \ popularity are due not only to the usefulness for individual\nusers, but also\
    \ to the role that they can play in supporting the entire community; an interesting\
    \ example\nis the forecast service on signiﬁcant atmospheric events. In this context,\
    \ the sEmPliCE project (Eledia\ncivil protection expositor), developed by the\
    \ ELEDIA research center in Trento (Italy), aims to make\neasily accessible the\
    \ numerous data related to environmental monitoring acquired by heterogeneous\n\
    technologies present on Trento’s provincial territory. Through an intuitive software\
    \ platform accessible\nby smartphones and tablets, the interested citizens can\
    \ obtain information updated in real time and\nconsult the data history, receiving\
    \ alert notiﬁcations in case of a forecast of natural disasters.\nIn the next\
    \ future, a fundamental role will be represented by artiﬁcial vision systems able\
    \ to manage\nthe actions performed by actuator robots on the cultivated products;\
    \ concerning this topic, the research\nhas already yielded signiﬁcant results\
    \ [16]. Below are shown some examples of robots employed\nto perform diﬀerent\
    \ tasks depending on the speciﬁc application and crop typology. In Figure 2a,\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 3632\n7 of 43\nthe so-called Vitirover autonomous mower-robot\
    \ is used to eliminate herbicides being able to mow\nthe grass up to a few centimeters\
    \ from the foot of vine plants; energy autonomy is guaranteed by\nphotovoltaic\
    \ cells placed on its roof (for further detail http://www.vitirover.com/) [17].\
    \ The robot\nworks on the basis of the global positioning system (GPS) coordinates,\
    \ provided by the manufacturer,\nrelated to cultivated land limits, being able\
    \ also to avoid any holes or pits; it is controlled by Please\nverify. or smartphone\
    \ app and through it, the farmer can manage the robot by positioning it in the\n\
    ground or vineyard. In addition, the drones are employed in the agricultural sector\
    \ for monitoring\nthe crops’ growth or pests’ spread; in Figure 2b, the so-named\
    \ Falcon 8 drone is shown while it is\nﬂying over an agricultural land. The drone,\
    \ provided with eight propellers, is capable of making video\nfootage and, by\
    \ using some infrared (IR) sensors, to detect the chlorophyll amount inside the\
    \ vineyards,\na fundamental parameter for agronomists and winemakers.\nFigure\
    \ 2. Image of solar-powered Vitirover robot in action on the ground (a); Falcon\
    \ 8 drone employed\nto monitor, by means of the infrared (IR) sensors, the chlorophyll\
    \ amount inside the vineyards (b).\nIn the GRAPE (acronym of ground robot for\
    \ vineyard monitoring and protection) project [18],\nan autonomous ground robot\
    \ equipped with a robotic arm was realized to monitor plants health in the\nvineyards\
    \ and, by navigating along the rows of vines, to dispense pheromones against pests.\
    \ Many\nresearch works are focused on the possibility to use the emerging digital\
    \ technologies to improve and\naid the agricultural sector management [19]. In\
    \ addition, the signiﬁcant potential of big data analysis\napplied to smart and\
    \ precision farming is highlighted in [20]; the authors show that the availability\n\
    of hardware and software techniques and methods for big data analysis, as well\
    \ as the increasing\non-ﬁeld usage of big data sources, shall encourage more academic\
    \ research, public sector initiatives\nand business ventures in the agricultural\
    \ sector.\nFrom the hardware point of view, the most used technology to detect\
    \ diﬀerent interest quantities\nof agricultural land is that of WSNs that can\
    \ be employed to carry out several monitoring operations;\nfor instance, they\
    \ are used for environmental condition monitoring or for providing information\n\
    about soil nutrients, allowing to predict crop health and product quality over\
    \ time. A classiﬁcation\nrelated to diﬀerent study cases to thoroughly explore\
    \ the existing solutions proposed in the literature,\naccording to their design\
    \ and implementation parameters is presented in [21]. Speciﬁcally, diﬀerent\n\
    farming applications that can be implemented by using WSNs are presented in [21]\
    \ related to\nirrigation management systems, farming monitoring systems, pest\
    \ and disease control and prediction,\ncontrolled use of fertilizers, vineyards’\
    \ production monitoring, groundwater quality monitoring,\ncattle movement monitoring,\
    \ gases monitoring into a greenhouse, asset tracking, remote control\nand diagnosis.\
    \ In addition, the authors classiﬁed the possible architectures in various categories,\n\
    highlighting the potential agricultural applications suitable for each one.\n\
    WSN nodes are based on programmable microcontrollers and designed as modular structures\n\
    open both from the hardware and software point of view [22,23]. The sensors used\
    \ for detecting\ndiﬀerent environmental and soil parameters have to be carefully\
    \ chosen; concerning soil water content\nmeasure, numerous techniques are currently\
    \ in use and the suitability of each one depends on cost,\naccuracy, durability\
    \ and response time [24]. A widely used measurement technique is based on\nthe\
    \ dependence of the dielectric constant with the soil water content that signiﬁcantly\
    \ aﬀects the\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n8 of 43\npropagation of the electromagnetic\
    \ waves inside the medium; in fact, the dielectric constant of dry soil\nis much\
    \ less than a wet one. Two approaches are commonly used to measure the dielectric\
    \ constant of\nsoil, namely the time domain approach and frequency domain one;\
    \ advantages of the ﬁrst are the low\ncost, need of low-frequency circuits, no\
    \ employment hazardous radiations and a fast response time.\nInstead, the frequency\
    \ domain approach has higher sensitivity to insulation and is more sensitive to\
    \ air\ngaps. A low-cost solar-powered monitoring station equipped with an analysis\
    \ probe based on the\nfrequency domain method was developed in [25] for measuring\
    \ temperature and humidity of both air\nand high silica content clay soil at diﬀerent\
    \ depths.\nA proper WSN design represents a fundamental point for monitoring diﬀerent\
    \ parameters in an\nagricultural land; a signiﬁcant issue that has to be taken\
    \ into account regards the power consumption\nof each sensor node, for ensuring\
    \ long node autonomy. In this regard, energy harvesting techniques\nrepresent\
    \ a real opportunity, thus obtaining a technical solution nearly with no maintenance\
    \ [26–29].\nAir pollution monitoring is another ﬁeld where WSNs are employed;\
    \ the meteorological conditions,\nsuch as wind speed and atmospheric turbulence,\
    \ aﬀect air quality as reported in [30] where a WSN\nwas designed, with an eﬀective\
    \ energy-saving system for each sensor node, for air and environment\npollution\
    \ detection. In this context, in [31] the authors propose a low-cost WSN for air\
    \ monitoring\napplications; the sensor node is based on commercial gas sensors\
    \ and a low power ZigBee (zonal\nintercommunication global-standard bee) module,\
    \ which shares the acquired information with the\ncloud by means of a gateway.\
    \ The experimental results demonstrate the proper operation of the node,\nhaving\
    \ obtained a 93.03% discrimination rate and R2 coeﬃcient values, in the gas quantitative\
    \ detection,\naround 0.99. An overview of WSN applications is presented in [32]\
    \ focusing on ﬁve application\nareas, namely healthcare, agriculture, environmental,\
    \ industry and military. Moreover, the technical\nfeatures of both hardware and\
    \ software sections for WSN design are given in detail depending on the\napplication\
    \ [32]. A WSN-based smart system was developed in [33] for monitoring the availability\n\
    level and rapid changes of water content in the soil, with the aim of guaranteeing\
    \ early ﬂood prediction,\nwater savings in the farmland irrigation as well as\
    \ waste reduction and optimal use of water resources\nwhere its availability is\
    \ poor [34,35]. All aforementioned WSN solutions can be applied in the precision\n\
    agriculture ﬁeld, namely a management strategy that employs information technology\
    \ to improve\ncrops’ quality and production [35,36]. Wireless sensor technologies\
    \ and Information Technology\n(IT)-based management tools can lead to a highly\
    \ eﬀective green agriculture, including, just as an\nexample, the proper supply\
    \ of adequate nutrients to crops and appropriate use of pesticides for the\noptimized\
    \ control of weeds, pests and diseases.\nThe recent WSN applications in precision\
    \ agriculture are analyzed in [37], where the various\nwireless communication\
    \ protocols are classiﬁed and compared; besides, this work reports a study on\n\
    the taxonomy of energy-eﬃcient and harvesting techniques for WSNs used in agricultural\
    \ monitoring\nsystems and a comparison between previous research works on agriculture-ﬁeld\
    \ WSNs. In addition, the\ndeep learning, a recent modern technique for image elaboration\
    \ and data processing, was introduced\nin agriculture domain; speciﬁcally, in\
    \ [38] a survey on 40 research works employing deep learning\ntechniques in various\
    \ agricultural and food production areas was carried out; in this context, the\n\
    authors analyzed particular agricultural issues, namely the used frameworks and\
    \ models, the sources,\nnature and preprocessing of the collected data and the\
    \ overall performance achieved according to the\nmetrics employed in each under-analysis\
    \ research work.\nThe optimization of energy consumption is crucial in WSN applications\
    \ for agriculture since\nusually the nodes are distributed in remote areas where\
    \ the maintenance for changing or recharging\nthe batteries is diﬃcult. Del Valle-Soto\
    \ et al. developed a WSN energy model to estimate the energy\nconsumption of each\
    \ node during the diﬀerent operations (data acquisition and transmission), when\n\
    the routing protocol is running [39]. The model validation is performed by employing\
    \ TI CC2530-based\nboards, which run a multiparent hierarchical (MPH) routing\
    \ protocol. The experimental results indicate\nthat the proposed protocol shows\
    \ a lower energy consumption respect to ad-hoc on-demand distance\nvector (AODV),\
    \ ZigBee tree routing (ZTR) and dynamic source routing (DSR), whereas the MPH\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 3632\n9 of 43\nprotocol has a slightly greater energy consumption\
    \ compared to the energy-aware protocols such as\npower-eﬃcient gathering in sensor\
    \ information systems (PEGASIS) and low energy adaptive clustering\nhierarchy\
    \ (LEACH) (2% and 3%, respectively).\nA crops’ monitoring system based on wireless\
    \ sensor network is reported in [40]. The authors\npresent their developed system\
    \ composed of seven parts: the data processing unit (model ATmega128,\nmanufactured\
    \ by Microchip Technology, Chandler, AZ, USA) which processes all the information\n\
    and manipulates the peripherals, the CC1101 Radio Frequency (RF) module (manufactured\
    \ by Texas\nInstrument, Dallas, TX, USA) for transmitting data collected by sensors\
    \ related to environmental and\nsoil parameters, a control unit to regulate the\
    \ activation/deactivation of each employed sensor node (for\nobtaining energy\
    \ saving), a data storage unit composed of AT45DB041D serial-interface ﬂash memory\n\
    (manufactured by Adesto Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), a power supply unit\
    \ (DC source or\nsolar battery), an analog interface used to adjust voltage values\
    \ provided by the employed sensors\nas required by the analog to digital converter\
    \ (ADC) and ﬁnally a digital interface for digital sensors.\nIn their system,\
    \ the authors employed also an image sensor node made up of a system-on-a-chip\
    \ (SoC)\nTHLK2405 images processing module and a CMOS model OV7640 images array\
    \ sensor (manufactured\nby OmniVision, Santa Clara, CA, USA) capable of operating\
    \ at up to 30 frames per second (fps) [20].\nIn the proposed system, the WSN is\
    \ fully integrated with an innovative fertigation unit and a farm\nmanagement\
    \ software platform implementing a DSS-algorithm supported by agronomic database;\n\
    also, the software platform allows the user, by means of a mobile application,\
    \ to control all the system\nfunctionalities and to view the stored data concerning\
    \ the carried out treatments and irrigations, as\ndescribed in Section 5.\n2.3.\
    \ Potentialities of Tracking and Tracing Software Systems and Analysis on the\
    \ Most Suitable Parameters for\nMonitoring the Freshness of Rapidly Perishable\
    \ Agricultural and Food Products\nAs known the supply chain (SC) of agriculture\
    \ products involves several processing and\nmanagement steps before the products\
    \ could reach the ﬁnal users; each step has much data associated\nwith it, often\
    \ unknown to the end customer. However, these data could be crucial both for companies,\n\
    in order to create logistic strategies and marketing techniques, but also for\
    \ the end costumers to ensure\nfood security and quality. For these reasons, exploiting\
    \ the IoT advances, diﬀerent smart tracing and\ntracking systems have been developed.\
    \ The agri-food industry is one of the most promising candidates\nwhich could\
    \ beneﬁt from all the features introduced by these technologies. Speciﬁcally,\
    \ intelligent\npackaging (IP), radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID), WSNs, analytics\
    \ and cloud platforms have been\npervasively applied to tracing and tracking systems,\
    \ allowing to improve the tracing capabilities along\nthe whole SC, while ensuring\
    \ the availability and accuracy of products data. Furthermore, the system\nscalability\
    \ is allowed by employing analytical methods and big data techniques, making the\
    \ work of\noperators easier and more eﬃcient [41].\nRelatively to the food chain,\
    \ almost a third of produced food for human consumption\nworldwide—approximately\
    \ 1.3 billion tons every year—is wasted. In industrialized countries, more\nthan\
    \ 40% of losses happen at the retail and consumer levels. Food is sometimes thrown\
    \ away ‘just\nin case’ when it is still ﬁne to be consumed. Diﬀerent solutions\
    \ have been developed to monitor\nthe quality of the packaged food and stored\
    \ before being consumed, ranging from color changing\nlabels as a function of\
    \ food container temperature to RFID tags that link up with smartphones to give\n\
    detailed information on the food status and sensors that indicate how ripe fruit\
    \ is [42]. Poor chill chain\nmanagement within the food supply chain and some\
    \ uncertainty about how long ago food packs\nwere opened after purchase are crucial\
    \ aspects that can determine the failure of stored food products;\ndiﬀerent companies\
    \ have developed smart tags that help retailers and the restaurant industry for\n\
    addressing this issue.\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n10 of 43\nIn the ﬁeld of tracking\
    \ and tracing of food products, an interesting commercial application is the\n\
    TT Sensor PlusTM, which combines a low-power temperature sensor and data logging\
    \ functionality\nin an adhesive label [43] (Figure 3a); it can be applied to the\
    \ container for monitoring the product\ntemperature, making the latter available\
    \ to the user through near-ﬁeld communication (NFC) by using\na mobile application\
    \ (Figure 3b). In addition, the evolution of this product, called TT Sensor PlusTM\
    \ 2,\nis equipped with two light emitting diodes (LEDs) for indicating the label\
    \ status (active/inactive) or\nalert conditions [44]. The device is fed by a 3\
    \ V lithium battery, so guaranteeing a long autonomy (more\nthan 3 years after\
    \ the activation). Such devices are suitable for several applications, as monitoring\
    \ of\npharmaceutical and medical products (Figure 3c), food and beverage, chemicals\
    \ and polymer-based\ngoods and in general other products sensitive to the storing\
    \ temperature.\nFigure 3. (a) Structure of the TT Sensor PlusTM smart label (b)\
    \ to monitor the temperature of food\nproducts made available through NFC by using\
    \ the mobile app; (c) TT Sensor PlusTM 2 label applied to\na bottle of wine (left)\
    \ or a pack of drugs [43,44].\nIn [45], the authors proposed a multilayer and\
    \ technological framework to support the company\nactivities in the development\
    \ of a traceability system based on Industry 4.0 principles. At ﬁrst,\nthe proposed\
    \ framework, given the adopted business model, identiﬁes and models the process\n\
    inﬂuencing the product. In addition, the identiﬁcation of each productive process\
    \ step and entity\nwhich stores the products information along the SC is required.\
    \ These operations are enabled by the\nIoT technologies [46,47]. Speciﬁcally,\
    \ the information related to the production environment, to the\nproduct transformation\
    \ or to the transport conditions are acquired and monitored by sensors placed\n\
    along the whole SC. Moreover, an IT application is employed for collecting these\
    \ data and making\nthem accessible by the company as well as the end-users, to\
    \ guarantee the beneﬁts above described.\nQi et al. illustrated a WSN-based integrated\
    \ cold chain shelf life decision support (C2SLDS) system,\ndesigned for perishable\
    \ food products cold-chain management [48]. The developed architecture relies\n\
    on a WSN for acquiring and transmitting, in a distributed manner, the products’\
    \ parameters, while a\ntime–temperature indicator (TTI) monitors and records the\
    \ time–temperature history of the products\nalong the whole SC. The system consists\
    \ of a 3-layer architecture, named WTTI (WSN-based TTI),\nAGS (advanced RISC machine\
    \ (ARM)-based gateway system) and LDSS (least shelf life ﬁrst out\n(LSFO) decision\
    \ support system), respectively. The WTTI is a reduced-function device, able to\
    \ acquire\ntemperature and wirelessly transmit shelf life information to a ZigBee\
    \ coordinator. The AGS consists\nof a Zigbee coordinator node and an ARM-based\
    \ smart device that gathers the temperature data from\nthe coordinator node. The\
    \ LDSS decisions are driven by the application server, the data warehouse\nserver,\
    \ the model base, the knowledge base, the routers and the ﬁrewalls. Based on this\
    \ information,\na software application calculates the shelf life of the products\
    \ by means of the TTI, once known the\nshelf life prediction model and the parameters\
    \ in the knowledge base.\nThe afore reported works propose devices able to monitor,\
    \ each, only one physical or chemical\nquantity, so indicating the freshness of\
    \ the speciﬁc stored product; instead, the designed BLE smart tag\nis able to\
    \ simultaneously detect several physical and chemical quantities, so covering\
    \ a wide range of\napplications, for monitoring the storage conditions of diﬀerent\
    \ food typologies.\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n11 of 43\nIn [49], the author proposed\
    \ a traceability system applicable to the agri-food products supply chain.\nThis\
    \ system employs RFID technology for enabling the data acquisition, the traceability\
    \ during the\ndiﬀerent productive steps (production, warehousing, distribution)\
    \ as well as the sale links of agri-food\nproducts. In addition, the system employs\
    \ several blockchain technologies to ensure the authenticity\nand reliability\
    \ of the shared information. Another approach to traceability of vegetables based\
    \ on\nRFID technology was described in [50]; speciﬁcally, a uniﬁed modeling language\
    \ (UML) is deﬁned to\nsupport the product traceability and, thus, creating a method\
    \ for modeling the products information\n(harvesting place, performed treatments,\
    \ places of storage, etc.) and quality. Such traceability code\nwas formatted\
    \ according to the European article number (EAN) and uniform code council (UCC)\n\
    standards. This UML modeling is used to perform real time tracking of the product,\
    \ thus allowing it to\neasily improve its quality as well as reducing the waste.\n\
    Ampatzidis et al. proposed two solutions to bind the bins employed to harvest\
    \ the fruits with the\ncorresponding pairs of trees, thus establishing the harvesting\
    \ yield of an orchard [51]. The ﬁrst method\nrelies on passive RFID tags, operating\
    \ in the ultra-high frequency (UHF) band (866 MHz for Europe),\nplaced on the\
    \ bins (Figure 4) and a long-range RFID radar-reader (manufactured by Trolley\
    \ Scan\nCompanyTM, Johannesburg, South Africa) and a diﬀerential GPS (DGPS) receiver\
    \ (model AgGPS® 106,\nmanufactured by Trible Geospatial, Vimercate, Italy), located\
    \ at the back of the collecting tractor, 1.50\nm above the ground; in the second\
    \ one, only the RFID tags are used, which are placed onto each pair\nof trees\
    \ as well as bins.\nIn addition to the implementation of a traceability system,\
    \ the low-cost BLE tag, designed and\ntested in this research work as reported\
    \ in the following sections, allows the detection of several\nfreshness indexes\
    \ for monitoring storage and transport conditions, making them available to the\
    \ user\nby a proper mobile application.\nFigure 4. Representation of bins collection\
    \ by the tractor equipped with a radio frequency identiﬁcation\n(RFID) reader\
    \ and diﬀerential GPS (DGPS) receiver.\nIn [52] two examples of the integration\
    \ between RFID technology and WSNs to trace any step of\nthe SC of the wine production\
    \ from the vineyard to the ﬁnal consumer are proposed. This allowed\ndemonstrating\
    \ how the constantly growing need to know more about the food we eat can be satisﬁed,\n\
    successfully monitoring and storing for traceability purposes, all the valuable\
    \ information of the whole\nSC. In [53] a similar approach is generalized to demonstrate\
    \ its applicability to diﬀerent types of food\nindustries. It has been shown how\
    \ the integration between WSNs and passive RFID technology could\nenable traceability\
    \ improvements for the ﬁnal customer as well as for the company, maintaining a\n\
    constant information line along the production and distribution chain, taking\
    \ care of some critical\nparameters like events in development, production parameters\
    \ (for example temperature, humidity,\netc.), limited storage life, storage and\
    \ transport conditions„ etc. All these improvements guarantee a\nmedium-term return\
    \ of investment for the company as well as a value-adding for the customer.\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 3632\n12 of 43\nOn the other side, an approach to enhance RFID\
    \ technology, with the aim to use it for traceability\nand parameter monitoring,\
    \ is to integrate sensing capability directly on the tag. The design and actual\n\
    use of chemical or biologic sensors as well as indicator labels in smart and active\
    \ packaging, in order\nto monitor the degree of freshness or correct conservation\
    \ of food, is a growing ﬁeld of study, thus\nobtaining at the same time a real-time\
    \ food-status monitoring, a reduction of food waste, an extension\nof shelf life\
    \ and improvement of overall food quality [54]. For example, in [55] the possibility\
    \ to exploit\nsome new chemical interactive materials (CIM) to realize battery-less\
    \ RFID sensor tags, capable to\ndetect diﬀerent gas species or humidity, is explored.\
    \ Speciﬁcally, considering applications to prevent\nfood-wasting, the use of the\
    \ doped poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PSS) as CIM to detect ethanol should be\nevaluated\
    \ because it is one of the indicators of food perishing. Other chemical and physical\
    \ parameters\ncan be monitored, and consequently diﬀerent types of sensors can\
    \ be used, to determine if food is\ngoing to decay. More in detail, in [56] a\
    \ review of the most widespread chemical and biologic sensors\nfor detecting food\
    \ quality is presented. Diﬀerent sensors work properly by monitoring diﬀerent\n\
    indicators for speciﬁc types of food, in order to control freshness markers or\
    \ detect the presence\nof allergens, pathogens, adulterants and toxicants. For\
    \ example, in ﬁsh products, one of the main\nfreshness indicators is the hypoxanthine,\
    \ which is produced by the metabolic degradation of adenosine\ntriphosphate (ATP),\
    \ whereas an indicator of the stored grain spoilage is the emission of CO2 as\
    \ result\nof insects’ infestations. The stored cereals are also often threatened\
    \ by mildews and fungi, which can\nbe discovered by speciﬁc biosensors for mycotoxin\
    \ detection; instead, concerning fruits and vegetables,\nvolatile organic compounds\
    \ (VOC) accumulate when they are closed into containers or packages.\nThe temperature\
    \ and humidity can also be useful for monitoring food spoilage, not to mention\n\
    that temperature is a key–value when it is needed to maintain the cold chain.\
    \ In this regard, some of\nthe authors have already presented in [57] a UHF RFID\
    \ sensor tag suitable for cold chain applications.\nSpeciﬁcally, the device is\
    \ a semi-passive tag that includes an antenna matched with the EM4325 RFID\nchip\
    \ impedance, a micro-controller unit (MCU), LEDs and general purpose input output\
    \ (GPIO) ports,\nto provide both tracking and temperature monitoring of fresh\
    \ and frozen ﬁsh. The device was thought\nof like a reusable board attached to\
    \ the storage box. The tracked data are collected by the system\neach time the\
    \ electronic product code (EPC) is read, but if a temperature threshold value\
    \ is overcome\nfor a speciﬁc time interval, a LED on the board is also lighted\
    \ up providing a visual alert for the\nhuman operator.\nAnother example of RFID\
    \ technology applied to food tracking and monitoring industries is\nproposed in\
    \ [58], where a printed NFC sensor tag was realized, capable to detect the trimethylamine\n\
    (TMA), another indicator of the ﬁsh and meat spoilage. The authors performed a\
    \ practical test by\nsuccessfully measuring the sensor response to the aging of\
    \ a codﬁsh ﬁlet, monitoring the changes in\nthe sensor response from 2 days before\
    \ to 3 days after the expiring date. A similar proof of concept has\nbeen provided\
    \ in [59], where a smart RFID tag for monitoring the meat decay is described.\
    \ As the\nﬁrst step, the authors combined diﬀerent sensors to map the ammonia\
    \ values when temperature and\nhumidity conditions of the pork meat sample varied.\
    \ This procedure allowed to discover 4 levels of\nammonia concentration for accurately\
    \ indicating the freshness of under-test food; then the prototype\nboard, integrating\
    \ the UHF RFID tag, MCU and the ammonia sensor has been developed.\nChemical and\
    \ physical indicators are not the only ones that can give information about the\
    \ good\nconservation of food [60]. Food color is also a good quality marker, especially\
    \ for food industries where\nthe product appearance is as important as its taste.\
    \ An interesting example of sensor tag integrating\na spectral ﬁngerprint sensor\
    \ capable to detect not only red–green–blue (RGB) frequencies, but also\ninfrared\
    \ and ultra violet (UV) light is shown in [61]. The authors realized an FR4 printed\
    \ circuit board\n(PCB) with all components of the sensor tag such as the UHF dipole\
    \ antenna, RFID chip, RGB sensor,\nIR sensor, UV sensor and the MCU. Its possible\
    \ application is in the food industry for the detection of\nthe diﬀerent food\
    \ colors, indicating variations in food quality, for example, the darker part\
    \ of a fruit\nthat is going to perish.\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n13 of 43\nIn [62],\
    \ the authors presented diﬀerent tools and devices (namely sensors, indicators,\
    \ barcodes\nand RFID devices) used in the foodstuﬀs’ intelligent packaging and\
    \ explained their role and features\nfor maintaining the quality of diﬀerent food\
    \ items in terms of both low microbial growth and gas\nconcentration and for providing\
    \ convenience and easiness to users. The review study also discussed\nother packaging\
    \ technical solutions in the supply chain management of food products to control\
    \ theft\nand counterfeiting conducts and to improve the company position on the\
    \ market in terms of branding\nand marketing. As known, sensor tags require an\
    \ anti-collision protocol to avoid collisions with other\ntags present in the\
    \ same area, as happens, for instance, in a warehouse containing numerous tagged\n\
    products; for this reason, in [63] the authors propose a new anti-collision protocol\
    \ based on fuzzy\nframe slotted aloha (FFSA) architecture and a novel dynamic\
    \ frame slotted aloha (DFSA) policy. The\nreported results obtained by performed\
    \ simulations demonstrate a reduction of the reading time in\nconditions of a\
    \ high density of sensor tags.\nMost of the devices above described are disposable,\
    \ ending their life once the tagged product is\ndelivered to the food shop or\
    \ wholesaler; instead, the realized BLE tag is reusable for a large number\nof\
    \ times by picking up the empty containers to be reused by the agricultural producer,\
    \ as described in\ndetail in Section 3.3, thus allowing to amortize the tag cost\
    \ over a long time.\n3. Materials and Methods\n3.1. Design, Functionalities and\
    \ Operating Modes of Automated Fertigation Facility Integrated with the WSN\n\
    In this paragraph, the functionalities and operating modes of designed solar-powered\
    \ farm\nmanagement facility are described, useful for farmers to monitor and control\
    \ their productions,\nto command or simply control the cultivation processes performed\
    \ on crops, such as fertigation\ncycles or disinfestation by pathogens and able\
    \ to allow the farmer or consumer to trace the cultivated\nproducts in all the\
    \ phases following the harvest. The fertigation section represents only a component\n\
    of the whole multi–functional system, fully integrated with the farm management\
    \ software platform\nthat implements a DSS algorithm for controlling all growth\
    \ phases of the cultivated products from\nplanting to harvest. The great beneﬁt\
    \ of the proposed farm facility is also the integration with a custom\ntraceability\
    \ system, for monitoring the storing and transportation conditions of the food\
    \ products\nstarting from their collection.\nIn Figure 5a, the solar-powered wooden\
    \ cottage with the automated fertigation system inside is\nshown; the hydraulic\
    \ mechanical section includes up to 5 containers with inside diﬀerent powdered\n\
    fertilizers, each provided of dosing mechanism, based on a properly sized cochlea,\
    \ for precisely\ncalibrating the amount of fertilizer to be added to the aqueous\
    \ solution (Figure 5b). In this way, the\ndesired amount of fertilizer is added\
    \ to the water in the tank; after, a mechanical mixer actuated by\nan electric\
    \ motor is used for mixing the fertilizing solution. Following, this last is pumped\
    \ by an\nelectric pump towards the diﬀerent land sections that require the fertigation\
    \ process. The composition\nof fertilizing solution is determined based on agronomic\
    \ model speciﬁc for the considered crop;\nthis model has as inputs the weather\
    \ forecasts and especially soil and environmental data detected\ndirectly on-ﬁeld\
    \ by means of the designed WSN. In fact, each WSN node constantly monitors soil\n\
    and crops’ parameters related to a speciﬁc section of the cultivated land and\
    \ wirelessly transmits\nthe detected data, through its coordinator node, towards\
    \ the cloud software platform (as shown in\nthe real implementation of Figure\
    \ 6). This last elaborates received data for determining the correct\nnutritional\
    \ and water requirements of the plants belonging to the considered section, as\
    \ a function\nof crop typology and growth phase according to the dynamic agronomic\
    \ database included in the\ncloud platform. The mathematical forecasting models,\
    \ included into the developed software system,\ncan forecast, depending on the\
    \ set treatments and crops growth status, some advance in time or\ndelay relative\
    \ to the crops’ harvests; the user farmer can activate this functionality according\
    \ to the\npurchase orders, received on the farm web portal by consumers and therefore\
    \ based on the scheduling\nof deliveries of the agri-food products to be made.\n\

    \ into two sectors with area of one\nhectare each.\nAs shown in Figure 7, the\
    \ main section of the developed remotely controlled farming facility was\nthe\
    \ “hardware control unit” which includes both mechanical and hydraulic sections\
    \ controlled by the\nelectronic unit, thereby allowing to obtain optimized fertigation\
    \ cycles in each section of the cultivated\nland, according to the crops’ needs\
    \ deﬁned by sensors data of the speciﬁc WSN cluster on the basis\nof agronomic\
    \ models and weather forecasts. The “hardware control unit” was fully powered\
    \ by a\nphotovoltaic plant consisting of three poly-crystalline 200-W solar panels\
    \ placed on the wooden cottage\nroof, a charge regulator (model Giaride 20A solar\
    \ charge controller, manufactured by Giaride, Inc.,\nHochdorf, Switzerland), the\
    \ DC/AC converter (model EDECOA 3000 W, manufactured by EDECOA,\nInc., Shenzhen,\
    \ China) and accumulation battery (model LAGM-160, manufactured by Leoch, Inc.,\n\
    Shenzhen, China) for storing the produced energy; in addition, a control and protection\
    \ panel was\nproperly sized for protecting the implant against voltage overloads\
    \ and short-circuits. The designed\n“control unit” collects information from weather\
    \ service and on-ﬁeld WSN related to the environmental\nand soil parameters and\
    \ compares them with proper thresholds derived from the agronomic models,\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 3632\n15 of 43\nthereby deﬁning the fertilizing solution composition\
    \ for each cultivated crop typology. Hence, this\nunit properly drives the actuators,\
    \ belonging to mechanical and hydraulic sections, for obtaining the\nestimated\
    \ fertilizing solution and distributing it to desired sections. Another section\
    \ of the developed\nfarming facility is the cloud software platform containing\
    \ the general agronomic database, related to\nthe cultivated crops and derived\
    \ from the agronomic models that determines the threshold values\nused by the\
    \ fertigator during its operation.\nFigure 7. Functional scheme of developed fertigation\
    \ system with the diﬀerent hardware and software\nsections and related data-ﬂow\
    \ between them; the collected data on the land are processed by the control\n\
    unit and then shared with the remote general agronomic database in order to be\
    \ combined with the\nagronomic and sustainability models as well as weather conditions\
    \ or forecast.\nThe fertigation system operations are determined, also, depending\
    \ on the data directly gathered\non-ﬁeld by means of the developed WSN; this last\
    \ is constituted by several sensor nodes, with diﬀerent\nfunctions, located in\
    \ diﬀerent points of the cultivated ﬁeld or greenhouse, for detecting environmental\n\
    and soil parameters as well as data on crops growth. Each sensor node is fed through\
    \ a photovoltaic\nsystem constituted by a small amorphous silicon solar panel,\
    \ the LTC3105 DC–DC voltage regulator\n(manufactured by Linear Technology, Norwood,\
    \ MA, USA) to recharge super-capacitor or lithium\nbattery properly dimensioned\
    \ for getting long energy autonomy.\nThe WSN is arranged according to a tree structure,\
    \ including nodes equipped with sensors for\nacquiring soil and environmental\
    \ data and coordinator nodes (or middleware nodes) that collect the\ndata from\
    \ sensor nodes and transmit them towards the central unit of the fertigation system.\n\
    Referring to the agricultural land shown in Figure 6 employed for the cultivation\
    \ of a vineyard\nwith a total area of just over two hectares, the realized WSN\
    \ was tested by placing a sensor node every\n500 m2 (i.e., 20 nodes distributed\
    \ for each one-hectare sector, as depicted in Figure 6), all connected,\nthrough\
    \ the coordinator nodes, to a single control unit, that manages the fertigation\
    \ processes. In this\nway, two neighboring nodes were spaced up to a maximum value\
    \ of 25–30 m; such distance was chosen\non the basis of some communication tests\
    \ performed also on similar cultivated ﬁelds with plants or\ncrops having a maximum\
    \ height of 70–80 cm and thin stem, in order to guarantee a low packet loss\n\
    percentage (<2%). However, the number of sensor nodes has to be chosen according\
    \ to farmer needs,\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n16 of 43\n(e.g., if more crop typologies\
    \ are placed inside the same sector), taking into account that the NodeMCU\nboard\
    \ ensures a communication range up to 70–80 m in open-ﬁeld condition or up to\
    \ 45–50 m in\npresence of small plants (as above speciﬁed). On the other hand,\
    \ the realized WSN was tested inside an\norchard (in particular cherry trees with\
    \ 3 m average height), at the beginning keeping the same distance\nbetween the\
    \ nodes (30 m), so obtaining a consequent increase of the packet loss percentage\
    \ (≈20%)\nmainly due to the path loss caused by the obstacles; in this scenario,\
    \ the distance between the nodes\nhas to be reduced up to 20 m, for reducing the\
    \ packets loss percentage to a reasonable value (<2%).\nAs mentioned above, in\
    \ Figure 6 the distribution of sensor and coordinator nodes in a vineyard in\n\
    the south of Italy (speciﬁcally north of the Lecce city) is shown, to detect soil\
    \ and air parameters and\ncarry out the communication tests. The land is divided\
    \ into two one-hectare sectors with twenty nodes\nfor each one. Five sensor nodes\
    \ (of the overall 20 nodes for each hectare) are conﬁgured to act also as\ncoordinator\
    \ nodes (or middleware nodes), gathering the data packets provided by the nearby\
    \ sensor\nnodes and periodically retransmitting the data, arranged into a multidimensional\
    \ matrix, to another\ncoordinator node closer to the central unit placed on the\
    \ underside of the land, until reaching the latter\nas following detailed.\nHowever,\
    \ to optimize the WSN topology and reduce its cost, the number of coordinator\
    \ nodes can\nbe reduced; consequently, longer distance between them and the central\
    \ unit has to be covered. In this\ncase, a coordinator node equipped with an external\
    \ antenna is required; thus, as an alternative to the\nNodeMCU board, a WEMOS\
    \ D1 mini board (manufactured by Shenzhen RobotLinking Technology\nCo., Shenzhen,\
    \ China) equipped with a +5 dBi antenna was tested in these conditions allowing\
    \ a\nhigher communication range. Regarding the WSN implementation as shown in\
    \ Figure 6 for its on-ﬁeld\ntesting, since the average distance between the diﬀerent\
    \ nodes is less than 45–50 m (namely about\n30 m) without the presence of large\
    \ obstacles, both sensor and coordinator nodes were realized by\nemploying the\
    \ ESP8266 NodeMCU board.\nIn addition, the central unit implements a mechanism\
    \ for detecting malfunctions or connection\nproblems of each sensor node; in fact,\
    \ if for ﬁve consecutive observation intervals (namely after two\nand half hours),\
    \ a given sensor node doesn’t transmit the sensors data, an alert message is sent\
    \ to the\ncloud platform, which warns the operator to check the node conditions.\n\
    All the functionalities of the developed IoT-oriented farm management facility\
    \ are governed by a\nsuitable software platform, enabling the farmer or agronomist\
    \ automatic management of the fertigation\nof controlled crops, the remote actuation\
    \ and monitoring of the speciﬁc agricultural treatments, but\nalso the purchase\
    \ of agri-food products by the consumers, as discussed in Section 5.\n3.2. Sensor\
    \ Node Architecture and Related Operating Modalities\nCommunication networks have\
    \ evolved towards the IoT sector; currently, the most widely used\ntechnologies\
    \ are SigFox, LoRa, BLE, Zigbee and Wi-Fi. Depending on the application, one must\n\
    consider their performance metrics to choose one technology over another. For\
    \ example, if technology\nmaturity is the metric, Lora can be considered in a\
    \ low state, Zigbee in a medium state and Wi-Fi\nin a very high state. Instead,\
    \ if the availability is the metric, then Lora and Zigbee exhibit a low\nlevel\
    \ while Wi-Fi a high level [64]. Speciﬁcally, in WSNs applications in precision\
    \ agriculture, Wi-Fi\ntechnology is an excellent option, even more so if the Wi-Fi\
    \ connection is established by employing\nthe low-cost ESP8266 module that has\
    \ an integrated chip with Wi-Fi connection and supports the\ntransmission control\
    \ protocol (TCP)/IP protocol. The main objective is to provide any ESP8266-based\n\
    node with access to the Wi-Fi network and act as an acquisition, processing and\
    \ Wi-Fi communication\nboard. In addition, in order to oﬀset the energy expenditure\
    \ of Wi-Fi technology, this module has a\nlow-consumption architecture that allows\
    \ itself to work in 3 diﬀerent modes: active mode, sleep mode\nand deep sleep\
    \ mode, as detailed and implemented in the following sections.\nSensors 2020,\
    \ 20, 3632\n17 of 43\nThe designed WSN is constituted by sensor nodes, equipped\
    \ with several sensors for acquiring\nsoil and environmental parameters, wirelessly\
    \ connected to the corresponding coordinator node that\ncollects data from cluster\
    \ nodes and sends them to the control unit of the farm management system,\nto\
    \ be immediately shared on the cloud software platform. Both node typologies are\
    \ based on the\nESP8266 NodeMCU electronic board that includes ESP8266 Wi-Fi chip;\
    \ several commercial sensors\nwere connected to acquire soil and environmental\
    \ parameters. The NodeMCU was chosen since it\ncombines, into a single device,\
    \ microcontroller functionalities for data acquisition and processing,\nas well\
    \ as a Wi-Fi transceiver for the communication between the WSN nodes; also, it\

    \ super-capacitor) fed by a small ﬂexible photovoltaic panel, able to ensure up\
    \ to 9 days of\nenergy autonomy (without any availability of solar energy, surely\
    \ an extreme unrealistic eventuality).\nParticularly, the used amorphous-silicon\
    \ waterproof solar panel (manufactured by Dongguan City\nXinliangguang New Energy\
    \ Technology Co., Guangdong, China, Figure 8f) is featured by a 1.5-W\nmaximum\
    \ deliverable power, 2.0-V open-circuit voltage, 1200-mA short-circuit current\
    \ and about\n10% conversion eﬃciency. A DC-DC regulation circuit (breakout board\
    \ designed by Crispytronics,\nSan Diego, CA, USA) based on the LTC3105 step-up\
    \ converter (manufactured by Linear Technology,\nNorwood, MA, USA) was used to\

    \ by\nMalvern, PA, USA) or a rechargeable 100-mAh LiPo battery (model Go Wireless®\
    \ 100-mAh LFT401430,\nBeaverton, OR, USA).\nIn order to reduce the sensor node\
    \ power consumption, some structural modiﬁcations were\nperformed on the ESP8266\
    \ NodeMCU board (manufactured by Espressif Systems, Shanghai, China);\nparticularly,\
    \ the main one concerns the replacement of the proprietary ESP8266 NodeMCU voltage\n\
    regulator (model AMS1117-3.3, manufactured by Advanced Monolithic Systems, Livermore,\
    \ CA, USA)\nwith the MCP1825S-3302E model (manufactured by Microchip Technology,\
    \ Chandler, AZ, USA, see\nFigure 8a) featured by a lower quiescent current (typical\
    \ value IQ = 120 µA) and dropout voltage (typical\nvalue ∆V = 210 mV for ILOAD\
    \ = 500 mA), respect to the same quantities of the initial one (IQ = 5mA\nand\
    \ ∆V = 1.1 V for ILOAD = 800 mA). Thereby a signiﬁcant saving in sensor node power\
    \ consumption\nwas obtained during the deep sleep mode in which the voltage regulator\
    \ current consumption is the\nmain contribution.\nMoreover, because the most energetically\
    \ expensive phase is the transmission one between sensor\nnodes, to extend node\
    \ autonomy, WSN operation was properly optimized according to the ﬂowchart\nof\
    \ Figure 9, that describes the operating modalities of both sensor and coordinator\
    \ nodes. Each sensor\nnode acquires the soil and environmental parameters from\
    \ sensors and sends them to the relative\ncoordinator node; at the transmission\
    \ end, the sensor node enters in deep sleep mode for 30 min (time\ninterval settable\
    \ by user) for reducing its power consumption. If the connection with the coordinator\n\
    node fails, the sensor node retries this operation every 1 min until the connection\
    \ is obtained. During\nthe connection phase, sensor nodes belonging to a given\
    \ sector send acquired data to the corresponding\ncoordinator node; every 30 min\
    \ this last arranges collected data into a single packet and transmits it to\n\
    the electronic control unit to be sent, via an Internet connection, to the cloud\
    \ software platform, and\nthen returns in the receiving mode.\nThe proposed farming\
    \ facility is constituted by low-cost solutions, but reliable at the same time,\n\
    in all its sections compared to other competitor systems. The cost of the fertigator\
    \ and WSN nodes\nis a function of the land size; for instance, supposing a two-hectare\
    \ ﬁeld, the cost of the fertigator\nis about 2900–3200 €, including mechanical,\
    \ electronic and hydraulic sections. For the WSN, the\ncost of each sensor node\
    \ is about 35 €, signiﬁcantly lower compared to similar solutions present on\n\
    the market. Considering a two-hectare ﬁeld (as described in Figure 6), divided\
    \ into two sectors of\nabout one hectare each and placing a node every 500 m2\
    \ (extendable up to 2000 m2, but with rougher\nmonitoring), 40 nodes (reducible\
    \ up to 10) are required for covering the whole land; therefore, the cost\nof\
    \ the WSN is about 1400 € (350 € for the solution with fewer nodes in any case\
    \ suﬃcient to ensure a\nproper communication).\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n19 of\

    \ BLE Sensor Tag for Monitoring the Product Conditions and\nSupporting Traceability\n\
    A BLE sensor tag was developed for monitoring the correct storage conditions of\
    \ the agri-food\nproducts during the storing or transportation, in order to assess\
    \ its freshness and integrity, but\nalso to support the product traceability.\
    \ The parameters selected for verifying the good storage\nconditions are the concentration\
    \ of total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs), NH3 (ammonia) and\nCO2, the environmental\
    \ temperature and humidity [60]. The TVOCs concentration summarizes\ncontributions\
    \ from some common gaseous species produced during the deterioration of food,\
    \ such as\nCH3CH2OH (ethanol), C2H4 (ethylene), CS2 (carbon disulﬁde), etc. [54,56].\n\
    Also, the NH3 represents a good indicator of protein decomposition, thus its concentration\
    \ can\nbe used to determine meat freshness [65]. Instead, the CO2 monitoring can\
    \ be used to control the\nquality of stored cereal and detect their spoilage.\
    \ In particular, CO2 concentrations between 600 and\n1.500 ppm indicate the onset\
    \ of mold growth due to excessive moisture inside the stored material\nor moisture\
    \ inﬁltration into the structure; instead, concentrations higher than 1500 ppm\
    \ indicate a\nserious mold growth aﬀecting the whole material or an infestation\
    \ of insects inside the stored food [66].\nThe developed BLE smart tag, oﬀering\
    \ a multiparameter detection, is featured by great versatility, so\nallowing its\
    \ application to diﬀerent food typologies (e.g., vegetables, fruits, meat, ﬁsh,\
    \ etc.), unlike\nother devices reported in the literature or present on the market\
    \ which are tailored for a speciﬁc\nproduct typology.\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n\
    20 of 43\nThe designed sensor tag uses the HM-10 BLE module (manufactured by Jinan\
    \ Huamao Technology\nco, Jinan City, China) based on CC2541 Integrated Circuit\
    \ (IC) (manufactured by Texas Instrument,\nDallas, TX, USA), a system-on-chip\
    \ (SoC) combining a 2.4 GHz BLE transceiver, compliant to Bluetooth\nv4.0 protocol\
    \ stack, with an 8051 MCU, featured by 128 KB ﬂash memory, 8 KB RAM and several\n\
    supporting features and peripherals (i.e., 12-bit ADC, 23 General-Purpose I/O\
    \ Pins, Watchdog Timer).\nThe wide range of peripherals and the integrated BLE\
    \ transceiver, implementing the v4.1 BLE\nstack, along with the advanced PMU are\
    \ the main reasons that justify the choice of CC2541 IC for the\nimplementation\
    \ of the BLE smart tag. It has three distinct low-power modalities (i.e., PMi,\
    \ i = 1,2,3) with\nincreasingly lower current consumption, making it ideal for\
    \ portable devices, wearable applications\nand consumer electronics. The CC2541\
    \ was programmed using CC debugger and programmer,\nemploying IAR Workbench for\
    \ 8051 MCU.\nThe HM-10 module was set as iBeacon for supporting the product traceability\
    \ in the whole supply\nchain; during the sleep period of the BLE tag, an advertising\
    \ time interval of 546.25 ms was set for\nthe iBeacon modality and the broadcasted\
    \ packet universally unique identiﬁer (UUID), major, minor,\nTx power) was used\
    \ to identify the food container where the BLE sensor tag was applied. Obviously,\n\
    this tracking system aims to trace the agglomerations of food products with medium-large\
    \ dimensions\n(pallets, bins, boxes, etc.) and not for consumer-level tracking.\
    \ The BLE tag can be reused a large\nnumber of times, once the container is collected\
    \ empty from the food shop or wholesaler by the farm.\nIn addition, the tag is\
    \ applied to the inner surface by two screws, thus it can be easily removed and\n\
    applied to another container, in case of damage of the latter. For the intended\
    \ use, since the BLE smart\ntag can be reused several times, the economic impact\
    \ related to the purchase of the device is greatly\nreduced. Further details about\
    \ the operation of the developed tracking system are reported in the\nfollowing\
    \ Section 5.\nThe sensor tag is equipped with a CCS811 digital gas sensor (manufactured\
    \ by AMS, Premstetten,\nAustria), an ultra-low-power metal oxide (MOX) gas sensor\
    \ able to detect the TVOCs and equivalent\nCO2 (eCO2) concentrations for air quality\
    \ monitoring applications. The measurements are obtained\nby means of intelligent\
    \ algorithms able to process raw data related to current and voltage values\n\
    provided by the MOX sensor and acquired by an integrated ADC, to then be made\
    \ available to a\nhost MCU using the I2C interface. Furthermore, the sensor has\
    \ 3 low-power modes optimized for\nextending the autonomy in portable applications.\
    \ The wide detection range (0 ÷ 1187 ppb for TVOC\nand 400 ÷ 8192 ppm for CO2),\
    \ the high sensitivity, and the low power consumption make the CCS811\nsensor\
    \ ideal for the considered application, given also its high robustness to the\
    \ external agents\n(high humidity and temperature, as well as presence of dust).\
    \ The CCS811-based breakout board\n(manufactured by Adafruit Ind., New York, NY,\
    \ USA, Figure 10a) was employed, modiﬁed to reduce\nthe power consumption with\
    \ the removal of the built-in 3.3 V voltage regulator (model MIC5225-3.3,\nmanufactured\
    \ by Microchip Technology, Chandler, AZ, USA), since the sensor was fed directly\
    \ by the\n3.3 V voltage regulator (model XC6206-3.3 with a lower quiescent current\
    \ of only 25 µA in idle mode,\nmanufactured by Torex Semiconductor, Tokyo, Japan)\
    \ included in the power supply section of the BLE\ntag (Figure 11).\nIn addition,\
    \ the sensor tag includes a BMP280 digital temperature and humidity sensor\n(manufactured\
    \ by Bosch Sensortec, Reutlingen, Germany), featured by 300–1100 hPa pressure\
    \ range\nand −40–+85 ◦C temperature range; it is based on a piezo-resistive pressure\
    \ sensor combined with\nan integrated mixed-signal conditioning and acquisition\
    \ section, then providing the conversion\nresults through a digital interface\
    \ (serial peripheral interface—SPI or inter-integrated circuit—I2C)\n(Figure 10b).\
    \ The small dimension and the high number of the functionalities of BMP280 sensor\n\
    allowed us to signiﬁcantly reduce the overall size of the realized BLE tag, maintaining\
    \ at the\nsame time very low its power consumption. Three diﬀerent operating modalities\
    \ are available,\nto optimize the power consumption in low-power applications.\
    \ To detect the ammonia concentration,\na Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS)\
    \ MOX gas sensor (model MiCS-5914, manufactured by\nSensortech, Inc., Oxnard,\
    \ CA, USA) was employed, featured by a 1–500 ppm detection range, a sensing\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 3632\n21 of 43\nresistance in the air between 10 KΩ and 1500\
    \ KΩ and sensitivity factor (Rair/R1 ppm) between 1.5\nand 15. A MiCS-5914-based\
    \ breakout board (manufactured by Feng Tai Co., Hong Kong, China),\nequipped with\
    \ an acquisition and transmission section based on the STM32 MCU (manufactured\
    \ by\nST Microelectronics Co., Geneva, Switzerland), was interfaced with the HM10\
    \ board by I2C serial\ncommunication (Figure 10c). The built-in 93 Ω pull-down\
    \ resistor in series to the internal heater\nof the MOX sensor was substituted\
    \ with a 47 Ω resistor, to power supply the board with 3.3 V\nand still ensuring\
    \ the right value (2.2 V) of the heater voltage; furthermore, a high-side channel-P\n\
    metal-oxide-semiconductor ﬁeld-eﬀect transistor (PMOSFET) switch was added to\
    \ turn oﬀ the sensor,\nto reduce the power consumption when the sensor tag is\
    \ in the idle mode.\nFigure 10. (a) CCS811 breakout board for detecting total\
    \ volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) and\neCO2 concentration; (b) BPM280 breakout\
    \ board used for monitoring environmental temperature and\nhumidity; (c) MiCS-5914\
    \ breakout board for detecting the ammonia concentration.\nThe three sensors were\
    \ interfaced through the I2C bus with the CC2541 TWI (two-wire interface)\nmodule\
    \ corresponding to the pins 15 (serial data—SDA) and 20 (serial clock—SCL) of\
    \ the HM-10\nboard, placing two 4.7 KΩ pull-up resistors on the two lines. In\
    \ addition, the CCS811 sensor was kept\nin sleep condition when no measurement\
    \ was required, thus reducing the current absorbed by the\nsensor (i.e., only\
    \ 19 µA with a 1.8 V power supply); the sensor was woken up by putting down the\n\
    nWAKE line (low active) through a GPIO (i.e., PIO11 pin) of the HM-10 board and\
    \ then setting the third\nmeasurement modality (called Mode 3) in the MEAS_MODE\
    \ register; after, 10 min have to be expected\nbefore the measurement. Similarly,\
    \ also the ammonia sensor (MiCS-5914) was turned on 10 min before\nthe reading,\
    \ so allowing the sensor to reach the optimal operative temperature. Such time\
    \ interval was\ndetermined through diﬀerent experimental tests carried out on\
    \ the two gas sensors (for TVOC and CO2\nand NH3, respectively), by comparing\
    \ the obtained measures with those provided by two commercial\ngas detectors,\
    \ namely a TVOC and CO2 combined detector (model ZN-202S, manufactured by Air\
    \ Ae\nSteward, Inc., Shenzhen, China) and another for Ammonia (model WASO-XM,\
    \ manufactured Hunan\nGri Instrument Co., Hunan, China).\nThe power supply section\
    \ is based on the XC6206-3.3 step-down voltage regulator for adapting\nthe voltage\
    \ provided by the 2500 mAh Lipo battery (model LIPO785060 manufactured by Pkcell\n\
    battery Co., Shenzhen, China) to 3.3 V required by all the devices included in\
    \ the BLE tag (Figure 11).\nThe power consumption analysis of the BLE tag prototype\
    \ is reported in the Section 4.2, as well as the\ndescription of the proposed\
    \ tracking and tracing system based on the BLE smart tags and the mobile\napplication\
    \ is detailed in the Section 5.1.\nThe cost of the developed BLE smart tag is\
    \ low, about 25–30 € including all sections, despite its\nsuperior functionalities\
    \ compared to other competitor devices present on the market, which usually\n\
    monitor only a single quantity (e.g., temperature or a single gas species). However,\
    \ this cost is easily\ndepreciable, given that the device is reusable for a long\
    \ time, as previously described.\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n22 of 43\nFigure 11.\

    \ constituting\nthe BLE smart tag.\n4. Results\n4.1. Functional Testing and Power\
    \ Consumption Analysis of Designed WSN Node\nThe developed WSN was tested in order\
    \ to determine the eﬀective power consumption of each\nnode typology and thus\
    \ establish the energy autonomy of the employed power supplying device.\nSpeciﬁcally,\
    \ the power consumption of a sensor node for diﬀerent operating modes and scenarios\n\
    are below reported. As described above, the original ESP8266 NodeMCU voltage regulator\
    \ (model\nAMS1117-3.3) was replaced with a more eﬃcient one (model MCP1825S-3302E)\
    \ in terms of quiescent\ncurrent and dropout voltage to reduce the node power\
    \ consumption.\nPower consumption is an essential factor in the performance and\
    \ life of WSN. To analyze network\noperation, we take into account that each node\
    \ sends its name, an ID message that identiﬁes the number\nof data packets sent\
    \ by each node, the Wi-Fi signal strength in the transmission and the sending\
    \ time.\nThis work emphasizes energy consumption due to the impact of Wi-Fi and\
    \ BLE technologies. While\ninteresting, other performance metrics, as the communication\
    \ statistics, are not considered in this\nanalysis, but are expected to be proposed\
    \ in future work. Some of these parameters are related to the\nnumber of packets,\
    \ where all the messages could be sorted by node and number of sent messages\n\
    in order to obtain the lost messages in the network. With this arrangement, the\
    \ messages that were\nnot labeled as consecutive numbers are searched to verify\
    \ that there was no jump. In addition, the\nnodes have timers that control the\
    \ losses or delays and sliding windows for the ﬂow control in the\nsending of\
    \ data. In addition, since the network keeps all the nodes synchronized, it is\
    \ enough to\nsubtract the reception time and the emission time to remove the latency\
    \ in the reception of messages.\nIt is interesting to note that the nodes continue\
    \ to send the message numbers without interruption,\ndemonstrating a high network\
    \ capacity against failures.\nThe experimental setup for power consumptions analysis\
    \ is depicted in Figure 12; the sensor\nnode was fed with 3.7 V, provided by a\
    \ power supply generator (model E3631A, manufactured by\nAgilent Technologies,\
    \ Santa Clara, CA, USA), directly applied to the voltage regulator input, voltage\n\
    value chosen to reproduce the real use of the node fed by the LiPo battery or\
    \ 90 F super-capacitor.\nA digital oscilloscope (model DSO5072P, manufactured\
    \ by Hantek, Shandong, China) was used to\nacquire the voltage drop waveforms\
    \ across a 4 Ω sensing resistor in series with node power supply\nSensors 2020,\
    \ 20, 3632\n23 of 43\nline, for determining absorbed current values during the\
    \ diﬀerent operating phases (inset of Figure 12).\nIn order to accurately measure\
    \ the very low absorbed current during deep sleep modality, also a digital\nmultimeter\
    \ (model GDM8351, manufactured by Gwinstek, Taipei, Taiwan, with 1 µV resolution)\
    \ was\nplaced in parallel to the 4 Ω sensing resistor. In addition, from the acquired\
    \ signals, the time duration\nof each node operating phase is determined to calculate\
    \ the related energy consumption.\nIn Figure 13a, the oscilloscope traces related\
    \ to the 4 Ω sensing resistor terminals (yellow and light\nblue lines) and to\
    \ their diﬀerence (purple) are reported, thus being able to easily distinguish\
    \ each node\nfunctioning mode, namely the wake up (green box), unsuccessful data\
    \ transmission to an unavailable\ncoordinator node (yellow box) and subsequent\
    \ return to the deep sleep modality (NodeMcu switching\noﬀ, red box). As above\
    \ described, the sensor node tries to establish a connection with the coordinator\n\
    node for a time duration of 20 s (as depicted in the ﬂowchart of Figure 9), otherwise,\
    \ it returns in\ndeep sleep mode to reduce its power consumption (Figure 13a).\
    \ The absorbed current values from the\nsensor node, during all the operating\
    \ phases, are then determined.\nFigure 12. Experimental setup to determine sensor\
    \ node power consumption in the diﬀerent functioning\nmodes, namely coordinator\
    \ node searching-data acquiring and transmission–deep sleep mode.\nFigure 13.\
    \ (a) Oscilloscope traces acquired during unsuccessful connection attempt of the\
    \ sensor node\nwith coordinator node; after 20 s, the node returns in deep sleep\
    \ mode to reduce the power consumption;\n(b) oscilloscope traces acquired during\
    \ a successful connection of the sensor node with coordinator\nnode; only 5.6\
    \ s were required to complete the data detection and transmission phases.\nIn\
    \ Figure 13b, the same signals of Figure 13a are reported when a connection was\
    \ established\nbetween the sensor node and the corresponding coordinator. At ﬁrst,\
    \ the sensor node wakes up from\ndeep sleep mode, switches on the connected sensors\
    \ to acquire interest data and then establishes a\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n24\
    \ of 43\nconnection with the coordinator node; in this phase, the data are acquired\
    \ by sensors and sent to the\ncoordinator node (red box). Finally, the ESP8266\
    \ NodeMCU switches oﬀ the connected sensors (green\nbox) and returns in deep sleep\
    \ mode (yellow box) for 30 min, as described in Figure 9. Similarly, the\ncurrent\
    \ values and time duration of diﬀerent operative phases were determined; the time\
    \ interval\nneeded to complete the acquisition and transmission phases is equal\
    \ to 8.7 s (Figure 13b), while a\n5.6-s-long time is required for the only data\
    \ transmission. The time interval required to establish the\nconnection varies\
    \ over the diﬀerent operating cycles according to the availability of coordinator\
    \ node;\nhowever, a 3.1 s mean value was determined based on the several carried\
    \ out experimental tests.\nGiven the above-reported data relative to both time\
    \ durations and current values during the\ndiﬀerent sensor node operating phases,\
    \ its energy consumptions can be calculated. Because a 4 Ω\nsensing resistor was\
    \ used, the voltage drop across it and the corresponding absorbed current associated\n\
    with each operative phase, are following reported in Table 1.\nTable 1. Absorbed\
    \ current and time duration values, extracted by the oscilloscope traces, related\
    \ to the\ndiﬀerent node operating phases.\nSensor Node Modality\nVoltage Drop\

    \ the energy\nconsumption estimate of the whole sensor node operating cycle is\
    \ given by the following relation:\nEstimated Energy Consumption = 1800 s × 0.067\

    \ V\n48 × 4.219 × 10−3 V = 8.88 gg,\n(6)\nTherefore, a sensor node energy autonomy\
    \ of almost 9 days was obtained, in the condition in\nwhich the energy contribution\
    \ from the solar panel for recharging the 90 F super-capacitor storage\ndevice\
    \ is totally absent due to the bad weather conditions (unrealistic eventuality).\n\
    Afterwards, the sensor node was power supplied by a 100 mAh single cell LiPo battery,\
    \ recharged\nby the solar energy harvesting system (by placing the jumper correspondent\
    \ to the 4.1 V output voltage\non LTC3105-based conditioning board); through the\
    \ same experimental setup of Figure 12, the voltage\ndrop across the 4 Ω sensing\
    \ resistor during the diﬀerent sensor node operating modalities was acquired\n\
    by the digital multimeter. Similarly, the absorbed current values and the respective\
    \ time durations\nwere determined (Figure 14) and thus the charge amount required\
    \ by the sensor node during the\ndiﬀerent operating phases calculated, as following\
    \ reported:\n•\nDeep-sleep mode:\nI1 = ∆V1\nRsens = 0.273 mV\n4 Ω\n= 0.068 mA\
    \ → Q1 = I1 × t1 = 0.068 mA × 1800 s\n= 0.122 C (0.034 mAh),\n(7)\n•\nCoordinator\
    \ node searching mode:\nI2 = ∆V2\nRsens = 83.928 mV\n4 Ω\n= 20.982 mA → Q2 = I2\
    \ × t2 = 20.982 mA × 3.1 s\n= 0.065 C (0.018 mAh),\n(8)\n•\nAcquisition and data\
    \ transmission mode:\nI3 = ∆V3\nRsens = 149.012 mV\n4 Ω\n= 37.253 mA → Q3 = I3\
    \ × t3 = 37.253 mA × 5.6 s\n= 0.208 C (0.058 mAh),\n(9)\nAs can be noted, the\
    \ current and charge values obtained are very similar to those previously\nreported.\
    \ Therefore, the electric charge needed to complete a single operating cycle is\
    \ given by:\nQTOT = Q1 + Q2 + Q3 = 0.034 mAh + 0.018 mAh + 0.058 mAh = 0.110 mAh,\n\
    (10)\nGiven that the system performs 48 operating cycles per day and assuming\
    \ a 30% LiPo battery\ndischarge margin, the sensor node autonomy could be expressed\
    \ by the following relation:\nAutonomy [gg] = 0.7 × Battery Capacity [mAh]\n48\
    \ × QTOT [mAh]\n= 0.7 × 100 mAh\n48 × 0.11 mAh = 13.26 gg,\n(11)\nA 70% discharge\
    \ margin was supposed because within that limit the LiPo battery can ensure the\n\
    right supply voltage for the sensor node (minimum value = 3.2 V), below that state\
    \ of charge then\nthe battery voltage goes down suddenly. Therefore, a sensor\
    \ node energy autonomy greater than\n13 days was obtained with the developed system,\
    \ in conditions of absence or limited availability of\nsolar energy to recharge\
    \ the used storage device. The diﬀerent discharge proﬁle of LiPo batteries\nrespect\
    \ to super-capacitors allows a greater sensor node energy autonomy, thus the LiPo\
    \ batteries must\nbe considered more appropriate for the considered application.\n\

    \ Modalities and Power Characterization of Developed BLE Smart Tag\nThe prototype\
    \ of the BLE smart tag was realized by placing the sensing breakout boards on\
    \ a\nprototyping board and realizing the connections on its back (Figure 15);\
    \ to simplify the wiring, the\nHM-10 module was soldered on an adapting board\
    \ in order to expose all its pins, making easy the\nconnection with the programmer.\
    \ In addition, the voltage regulation section, based on the XC6206-3.3\nIC, was\
    \ placed on the back of the prototyping board, as well as the LiPo battery on\
    \ the bottom of the\nplastic box, under the electronic boards; for sake of clarity,\
    \ the LiPo battery is shown in Figure 15,\nbesides to the board. All the mentioned\
    \ components were positioned inside a plastic box, with a\nperforated cover to\
    \ allow the right detection of parameters inside the container where the BLE sensor\n\
    tag is installed.\nFigure 15.\nThe prototype of the developed BLE smart tag placed\
    \ inside a plastic box with a\nperforated cover.\nThe operation modality of the\
    \ developed BLE smart tag is described in the ﬂowchart reported in\nFigure 16;\
    \ at ﬁrst, the setting of diﬀerent interfaces and registers of the CC2541 IC (microcontroller\n\
    on board to the HM-10 control module) has to be deﬁned, to allow connection with\
    \ the employed\nsensors. Afterward, for a time interval equals to the wake_up\
    \ period (default value 24 h), the HM-10\nmodule is set in the iBeacon modality,\
    \ broadcasting an advertising packet every 546.25 ms (time\ninterval between the\
    \ advertising packets, as detailed in Figure 18a) by exploiting the halSleep()\
    \ and\nosal_set_event() methods of the BLE v1.4.1 stack; when the module doesn’t\
    \ transmit any advertising\npackets, the HM-10 module brings itself in PM3 low\
    \ power modality, so allowing a great reduction of\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n27\
    \ of 43\nthe power consumption. Once the sleep timer overﬂows the wake_up time\
    \ interval (default value\n24 h), the HM-10 module is switched to the active mode,\
    \ thus waking up the CCS811 sensor and\nswitching on, by the CMOS switch, the\
    \ MiCS-5914 sensor for 10 min allowing them to reach their\noperative temperature;\
    \ as previously described, such time interval was experimentally determined,\n\
    as the minimum value required by the two sensors for reaching their operative\
    \ temperature. After\nthis time interval, also the BMP280 temperature and moisture\
    \ sensor is woken up and then all the\ndata are acquired from the sensors and\
    \ elaborated for extracting the aforementioned parameters (i.e.,\ngas concentrations,\
    \ temperature and humidity, Figure 16). Afterward, each parameter is compared\n\
    with speciﬁc thresholds, chosen as a function of the stored agri-food product\
    \ typology, since each food\ntypology is featured by a storage temperature and\
    \ speciﬁc gas types that indicate the food spoilage, as\nreported in the literature\
    \ [59,67,68] (Figure 16); besides, such threshold values depend on the shape\n\
    and size of the food container, on the positioning into the container of the tag\
    \ respect to the product\nlevel, as well as on the presence of ventilation, namely\
    \ if the food package is sealed or open. The\nthreshold values can be set or modiﬁed\
    \ by reprogramming the BLE smart tag, every time that the\nagri-food product stored\
    \ in the container is changed.\nFigure 16. Flowchart related to the operation\
    \ modality of developed Bluetooth low energy (BLE) smart\ntag placed inside the\
    \ container where the agri-food products are stored.\nIf abnormal parameter values\
    \ are detected, the wake_up period is halved compared to the previous\none, up\
    \ to a minimum value of 6 h; afterward, only if no monitored parameter is beyond\
    \ the preset\nlimits, the wake_up period is reset to 24 h (Figure 16). Following,\
    \ the BLE tag enables the deep sleep\nmode for the BMP280 and CCS811 sensors and\
    \ turns oﬀ the MiCS-5914 sensor and then it establishes\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n\
    28 of 43\nthe connection with the Bluetooth gateway, towards which transmits the\
    \ acquired data along with a\nwarning byte, which indicates if a certain parameter\
    \ has assumed an abnormal value (alarm condition).\nSpeciﬁcally, 5 bits of the\
    \ warning byte are associated with the 5 parameters acquired by the BLE tag,\n\
    arranged as depicted in Figure 17 (each bit set to “1” logic in case of an alarm\
    \ condition). Finally, the\noperating cycle above described starts again with\
    \ the BLE smart tag set in the iBeacon modality, with\nthe same setting previously\
    \ reported, for the time interval (24 h or 12 h or 6 h), as determined in the\n\
    previous cycle.\nFigure 17. Structure of the warning byte transmitted from the\
    \ BLE tag to signal an alarm condition\nrelated to the acquired parameters.\n\
    During both iBeacon modality and data transmission phase of the BLE smart tag,\
    \ the transmitted\npower was set to 0 dBm by using hciStatus_t HCI_EXT_SetTxPowerCmd()\
    \ method, in order to comply\nwith the detection range requirements described\
    \ in the following Section 5.1.\nAfterward, the BLE smart tag was tested for determining\
    \ its overall power consumption, thus\nestablishing the energy autonomy. A GDM8351-model\
    \ digital multimeter was placed in series to\nthe power supply line of the BLE\
    \ tag, for acquiring the current values with a 100 ms sampling rate\nto determine\
    \ the power consumption for each operative phase. In Table 2, the measured current\n\
    values are summarized, along with the time duration of each phase determined by\
    \ placing a 10-Ω\nsensing resistor in series to the power supply line and monitoring,\
    \ with a DSO5072P-model digital\noscilloscope, the voltage drop on the sensing\
    \ resistor. The measures were carried out by considering\na 24 h wake_up period\
    \ and the time durations reported in Table 2 refer to a single operative cycle\n\
    of the BLE tag (set of phases outlined in the ﬂowchart of Figure 16). In addition,\
    \ in Figure 18a the\noscilloscope traces related to the 10-Ω sensing resistor\
    \ terminals (yellow and green lines) and their\ndiﬀerence (purple) are reported,\
    \ during the iBeacon modality of BLE smart tag; as it can be noted\nfrom Figure\
    \ 18b, a 130 mV peak value for the 10-Ω drop voltage was measured during the packet\n\
    transmission (time duration of 5 ms), corresponding to a 13 mA absorbed current.\
    \ As can be noted in\nFigure 18a, the time interval between the iBeacon packet\
    \ transmissions, represented by the current\nabsorption peaks, is equal to about\
    \ 545 ms, time interval previously set during the setting phase of\nthe CC2541\
    \ module (Figure 16). Thanks to the ﬁrmware strategies implemented in the ﬂowchart\
    \ of\nFigure 16 for the power consumption minimization of the diﬀerent modules,\
    \ a very long lifetime (more\nthan 5 months) of the employed LiPo battery was\
    \ obtained, as reported below.\nTable 2. Current absorbed by the BLE smart tag\

    \ voltage drop is equal to 130 mV, corresponding to an absorbed current value\
    \ of\n13 mA.\nOnce measured the current values for each BLE tag operative phase,\
    \ then the overall charge\nrequired to carry out an operating cycle was calculated\
    \ as follows:\n•\niBeacon phase:\nQ1 = 0.237 mA × 24 h = 5.688 mAh,\n(12)\n•\n\
    Heating phase of the gas sensors:\nQ2 = 28.287 mA × 600\n3600 h = 4.714 mAh,\n\
    (13)\n•\nAcquisition and transmission phase:\nQ3 = 8.675 mA × 1.426\n3600 h =\
    \ 0.003 mAh,\n(14)\nThe overall charge required for a single operative cycle of\
    \ the BLE tag is given by the\nfollowing formula:\nQTOT = Q1 + Q2 + Q3 = 5.688\
    \ mAh + 4.714 mAh + 0.003 mAh = 10.405 mAh,\n(15)\nFollowing, assuming a 30% LiPo\
    \ battery (with a 2500 mAh capacity) discharge margin, the energy\nautonomy of\
    \ the BLE smart tag was determined:\nAutonomy [gg] = 0.7 × Battery Capacity [mAh]\n\
    QTOT [mAh]\n= 0.7 × 2500 mAh\n10.405 mAh\n= 168.20 gg,\n(16)\nTherefore, an energy\
    \ autonomy greater than 168 days (i.e., 5.6 months) was obtained for the\ndeveloped\
    \ BLE sensor tag, fully satisfactory for the considered application.\n5. Discussion\n\
    As discussed above, the smart making-decisions section of developed IoT-based\
    \ farm facility is\nthe software platform, enabling the control and management\
    \ of all its functionalities and oﬀering to the\ncustomers some value-added services\
    \ related to the traceability of agricultural products; speciﬁcally,\nthe platform\
    \ includes the so-named Campaign Registry application, able to monitor and establish,\
    \ in\nan optimized way, the fertigation treatments for each monitored land area\
    \ on the basis of the following\ninputs and agronomic models:\nSensors 2020, 20,\
    \ 3632\n30 of 43\n•\nWSN data related to environmental, soil and crops parameters;\n\
    •\nUser inputs, namely data entered, through the dedicated “Farm App” installed\
    \ on the\nsmartphone/tablet, by the farmer or agronomist;\n•\nData obtained by\
    \ reliable weather stations;\n•\nPurchase orders, namely information able to inﬂuence\
    \ the growth or production of a speciﬁc crop\nif the market requires greater or\
    \ lower production levels.\nThe cloud database is managed by professional users\
    \ (as informatics or agronomists) in order to\nconstantly update the set of information\
    \ (temperatures, soil data, fertilizer types, fertigation periods,\nweather conditions,\
    \ crops growth status), taking into account any change in the state of the land\
    \ over\ntime, for optimizing the quality and yield of cultivated products and,\
    \ at the same time, preserving\nthe soil wellbeing with consequent advantages\
    \ for the ecosystems. Furthermore, the agronomist can\nupdate the data into the\
    \ on-cloud database on the basis of the on-ﬁeld observations related to the crop\n\
    phenological development. In addition, he can also check the fertigation system\
    \ correct operation\nby sending a “status query” through the smartphone app to\
    \ the remote management platform as\nwell as he can identify a land portion with\
    \ his smartphone by reading the QRcode, placed near each\nportion of the cultivated\
    \ land, in order to view or update the related information contained in the\n\
    “Campaign Register” application of the software platform and ﬁnally he can request\
    \ the execution of a\nspeciﬁc treatment of fertigation or against pests, on the\
    \ considered land portion bypassing the remote\nautomated management.\nThe developed\
    \ software platform automatically stores detailed information concerning the\n\
    treatments performed on followed cultivations during the whole growth period,\
    \ allowing the customers\nto verify, through a suitable user interface, the treatments\
    \ carried out on the considered agricultural\nproducts, and thus their quality,\
    \ but also to place a purchase order. Through the developed platform,\nthe consumers\
    \ can monitor the whole supply chain of the agri-food products, obtaining information\n\
    concerning the freshness and genuineness of the agricultural product, so enabling\
    \ additional revenues\nto the farmer.\nIn addition, the data and parameters of\
    \ the general agronomic database can be\nmonitored and updated by the farmer or\
    \ agronomist, as well as they can manage the execution of\nspeciﬁc treatments\
    \ through the developed platform. The customers can access only to the information\n\
    concerning performed treatments and to product traceability [69]. The data derived\
    \ from the agronomic\nmodels, crucial for the fertigation system operation, are\
    \ stored both in the on-cloud database and in\nthe local one, data concerning\
    \ the nutritional needs of each considered crop typology as function the\nseasonal\
    \ period, growth phase and speciﬁc environmental/geographical/meteorological conditions.\n\
    In fact, the possible system operation modes are two, namely:\n•\nBottom-Up modality:\
    \ the master is a stand-alone component (PC of the solar-powered fertigation\n\
    system) where the main operating activities are performed, stored and synchronized\
    \ with the\non-cloud platform (remote server). In this way, the service is guaranteed\
    \ even if the Internet\nconnection is absent or not always guaranteed.\n•\nTop-Down\
    \ modality: the master is the on-cloud architecture that manages and commands\
    \ the\nneeded operations to be performed by the solar fertigation system; moreover\
    \ the farmer can\nremotely set the fertigation cycles and land sections, where\
    \ to carry out the farming treatments.\nThe fertigation system has two user levels,\
    \ namely:\n•\nLevel 1—System Management: the authorized user can access to each\
    \ software section and\napplication as a master user, can create a lower-level\
    \ user (farmer/customer), visualize and\nremotely control each installed fertigation\
    \ system and manage all their operations. Further, he can\nupdate the general\
    \ agronomic database by adding further crops to be cultivated or modifying the\n\
    parameters and calculation algorithms;\n•\nLevel 2—Farmer or Customer: he is associated\
    \ with a single fertigation system, can set the crops\nin the diﬀerent areas of\
    \ the land (only the farmer), control automatically or manually the irrigation\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 3632\n31 of 43\nor fertigation cycles (only the farmer), view\
    \ the history of crops parameters and certiﬁcation\nreports of the carried out\
    \ treatments.\nThe developed application comprises a traceability system of cultivated\
    \ crops, named Customer\nFree Campaign Register, an open-source tool, connected\
    \ to the general agronomic database, by which the\ncustomer can verify the farming\
    \ processes and quality standards, even before arranging the purchase\norder,\
    \ so providing an added value for the farmer. The software platform allows enabled\
    \ users to\nremotely interact with the farm management system, for example, to\
    \ check the historical register of the\ndiﬀerent carried out agricultural processes\
    \ or to update the agronomic database based on observations\ndirectly on cultivated\
    \ land related to crop growth.\nIn order to highlight the functionalities and\
    \ utility of developed smartphone application for the\nfarmers or customers, following\
    \ some screenshots are shown and described. In Figure 19a, the “view\nsection”\
    \ is shown from which the farmer (user M1) can check the irrigated sectors (green\
    \ color); clicking\non “Status” button, the enabled user can control soil and\
    \ crops parameters detected by the WSN\nwhereas with the M-button he can manually\
    \ command a speciﬁc process for the considered land sector\nbypassing what established\
    \ by the DSS on the basis of the agronomic models. In Figure 19b, the “Data\n\
    history section” for sector 1 is shown with the chronology of the WSN data and\
    \ performed treatments;\nto such section, both the farmer and customer users can\
    \ access from their account.\nFigure 19. Screenshots of the realized application:\
    \ “view section” where the farmer (user M1) has a\ncomplete overview of the cultivated\
    \ crops (a) and “Data history section” through which the farmer or\ncustomer monitor\
    \ crops’ parameters and the performed treatments for growth optimization (b).\n\
    Finally, to verify the correct functioning of the developed IoT-oriented farm\
    \ management facility\nconstituted by the sensor nodes installed in the cultivated\
    \ ground and by the cloud software platform,\ndiﬀerent measurement campaigns were\
    \ carried out actually on cultivated lands and the obtained\nresults have certiﬁed\
    \ the correct functioning of the hardware and software sections.\n5.1. Proposed\
    \ Tracking and Tracing System for Monitoring the Storage Conditions of Agri-Food\
    \ Products and\nReal Tests of the Designed BLE Smart Tag\nAs previously described,\
    \ the proposed farm management and control system includes a traceability\nsystem\
    \ of the agri-food products along the whole SC able to monitor and share the main\
    \ indicators for\ndetermining the storing and transport conditions. This system\
    \ is based on the BLE smart tags, with\nthe structure described in the Section\
    \ 3.3, placed into the containers where the agri-food products are\nstored. Once\
    \ the products arrive at a storage warehouse, the UUID of newly arrived containers\
    \ are\ndetected by the Bluetooth gateway (called “Incoming Bluetooth Gateway”,\
    \ in Figure 20) located near\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n32 of 43\nthe warehouse\
    \ unloading area; when a new UUID is found, the incoming gateway updates, through\
    \ a\nWi-Fi gateway, the new container location in the relative record, associated\
    \ with the detected UUID, in\nthe cloud database (i.e., an Azure SQL database).\n\
    Figure 20. Schematic representation of the proposed tracking and tracing system\
    \ based on the BLE\nsmart tags.\nA commercial Bluetooth gateway (model BTP104-SS,\
    \ manufactured by Jinou, Chongqing, China)\nwas employed for carrying out detection\
    \ and communication tests of the BLE smart tags with the\non-cloud platform (as\
    \ represented in the scenario of Figure 20); by setting the transmitted power\
    \ level\nof each BLE tag to 0 dBm, a detection range of 12 m was obtained, particularly,\
    \ in the condition in\nwhich the tagged containers are stacked for their transportation,\
    \ reaching instead up to 21 m detection\ndistance in the open ﬁeld condition.\
    \ Therefore, a gateway can be located at the warehouse entrance for\ndetecting\
    \ the incoming containers, whereas inside the warehouse the gateways have to be\
    \ regularly\ndistributed (at a distance of 12 m from each other) for receiving\
    \ the data transmitted by the tags\n(Figure 20).\nAfter the detection of a new\
    \ container, the Bluetooth gateway sends to the remote database a\npacket containing\
    \ its identiﬁer (i.e., the UUID) along with a code related to the new storage\
    \ warehouse\n(Figure 20). The UUID is the key for all the operations carried out\
    \ in the database, namely to insert,\nselect, update, delete and call an item.\
    \ Afterward, the food products are stored in the warehouse and the\nBLE smart\
    \ tags, placed into the containers, periodically send the acquired parameters,\
    \ suitably arranged\nin data packets, to the Bluetooth gateways located inside\
    \ the warehouse. Speciﬁcally, a 27 bytes packet\nis transmitted by each BLE tag,\
    \ with the ﬁrst 16 bytes represent its UUID, 6 bytes are related to the\nTVOC,\
    \ CO2 and NH3 concentrations and 2 bytes each for the environmental temperature\
    \ and humidity\n(as depicted in Figure 20). Finally, the warning byte is added\
    \ to the packet to signal anomalies of the\nmonitored parameters, as described\
    \ in the Section 4.2. The data related to a given container, then,\nare stored\
    \ into a record of the on cloud database, related to the BLE tag UUID; when a\
    \ container\nleaves the warehouse towards another one, it passes nearby another\
    \ gateway, called “outcoming\nBluetooth gateway”, which updates the database reporting\
    \ its exit. The afore-described mechanism\ncontinues until the containers are\
    \ delivered to the food shop or wholesaler, where also the empty\nSensors 2020,\
    \ 20, 3632\n33 of 43\ntagged containers are picked up by the farmer to be following\
    \ reused; the data stored in the database\nrelated to a given UUID are removed\
    \ after the expiration date of the food product.\nThe user can assess the tracking\
    \ and storage information of the agri-food products employing a\nmobile application\
    \ designed by using the Android Studio 3.6.1 development environment.\nAfter the\
    \ login, the user (indicated with R, Figure 21a) is directed into the main page\
    \ of the\napplication, where the container UUID can be entered typing the alphanumeric\
    \ characters in the\nappropriate ﬁeld and by pushing the “Track” button, the user\
    \ is directed to the page related to the\ndesired container (Figure 21a). Afterward,\
    \ by pushing the “Par. History” button (Figure 21b), the\nuser can verify the\
    \ history of each monitored parameter pressing the button related to the desired\n\
    quantity (i.e., T, H for humidity, VOC, NH3 and CO2); a visual indicator is added\
    \ above each button to\nsignal abnormal values of the corresponding parameter.\
    \ In addition, the temporal trend of the selected\nparameter is shown (e.g., the\
    \ temperature in Figure 21b) along with its mean and peak values.\nFigure 21.\
    \ Application screenshots of the tracking and traceability system based on BLE\
    \ tags. (a) logged\nuser (R) inserts the container universally unique identiﬁer\
    \ (UUID); (b) “Par. History” section with\nshown the history of acquired parameters;\
    \ (c) “Tracking Info” section where the customer checks the\ntracking information\
    \ related to the entered UUID.\nBy pushing the “Tracking Info” button, the user\
    \ can monitor the tracking information of the\nconsidered container (Figure 21c);\
    \ in fact, this page contains a table where are detailed all the movements\nof\
    \ the container, updated over time by means of the tracking system above described.\n\
    Several tests were performed for validating the operation of the BLE tags and\
    \ related tracking\nsystem; the BLE smart tag was placed inside a plastic box\
    \ (with 50 cm × 40 cm × 40-cm dimension)\ncovered by a perforated lid (30 holes\
    \ with 0.6-cm diameter), containing 5 kg of oranges, leaving the box\ninto a refrigerator\
    \ set to a 5 ◦C target temperature for 20 days. On the 20th day, the plastic container\n\
    was taken out of the freezer and left at room temperature (about 20–25 ◦C) for\
    \ further 10 days. The tag\nwas ﬁxed by means of screws on the inner surface of\
    \ the plastic container, 10 cm above the product\nlevel since, from preliminary\
    \ tests, this position can ensure a good detection capability to the device,\n\
    and, at the same time, avoid some false alarms due to local gas accumulation.\
    \ However, the container\ndimension, shape and ventilation aﬀect the response\
    \ of the BLE smart tag, since these factors determine\nthe gas concentration and\
    \ distribution inside the container; therefore, a preliminary characterization\
    \ of\nthe BLE tag, before to be used for the speciﬁc container, is required to\
    \ determine the threshold values\nfor each gas species. For the case under consideration,\
    \ the threshold values were determined based on\nvisual and olfactory observations\
    \ and set to 581 ppb for TVOC, 176 ppm for NH3 and 1647 for CO2.\nIf the concentration\
    \ of a gas species exceeds the aforementioned threshold or the temperature and\n\
    humidity values are outside the set intervals (0–10 ◦C and 30–70% for oranges,\
    \ respectively), an alarm bit\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n34 of 43\nis set in the\
    \ warning byte and sent to the software platform along with the acquired information.\
    \ Besides\nthe temporal trends, the mobile application shows the user the warning\
    \ on the monitored quantities, as\na visual indicator which turns red (from green)\
    \ in case of alarms. For instance, in Figure 21b, the data\nrelated to the container\
    \ with oranges are reported; once the container is removed from the refrigerator,\n\
    the indicator related to the temperature (marked with T) changes from green to\
    \ red.\nThe temporal trends of the monitored parameters are shown in Figure 22;\
    \ as it can be noted, the\nmeasurements are temporally closer from the 20th day,\
    \ since the detected temperature is higher than\nthe upper threshold (set to 10\
    \ ◦C) and thus the wake_up period is progressively reduced up to 6 h, as\ndetailed\
    \ in the Section 4.2 (Figure 22a). After removing the box from the refrigerator,\
    \ TVOC values\nincreased signiﬁcantly due to the fastening spoiling process into\
    \ the stored oranges [70,71]. In addition,\nthe measurements showed an increase\
    \ of CO2 and NH3 values throughout the measuring range, slow\nin the refrigerator\
    \ and faster outside, reaching peak values of 3022 ppm and 287 ppm, respectively\n\
    (corresponding to 5439.6 mg/m3 and 199.6 mg/m3). Following, a reduction of CO2\
    \ and NH3 values\nin the last days of the observation interval was observed, as\
    \ already reported in the literature [70]\n(Figure 22b).\nFigure 22. Temporal\

    \ frozen codﬁsh ﬁllet placed inside a polystyrene box\nwith 40 cm × 40 cm × 20\
    \ cm dimension, covered by a plastic wrap and leaving the container to 0 ◦C\n\
    for 20 days; then the box is removed from the freezer and left uncovered to room\
    \ temperature for\nother 10 days. The BLE tag was attached to the internal surface\
    \ of the polystyrene box, 10 cm above\nthe ﬁsh level, in order to monitor the\
    \ storing conditions and the gas levels emitted by the codﬁsh\nﬁllets; the related\
    \ temporal trends, over the whole observation interval, are reported in Figure\
    \ 23.\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n35 of 43\nSimilarly, the BLE tag characterization\
    \ for the container with ﬁsh inside was performed, to determine\nthe threshold\
    \ values, so obtaining 389 ppb and 256 ppm values for TVOC and NH3, respectively;\n\
    besides, the temperature and humidity ranges were set to 0–10 ◦C and 20–70%. Thus,\
    \ if a detected\nvalue isn’t included in the corresponding set range, an alarm\
    \ message is sent to the software platform\nand reported on the mobile application\
    \ by means of the visual indicator (turned red) related to the\nabnormal parameter\
    \ (Figure 21b). In the ﬁrst phase, the NH3 concentration increases slowly although\n\
    in the refrigerator, since the enzymatic and bacteria growth decomposes the ﬁsh\
    \ proteins even at a\ntemperature of a few degrees [72], so producing nitrogen\
    \ volatile compounds that indicate the spoiling\nof the ﬁsh. This trend has accelerated\
    \ after the defrosting (from the 20th day) reaching a peak value\nof 274 ppm (i.e.,\
    \ 190.5 mg/m3) after about 4 days, then the NH3 concentration reduced indicating\
    \ an\nadvanced decomposition of ﬁsh proteins, as already reported in [73] (Figure\
    \ 23b). A CO2 concentration\nnear to the lower limit of the MiCS-5914 sensor (i.e.,\
    \ 400 ppm) was detected before the box left the\nfreezer, values ascribable to\
    \ the environmental concentration inside the box; in fact, once the box was\n\
    extracted from the freezer and removed the plastic wrap, the CO2 concentration\
    \ is increased slightly\naround the value of 500 ppm, due to the indoor environment.\
    \ TVOC concentration, initially, grew\nslowly (up to 170 ppb) until the box was\
    \ in the freezer, increasing then quickly when the box was\nextracted, reaching\
    \ a maximum value of 626 ppb at the end of the observation interval (10 days after\n\
    the defrosting).\nFigure 23. Temporal trends of the parameters detected by the\

    \ Facility in Real Scenarios\nAfterward, diﬀerent measurement campaigns were carried\
    \ out on-ﬁeld for testing the operation\nof all the fertigator sections, but also\
    \ the proper integration of the software platform, implementing the\nagronomic\
    \ database, with the developed WSN and the weather forecast; in this way, the\
    \ beneﬁts in\nterms of water savings and proper fertilizer usage were evaluated.\n\
    At ﬁrst, the system was tested on a land of 1200 m2 cultivated with tomatoes,\
    \ arranged in rows\nequipped with a drip irrigation system and divided into three\
    \ sectors. In this case, a fertigation unit\nequipped with a 5000 L mixing tank\
    \ and 3 hp pump (model HF-8B, manufactured by Pedrollo Spa, San\nBonifacio, Italy)\
    \ was employed. A WSN constituted by 6 sensor nodes, two for each sector, was\
    \ installed\nwith one of them acting as coordinator node. The considered land\
    \ is featured by slightly clay soil (i.e.,\na high TAW—total available water value),\
    \ whereas the tomato plants are in the development phase\n(20 days from the planting);\
    \ speciﬁcally, the reported tests were carried out on 22 July 2019, during\na\
    \ week characterized by high environmental temperatures and humidity. In these\
    \ conditions, the\nagronomic database scheduled a unique irrigation per day, lasting\
    \ an hour and a half, corresponding\nto 1800 L water amount for each sector; in\
    \ addition, the agronomic database established a fertigation\nprocess with 7.5\
    \ kg of N–P–K soluble fertilizer (with 9–30–22 ratios) dissolved into the water\
    \ amount\nof a normal irrigation.\nAs previously cited, the developed system schedules\
    \ irrigation and fertigation processes according\nto the crops need and WSN data,\
    \ reducing the occurrence of under- or over-watering conditions, thus\nminimizing\
    \ any plants stress. In Figure 24a, the temporal trend of soil humidity in the\
    \ sector 2 is shown;\nthe irrigation was scheduled for 6:00 P.M. (post meridiem),\
    \ if the soil water content (average value of\nthe data provided by the two sensors)\
    \ was lower than the set threshold (40%, Figure 24a). However,\nfrom 2:00 P.M.\
    \ to 5:00 P.M. a heavy rainfall occurred, thus the soil humidity exceeded the\
    \ 40% value,\nand the scheduled irrigation was canceled, so obtaining water-saving\
    \ and avoiding tomatoes-plants\nstress due to overwatering. In fact, in Figure\
    \ 24a the simulated humidity values, if the irrigation had\nnot been canceled,\
    \ are reported, calculated taking into account the soil composition (i.e., soil\
    \ hydraulic\nconductivity K equals to 7.0 × 10−9 ms−1), and the amount of precipitated\
    \ water using the Darcy’s\nlaw [74]. For the same day, in Figure 24b, the temporal\
    \ trends of soil and environmental temperature\nare shown; such parameters along\
    \ with the status of the fertigation system are shown to the farmer\nthrough the\
    \ mobile application, as above described (Figure 19a).\nIn addition, the developed\
    \ farm management facility was tested inside a 1700-m2 greenhouse\nwhere lettuce\
    \ plants were cultivated; the greenhouse was equipped with suspended sprinkler\
    \ irrigation\nimplant and a centralized dehumidiﬁer to control the environmental\
    \ temperature and humidity for\noptimizing the growth conditions as well as reducing\
    \ rotting and the spread of diseases and pests.\nSpeciﬁcally, the greenhouse was\
    \ divided into three sectors each equipped with three sensor nodes, one\nof which\
    \ conﬁgured also as coordinator node; a fertigation unit with a 500-L mixing chamber\
    \ and a\n3-hp pump (model HF-8B) was installed to irrigate three sectors consecutively.\n\

    \ water value) and the lettuce plants are next to harvesting phase;\ntherefore,\
    \ the agronomic database scheduled, for each day, an irrigation in the morning\
    \ (at 7:00 A.M.,\nAnte Meridiem) and a fertigation process in the evening (at\
    \ 7:00 P.M.) for a time duration of 30 min\n(corresponding to 1600 L), if the\
    \ average soil humidity was lower than 40%. The fertigation consisted\nof dissolving\
    \ 1.7 kg soluble N–P–K fertilizer, with 15–5–20 ratios, into the water amount\
    \ of a normal\nirrigation. In Figure 25, the temporal trend of soil humidity (blue\

    \ In addition, the detected air temperature and humidity values\n(red and green\

    Thanks to the recent availability of advanced hardware and software solutions\
    \ that allow farmers\nto control in real time the growth, the harvest and subsequent\
    \ transformation of cultivated crops,\nthe agricultural companies can increase\
    \ yields, nutritional quality and safety, from the health point\nof view, of the\
    \ cultivated products, reduce production costs and negative impacts on the health\
    \ and\nenvironment, in line with the modern principles of economic, environmental\
    \ and social sustainability.\nA management and traceability system, that employs\
    \ modern technologies, was developed able to\nsupport the activities of farms\
    \ in their productions as well as users of the cloud platform in controlling\n\
    the cultivation processes directly on-ﬁeld and to trace the products harvested\
    \ from the land along the\nentire production chain. A fertigation system was developed,\
    \ to manage the frequency and typology of\nthe irrigation processes, controlled\
    \ by an on-cloud software platform implementing a decision-making\nalgorithm based\
    \ on the information provided by the weather service and a WSN installed on the\
    \ ﬁeld.\nSpeciﬁcally, the decisions on timing and fertilizer amount are based\
    \ on a complete state-of-the-art\nagronomic database, which represents the smart\
    \ section of the fertigation system, reproducing, for a\ngiven crop typology,\
    \ the needs in terms of water and fertilizers as a function of the season, growth\
    \ phase,\nsoil typology, along with the soil and environmental parameters. The\
    \ information in the agronomic\ndatabase was determined by collecting and synthesizing\
    \ the results of previous scientiﬁc works and\nwell-known agronomic models (such\
    \ as the nutrient balance-NB one) and made available to the\nsoftware platform\
    \ by means of an on-cloud MySQL database. The integration of the fertigation system\n\
    with a custom agronomic database represents the main innovation of proposed work.\
    \ The designed\nWSN node is energetically autonomous thanks to a solar harvesting\
    \ system properly sized; also, the\nsensor node ﬁrmware architecture was discussed,\
    \ as well as the operating modalities for managing data\nacquisition from sensors\
    \ and the communication towards the WSN coordinator node. In particular, the\n\
    power consumption of the WSN nodes was minimized exploiting the built-in low-power\
    \ modalities of\nthe NodeMCU board and properly conﬁguring the timing of the acquisition\
    \ and communication phases,\nalong with the status of the connected sensors. Experimental\
    \ tests were performed for estimating the\nnode power consumption in the diﬀerent\
    \ operative phases, obtaining a long lifetime of the used LiPo\nbattery (more\
    \ than 13 days without any availability of solar energy, an unrealistic extreme\
    \ case).\nIn this way, an automated and traced management of the treatments performed\
    \ on a particular\nland section is obtained, reducing water and fertilizer waste,\
    \ as well as minimizing the stress-induced\non the plants, thus enhancing the\
    \ crop yield. A suitable mobile app allows users to fully control\nall the functionalities\
    \ of the fertigation system, but also to verify all the treatments performed on\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 3632\n39 of 43\na given land section. In addition, the developed\
    \ fertigation system enables the implementation of\nspeciﬁc management strategies,\
    \ aimed at anticipating or delaying the product collection, actuated\nby properly\
    \ tuning the irrigation/fertigation timing, on the basis of the customers’ requests;\
    \ this\nscientiﬁc innovativeness allows the farmer to achieve economic beneﬁts\
    \ as well as a reduction of the\nagri-food waste.\nA tracking and tracing system,\
    \ based on BLE smart tags, was designed capable to monitor the\nmovements of the\
    \ agri-food products from the cultivation ﬁeld to the consumers and their storage\n\
    conditions. To reduce the power consumption of developed BLE tag, commercial microcontroller\
    \ and\nsensor breakout boards were modiﬁed, resulting in a long-time reusable\
    \ device, a novelty compared to\ncompetitor systems reported in the scientiﬁc\
    \ literature as well as on the market. The chemical/physical\nquantities detected\
    \ by the BLE smart tag were chosen in order to provide reliable markers of the\n\
    freshness status of diﬀerent product typologies (vegetables, meat, ﬁsh, etc.),\
    \ making it a versatile\ninstrument adaptable to diﬀerent scenarios. Respect to\
    \ existing scientiﬁc works where only one\nphysical or chemical quantity is monitored\
    \ to detect the spoiling of the speciﬁc stored product, instead,\nthe designed\
    \ BLE tag is able to simultaneously detect several quantities, so covering a wide\
    \ range of\napplications. In addition, the threshold values involved in the HM-10\
    \ ﬁrmware have to be set as a\nfunction of the food typology, amount of the stored\
    \ product, as well as the typology and size of the\nused container; in this way,\
    \ the designed BLE tag can be easily adapted, after a prior characterization,\n\
    to every container typology. Furthermore, by optimizing the HM-10 ﬁrmware, both\
    \ in iBeacon and\nacquisition modalities and implementing proper operating strategies,\
    \ a reduced power consumption\nof the BLE tag was ensured.\nThe prototype of the\
    \ BLE smart tag, based on the CC2541 IC and low-cost sensors, was tested to\n\
    validate its operation and determine the energy autonomy (up to 5.6 months), value\
    \ to our knowledge\nnot achieved by other devices present in literature, considering\
    \ also that our BLE tag allows detecting\ndiﬀerent chemical/physical quantities,\
    \ as already highlighted before. The user can remotely access the\ntracking and\
    \ storing information by means of a properly developed mobile application synchronized\n\
    with the on-cloud traceability database. Several tests were carried out to verify\
    \ the tag functionalities;\nspeciﬁcally, we have reported the results related\
    \ to the BLE tag applied to a closed plastic or polystyrene\nbox with inside oranges\
    \ or codﬁsh ﬁllets, respectively and monitoring the interest parameters for\n\
    30 days (20 days in the refrigerator and 10 days outside) by employing the developed\
    \ mobile application.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, P.V. and N.I.G.;\

    \ \n1.1. A worldwide dilemma of food security\nFood security is a multifaceted\
    \ notion that aims to eliminate hunger by \nassuring a steady supply of nutritious\
    \ food. It is defined by a four-pillar para-\ndigm, each of which is necessary\
    \ to provide food security [1]. Food security \nis becoming a severe global concern\
    \ as a result of anthropogenic factors such \nas rapid population expansion, urbanization,\
    \ industrialization, farmland loss, \nfreshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation.\
    \ This is due to the fact that \n424\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nthese factors have a direct impact on the agricultural industry,\
    \ which is the \nworld’s principal source of agri-food production. By 2050, it\
    \ is expected that \nthe global population will rise from 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion,\
    \ urban population \nwill rise by 66 percent, arable land will decline by approximately\
    \ 50 million \nhectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO 2 – promote crop disease\
    \ and \npest growth) will rise by 50 percent, agri-food production will decline\
    \ by 20%, \nand food demand will rise by 59 to 98 percent, posing an imminent\
    \ threat. To \nmeet rising food demands, agricultural practitioners around the\
    \ world will need \nto increase crop and livestock production to maximize agricultural\
    \ output. The \nemphasis of this review paper is crop farming, which includes\
    \ the production \nof both food and cash crops. \nA typical agri-food value chain\
    \ displaying three key stages in the production \nof agricultural products: pre-field\
    \ (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and \nharvesting stage), and post-field\
    \ (post-harvesting stage). All of the stages are \nimportant in the value chain,\
    \ but in this examination, we will focus on the sec-\nond stage, in-field, which\
    \ includes numerous crop-growing operations such as \nploughing, sowing, spraying,\
    \ and harvesting, among others. Traditional agricul-\ntural approaches are now\
    \ used in these procedures, which are labor-intensive, \nrequire arable land,\
    \ time, and a significant quantity of water (for irrigation), and \nmake it difficult\
    \ to produce enough food [5]. A part of the problem is also due \nto the improper\
    \ application of pesticides and herbicides, as well as the misuse \nof available\
    \ technologies, both of which hurt crops and ultimately result in \nagricultural\
    \ waste [6]. These problems can be solved by combining advanced \ntechnologies\
    \ and computer-based applications that ensure higher crop yields, \nless water\
    \ use, better pesticide/herbicide use, and improved crop quality. This \nis where\
    \ the concept of smart agriculture comes into play.\n1.2. Smart Agriculture\n\
    Every industry is being revolutionized and reshaped by Industry 4.0. It’s a \n\
    strategic initiative that combines emerging disruptive digital technologies like\
    \ \nthe Internet of Things (IoT), big data and analytics (BDA), system integration\
    \ \n(SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous robotic systems (ARS),\
    \ \naugmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless sensor networks\
    \ \n(WSN), cyber-physical systems (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive manu-\n\
    facturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. \nAgriculture 4.0,\
    \ also known as smart agriculture, smart farming or digital \nfarming [7], is\
    \ the next phase of industrial agriculture, fueled by the integra-\ntion of these\
    \ technologies in agriculture. Farmers can use smart agriculture to \naddress\
    \ a variety of agricultural food production concerns such as farm pro-\n425\n\
    Siberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nductivity,\
    \ environmental impact, food security, crop losses, and sustainability. \nFarmers,\
    \ for example, can connect to farms remotely, regardless of location \nor time,\
    \ using IoT-enabled equipment based on WSNs to monitor and control \nfarm operations.\
    \ Drones outfitted with hyper spectral cameras can collect data \nfrom a variety\
    \ of sources on farmlands, while autonomous robots can assist \nor complete repetitive\
    \ chores on farms. Data analytics techniques can be used \nto examine the obtained\
    \ data, and computer programs can be utilized to help \nfarmers make decisions.\n\
    Similarly, smart agriculture can monitor and analyze a wide range of pa-\nrameters\
    \ related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production status, \nwater\
    \ management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides and pes-\nticides,\
    \ and controlled environment agriculture to increase crop yields, reduce \ncosts,\
    \ improve product quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of \nmodern\
    \ systems [8].\n1.3. Research Motivation and Contribution \nThe reason for writing\
    \ this assessment is that digital technologies in agri-\ncultural systems provide\
    \ new strategic solutions for increasing farm output ef-\nficiency and effectiveness.\
    \ Furthermore, digital transformation paves the door \nfor modern farming technologies\
    \ like vertical farming (hydroponics, aquapon-\nics, and aeroponics) to be used,\
    \ which has the potential to solve food security \nissues. However, there are\
    \ a number of issues and restrictions connected with \nthis change from a technological,\
    \ socioeconomic, and management perspective \nthat must be overcome in order to\
    \ fully realise the potential of agricultural 4.0 \n[9].A number of publications\
    \ [9–18] have examined developing trends in the \ndevelopment of agriculture 4.0\
    \ by offering concise information on essential \nuses, benefits, and research\
    \ problems of smart farming. These studies’ research \nfocuses on either explaining\
    \ more general technical aspects while focusing on \nonly one or a few digital\
    \ technologies, or improving agricultural supply chain \nperformance, or developing\
    \ an agriculture 4.0 definition, or achieving sustain-\nable agronomy through\
    \ precision agriculture, or proposing a smart farming \nframework. Nonetheless,\
    \ these studies do not include an explicit discussion of \nthe tools and techniques\
    \ utilized to construct various systems, as well as their \nmaturity level. There\
    \ are also few studies that look at the consequences of dig-\nital technology\
    \ in modern soilless farms including hydroponics, aquaponics, \nand aeroponics\
    \ (indoor/outdoor). As a result, in order to promote conversation \nin this field,\
    \ it is necessary to examine the emergence of agriculture 4.0 from \nmany angles.\
    \ This research seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of dig-\nital technologies\

    \ and agricultural practitioners will benefit from the review’s insights \nin\
    \ future study on agriculture 4.0. \n1.4. Paper organization \nThe following is\
    \ the structure of the paper after the introduction: \nSection 2 discusses the\
    \ methodology used to collect relevant literature; Sec-\ntion 3 then presents\
    \ the statistical results obtained after a general analysis of the \nselected\
    \ research studies; Section 4 then provides a detailed overview of the \ncore\
    \ technologies used in agricultural digitization; Section 5 then highlights the\
    \ \ntechnical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital integration in agriculture;\
    \ \nand finally, Section 6 outlines a discussion of the research questions.\n\
    2. Research Methodology \nA systematic literature review (SLR) is a technique\
    \ for organizing and iden-\ntifying research related to a specific topic [19].\
    \ SLR is used in this study to look \ninto the state of Industry 4.0 technologies\
    \ in the agricultural industry. Cases \nwhere the phrase ‘agricultural’ occurred\
    \ in the title, abstract, or keywords of \nan article with any of the ‘Industry\
    \ 4.0 technologies’ described in section 1.2 \nare specifically sought. A review\
    \ procedure is established prior to conducting \nthe SLR to ensure a transparent\
    \ and high-quality research process, which are \nthe features that distinguish\
    \ a systematic literature review [20]. By conducting \nthorough literature searches,\
    \ the review methodology also helps to reduce bias. \nThe creation of the research\
    \ questions, the defining of the search method, and \nthe specification of inclusion\
    \ and exclusion criteria are all part of this process. \nTo conduct SLR, this\
    \ paper uses a recommended reporting item for system-\natic reviews and meta-analysis\
    \ (PRISMA) approach. PRISMA is a minimum \ncollection of items based on evidence\
    \ that is used to guide the construction of \nsystematic literature reviews and\
    \ other meta-analyses [19].\n2.1. Review Protocol \nBefore doing the bibliographic\
    \ analysis, a review methodology is estab-\nlished to identify, analyze, and interpret\
    \ data that are relevant to the research \nfocus. To begin, research questions\
    \ are developed in order to provide insight \ninto the study of published studies\
    \ in the research area of interest from many \nperspectives. These are the questions\
    \ that must be addressed in the research. The \nsearch strategy is then created,\
    \ which aids in the identification of appropriate \n427\nSiberian Journal of Life\
    \ Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nkeywords later in the search equation,\
    \ as well as the identification of relevant \ninformation sources, such as academic\
    \ databases and search engines that allow \naccess to vast amounts of digital\
    \ documentation. Science Direct, Scopus, and \nIEEE Xplore are three online research\
    \ archives that are utilized to find relevant \nstudies. Finally, boundaries are\
    \ created by predefining inclusion and exclusion \ncriteria for further inquiry\
    \ and content assessments of selected articles in order \nto narrow the search\
    \ results of each database.\n2.2. Evaluation Process \nIdentification, screening,\
    \ eligibility, and inclusion are the four stages of the \nliterature search process\
    \ that are evaluated. Consolidation is done for the re-\nmoval of duplicate items\
    \ in the identification step after initial metadata filtering \nby the use of\
    \ search expressions. After this phase, the number of publications is \nreduced.\
    \ The titles and abstracts of the papers are reviewed during the screening \n\
    stage, and the most relevant publications are chosen for integral reading. In\
    \ the \nthird stage, full-text screening of these papers is done to ensure that\
    \ they are \neligible for this paper’s goal.\n2.3. Threats to Validity \n(i) SLR\
    \ replication: Because the current search is confined to only three on-\nline\
    \ repositories, the provided SLR is vulnerable to risks to validity. \nAdditional\
    \ sources could potentially lead to the discovery of more pub-\nlications. Validity\
    \ can be regarded satisfactorily addressed because the SLR \nprocess is clearly\
    \ defined in sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2. However, it is possible \nthat slightly\
    \ different publications will be found if this SLR is replicated. This \nvariation\
    \ could be due to various personal choices made throughout the PRIS-\nMA screening\
    \ and eligibility phases, but it’s highly improbable that the overall \nresults\
    \ would alter.\n(ii)The search string used to discover the relevant papers covers\
    \ the entire \nspectrum of SLR; however it’s possible that some important studies\
    \ were over-\nlooked. More research may be found if more keywords and synonyms\
    \ in the \nsearch are included.\n3. Digitization Trends in Agriculture \nAlthough\
    \ the agriculture business is making significant progress in terms \nof digital\
    \ technology adoption, it is still lagging behind other industries such \nas healthcare,\
    \ manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, and others [15]. The \ncrop farming\
    \ method considered while designing an application or framework \nis referred\
    \ to as the farm type. The farming method, for example, can be soil-\nbased or\
    \ soilless. Open-air fields (conventional outdoor agricultural farms) and \n428\n\
    Siberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ngreenhouse\
    \ farms are included in the soil-based farming category (indoor). The \nsoilless\
    \ farming category, on the other hand, includes modern farming tech-\nniques such\
    \ as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor). In \nthe recent\
    \ decade, autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned guided \nvehicles and\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), the internet of things, and \nmachine learning\
    \ appear to be the most commonly used technology in agricul-\nture. Agriculture’s\
    \ growing sectors include big data, wireless sensor networks, \ncyber-physical\
    \ systems, and digital twins. Furthermore, in contrast to indoor \nfarms, open\
    \ air farms are the most usually examined in research investigations. \nFew publications\
    \ exist for soilless farming systems (aquaponics, aeroponics, \nand hydroponics),\
    \ implying that these modern farming practices are still in \ntheir infancy. Similarly,\
    \ each use case’s services are identified and classified \ninto nine service categories:\
    \ I crop management, CM (estimation/harvesting \nperiod and seed plantation/prediction\
    \ of crop yield/ growth rate/harvesting/ \npollination/ spraying (fertilizer/\
    \ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM \n(fresh weight, green biomass,\
    \ height, length, width, leaf density, piment content \n(chlorophyll), and phytochemical\
    \ composition); iii) water and environmental \nmanagement, WEM (monitoring and\
    \ control of flow rate, water level, water \nquality (nutrients), temperature,\
    \ humidity, CO2, and weather forecasts, among \nother things); iv) irrigation\
    \ management, IM (water stress detection and sched-\nuling); v) farm management,\
    \ FM (monitoring of farm operations, tracking and \ncounting products, determining\
    \ production efficiency, financial analysis, energy \nconsumption analysis, technology\
    \ integration, and decision-making);\nPDM (pest and disease management) is a term\
    \ used to describe the man-\nagement of pests and diseases (pest identification\
    \ and disease detection) SM \n(Soil Management) vii) (moisture content, soil nutrients,\
    \ fertilizer needs and \napplication) WUVM (weed/unknown vegetation mapping, classification,\
    \ and \npesticide application) viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management FDC\
    \ \n(fruit detection and counting), and ix) \nThe role of various digital technologies\
    \ in smart farming is depicted in \nthese categories. Crop management characteristics\
    \ such as crop yield prediction, \ngrowth rate estimation, and harvesting period\
    \ evaluation are the most 4.0 in the \nprevious decade, whereas soil management,\
    \ fruit identification and counting, \nand crop quality management receive very\
    \ less attention. The European Union’s \nTRL scale, which divides system maturity\
    \ into three generic categories [21], is \nused to assess the technology readiness\
    \ level (TRL) of all use cases. The first \nlevel is conceptual, which corresponds\
    \ to European TRL 1–2 (use case is in \nconcept phase), the second level is prototype,\
    \ which corresponds to Europe-\n429\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\nan TRL 3–6 (use case is functional even without all planned\
    \ features), and the \nthird level is deployed, which corresponds to European\
    \ TRL 7–9. (Use case \nis mature with all the possible functions). Each use case’s\
    \ TRL was produced \nin a few experiments. It has been noticed that smart agricultural\
    \ systems have \nmade little progress from the concept and prototype stages to\
    \ the commercial \nstage. The majority of use cases, for example, are still in\
    \ the prototype stage.\n4. Agriculture 4.0 enabling technologies \n4.1. Internet\
    \ of Things driven agricultural systems \nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a network\
    \ of interconnected computing de-\nvices, sensors, appliances, and machines that\
    \ are all connected to the internet \nand have their own unique identities and\
    \ capacities for remote sensing and \nmonitoring [21]. Network layer (communication),\
    \ perception layer (hardware \ndevices), , middleware layer (device management\
    \ and interoperability), service \nlayer (cloud computing), application layer\
    \ (data integration and analytics), and \nend-user layer are the six layers of\
    \ the IoT reference architecture (user-inter-\nface). IoT devices on the physical\
    \ layer in the agricultural domain collect data \non environmental and crop characteristics\
    \ such as temperature, humidity, pH \nvalue, water level, leaf colour, fresh leaf\
    \ weight, and so on. The network layer is \nresponsible for transmitting this\
    \ information, and its architecture is determined \nby the field size, farm location,\
    \ and type of farming method. ZigBee, LoRa, and \nSigfox, for example, are widely\
    \ utilized and employed in outdoor fields because \nthey are less expensive, have\
    \ low energy consumption, and have a long trans-\nmission range [22, 23]. Bluetooth,\
    \ despite being a secure technology, is only \nemployed in indoor farms due to\
    \ its limited transmission range [22]. Due to its \nhigh costs and high energy\
    \ consumption, Wi-Fi is not a promising technology \nfor agricultural applications\
    \ [22]. On the other hand, RFID (radio frequency \nidentification) and NFC (near\
    \ field communication) technologies are increas-\ningly being used in agricultural\
    \ systems for product tracking [24]. For periodic \nmonitoring of environmental\
    \ and soil characteristics, GPRS or mobile commu-\nnication technology (2G, 3G,\
    \ and 4G) is utilized. Furthermore, HTTP, WWW, \nand SMTP are the most commonly\
    \ utilized communication protocols in agri-\ncultural contexts. Similarly, middleware\
    \ HYDRA and SMEPP are commonly \nused in agricultural systems to enable interoperability\
    \ and system security for \ntheir context-aware functionalities [25]. \nCloud\
    \ computing approaches are used in the service layer to store data. \nThis information\
    \ is then used on the application layer to create smart apps that \nfarmers, agriculture\
    \ experts, and supply chain professionals can use to improve \n430\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nfarm monitoring and productivity.\
    \ The use of IoT in agriculture is intended to \nprovide farmers with decision-making\
    \ tools and automation technologies that \nallow them to seamlessly integrate\
    \ knowledge, products, and services in order to \nincrease production, quality,\
    \ and profit. A slew of research have been conduct-\ned and presented on the incubation\
    \ of IoT concepts in the agricultural industry. \nThe development of IoT-based\
    \ agricultural systems has addressed a variety of \ntechnological and architectural\
    \ concerns. However, most of these technologies \nare now in the conceptual stage\
    \ or in prototype form (not commercial). Farm \nmanagement, irrigation control,\
    \ crop development, health monitoring, and dis-\nease detection are all priorities.\
    \ \nSome of these studies also explained how IoT is being used in current ag-\n\
    ricultural systems like vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics, hydro-\n\
    ponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Furthermore, the\
    \ \nmajority of studies have been focused on a single issue.\n4.2. Wireless sensor\
    \ networks in agriculture \nA wireless sensor network (WSN) is a technology that\
    \ is utilized in an Inter-\nnet of Things (IoT) system. It is defined as a collection\
    \ of spatially distributed \nsensors for monitoring environmental physical conditions,\
    \ temporarily storing \nobtained data, and transferring the information to a central\
    \ point [22]. A wire-\nless sensor network (WSN) for smart farming is made up\
    \ of multiple sensor \nnodes connected by a wireless connection module. These\
    \ nodes have a variety \nof skills that allow them to self-organize, self-configure,\
    \ and self-diagnose (for \nexample, processing, trans- mission, and feeling).\
    \ There are various varieties of \nWSNs, which are classified based on the environment\
    \ in which they are used. \nTWSNs (terrestrial wireless sensor networks), WUSNs\
    \ (wireless underground \nsensor networks), UWSNs (underwater wireless sensor\
    \ networks), WMSNs \n(wireless multimedia sensor networks), and MWSNs (mobile\
    \ wireless sensor \nnetworks) are a few examples [26]. TWSN and UWSN are commonly\
    \ utilized \nin agricultural applications. TWSN nodes are sensors that collect\
    \ data from \nthe environment and are located above ground. The second type of\
    \ WSN is \nWUSNs, which are WSNs with sensor nodes embedded in the soil. Lower\
    \ fre-\nquencies easily enter the soil in this environment, whereas higher frequencies\
    \ \nare severely attenuated [27]. Because of the limited communication radius,\
    \ the \nnetwork requires a larger number of nodes to cover a big area. Many research\
    \ \npublications on the use of WSN for various outdoor and indoor farm applica-\n\
    tions, such as irrigation management, water quality testing, and environmental\
    \ \nmonitoring, are accessible in the literature. The goal of these experiments\
    \ was \nto create WSN architectures that were simple, low-cost, energy-efficient,\
    \ and \n431\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n\
    scalable. However, several aspects of WSNs, such as minimum maintenance, \nrobust\
    \ and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability, require more study. \n\
    4.3. Cloud computing in agriculture \nCloud computing (CC) is defined as a model\
    \ for enabling convenient, ubiq-\nuitous, on-demand network access to a shared\
    \ pool of configurable computing \nresources (e.g., networks, servers, storage,\
    \ applications, and services) that can \nbe rapidly provisioned and released with\
    \ minimal management effort or ser-\nvice provider interaction, according to the\
    \ National Institute of Standards and \nTechnologies (NIST) [28]. The datacenter\
    \ (hardware), infrastructure, platform, \nand application layers make up the primary\
    \ architecture of CC [29]. Each of \nthese layers corresponds to one of three\
    \ cloud service models: SaaS (software \nas a service), PaaS (platform as a service),\
    \ and IaaS (infrastructure as a service) \n(IaaS). In the agriculture sector,\
    \ cloud computing has gotten a lot of attention in \nthe last decade because it\
    \ provides: 1) low-cost storage for data collected from \nvarious domains via\
    \ WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale \ncomputer systems\
    \ to make intelligent decisions by converting raw data into \nusable knowledge,\
    \ and 3) a secure platform for developing agricultural based \nIoT applications\
    \ [30]. \nCC is used to develop various agricultural applications in conjunction\
    \ with \nIoT and WSN. CC technology is also utilized to develop operational farm\
    \ man-\nagement systems (FMSs) that help farmers and farm managers monitor farm\
    \ \nactivities more efficiently. The traceability of agri-product quality is another\
    \ \narea of interest that is being investigated in global research [31]. However,\
    \ only \npreliminary research has been done to see if traceability complies with\
    \ food \nsafety and quality criteria. The usage of cloud-based agricultural systems\
    \ has \nthe potential to address issues such as rising food demand, pollution\
    \ from pes-\nticides and fertilizers, and the safety of agricultural products.\
    \ These FMSs, on \nthe other hand, lack the flexibility to offer run-time customization\
    \ in response \nto specific farmer needs. Furthermore, because most farm data\
    \ is fragmented \nand distributed, recording farm operations accurately in existing\
    \ FMSs systems \nis problematic [32].\n4.4. Edge/fog computing in agriculture\
    \ \nThe rapid expansion of IoT has resulted in an explosion of sensors and smart\
    \ \ndevices, creating massive amounts of data. The processing and analysis of\
    \ such a \nlarge volume of data in real time is difficult since it puts a strain\
    \ on the cloud serv-\ner and slows response times. When dealing with such a massive\
    \ data set, a cloud \nserver alone will not be able to offer real-time responses.\
    \ Furthermore, because \nIoT applications require a constant exchange of information\
    \ between devices and \n432\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nthe cloud, they are susceptible to network latency, making\
    \ CC unsuitable for these \napplications [23]. The introduction of the edge computing\
    \ idea has the potential \nto overcome the CC issues. This novel computing architecture\
    \ places computa-\ntional and storage resources (such as cloudlets or fog nodes)\
    \ closer to data sources \nlike mobile devices and sensors at the network’s edge.\
    \ This allows for real-time \nanalytics while maintaining data security on the\
    \ device [23]. Although edge com-\nputing has exciting potential for smart agriculture,\
    \ its applications in agricultural \nsystems are still in their infancy. As a\
    \ result, there are limited research studies in \nthis field. The majority of\
    \ the edge computing-based agricultural systems covered \nin these papers are\
    \ prototypes that solve a small number of challenges across a \nvariety of agricultural\
    \ disciplines. Interoperability and scalability issues haven’t \ngotten enough\
    \ attention so yet. Agricultural robots combine emerging technolo-\ngies such\
    \ as computer vision; wireless sensor networks (WSNs), satellite navi-\ngation\
    \ systems (GPS), artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing (CC), and the \n\
    Internet of Things (IoT) to help farmers improve productivity and quality of ag-\n\
    ricultural products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile or fixed [33]. Mobile\
    \ \nAARS can move around the working field. Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) \n\
    and unidentified aerial vehicles (UAVs) are the two types of mobile AARSs, as\
    \ \ndiscussed in the following sections. \n4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in\
    \ agriculture\nUnmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that work\
    \ with-\nout the use of a human operator on the ground. A platform for locomotive\
    \ ap-\nparatus and manipulator, navigation sensors, a supervisory control system,\
    \ an \ninterface for the control system, communication links for information exchange\
    \ \nbetween devices, and system architecture for integration between hardware\
    \ and \nsoftware agents are the main components of UGVs [34]. The control architec-\n\
    ture of a UGV can be remote-operated (controlled via an interface by a human \n\
    operator) or totally autonomous (operated without the use of a human control-\n\
    ler using artificial intelligence technology) [34]. Locomotive systems, likewise,\
    \ \ncan be based on wheels, tracks, or legs [34]. Legged robots are uncommon in\
    \ \nagriculture, despite their great terrain flexibility, inherent Omni directionality,\
    \ \nand soil protection. These robots, however, offer a disruptive locomotion\
    \ mech-\nanism for smart farms when paired with wheels (wheel-legged robots).\
    \ UGVs \nshould meet specific requirements, such as small size, maneuverability,\
    \ resil-\nience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety, in addition\
    \ to the nec-\nessary features for infield operations, in order to improve crop\
    \ yields and farm \nproductivity. A 4WD locomotive system is used in the majority\
    \ of agricultural \nrobotic systems due to its ease of manufacture and control.\
    \ \n433\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n\
    The disadvantage of 4WD is that terrains with stone elements and/or voids \nhave\
    \ a significant impact on the wheels [34]. As a result, other mechanisms, \nsuch\
    \ as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems, should be investigated. \nAlthough\
    \ some robots include computer vision systems, most of these robots \nare designed\
    \ with a low-cost computer vision system, such as traditional RGB \ncameras, due\
    \ to the difficulties of establishing an accurate and dependable sys-\ntem that\
    \ can replace manual labour. Furthermore, the majority of the systems \nmentioned\
    \ above are still in the research phase, with no large-scale commer-\ncial application.\n\
    4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture \nUnmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),\
    \ sometimes known as aerial robots, are \nplanes that do not have a human pilot\
    \ on board. There are many different types \nof UAVs [35] depending on the technology\
    \ used to fly (wing structure) and the \nlevel of autonomy. Fixed-wing (planes),\
    \ single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid system \n(vertical takeoff and landing), and\
    \ multi-rotor UAVs are examples of wing types \n(drone). Drones (multi-rotor technology),\
    \ which are raised and driven by four \n(quad-rotor) or six (hex-rotor) rotors,\
    \ have grown in popularity in the agricul-\nture sector because to their mechanical\
    \ simplicity in comparison to helicopters, \nwhich rely on a much more complex\
    \ plate control mechanism [36]. Similarly, \nUAVs can be tele-operated or tele-commanded,\
    \ depending on their autonomy \nlevel, with the pilot providing references to\
    \ each actuator of the aircraft to con-\ntrol it in the same way that an onboard\
    \ pilot would, or tele-commanded with the \naircraft relying on an automatic controller\
    \ on board to maintain a stable flight \n[35]. Agricultural UAVs with the right\
    \ sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, \nand hyper spectral cameras, for\
    \ example) can collect data (vegetation, leaf area, \nand reflectance indexes)\
    \ from their fields to monitor dynamic changes in crops \nthat aren’t visible\
    \ from the ground [37]. Farmers can deduce information about \ncrop illnesses,\
    \ nutrient deficits, water level, and other agricultural growth char-\nacteristics\
    \ using this data. Farmers might plan possible cures using this knowl-\nedge (irrigation,\
    \ fertilization, weed control, etc.). \nThe majority of the systems mentioned\
    \ above are still in the research stage, \nwith no large-scale commercial use.\
    \ Other issues with these UAVs include bat-\ntery life and flight time [35]. Lithium-ion\
    \ batteries are currently in use because \ntheir capacity exceeds that of conventional\
    \ batteries. \nHowever, increasing the battery capacity increases the weight of\
    \ the drone, \nand research is currently underway to overcome this issue. \nFurthermore,\
    \ existing UAVs have complicated user interfaces that can only \nbe used by experts\
    \ to accomplish agricultural chores. People who are elderly \n434\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nor unfamiliar with UAV\
    \ technology will be able to control it more readily if \nthe user interface is\
    \ improved and made more human-centered with multimod-\nal feedback. \n4.6. Big\
    \ data and analytics in agriculture \nRapid advancements in IoT and CC technologies\
    \ have massively expanded \nthe amount of data available. Textual content (structured,\
    \ semi-structured, and un-\nstructured) and multimedia content (e.g., videos,\
    \ photos, and audio) are included \nin this data, also known as Big Data (BD)\
    \ [38]. Big data analytics is the practice \nof analyzing large amounts of data\
    \ to find hidden patterns, unknown relationships, \nmarket trends, client preferences,\
    \ and other important information (BDA). Big \ndata is usually classified into\
    \ five dimensions, each of which is represented by a V. \nThe concept of BD-driven\
    \ smart agriculture is very new, but its trend is \ngood because it has the potential\
    \ to make a dramatic change in the food supply \nchain and boost food security\
    \ through higher productivity. Agricultural big data \nis typically generated\
    \ from a variety of sources in agriculture, including ground \nsensors, aerial\
    \ vehicles, and ground vehicles equipped with special cameras and \nsensors; governmental\
    \ bodies in the form of reports and regulations; private \norganizations through\
    \ online web services; farmers in the form of knowledge \ngained through surveys;\
    \ and social media [39]. Depending on the agricultural \ndomain, the data can\
    \ be environmental (weather, climate, moisture level, etc.), \nbiological (plant\
    \ disease), or geospatial, and it comes in a variety of volumes, \nspeeds, and\
    \ formats [40]. The information is acquired and stored in a computer \ndatabase,\
    \ where it is analyzed using computer algorithms for seed characteris-\ntics,\
    \ weather patterns, soil attributes (such as pH or nutrient content), marketing\
    \ \nand trade management, consumer behaviour, and inventory management. In \n\
    agriculture, a range of strategies and tools are used to examine large data. The\
    \ \nmost often employed techniques include machine learning, cloud-based plat-\n\
    forms, and modelling and simulation. Machine learning technologies are used \n\
    to solve problems like prediction, clustering, and classification, while cloud\
    \ \nplatforms are utilized for large-scale data storage, preprocessing, and visual-\n\
    ization. There are still numerous potential areas where BDA can be used to \n\
    address various agricultural concerns that are not well covered in existing lit-\n\
    erature. For example, data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical farming \n\
    systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and indoor\
    \ \nfarms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to help farmers design\
    \ \nindoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers to help them\
    \ make \ndecisions about the physical ecosystem’s sustainability. Finally, the\
    \ majority of \nsystems are still in the prototype stage.\n435\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n4.7. Artificial intelligence\
    \ in agriculture \nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the study of theories and computer\
    \ systems that \ncan perform activities that need human intelligence, such as\
    \ sensory percep-\ntion and decision-making [41]. AI, particularly in the areas\
    \ of machine learning \n(ML) and deep learning (DL), is seen as one of the primary\
    \ forces driving the \ndigitization of agriculture when combined with CC, IoT,\
    \ and big data. These \ntechnologies have the potential to increase crop production,\
    \ harvesting, pro-\ncessing, and marketing in real time [42]. ML and DL algorithms\
    \ are being used \nto determine various parameters such as weed detection, yield\
    \ prediction, and \ndisease identification in a number of intelligent agricultural\
    \ systems. The fol-\nlowing two sub-sections go through these systems.\n4.7.1.\
    \ Machine learning in agriculture \nsupervised learning (linear regression, regression\
    \ trees, non-linear regres-\nsion, Bayesian linear regression, polynomial regression,\
    \ and support vector \nregression), and unsupervised learning (hierarchal clustering,\
    \ k-means cluster-\ning, neural networks (NN) anomaly detection, principal component\
    \ analysis, \nindependent component analysis, a-priori algorithm, and singular\
    \ value decom-\nposition (SVD)). Weed detection, Crop yield prediction, disease\
    \ and weather \nprediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation ( moisture content,\
    \ type, pH, \ntemperature, etc.), water management, fertilizer amount determination,\
    \ and \nlivestock production and management all use machine learning techniques\
    \ and \nalgorithms [2, 43]. According to the study of these publications, “crop\
    \ yield \nprediction” is an extensively researched area, with the most widely\
    \ utilized ML \napproaches to allow smart farming being linear regression [4],\
    \ neural network \n(NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM)\
    \ [2]. \nThe presented use cases are still in the research phase, and no commercial\
    \ \nuse has been recorded as of yet. Furthermore, AI and machine learning ap-\n\
    proaches are found to be underutilized in greenhouse and indoor vertical farm-\n\
    ing systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are \n\
    only a handful publications that use machine learning techniques. To enable \n\
    digital farming, new methodologies such as federated learning and privacy \npreserving\
    \ methods are being developed in light of the digital transformation’s \ncyber-security\
    \ and data privacy problems [44]. These methods create machine \nlearning models\
    \ from local parameters rather than sharing private data samples, \nreducing security\
    \ concerns.\n4.7.2. Deep learning in agriculture \nDeep learning (DL) is an extension\
    \ of classical machine learning (ML) \nbecause extra “depth” (complexity) is added\
    \ to the model, it can accomplish \n436\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ndifficult tasks (predictions and classification)\
    \ extraordinarily well and quick-\nly. DL’s main benefit is feature learning,\
    \ which includes extracting features \n(high-level information) from big datasets\
    \ automatically [45]. Long short term \nmemory (LSTM) networks, convolutional\
    \ neural networks (CNNs), recurrent \nneural (RNN) networks, generative adversarial\
    \ networks (GANs), radial basis \nfunction networks (RBFNs), multilayer perceptron\
    \ (MLPs), feed-forward ar-\ntificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing maps\
    \ (SOMs), deep belief net-\nworks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),\
    \ and autoencoders are \nexamples of deep learning algorithms Various sites [46]\
    \ provide a full overview \nof these methods, popular architectures, and training\
    \ systems. DL algorithms \nare commonly used in agriculture to solve problems\
    \ related to computer vision \napplications that aim to predict key parameters\
    \ such as crop yields, soil mois-\nture content, weather conditions, and crop\
    \ growth conditions; detect diseases, \npests, and weeds; and identify leaf or\
    \ plant species [47]. Computer vision is an \ninterdisciplinary field that has\
    \ exploded in popularity in recent years thanks to \nthe rise of CNNs. It provides\
    \ methods and techniques for accurately process-\ning digital images and allowing\
    \ computers to analyze and comprehend the vi-\nsual world [48]. CNNs, generally\
    \ is known as Convet and its derivatives, are \nthe most widely used deep learning\
    \ algorithms in agricultural applications. \nRegion-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN,\
    \ Faster-RCNN, YOLO, and Mask-\nRCNN are some of the CNN variants, with the first\
    \ four being the most typi-\ncally used to address object detection issues. On\
    \ the other side, Mask-RCNN \nis utilized to overcome instance segmentation issues.\
    \ The reader can find a \nthorough explanation of these algorithms and their applications\
    \ in the exist-\ning bibliography [47]. Other DL approaches have been employed\
    \ in a few re-\nsearch. When it comes to datasets, the majority of deep learning\
    \ models are \ntrained on photographs, with only a few trained on sensor data\
    \ collected in the \nfield. This demonstrates that DL can be used on a wide range\
    \ of datasets. It’s \nalso worth noting that the majority of the research is focused\
    \ on outdoor farms, \nwith next-generation farms (environment-controlled) receiving\
    \ less attention. \nThough digital farming has the potential to be enabled by\
    \ DL, most systems \nare still in the prototype stage. Furthermore, the additional\
    \ obstacles created \nby cyber-security and privacy concerns necessitate the improvement\
    \ of current \ndeep learning and computer vision technologies.\n4.8. Agricultural\
    \ decision support systems \nA decision support system (DSS) is a smart system\
    \ that assists stakehold-\ners and potential users in making decisions in response\
    \ to specific needs and \nchallenges by offering operational responses based on\
    \ meaningful informa-\n437\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\ntion retrieved from raw data, documents, personal knowledge,\
    \ and/or models \n[49]. Data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven,\
    \ and \nknowledge-driven DSS are all possibilities. The following source [50]\
    \ lists the \nkey features of these DSSs. The volume of farming data has exploded\
    \ as a re-\nsult of the advent of agriculture 4.0. Platforms like agricultural\
    \ decision support \nsystems (ADSS) are necessary to convert this heterogeneous\
    \ data into practical \nknowledge in order to make evidence-based and precise\
    \ judgments about farm \nmanagement and facility layout [51]. ADSSs have gotten\
    \ a lot of interest in the \nagriculture industry over the last few years. A variety\
    \ of agricultural concerns, \nsuch as farm management, water management, and environmental\
    \ management, \nhave been addressed by a number of ADSSs. Most ADSSs have been\
    \ found \nto ignore expert knowledge, which is extremely useful since it enables\
    \ for the \nconstruction of systems that are tailored to the demands of the users.\
    \ Complex \nGUIs, insufficient re-planning components, a lack of prediction and\
    \ forecasting \nabilities, and a lack of ability to adjust to unpredictable and\
    \ dynamic elements \nare some of the other identified faults with some of these\
    \ ADDSs. It’s also worth \nnoting that all of the ADSSs are for outside agriculture\
    \ systems and are still in \ndevelopment. In comparison, the use of ADSS in indoor\
    \ soilless agriculture is \ncurrently underutilized.\n4.9. Agricultural cyber-physical\
    \ systems \nA cyber-physical system (CPS) is an automated distributed system that\
    \ inte-\ngrates physical processes with communication networks and computing infra-\n\
    structures [52], and it is one of the key technologies of Industry 4.0. There\
    \ are \nthree standard CPS reference architecture models: 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA,\
    \ \nwhich may be found in full at the following source [53]. Among these, the\
    \ 5C \nis a well-known and widely used reference model. CPS takes advantage of\
    \ a \nnumber of existing technologies, including agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented\
    \ \nreality, big data, and machine learning (ML) [54]. Scalability, flexibility,\
    \ au-\ntonomy, reliability, resilience, safety, and security are all improved\
    \ as a result \nof its adoption.\nOne of the most difficult domains that can benefit\
    \ from CPS technology is \nagriculture. Agricultural cyber-physical systems (ACPSs)\
    \ combine advanced \nelectronic technology with agricultural infrastructure to\
    \ create integrated farm \nmanagement systems that interact with the physical\
    \ environment to keep crops \ngrowing at their best [55]. ACPSs collect high-accuracy\
    \ data regarding climate, \nsoil, and crops and utilize it to manage watering,\
    \ humidity, and plant health, \namong other things. For the management of various\
    \ services, a range of ACPSs \nhave been created; however, most of these systems\
    \ are still in the prototype and \n438\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nconceptual stages. Furthermore, the majority\
    \ of studies are for outdoor farms, \nwith only a few publications published on\
    \ soil-based greenhouse systems. There \nhas been no research on indoor soilless\
    \ agricultural methods. Since of its pro-\nspective applications in a variety\
    \ of fields, ACPSs have sparked a lot of academ-\nic interest; nevertheless, deploying\
    \ CPS models in real-world applications is \nstill a difficulty because it requires\
    \ the right hardware and software [56]. When \ndesigning ACPSs, special emphasis\
    \ should be paid to autonomy, robustness, and \nresilience in order to deal with\
    \ the unpredictable nature of the environment and \nthe unknown characteristics\
    \ of agricultural facilities. ACPSs are influenced by \na variety of factors,\
    \ including humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data.. ACPSs \nmust be properly\
    \ and extensively developed to provide a seamless operation \nwhile avoiding conflicts,\
    \ errors, and disturbances.\n4.10. Digital twins in agriculture \nA digital twin\
    \ (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical) \nobject that mimics\
    \ its behaviours and states across multiple stages of the ob-\nject’s lifecycle\
    \ by combining real-world data, simulation, and machine learning \nmodels with\
    \ data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning \n[57]. The\
    \ physical and virtual entities, the physical and virtual environments, \nthe\
    \ metrology, and realization modules that perform the physical to virtual and\
    \ \nvirtual to physical connection or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate,\
    \ and \nthe physical and virtual processes are all required for a complete description\
    \ of \nthe DT concept for any physical system [58]. Because of advancements in\
    \ tech-\nnology such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks,\
    \ and \ncloud computing, the DT concept has gained traction. This is due to the\
    \ fact that \nthese technologies enable real-time monitoring of physical twins\
    \ at high spatial \nresolutions using both small devices and distant sensing,\
    \ which generate ev-\ner-increasing data streams [21]. In comparison to other\
    \ fields, the notion of DT \nin agricultural applications is relatively new, with\
    \ the first references appearing \nin 2017; as a result, its added value has not\
    \ yet been thoroughly studied [21]. \nBecause of its reliance on natural circumstances\
    \ (temperature, soil, humidity), \nas well as the presence of living and non-living\
    \ physical twins (plants and an-\nimals), framing is a very complex and dynamic\
    \ realm (indoor farm buildings, \ngrow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural\
    \ machinery). \nNon-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with\
    \ plants and \nanimals (living physical twins), posing more obstacles for DT in\
    \ agriculture, \nwhereas non-living physical twins are the focus of DT in other\
    \ domains such \nas manufacturing. The majority of research has been on open-air\
    \ agricultur-\nal systems. There is just one study that proposes DT for a soil-based\
    \ vertical \n439\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6,\
    \ 2022\nfarming system and one study that implements DT for a soilless vertical\
    \ farm-\ning system (aquaponics). This could be due to the difficulty of designing\
    \ and \nmanaging modern farming systems. Furthermore, the majority of DTs are\
    \ still \nin the research phase, with no commercial deployment planned. Cost savings,\
    \ \ndisaster prevention, clearer decision making, and efficient management oper-\n\
    ations are all reported benefits of DT applications in agriculture, which can\
    \ be \napplied to a variety of agricultural subfields such as plant and animal\
    \ breeding, \naquaponics, vertical farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming.\
    \ While \nDT technology offers a lot of promise, achieving synchronization between\
    \ the \nreal and digital worlds is difficult. Due to the quirks of living physical\
    \ twins, \nthe intricacy of this procedure is magnified in agricultural settings.\
    \ As a result, \nagricultural DT should begin with micro-farms, which can then\
    \ be gradually up-\ngraded to a more intelligent and autonomous form by adding\
    \ more components.\n4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry \n\
    This section outlines a series of interconnected hurdles to a wider adoption of\
    \ \ndigital technologies in agriculture. Following a review of the literature,\
    \ 21 barri-\ners were found, which were divided into technical and socioeconomic\
    \ categories.\n4.12. Technical roadblocks \n•Interoperability: Data is regarded\
    \ as a critical component in the success of \nsmart systems. Agricultural data\
    \ is typically gathered from a variety of sources, \nincluding thousands of individual\
    \ farmlands, animal industries, and business ap-\nplications. Data can be in a\
    \ variety of formats, making data integration difficult. \nAs a result, after\
    \ systematic data collection, storage, processing, and knowledge \nmining, data\
    \ interoperability is critical to increasing the value of this widely \ndistributed\
    \ data [59]. Interconnected and interoperable devices are also required \nfor\
    \ successful communication between heterogeneous devices. The system’s in-\nteroperability\
    \ can be improved through cross-technology communication [60].\n•Standardization:\
    \ Standardization of devices is required to fully use digital \ntechnologies for\
    \ smart farming applications. Differences in output can occur \nas a result of\
    \ misinterpretation and changes over time. Device, application, and \nsystem interoperability\
    \ concerns can also be overcome by standardization [25].\n•Data quality: Data\
    \ quality, as well as data security, storage, and openness, \nare essential for\
    \ producing meaningful outcomes. Another impediment to the \nadoption of smart\
    \ farming technologies is the lack of decentralized data man-\nagement systems\
    \ [9]. Multiple actors’ willingness to exchange farm data is be-\ning harmed as\
    \ a result of this problem.\n•Hardware implementation: It is incredibly difficult\
    \ to establish a smart agri-\ncultural setup in large-scale open areas. This is\
    \ due to the fact that all hardware, \n440\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences\
    \ and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nincluding IoT devices, wireless sensor networks,\
    \ sensor nodes, machinery, and \nequipment, is directly exposed to harsh environmental\
    \ conditions such as heavy \nrainfall, extreme temperatures, extreme humidity,\
    \ high wind speeds, and a vari-\nety of other dangers that can destroy electronic\
    \ circuits or disrupt their normal \nfunctionality [61]. A possible answer is\
    \ to construct a sturdy and lasting casing \nfor all of the expensive devices\
    \ that can withstand real-world conditions [62].\n•Adequate power sources: Typically,\
    \ wireless gadgets used on farms func-\ntion for an extended period of time and\
    \ have a limited battery life. \nBecause replacing a battery in the event of a\
    \ failure is difficult, especially in \nopen-air farms where devices are strategically\
    \ located with limited access [61], a \nproper energy-saving system is required.\
    \ Low-power sensors and proper commu-\nnication management are two viable strategies\
    \ for reducing energy consumption \n[24, 63]. Other intriguing technologies to\
    \ eliminate the need for battery renewal by \nrecharging batteries using electromagnetic\
    \ waves include wireless power transfer \nand self-supporting wireless systems.\
    \ In most agricultural applications, however, \nlong-distance wireless charging\
    \ is required [9]. Another potential alternative is to \ncapture ambient energy\
    \ from rivers, fluid flow, vehicle movement, and the ground \nsurface using sensor\
    \ nodes; however the converted electrical energy is current-\nly restricted, necessitating\
    \ the need to enhance power conversion efficiency [64].\n•Reliability: The dependability\
    \ of devices, as well as the software applica-\ntions that run on them, is critical.\
    \ This is due to the fact that IoT devices must \ncollect and transmit data from\
    \ which judgments are made utilizing a variety of \nsoftware packages. Unreliable\
    \ sensing, processing, and transmission can result \nin erroneous monitoring data\
    \ reports, significant delays, and even data loss, all \nof which can have a negative\
    \ impact on agricultural system performance [25].\n •Adaptability: Agriculture\
    \ is a complicated, dynamic, and continuously \nchanging environment. As a result,\
    \ when building a system, it is critical for de-\nvices and applications to react\
    \ proactively with other entities in the face of un-\nknown and dynamic elements\
    \ in order to provide the required performance [65].\n•Robust wireless architectures:\
    \ Low-cost, wide-area coverage, enough net-\nworking flexibility, and high scalability\
    \ are all advantages of wireless networks \nand communication technologies. However,\
    \ in a dynamic agriculture environ-\nment, such as temperature swings, the movement\
    \ of live objects, and the ex-\nistence of impediments, dependable wireless connection\
    \ is a major difficulty. \nFor example, multipath propagation effects cause signal\
    \ strength oscillations, \nresulting in unstable connectivity and insufficient\
    \ data transmission [66]. These \nelements have an impact on the agricultural\
    \ system’s performance. As a result, \nrobust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures\
    \ with proper sensor node place-\n441\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\nment, antenna height, network topology, and communication\
    \ protocols are re-\nquired, as well as low-maintenance wireless systems [11].\n\
    •Interference: Because of the extensive deployment of IoT devices and wire-\n\
    less sensor networks, another difficulty is wireless interference and quality\
    \ of \nservice degradation. Effective channel scheduling between heterogeneous\
    \ sens-\ning devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and upcoming networking prim-\n\
    itives like concurrent transmission [67] can all help to solve these problems.\
    \ \nBecause agriculture equipment are dispersed in indoor greenhouses, outdoor\
    \ \nfarmlands, underground locations, and even aquatic areas, cross-media com-\n\
    munication between underground, underwater, and air is also necessary for full\
    \ \nintegration of smart technologies [68].\n•Security and privacy: Because smart\
    \ agricultural systems are dispersed, \nthey are vulnerable to cyber-attacks such\
    \ as eavesdropping, data integrity, de-\nnial-of-service assaults, and other sorts\
    \ of disruptions that could jeopardize the \nsystem’s privacy, integrity, and\
    \ availability [69]. With various privacy-preserv-\ning techniques and federated\
    \ learning approaches, cyber-security is a funda-\nmental concern that needs to\
    \ be addressed in the context of smart farming [44].\n•Compatibility: in order\
    \ to meet the fragmentation and scalability standards, \nthe models or software\
    \ applications developed must be adaptable and able to \nrun on any equipment\
    \ in the agricultural system [13]. \n•Resource optimization: To boost farm profitability,\
    \ farmers need a resource op-\ntimization procedure to determine the ideal number\
    \ of IoT devices and gateways, \ncloud storage size, and volume of transmitted\
    \ data. Resource optimization is diffi-\ncult since farms vary in size and require\
    \ different types of sensors to assess different \nvariables [70]. Second, most\
    \ farm management systems do not support run-time \nchanges to match the demands\
    \ of individual farmers. To estimate adequate resource \nallocation, complicated\
    \ mathematical models and algorithms are necessary [32].\n•Scalability: Due to\
    \ technological improvements, the number of gadgets, \ngear, and sensors put on\
    \ farms is continually expanding. \nGateways, network applications, and back-end\
    \ databases should all be de-\npendable and scalable in order to serve these entities\
    \ [71].\n•Human-centered user interfaces: Existing agricultural software and gadgets\
    \ \nhave complicated user interfaces, which are limiting smart farming methods.\
    \ \nThe majority of graphical user interfaces are constructed in such a way that\
    \ \nonly specialists can use them to accomplish agricultural activities. By making\
    \ \nthe user interface more human-centered and providing multimodal feedback,\
    \ a \nbigger group of individuals will be able to use it to complete various agricul-\n\
    tural tasks [35].\n442\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol.\
    \ 14, №6, 2022\n4.13. Socio-economic roadblocks \n•Gap between farmers and researchers:\
    \ Farmers’ engagement is critical to \nthe success of the agriculture industry’s\
    \ digitization. Agricultural specialists are \nfrequently unaware of the concerns\
    \ that farmers encounter during the agri-food \nproduction process, which smart\
    \ technologies could solve [16]. Furthermore, it \nis critical to completely comprehend\
    \ the nature of problems in order to create \nan appropriate smart solution. \n\
    As a result, bridging the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, \n\
    and AI researchers is critical.\n•Expenses connected with smart systems: the costs\
    \ associated with adopt-\ning smart technology and systems are a major impediment\
    \ to the agriculture \nsector’s digitization. These expenses typically include\
    \ deployment, operation, \nand maintenance. Smart system deployment costs are\
    \ typically significant since \nthey include: I hardware installation, such as\
    \ autonomous robots and drones, \nWSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure,\
    \ and ii) paying trained labour \nto do particular agricultural tasks [72]. Similarly,\
    \ subscriptions to centralized \nnetworks and software packages are necessary\
    \ to support data processing, con-\ntrol of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge\
    \ exchange, which eventually \nraises operating expenses [73]. Even if service\
    \ providers occasionally provide \nfree subscription packages with limited capabilities,\
    \ storage capacity is limited. \nPeriodic maintenance is essential to ensure the\
    \ proper operation of the smart \nsystem, which adds to the total costs.\nEnvironmental,\
    \ ethical, and societal costs may also be connected with the \nadoption of smart\
    \ devices. Initiatives focusing on cooperative farming are need-\ned to overcome\
    \ cost-related roadblocks by providing: I support services for \nbetter cost management\
    \ and needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to \ntransform conventional\
    \ equipment into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce \nhigh initial costs [73].\n\
    •Digital division: a lack of awareness of digital technology and their appli-\n\
    cations is another problem limiting the digitalization of the agriculture sector.\
    \ \nThe majority of farmers have no understanding what digital technologies are,\
    \ \nhow to install and utilize them, or which technology is appropriate for their\
    \ farm \nand matches their needs [14]. As a result, farmers must be educated on\
    \ current \nfarming technologies and processes. \nFurthermore, various tactics\
    \ are required to develop tools that use natural \nlanguage and are easily understood\
    \ by farmers with low levels of education [74]. \n•Return on investment: In agriculture,\
    \ like in other industries, the profit \nmargin is critical. When it comes to\
    \ implementing modern technologies, farm-\n443\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences\
    \ and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\ners are concerned about the time it will\
    \ take to recoup their investment and the \ndifficulty in assessing the benefits\
    \ [12].\n•Building faith in the effectiveness of smart technology in agriculture\
    \ is \ndifficult, unlike in other disciplines, because many decisions influence\
    \ systems \nthat involve both living and non-living elements, and the results\
    \ can be difficult \nto reverse [16]. In addition, the lack of verification of\
    \ the influence of digital \ntools on farm productivity exacerbates the current\
    \ difficulties.\n•Legal frameworks: different regions and nations have distinct\
    \ legal frame-\nworks that influence the deployment of digital technologies in\
    \ agriculture, par-\nticularly in monitoring and agri-food supply [31]. Similarly,\
    \ laws governing \nresource allocation (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy,\
    \ and security \ndiffer from country to country [31].\n•Connectivity infrastructure:\
    \ In most developing nations, connectivity in-\nfrastructure is poor, limiting\
    \ access to advanced digital technologies that could \nhelp turn data from disparate\
    \ sources into useful and actionable insights [10].\n4.14. Discussion \nThe goal\
    \ of this study was to describe the new digital technologies that are \nbeing\
    \ used in the agricultural industry in order to predict the future trajectories\
    \ \nof agriculture 4.0. Big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-phys-\n\
    ical systems, and digital twins are among the technologies that have yet to be\
    \ \nfully explored in agriculture. This disparity could be due to the fact that\
    \ install-\ning advanced technologies with more complex processes can be costly,\
    \ at least \nin the early stages of their acceptance. The agricultural industry’s\
    \ development \nof these technologies is expected to speed up in the next years.\
    \ The findings of \nSLR also reveal that IoT is widely used in farms. This is\
    \ owing to the IoT’s di-\nverse capabilities, which include monitoring, tracking,\
    \ and tracing, agricultural \nmachinery, and precision agriculture [21]. One of\
    \ the key research aims within \nthe farm 4.0 techniques can be regarded to be\
    \ IoT. Nonetheless, when building \nan intelligent agricultural system, only a\
    \ few researches have examined data \nsecurity and dependability, scalability,\
    \ and interoperability. The outcomes of \nthe study also revealed that the majority\
    \ of use cases are still in the prototype \nstage. The reason for this could be\
    \ that most agricultural activities involve live \nsubjects, such as animals and\
    \ plants, or perishable products, and establish-\ning systems for living subjects\
    \ is more difficult than developing systems for \nnon-living human-made systems.\
    \ Another explanation could be that, due to the \ntrans-disciplinary character\
    \ of agriculture, it is a late adopter of technology. As a \nresult, in order\
    \ to construct intelligent systems, the agricultural community must \nbecome conversant\
    \ with all digital technologies. Finally, differences in plant/\n444\nSiberian\

    \ growth conditions complicate agricultural system digitaliza-\ntion [55]. In\
    \ contrast to indoor farms, the majority of the technologies created \nby SLR\
    \ are for open-air soil-based farms (soilless and soil-based). This is owing \n\
    to the complicated design and maintenance of indoor farms, particularly soilless\
    \ \nfarms, where the parameters and elements to be maintained are numerous (pH,\
    \ \nair temperature, humidity, etc.) [5]. However, by incorporating digital technol-\n\
    ogy and data-driven computer applications into indoor farms, a more reliable \n\
    control of the process can be attained. Furthermore, SLR reveals that insufficient\
    \ \nresearch is undertaken in three of the nine service areas described in section\
    \ 3 \n(soil management, fruit detection and counting, and crop quality management).\
    \ \nThis supports the notion that significant research and development is required\
    \ \nin some areas to ensure the successful digitization of the agriculture business\
    \ \nin both developed and developing countries. The agriculture ecosystem’s com-\n\
    plexity creates a set of interrelated hurdles that prevent full integration of\
    \ digital \ntechnology for agriculture 4.0 implementation. As a result, identifying\
    \ possible \nbottlenecks is critical in order to devise strategic strategies to\
    \ overcome them. \nThis research aims to figure out what these stumbling barriers\
    \ are. Following \nthe investigation, 21 barriers were found and characterized\
    \ on both a technical \nand socioeconomic level. These impediments are addressed\
    \ in section 5, which \noutlines what needs to be done on a bigger scale to digitize\
    \ the agricultural \neconomy. However, it is still unknown how much removing or\
    \ mitigating these \nhurdles aids in the successful integration of digital technologies.\
    \ \n4.16. Added value of agricultural digitization \nSeveral benefits that can\
    \ inspire framers and other actors to assist agriculture \nindustry digitization\
    \ have been discovered and outlined based on analysis. The \nbenefits described\
    \ here have the potential to increase farm productivity and im-\nprove product\
    \ quality, but they should not be viewed as a cure for the problems \nthat come\
    \ with smart agriculture [73]. \n•Improved agility: Farm operations can now be\
    \ more agile thanks to digital \ntechnologies. Farmers and agricultural professionals\
    \ can quickly respond to \nany anticipated changes in environmental and water\
    \ conditions using real-time \nsurveillance and forecasting technologies to save\
    \ crops [72].\n•Green process: By lowering the use of in-field fuel, nitrogen\
    \ fertilizers, \npesticides, and herbicides, digital technologies make farming\
    \ more ecologically \nfriendly and climate-resilient [75].\n•Resource efficiency:\
    \ By increasing the quantity and quality of agricultural \noutput while reducing\
    \ the use of water, energy, fertilizers, and pesticides, digital \nplatforms can\
    \ improve resource efficiency [3]. \n445\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n•Time and cost savings: By automating various\
    \ tasks such as harvesting, sow-\ning, or irrigation, managing the application\
    \ of fertilizers or pesticides, and sched-\nuling irrigation, digital technologies\
    \ provide significant time and cost savings [76].\n•Asset management: digital\
    \ technologies enable real-time observation of \nfarm holdings and equipment,\
    \ allowing for theft prevention, component re-\nplacement, and routine maintenance\
    \ [10].\n•Product safety: By eliminating fraud [17, 18] linked to adulteration,\
    \ coun-\nterfeiting, and artificial enhancement, digital technologies maintain\
    \ appropriate \nfarm output and ensure a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food\
    \ products [69].\n4.17. Considerations and future prospects \nThe agricultural\
    \ industry would see major benefits as a result of the planned \nmeasures. However,\
    \ the impediments identified in section 5 must be solved first \nin order to make\
    \ things sustainable for small and medium-scale growers. Some \nof the above hurdles\
    \ can be mitigated by awareness campaigns emphasizing the \nimportance of smart\
    \ agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and \nencouraging\
    \ novel techniques (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders \nto take\
    \ an active role in the digital transformation [9]. Initiatives at the federal\
    \ \nlevel, grants and endowments, public-private collaborations, data transparency,\
    \ \nand regional research efforts can all help overcome potential hurdles. Finally,\
    \ \nwhen constructing a smart agriculture system, a roadmap can be used, starting\
    \ \nwith a basic architecture with few components and simpler functionality and\
    \ \ngradually adding components and functionality to develop a sophisticated sys-\n\
    tem with full digitization potential [21]. These issues can pave the road for\
    \ ag-\nriculture 4.0’s successful adoption. The use of explainable artificial\
    \ intelligence \nto monitor crop development, estimate crop biomass, evaluate\
    \ crop health, and \ncontrol pests and diseases is one of the future prospects\
    \ of digital technologies \nin smart agriculture. Explainable AI eliminates the\
    \ old black-box approach of \nmachine learning and allows for a better understanding\
    \ of the reasoning behind \nany given decision [15]. The use of common semantics\
    \ and ontologies to de-\nscribe big data, as well as the adoption of open standards,\
    \ has the potential to \naccelerate research and development in the field of smart\
    \ farming. Similarly, \n5G technology must be thoroughly investigated in order\
    \ to enable improved \nconnectivity and live streaming of crop data [6]. By executing\
    \ precise crop in-\nspections remotely, 5G technology will reduce internet costs\
    \ and enhance the \nentire user experience of farm management and food safety\
    \ [77]. It would also \nhelp to close the gap between stakeholders by keeping\
    \ them informed about \ncrop availability. Finally, blockchain can be used in\
    \ conjunction with IoT and \nother technologies to address data privacy and security\
    \ concerns [78]. \n446\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol.\
    \ 14, №6, 2022\n4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 \nThe agriculture sector has\
    \ traditionally had a breakthrough during industri-\nal revolutions. Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 offers significant potential to offset rising food \ndemands and prepare\
    \ for the future by reinforcing agricultural systems with \nWSN, IoT, AI, and\
    \ other technologies, as formally mentioned in preceding \nsections. While agricultural\
    \ 4.0 is still being implemented, agriculture 5.0 is \nalready being discussed.\
    \ \nAgriculture 5.0 builds on agriculture 4.0 by incorporating industry 5.0 prin-\n\
    ciples to provide healthy, affordable food while also ensuring that the environ-\n\
    ments on which life depends are not degraded [79]. Industry 4.0 focuses less \n\
    on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability and more on dig-\n\
    italization and AI-driven technologies for increasing efficiency and flexibility,\
    \ \nthe European Commission formally called for the Fifth Industrial Revolution\
    \ \n(industry 5.0) in 2021 [80]. Industry 5.0 adds to and expands on the industry\
    \ 4.0 \nconcepts by emphasizing human-centricity, sustainability, and resiliency\
    \ [81]. \nIt entails improving human-machine collaboration, decreasing environmental\
    \ \neffect through the circular economy, and designing systems with a high degree\
    \ \nof robustness to reach an ideal balance of efficiency and productivity. Among\
    \ \nthe enabling technologies of industry are cobots (collaborative robots), smart\
    \ \nmaterials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient\
    \ \nand secure data management, renewable energy sources, and others 5.0[80].\n\
    Farm production efficiency and crop quality can be improved in agriculture \n\
    5.0 settings by delegating repetitive and boring activities to machines and those\
    \ \nthat need critical thinking to humans. For this reason, agricultural cyber\
    \ physical \ncognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment and conduct\
    \ ap-\npropriate actions, comparable to those established for the manufacturing\
    \ sector, \nshould be developed. This might include collaborative farm robots\
    \ that work in \nthe fields to aid crop growers with time-consuming operations\
    \ like seed sowing \nand harvesting. Similarly, digital twins in agriculture 5.0\
    \ can add substantial value \nby recognizing technical difficulties in agricultural\
    \ systems and resolving them \nmore quickly, detecting crop illnesses, and producing\
    \ more accurate crop output \nestimates. This demonstrates that agriculture 5.0\
    \ has the potential to pave the way \nfor climate-smart, sustainable, and resilient\
    \ agriculture, but it is still in its infancy. \n5. Conclusions \nConcerns about\
    \ global food security have heightened the demand for \nnext-generation industrial\
    \ farms and agricultural intensive production systems. \nDigital technologies,\
    \ such as those given by the Industry 4.0 programme, are at \n447\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nthe vanguard of this modern\
    \ agricultural period, providing a wide range of in-\nnovative solutions. Disruptive\
    \ technologies are being integrated into traditional \nagriculture systems by\
    \ scientists and researchers in order to boost crop yields, \ncut costs, reduce\
    \ waste, and sustain process inputs. This report includes an SLR \nthat discusses\
    \ the current state of various technologies in the agriculture sector. \nSeveral\
    \ findings are drawn, including the fact that big data and analytics inte-\ngration,\
    \ wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins in \nagriculture\
    \ are still in their infancy, with the majority of use cases still in the \nprototype\
    \ stage. Similarly, 21 technological and socioeconomic impediments \nare found\
    \ and categorized. These impediments must be identified and addressed \nif the\
    \ agriculture industry is to be digitalized. The report also identifies and \n\
    presents the additional value of digital technology in the agriculture industry.\
    \ \nOverall, this research contributes to the ongoing research on agricultural\
    \ 4.0. \nThe review’s principal restriction is twofold: first, only three online\
    \ reposito-\nries (Scopus, IEEE, and Science Direct) are considered for literature\
    \ searches, \nand second, new keywords and synonyms may return more papers. The\
    \ main \nconclusions are highly unlikely to alter in either scenario. Additional\
    \ research \ndatabases and areas can be considered for future study in order to\
    \ provide a \ncomplete overview of the agriculture industry in terms of digitization.\
    \ In addi-\ntion, papers focusing on agriculture 5.0 in general will be featured.\n\

    \ has provided sophisticated research and developments \nin the field of agriculture.\
    \ In agriculture field production, using environmental and deployment \nsensors\
    \ like DHT11, soil moisture, soil temperature, and so on, IoT has been utilised\
    \ to monitor \nfield conditions and automation in precision agriculture. The environmental\
    \ parameters, field \nevaluation, deployment parameters, and shortage of water\
    \ has become an unresolved task for \nagriculture monitoring. All of this leads\
    \ to insufficient production of the agricultural crop. To \neradicate the above-mentioned\
    \ problems, we proposed a system in the using an architectural \nmanner. This\
    \ system uses an NRF24L01 module with in-built power and low noise amplifiers\
    \ to \nenable a long-distance communication for transmission of the field information\
    \ about the current \ncrop situation to the farmers. This work is investigating\
    \ an appropriate, reasonable, and applied \nIoT technology for precision agriculture\
    \ by considering various applications of agriculture and \nexperiments. The proposed\
    \ system reduces power consumption, and improves operational \nefficiency. The\
    \ proposed system reduces human efforts and also evaluates heat index \nmeasurement\
    \ to monitor the environment. Based on the experiments, the current consumption\
    \ \nand life expectancy of the AWMU are determined to be 0.02819 A and 3 days\
    \ 20 hours 13 \nminutes and 47 seconds, respectively. Furthermore, the maximum\
    \ transmission of AWMU is in \nan environmental location is 200 meters line of\
    \ sight from the router. \n Keywords: Internet of Things, ThingSpeak cloud platform,\

    1. Introduction \nIn recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor\
    \ Networks (WSN) have become \nincreasingly essential [1] in agriculture. IoT\
    \ is having abundant applications like agriculture, \nhealthcare, smart cities,\
    \ commerce, home automation, education, and the environment. These \napplications\
    \ [2] are developed by the IoT sensor cloud-enabled, edge computing, cloud \n\
    computing, and WSN.  \nAgriculture and soil monitoring is based on environment\
    \ and soil parameters. These have come \nfrom animal health, crop health, plant\
    \ health, soil health, soil ecosystem, climate balance, and \nhuman health. We\
    \ came to know about animal health by tracking movement. For proper \nirrigation,\
    \ there should be nutrients, fertilizers, and water requirements that lead to\
    \ better crop \nhealth, soil health, and plant [3] health. Weather assessment\
    \ comes under the climate balance and \nthe soil ecosystem is associated with\
    \ soil fertility and quality. Human health also plays a major \nrole in the agriculture\
    \ workplace as shown in Fig. 1.  \nA. Smart Agriculture Monitoring (SAM) \nIoT\
    \ can provide automation in agriculture monitoring systems with help of sensors,\
    \ actuators \nembedded hardware platforms, and cloud-enabled technologies like\
    \ big data and cloud \ncomputing. Generally, the IoT role in agriculture has been\
    \ transformed [4] to different domains \nsuch as water and soil management, crop\
    \ monitoring, etc. WSN also enables automation in the \nfield of agriculture with\
    \ energy harvested [5] nodes, hardware cost-effectiveness, and scalability. \n\
    \ \nFig. 1 Overview of the smart agriculture parameters \nB. Remote Monitoring\
    \ Systems using IoT \nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a promising approach for\
    \ remote monitoring and \ninterconnectivity of the proposed system in this scenario,\
    \ thanks to communication protocols, an \nopen-source cloud platform for experiment\
    \ results based on Application Programming Interface \n(API), visualization dashboards,\
    \ and [6] web development tools. \n2. Related Work \nEmerging technologies are\
    \ playing a crucial role in smart agricultural monitoring systems, \nprecision\
    \ agriculture, and smart irrigation with complete automation and design implementations\
    \ \nin the current scenario. Some of the existing works are discussed below. \
    \   \nNestor Michael Tiglao et al. [7] proposed an Agrinex system, which is used\
    \ for smart irrigation \nwith a low-cost design and has a mesh-based topology\
    \ framework. It consists of hardware like \nRF module (NRF24L01), sensors (Temperature\
    \ and Humidity, soil moisture), actuator (servo \nmotor), and embedded boards\
    \ (Arduino and raspberry pi). Sensor's data processed and \ntransmitted through\
    \ the ATMEGA328P microcontroller and then via a gateway (sink node) to \nthe server\
    \ or cloud with the help of internet connectivity. The user can able to access\
    \ the sensor \ndata from the cloud and also developed a web application for remote\
    \ accessing and visualizing \nthe sensor data in online mode. \nRaul Morais et\
    \ al. [8] explained the mySense concept which means that data handling of \nenvironment\
    \ for developing the agriculture practices. In this article, four-layered architecture\
    \ \nshows the systematic data collection towards the precision agriculture issues\
    \ is discussed. This \narchitecture is made of four important components such\
    \ as input components (sensors) and input \ncomponents (actuators), gateway (Arduino\
    \ Uno, Raspberry pi) and wireless sensor network, web \nand cloud services, and\
    \ applications of end-user. It enables the hardware platforms with cost-\neffective\
    \ design end products to monitor the agriculture applications. \nUélison Jean\
    \ L. dos Santos et al. [9] represented the agriculture prediction model which\
    \ gives \ninsight on anticipate problems and improves the production of crops.\
    \ This model has three major \ncomponents like LoRa module, the Time series model,\
    \ and ARIMA predictive model. With the \nhelp of this model, to eradicate the\
    \ crop defects and notifications are sent to the farmers \nregarding their filed\
    \ information. In this model, sensors data acquisition with time series to \n\
    provide accurate results in agriculture production to the farmers.    \nShadi\
    \ AlZu’bi et al. [10] proposed an internet of multimedia things in smart agriculture\
    \ \napplications. This article, mainly focussed on smart farming for the optimized\
    \ process of \nirrigation. Internet of multimedia things having three important\
    \ components like image \nprocessing, IoT sensors, and machine learning techniques,\
    \ these techniques are used in the \ndecision-making system for proposed irrigation.\
    \ In this project deep learning is also state of the \nart for achieving the optimal\
    \ decision-making smart irrigation system. \nKhalid Haseeb et al. [11] demonstrated\
    \ an IoT and WSN based energy efficient framework for \nsmart agriculture applications.\
    \ In this paper, IoT and WSN are used to perceive the crop \nconditions and precision\
    \ agriculture automation by using different IoT sensors and these IoT \nsensors\
    \ deployed in the field of agriculture. To improve crop yield production over\
    \ the smart \nfarming decision-making system and acquire sensor data about the\
    \ crops and plant. This \nproposed system concentrated on few important metrics\
    \ like communication range, SNR, system \nthroughput, power consumption, and packet\
    \ drop ratio.   \nSanjeevi et al. [12] focussed on smart farming and agriculture\
    \ monitoring using cloud \ncomputing, the Internet of Things, and wireless sensor\
    \ network. In this article, the proposed \nmethodology gives insight into network\
    \ efficiency, low latency, high SNR, MSE, and more \ncoverage area. Based on the\
    \ sensor data, the receiver module has performed the action regarding \nmotor\
    \ on/off operations for proper water usage to agriculture monitoring. Different\
    \ types of \nsensors and other components have been used in the hardware implementations\
    \ for the smart \nagriculture monitoring system. \nTable 1 shows the IoT and WSN\
    \ based smart agriculture monitoring systems with various \nwireless communication\
    \ technologies and different metrics considered. These systems ensure \ncost-effectiveness,\
    \ high flexibility, and fast deployment based on mesh topology configuration in\
    \ \nthe agriculture field. Most of the existing systems are used Wi-Fi and ZigBee\
    \ technologies for \ntransmitting the sensor data of the agriculture field to\
    \ the farmer.           \nTable 1 Shows the IoT and WSN based smart agriculture\

    \ have been used. Based on the \ntransmission distance the wireless technologies\
    \ are divided into 3 categories. They are short-\nrange communication [24] for\
    \ the distance of <10m, medium-range communication for the \ndistance of 10m to\
    \ 100m, and long-range communication for the distance of distance >100m. \nThe\
    \ short-range communication includes Radio-frequency identification, Bluetooth,\
    \ ultra-\nwideband, and so on. Wi-Fi and ZigBee are used for medium-range communication\

    \ area, \netc. LPWA technology cannot be used for audio/video streaming due to\
    \ its low data rate. This \ntechnology is suitable in situations where there is\
    \ a need to transmit the distance over more \ndistances with smaller data rates.\
    \ The LPWA offers a more than 15km communication range \nwith a power consumption\

    \ technologies and Protocols \nIn this study, wireless communication technologies\
    \ and protocols are used for data transmission \nfor short and long-range distances.\
    \ IoT is having many wireless communication technologies as \nwell as protocols.\
    \ Apart from that some of them have been discussed for sending the data to a \n\
    cloud server. The wireless communication technologies like Wi-Fi, NRF24L01 are\
    \ used to \nnetwork connectivity to a range of about 100 m and 200m through a\
    \ router (wireless access \npoint) respectively, and as well as protocols like\
    \ MQTT, CoAP for providing the communication \nbetween the machine to machine\
    \ (M2M) and messages are sent to cloud.  \n3.4 NRF24L01 module \nNRF24L01 Module\
    \ consists of two libraries like RF24 and RF24Network for providing all \npackages\
    \ into the Arduino sketch. It acts as both transmitter and receiver to send the\
    \ data over \nthe network at a 200m distance. It has operated at 2.4GHz and the\
    \ data rate ranges from 250 \nKbps, 1-2 Mbps. The wireless transceiver NRF24L01\
    \ module is having an in-built Wi-Fi SoC \nantenna and a total of 8 input and\
    \ output pins. \n3.5 Field actuators \nIn the field of agriculture applications,\
    \ field actuators have been provided the controlling \nfunctions of devices. In\
    \ this scenario, filed actuators are like the Reay module, Motor module, \nand\
    \ LED indicator module. Based on sensor data, the action will be performed by\
    \ a particular \nactuator with an LED indicator. Field actuators are having few\
    \ important specifications \ndiscussed in table 4. \nTable 4 Shows the different\

    4. Proposed Architecture \nThe proposed architecture of a self-powered, real-time,\
    \ nrf24l01 IoT based-cloud enabled service \nfor smart agriculture decision-making\
    \ system consists of two sections such as Transmitter \nsection (Tx) and Receiver\
    \ section (Rx) as shown in below Fig. 4 and the wireless connection \nbetween\
    \ AWMU to WAMU as shown in below Fig. 5.  \nThe transmitter section (Tx) is responsible\
    \ for monitoring the agriculture field to get information \n(agriculture parameters)\
    \ from environmental sensors and deployment sensors (agriculture \nsensors). So\
    \ the physical layer comes into the picture and it senses all agriculture parameters\
    \ \nthrough sensors like temperature, humidity, moisture, and so on. It sends\
    \ the digital signal to \nanother above level. Data acquisition is a collection\
    \ of data from sensors deployed in the \nagriculture field. Once got completion\
    \ of the data collection process and will be processed the \ndata, the term is\
    \ called data processing which comes under hardware embedded platforms (IoT \n\
    gateway) along with wireless communication technologies for IoT, based on the\
    \ conceptual and \ncommunication layers. Through communication protocols like\
    \ MQTT and CoAP, only the \nmessages are transmitted from client to server based\
    \ on a set of rules for data in formats such as \nXML, JSON, CSV, and so forth.\
    \ These things have happened while the Internet is available at \nfarmers' place\
    \ and it comes under the Internet layer.    \nThe receiver section (Rx) is to\
    \ take care of the agriculture field information which is stored in the \ncloud\
    \ server repository (IoT-cloud) with the help of IoT security like API key (Application\
    \ \nProgramming Interface). So that data access from the cloud repository through\
    \ preconfigured \ndevices like mobile phones, laptops, and so forth. The accessing\
    \ layer is responsible for access \nthe data from the cloud through a farmer’s\
    \ mobile phone regarding agriculture data. The \napplication layer is built to\
    \ do completely automatic visualization through graphical \nrepresentation, monitoring\
    \ for real-time applications, and statistical analysis for data. IoT cloud \n\
    itself data storage and data analysis is done in it. By using some of the machine\
    \ learning \nalgorithms are used in IoT applications for data analysis. Finally,\
    \ IoT cloud platforms are \nproviding cloud services for data storage and analysis.\
    \ These cloud platforms are associated with \nthe architecture of IoT for providing\
    \ cloud services. \n \n \n \n \nFig. 4 Proposed architecture for the smart agriculture\
    \ decision-making system \n \n \nFig. 5 Wireless connection between AWMU to WAMU\
    \ architecture \n4.1 Agriculture Wireless Monitoring Unit (AWMU) \nAgriculture\
    \ Wireless Monitoring Unit (AWMU) is deployed in the field of agriculture. It\
    \ consists \nof environment sensors, agriculture sensors, hardware platform (Arduino),\
    \ energy harvesting \ncapability circuit for power supply, and wireless transmitter\
    \ module (NRF24L01). The sensors \nlike DHT11 (temperature and humidity sensor),\
    \ soil temperature, soil moisture sensors, and \nNRF24L01-Tx module are connected\
    \ to the microcontroller. The AWMU has transmitted the \ninformation to other\
    \ devices through wireless communication over a network with good internet \n\
    connectivity. In the agriculture field, each AWMU is communicated through Wi-Fi\
    \ connectivity. \nFinally, the filed information is sent through the IoT gateway\
    \ from AWMU to the receiver \nmodule.  \n4.2 Wireless Actuator Monitoring Unit\
    \ (WAMU) \nWireless Actuator Monitoring Unit (WAMU) is deployed in the field of\
    \ agriculture. It has 4 \nmodules such as 1. Relay module 2. Motor module 3. LED’s\
    \ indicator module 4. NRF24L01-Rx \nmodule and hardware platform (Arduino Uno),\
    \ energy harvesting capability circuit for power \nsupply. Based on sensor data,\
    \ which is coming from the AWMU then actuators are responded \naccordingly through\
    \ wireless communication over a network. Once it reaches the field \ninformation\
    \ to WAMU and it again sends to the server or cloud. In the agriculture field,\
    \ the \nWAMU is communicated through wireless communication connectivity to the\
    \ cloud. \n \n4.3 Field Estimation for Deployment Sensors  \nThe proposed system\
    \ consists of environment and deployment sensors that are employing in the \n\
    agriculture field and each sensor covers the different coverage area. To achieve\
    \ [30] the better \nconnectivity means more coverage area (above 1 acre) with\
    \ no data loss and long-range \ncommunication as shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7. And\
    \ also if the length (L) of the sub-field is low \nthen received sensor data is\
    \ more accurate, which means rises monitoring of agriculture field and \nreducing\
    \ the cost-effective of sensor deployment. So total agriculture field is dividing\
    \ into five \nsub-fields based on wireless connectivity of sensors in Eq. 1 and\
    \ each sub-field is having three \nAgriculture Wireless Monitoring Nodes (AWMN).\
    \ And also each AWMN contains 4 sensors \nthat are deployed in the agriculture\
    \ field. So that number of sensors selected in a particular \nagriculture sub-field\
    \ for coverage connectivity in Eq. 2.   \n \n  \n \n \n \n       (1) \n \n \n\

    \ \nHeat Index (HI) is defined as the combination of air temperature (T) and air\
    \ humidity (H) values \nto regulate the equivalent temperature experienced by\
    \ plants or crops. In this process, the DHT11 \nsensor is connected to a microcontroller\
    \ (Arduino Uno) and it gives the sensors values like \ntemperature and humidity\
    \ (Environment parameters). Based on the sensor values, heat index \nmeasurement\
    \ [31] is calculated from Eq. 3 and it is used to good environmental conditions\

    \ \nIn this section, hardware implementation is discussed. The proposed system\
    \ consists of two parts \none is the transmitter part and the other one is the\
    \ receiver part. The transmitter and Receiver \ncircuits are connected wirelessly.\
    \ NRF24L01 module is used for wireless communication. The \nDHT11 sensor, soil\
    \ moisture sensor, soil temperature sensors, and NRF24L01 Transmitter \nmodule\
    \ are connected to the Arduino board at the Transmitter section. The receiver\
    \ circuit \nconsists of an NRF24L01 receiver module and a submersible pump (motor)\
    \ that is connected to \nArduino Uno. The soil moisture and soil temperature sensors\
    \ are deployed in the soil. The data \ncollected by this DHT11 sensor, soil moisture,\
    \ and soil temperature sensors are transmitted to the \nreceiver side circuit.\
    \ Some Threshold value is set at the receiver side microcontroller. If the \n\
    sensor received is below the threshold value then the motor will be in OFF condition\
    \ and if the \nreceived sensor is above the threshold value then the motor will\
    \ be turned ON and automatically \nirrigates the field. So, Depending on the data\
    \ received and threshold values, the submersible \npump (motor) will ON/OFF operations\
    \ accordingly as shown in Fig. 9, Fig. 10, and Fig. 11.  \n \nFig. 9 a demonstration\

    \ in the proposed agriculture \nmonitoring system. There are 2 modes: active and\
    \ low power. The sensor data will be delivered \nto the monitoring system through\
    \ remotely (WAMU) in the agriculture field once every second. \nFor each reading\
    \ consists of sixty four samples, which are sent as packets to the ThingSpeak\
    \ \ncloud platform. The data must be transmitted in 567.6 x10-6 seconds. So, for\
    \ the time being, the \nAWMU will be in a power-saving mode (idle). Because the\
    \ device operates on batteries, this will \nimprove power efficiency. Eq. 4, 5,\

    IoT investigates the agricultural field's quality to increase the crop yields,\
    \ boost efficiency, and \nlower the costs. The proposed Self-Powered, Real-Time,\
    \ NRF24L01 IoT based-cloud enabled \nservice for smart agriculture decision-making\
    \ system contributes to agricultural technology by \nenhancing the monitoring\
    \ and irrigation management schedules on a time-to-time basis. Since it \nis based\

    \ \nAdditionally, the system has some flaws, such as a limited coverage area.\
    \ Incompetence and data \nloss are caused by the surface area of sensors inserted\

    \ municipalities employ the smart city model in large cities to improve the quality\n\
    of life of their residents, utilize local resources efﬁciently, and save operating\
    \ expenses. This model\nincorporates many heterogeneous technologies such as Cyber-Physical\
    \ Systems (CPS), Wireless\nSensor Networks (WSNs), and Cloud Computing (ClCom).\
    \ However, effective networking and\ncommunication protocols are required to provide\
    \ the essential harmonization and control of the many\nsystem mechanisms to achieve\
    \ these crucial goals. The networking requirements and characteristics\nof smart\
    \ city applications (SCAs) are identiﬁed in this study, as well as the networking\
    \ protocols\nthat can be utilized to serve the diverse data trafﬁc ﬂows that are\
    \ required between the dissimilar\nmechanisms. Additionally, we show examples\
    \ of the networking designs of a few smart city systems,\nsuch as smart transport,\
    \ smart building, smart home, smart grid, smart water, pipeline monitoring,\n\
    and control systems.\nKeywords: smart city; IoT applications; networking architectures;\
    \ Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS);\nWireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)\n1. Introduction\n\
    Nowadays, several municipalities implement the smart city model [1] to improve\n\
    the quality of life for their citizens and the efﬁcient use of city resources.\
    \ Intelligent\nservices can decrease operational costs and resource expenditure\
    \ in smart cities. They can\nenhance performance and operations in a wide variety\
    \ of smart city applications (SCAs)\nincluding transportation, healthcare, energy,\
    \ education, and many more. Smart services are\nprovided by various cutting-edge\
    \ technologies supporting the smart city model. Examples\nof these technologies\
    \ include the internet of things (IoT), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs),\nCyber-Physical\
    \ Systems (CPS), Cloud Computing (ClCom), fog computing (FoC), big data\nanalytics,\
    \ and robots.\nIoT is the core technology used in smart cities, bringing plentiful\
    \ human life beneﬁts [2].\nIoT enables the integration of physical objects/smart\
    \ things into urban environments\nwhere innovative services are offered to support\
    \ every activity at any time and from any\nlocation [2]. Things are monitored\
    \ by IoT applications that make direct decisions for their\nefﬁcient management.\
    \ Moreover, things state their conditions, such as battery status and\nfault reporting\
    \ for prognostic maintenance. WSNs offer real-time monitoring of the state\nof\
    \ the infrastructure and resources in a smart city [3]. Wireless sensor devices\
    \ can also\nobtain physical environment information such as temperature. In a\
    \ CPS, the computation,\nnetworking, and physical processes are put together to\
    \ control and monitor the physical\nenvironment of a smart city [4]. In smart\
    \ cities, CPSs are employed to offer practical\nconnections between the virtual\
    \ and physical worlds. Applications for smart cities can\nbe sustained by the\
    \ ClCom paradigm that provides a scalable and affordable platform\nElectronics\

    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n2 of 63\nfor computation and IoT data storage [5].\
    \ FogC offers reduced latency, greater mobility,\nlocation awareness, streaming,\
    \ and real-time response for SCAs [6]. Smart cities have\ndispersed vast numbers\
    \ of sensors, and thus large-scale data processing requires a complex\ninfrastructure.\
    \ Robotics in the cloud can be an effective computing tool for IoT applications\n\
    that require a lot of data processing [7]. To improve the services offered by\
    \ smart cities,\nbig data analytics is employed to generate intelligent and optimal\
    \ temporary and lasting\ndecisions [8].\nThe abovementioned technologies are used\
    \ to implement numerous smart city ser-\nvices [9,10]. For instance, intelligent\
    \ transportation services are applied to improve route\nplanning and avoid jamming\
    \ in city streets. These services can enhance vehicular safety\nand make possible\
    \ self-driving cars. Furthermore, parking services and smart trafﬁc light\ncontrols\
    \ are provided. Smart energy services [10] (e.g., intelligent energy management\n\
    and energy consumption prediction) are used to sustain smart grids and smart buildings.\n\
    These services can also offer improved utilization of renewable energy. Additional\
    \ smart\nservices are engaged in real-time monitoring of bridges, tunnels, water\
    \ networks, train and\nsubway rails, and gas and oil pipelines. Structural health\
    \ monitoring is also feasible using\nsmart services [11]. Last but not least,\
    \ there are smart services that focus on monitoring the\nenvironment, public safety,\
    \ and security of citizens [12].\nAll these smart city services necessitate a\
    \ reliable networking infrastructure to efﬁ-\nciently exchange messages between\
    \ the modules of a smart city system implementing a\nparticular smart service.\
    \ In particular, smart city services need a variety of networking and\ncommunication\
    \ technologies for their completion because they are proposed for dissim-\nilar\
    \ scales. For example, smart services for smart buildings must be implemented\
    \ based\non Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4) or Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1) network protocols.\
    \ On the other\nhand, smart services for the smart grid must be mainly implemented\
    \ using the WiMAX\n(IEEE 802.16) network protocol. From another viewpoint, smart\
    \ city services can exploit\ndissimilar network and communication models and solutions.\n\
    Until now, the networking and communication components of smart city systems have\n\
    received little research attention. To the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive\
    \ survey\nof network architectures and protocols for IoT applications in smart\
    \ cities does not exist\nand is the goal of this study. The communication and\
    \ networking issues involved in smart\ncity systems are examined in this study.\
    \ This paper considers networking technologies,\ntopologies, and communication\
    \ requirements for such systems. It also examines if current\nnetwork protocols\
    \ are appropriate for certain smart city services. This paper surveys recent\n\
    developments in networking architectures to support SCAs. As this is an active\
    \ area, this\npaper is important to support new research in this ﬁeld. The paper\
    \ contributes as follows:\n1.\nIt presents network requirements of the major SCAs\
    \ including intelligent transporta-\ntion, smart buildings, pipeline monitoring\
    \ and control, smart water networks, smart\ngrids, and manufacturing control and\
    \ monitoring.\n2.\nIt reviews networking architectures used for the above applications\
    \ focusing mainly\non the protocols’ suitability.\nThe remainder of this paper\
    \ is structured as follows: Section 2 describes SCAs;\nSection 3 presents network\
    \ requirements and protocols used for important SCAs;\nSections 4 and 5 analyze\
    \ protocols and network architectures for smart grids, smart build-\nings, smart\
    \ water and pipeline network monitoring, and smart transportation; Section 6\n\
    summarizes the paper, while Section 7 provides open research directions; lastly,\
    \ Section 8\nconcludes the paper. Figure 1 provides the layout of the survey.\n\

    \ articles.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n4 of 63\nIn the ﬁrst stage, the search\
    \ process is automatically performed using searching on\npopular academic databases\
    \ such as IEEE explorer, ACM, Wiley, Springer, Science Direct,\nSAGE, and Google\
    \ Scholar. The following search string was deﬁned by adding other\nspellings of\
    \ the main elements to ﬁnd relevant articles. The search string was as follows:\n\
    (“IoT” OR “Internet of Things”) AND (“network architecture” OR “network pro-\n\

    \ OR\n“Artiﬁcial Intelligence”).\nWe found 264 articles from journals, conference\
    \ proceedings, books, and patents.\nThese articles were published between 2013\
    \ and 2023. In the article selection based on the\nquality of the publisher stage,\
    \ the search string was constrained by searching for conference\npapers and journal\
    \ articles of IEEE, ACM, Sage, Wiley, Science Direct, and Springer, in\norder\
    \ to guarantee that only high-quality publications and articles were selected\
    \ for the\nreview. Consequently, 240 articles were selected.\nIn the third stage\
    \ of eliminating the inappropriate articles, a Quality Assessment\nChecklist (QAC)\
    \ based on [13] was developed, wherein those articles emerging from the\ninitial\
    \ search were reﬁned. After reading the abstracts, we eliminated the unrelated\
    \ articles.\nThe entire body of the remaining papers was checked, and those which\
    \ were not related to\nour concerned ﬁeld were also crossed out. After eliminating\
    \ inappropriate articles, only\n226 studies were identiﬁed.\n2. Smart City Applications\n\
    This section discusses the main SCAs used in diverse domains. To understand what\n\
    type of assistance is needed by the networking infrastructures offered for SCAs,\
    \ their\nadvantages and design problems were addressed.\nIn the energy sector,\
    \ SCAs are being used to increase the reliability, efﬁciency, and\nsustainability\
    \ of electric energy generation and distribution in smart grids [14]. A smart\
    \ grid\nis a new power grid system that automatically collects and reacts to available\
    \ information\nabout supplier and consumer behavior. Smart grids use CPS to supply\
    \ self-monitoring and\nsuperior control mechanisms for power generation and consumer\
    \ demand, improving grid\nreliability and efﬁciency. CPS systems are also used\
    \ to manage the process of producing\nrenewable energy from wind turbines [15].\n\
    Certain applications are utilized in smart buildings to monitor and manage energy\n\
    consumption [16]. CPS controls the equipment in the buildings, including the Heating,\n\
    Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems; appliances; and lighting systems.\n\
    Different kinds of sensor nodes, which keep track of the current state of the\
    \ environment\nand energy consumption, are typically included in smart building\
    \ systems. A centralized\nmonitoring and control system receives observations\
    \ and measurements from these sensors.\nBased on reported observations, current\
    \ operational circumstances, and environmental\nfactors, the control system employs\
    \ intelligent algorithms to manage the sub-systems\nemployed in the buildings\
    \ to optimize energy consumption.\nIntelligent transportation is another SCA that\
    \ has attracted a lot of interest in the\ntransportation sector. Applications\
    \ related to vehicle safety are among the most crucial\ntypes of such applications.\
    \ Vehicles can be equipped with a variety of safety features,\nsuch as blind spot\
    \ monitoring, emergency braking, collision avoidance systems, and lane\nchange\
    \ warning signs. To improve driving safety, these applications offer full or semi-\n\
    automatic operations. Real-time and reliability support in detection and response\
    \ are these\napplications’ most crucial characteristics. Applications for enhancing\
    \ vehicle safety must\nbe dependable and able to operate in real-time in all aspects\
    \ such as threat observations,\ndecision making, communication, and actions. However,\
    \ the software cannot handle\nhigh levels of incorporation across all the relevant\
    \ devices and guarantee real-time and\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n5 of 63\ntrustworthy\
    \ replies. Furthermore, self-driving vehicles are regarded as crucial SCAs [17].\n\
    They combine all the aforementioned capabilities with vision and monitoring equipment\n\

    \ intelligent\nsoftware that evaluates and reacts to these data in real-time.\
    \ Intelligent trafﬁc light controls,\nwhich incorporate device monitoring across\
    \ numerous locations to precisely forecast trafﬁc\npatterns, are another application\
    \ of intelligent transportation. The authors of [18] present\nan example of intelligent\

    observations, decision making, communication, and actions. However, the software\
    \ \ncannot handle high levels of incorporation across all the relevant devices\
    \ and guarantee \nreal-time and trustworthy replies. Furthermore, self-driving\
    \ vehicles are regarded as \ncrucial SCAs [17]. They combine all the aforementioned\
    \ capabilities with vision and \nmonitoring equipment to provide the vehicle the\
    \ ability to traverse the roads using \nsensed data and intelligent software that\
    \ evaluates and reacts to these data in real-time. \nIntelligent traffic light\
    \ controls, which incorporate device monitoring across numerous \nlocations to\
    \ precisely forecast traffic patterns, are another application of intelligent\
    \ \ntransportation. The authors of [18] present an example of intelligent traffic\

    \ the physical \nhealth of users [25]. \nFigure 2 shows some important applications\
    \ including smart traffic surveillance and \nmanagement, smart healthcare, weather\

    \ networking and communication amongst SCAs.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n6 of\
    \ 63\nAnalysis of Smart City Applications/Systems\nThis subsection analyses the\
    \ SCAs shown in Figure 2.\nSmart Trafﬁc Surveillance Systems: These systems are\
    \ based on centralized pro-\ncesses and may fail due to networking problems. Thus,\
    \ to automate such an innova-\ntive system, centralized and distributed methods\
    \ must be used to maintain local servers.\nJavaid et al. [26] suggested a smart\
    \ trafﬁc management system using a mixture of central-\nized and decentralized\
    \ processes to optimize the ﬂow of vehicles on roads and an algorithm\nto manage\
    \ a variety of trafﬁc conditions efﬁciently. In the context of smart cities, effec-\n\
    tive trafﬁc management implies that a decision-making model identiﬁes and quantiﬁes\n\
    trafﬁc congestion as well as predicts trafﬁc patterns. Afrin and Yodo [27] offered\
    \ a theoreti-\ncal analysis that takes into account such effective trafﬁc management.\
    \ Notably, existing\ndecision-making models are primarily devoted to urban and\
    \ highway trafﬁc management,\nnot considering the closed campuses and collector\
    \ roads scenarios. Sarrab et al. [28] iden-\ntiﬁed this weakness and proposed\
    \ an IoT-based system model that collects, processes,\nand stores real-time trafﬁc\
    \ data for such an unusual scenario. In an IoT-based trafﬁc man-\nagement system,\
    \ various challenges emerge. These challenges include security issues,\nextremely\
    \ sophisticated networking equipment, network overhead, required adjustments,\n\
    and speciﬁc information ﬁelds in the protocol header and structure, as well as\
    \ higher costs.\nSmart Healthcare Systems: For real-time monitoring of health\
    \ parameters, these sys-\ntems are progressively being associated with and connected\
    \ via the Internet to numerous\ntypes of available smart wearable sensing and\
    \ computing devices. These systems face\nseveral problems [29] that must be resolved.\
    \ A security/privacy perspective, inter-realm au-\nthentication, interoperability\
    \ issues, device-to-device informal communication, and collec-\ntion and management\
    \ of medical data are among the issues on this list. Alromaihi et al. [30]\naddressed\
    \ issues related to cyber-security while using IoT for such applications. They\n\
    sought to examine secure techniques’ deployment and implementation from the perspec-\n\
    tive of preventing and reducing cyber-attacks on IoT devices. Some crucial surveys\
    \ and\nreviews [31,32] on smart healthcare applications tackle the problem of\
    \ integrating IoT\nsystems with any healthcare application particularly.\nWeather\
    \ and Air Quality Monitoring Systems: These systems use environmental\nmonitoring\
    \ stations, which are extremely pricey to acquire and maintain. For example,\n\
    these stations require engineers with specialized skill sets and data analysts.\
    \ Therefore, it is\nimpractical to deploy such monitoring stations densely. Instead,\
    \ they are often deployed\nsparsely, which creates the problem of limited spatial\
    \ resolutions for useful measurements.\nLately, cheap monitoring sensors have\
    \ evolved in the market, signiﬁcantly assisting in\nreﬁning the granularity of\
    \ monitoring [33]. Highlighting the same problem, the authors [33]\nemphasized\
    \ the drawbacks of these inexpensive sensors (particularly with air quality\n\
    monitoring sensors). For instance, these sensors frequently struggle with the\
    \ issue of\ncross-compassions in the presence of multiple ambient pollutants.\
    \ Moreover, these sensors\nare extremely susceptible to unexpected variations\
    \ in humidity, temperature, and wind\ndirection, and as a result, their accuracy\
    \ deteriorates with time. A recalibration routine\nmight be a way to maintain\
    \ and enhance such accuracy. However, because it would take\na lot more time and\
    \ work, this technique is highly improbable and would not work for\nlarge-scale\
    \ deployments. In a weather monitoring system, the monitoring is highly complex\n\
    and involves three steps [34]:\n(1)\nObserving: It can be performed by monitoring\
    \ satellite imagery, precipitation reports,\nsurface data, and gathering data\
    \ from other nearby forecasters.\n(2)\nForecasting: It can be performed by forecasters\
    \ as short-term and long-term forecasting.\nShort-term forecasting is carried\
    \ out by evaluating the current weather conditions\nand projecting them over the\
    \ next few hours using knowledge of the mechanics\nof the weather. Long-term forecasting,\
    \ however, is possible through weather (nu-\nmerical) modeling and the projection\
    \ of such modeling using computer simulations.\nTo produce these simulations for\
    \ future forecasting, these modeling techniques use\nenvironmental data from satellite\
    \ photography, weather balloons, and surface ob-\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n\
    7 of 63\nservations. Following completion of the forecasting, the forecasters\
    \ translate the\nproduced simulated expected output into a perceptible format\
    \ for non-specialists so\nthat they can respond appropriately.\n(3)\nCommunicating:\
    \ Finally, they communicate such output or forecasted information to\nappropriate\
    \ authorities.\nDespite the fact that all of these computer models are used to\
    \ forecast the weather, the\nsuccess of each one is largely inﬂuenced by three\
    \ different elements: (a) the quantity of\nprecise data; (b) the length of time\
    \ needed to analyze that data; and (c) the complexity of\ndynamic atmospheric\
    \ weather events. A large part of collecting accurate data for a region\nis the\
    \ placement of weather stations. They may occasionally be stationed distant from\
    \ rural\nareas in a city area. Because of this, they are unable to gather enough\
    \ information for desert,\nsea, or even rural areas to supply the computer models\
    \ used to predict weather conditions\naccurately. Forecasters also use satellite\
    \ data to combat this issue. However, because\nof cloud cover and signiﬁcant changes\
    \ in the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere,\nsatellite data accuracy can\
    \ occasionally be unreliable. Moreover, the topographic image and\nmap information\
    \ or surface/land features change substantially in a shorter area. Hence,\nit\
    \ further impacts temperature and precipitation values signiﬁcantly. This further\
    \ makes\nthings harder for a computer model to predict accurately. Hence, there\
    \ is a need to re-\nevaluate and re-modify such models’ mathematical equations\
    \ so that they can predict the\nchanges more accurately.\nSmart Waste Management\
    \ Systems: Automated smart waste management is crucial for\nthe following reasons:\
    \ (1) due to a lack of waste disposal infrastructure; (2) thin or delicate\nwaste\
    \ collection methods being required; (3) lack of effective waste logistics management;\n\
    (4) insufﬁcient use of cutting-edge trash treatment and recycling technologies;\
    \ and (5) lack\nof workers and specialists with the necessary technical and non-technical\
    \ skills to handle\ngarbage disposal and the associated infrastructures. Smart\
    \ waste management schemes\ninclude various steps such as (1) waste collection;\
    \ (2) differentiation of waste as per their\nbiological and physical properties;\
    \ (3) storage; (4) transportation of waste into garbage\ndisposal infrastructures/treatment\
    \ plants; and (5) waste treatment and disposal. Sosunova\nand Porras [35] identiﬁed\
    \ issues and challenges while collecting and analyzing data from\nsmart deployed\
    \ sensors on garbage bins. Their study investigated some operational issues\n\
    such as the management of waste vehicles and urban infrastructure and smartly\
    \ managing\nwaste vehicle routes.\nSmart Street Lighting Systems: This system\
    \ is a network-oriented solution that uses\nstreetlights ﬁtted with speciﬁc actuators\
    \ and sensors, implying a wide range of facilities\nand connectivity interfaces\
    \ [36]. The street lighting application (described in [37]) has a\nmechanism that\
    \ gathers or monitors environmental data and then evaluates street lighting\n\
    with the use of smart wireless nodes (ﬁtted out with numerous forms of sensors\
    \ and\nactuators). These smart nodes are mounted atop the towers that hold the\
    \ streetlights, and\nthey are connected to the Internet by way of a gateway device.\
    \ Zanella et al. [37] insist\nthat their system could assist in gathering environmental\
    \ parameters such as humidity, air\ntemperature, and CO level. Moreover, the authors\
    \ stated that optimizing street lighting\nefﬁciency is a paramount concern that\
    \ must be addressed. This monitoring system makes\nit possible to maximize efﬁciency\
    \ since it allows for the adjustment of streetlamp intensity\nin response to the\
    \ time of day, the presence of people, and the weather. Although this\nsystem\
    \ is simple and built on the IoT concept, it will inevitably contain crucial concerns\
    \ that\nrequire particular attention, such as complicated networking solutions\
    \ and communication\namong heterogeneous devices. However, selecting the right\
    \ light lamp is critical for a\npower-efﬁcient lighting mechanism. Their selection\
    \ is based on how effective they are in\nterms of power usage and lifespan. The\
    \ existing metropolitan system relies on Metal Halide\n(MH) or High-Pressure Sodium\
    \ (HPS) bulbs. Unlike LEDs, these bulbs are frequently seen\nas being inefﬁcient\
    \ in terms of power consumption and requiring signiﬁcant maintenance,\nwhich adds\
    \ signiﬁcantly to the cost. In addition, the system should be designed following\n\
    the advised design standards (it must adhere to the current standard CEN/TR 13201)\
    \ [36].\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n8 of 63\nCurrently, there are three kinds\
    \ of control systems for smart lighting systems in use:\ncentralized, decentralized,\
    \ and hybrid. Nevertheless, these systems are susceptible to a\nvariety of security\
    \ assaults. Moreover, not much effort has been made into this problem\nthus far.\n\
    Smart Emergency Response Systems: Such a system ensures the safety and security\
    \ of\nits residents. It can be utilized for crime detection and prevention, dealing\
    \ with natural\ncalamities and accidents, and law enforcement [38]. Data collection\
    \ is ﬁrst and foremost\nimportant for the designing portion of these applications.\
    \ Depending on the gathered\nfacts, the development of intelligence (which aids\
    \ in making important decisions) and the\nability to respond swiftly and quickly\
    \ are the issues that require special attention. When\nit comes to gathering data,\
    \ we can make use of CCTV cameras and sophisticated trafﬁc\nsensors. A developer\
    \ can create and put into action a crucial learning scheme that will\nconduct\
    \ predictive analysis and gather intelligence on top of the data gathered. Therefore,\n\
    this kind of predictive analysis has the potential to gather signiﬁcant information\
    \ that\nwill help the relevant authorities (e.g., the ﬁre safety department, the\
    \ police department,\nand law enforcement agencies) take the proper security and\
    \ preventive measures. The\nconcept of widespread surveillance has important beneﬁts\
    \ for security and safety. However,\nkeeping track of such vast amounts of data\
    \ also prompts a lot of worries and issues for\ndesigners and developers, including\
    \ storage; the effectiveness of learning algorithms; and,\nmost importantly, the\
    \ question of whether it is morally right or acceptable to keep track\nof each\
    \ individual (a privacy issue). In addition, a very important point is whether\
    \ this\nkind of widespread surveillance is feasible, especially for nations such\
    \ as China and India,\nwhere a city’s population can exceed that of a whole nation.\
    \ Further, Gharaibeh et al. [38]\nclaimed that combining information transmission\
    \ technologies with well-implemented\ndata analytics models is necessary for quick\
    \ and swift collaboration. To save as many lives\nas possible during natural disasters,\
    \ it is imperative to gather, assess, and communicate\nvital information to the\
    \ relevant authorities. As a result, there is currently a lot of work\nbeing done\
    \ to enhance the performance of information exchange systems. Although this\n\
    system is based on the IoT concept and is relatively simple, it faces important\
    \ problems\nthat need consideration, such as complex networking solutions and\
    \ information sharing\nacross heterogeneous devices on time (time-sensitive application).\n\
    Smart Residence/Home Automation: A smart home has highly developed systems\nsuch\
    \ as a control system for devices or objects (such as fans, lights, music systems,\
    \ TVs,\nand other smart appliances), automated door openers, smart appliances\
    \ that may send\nusers remote status updates, smart refrigerators, and washing\
    \ machines. A user can control\nthe majority of smart home appliances remotely\
    \ with two recently produced gadgets:\nGoogle Home and Amazon Echo. In a smart\
    \ home, the end-user demands a high-speed\ninternet connection, so they can access\
    \ networking sites that control the home with HD live\nstreaming services. In\
    \ contrast, a smart healthcare application needs safe connections to\ncomputing\
    \ servers in the cloud for managing sensitive private information. Hence, data\n\
    management systems must address a crucial issue, namely, the necessity to concentrate\n\
    on data distribution based on various end-user categories rather than just recommending\n\
    distinct data distribution among various end-user groups [38]. The concept of\
    \ smart home\nautomation raises serious concerns about security and privacy risks.\
    \ A smart home includes\nsecurity monitoring systems with motion sensors, wirelessly\
    \ opening smart door locks,\ntelevisions, phones, and other smart appliances that\
    \ are highly outﬁtted with cameras and\nmicrophones. Although these gadgets improve\
    \ the system, little research has been done on\ntheir privacy and security features.\
    \ If we conduct a thorough analysis of these gadgets, we\nwill discover that their\
    \ manufacturers offer either very few or no security features at all.\nIndeed,\
    \ Fernandes et al. [39] provided their eye-opening views after carefully examining\n\
    Samsung’s SmartThings framework (programming) and their SmartApps market. They\n\
    argued that more than 50%—exactly 55%—of these smart applications are already\
    \ more\nprivileged by default and as a result, do not need to access unrelated\
    \ applications. As a\nresult, hackers can use them with ease. Apart from this,\
    \ according to a published document\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n9 of 63\nby WikiLeaks\
    \ [40], the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has all the tools to access, control,\n\
    and hack these smart home applications anywhere in the world. Furthermore, criminal\n\
    entities and hackers could seize control of smart personal devices, capture delicate\
    \ private\ninformation, and exploit that information immorally typically through\
    \ user tracking and\nproﬁling. Additionally, a hacker may break into one of these\
    \ smart applications, grab vital\ninformation, and then use it to launch any kind\
    \ of attack. For instance, based on motion\nsensors, security camera feeds, and\
    \ power usage patterns, a burglar can determine where\nand when to break into\
    \ the house. By locating the authentication credentials of authorized\nparties,\
    \ they can compromise smart door locks [41]. Better security-aware hardware and\n\
    software (as well as the related common standards) must be developed to safeguard\
    \ against\nall these attempts so that high-tech appliances, sensors, actuators,\
    \ etc., are impervious to\nsuch security and privacy attacks.\nSmart Grid Networks:\
    \ The functionality of the traditional electricity grid is unidirec-\ntional (i.e.,\
    \ electricity is transmitted from electricity-producing sources to end-customers).\n\
    Electricity has been moving from power plants to users in a single direction thanks\
    \ to\nthe deployment of electricity grids. The existing grid system operates in\
    \ an open-loop\nfashion since there are not any adequate communication infrastructures\
    \ in the distribution\nsector. Moreover, the main distribution center has little\
    \ or no real-time knowledge of the\nsystem’s operating conditions and dynamically\
    \ changing load. There are also several tech-\nnical, economic, and environmental\
    \ problems with this conventional approach. Therefore,\nthis conventional system\
    \ must become dependable, manageable, and scalable, as well as\nﬂexible, secure,\
    \ and interoperable [42].\nThe smart grid is the next invention of the Electric\
    \ Power System (EPS) that incor-\nporates quicker, more secure, and reliable communication\
    \ networks [43]. Smart grids\nsupplement the conventional electricity grid by\
    \ incorporating renewable energy sources\nsuch as biomass, solar energy, and wind\
    \ energy. These energy sources are much cleaner\nand more ecologically friendly\
    \ than non-renewable energy sources such as fossil fuels.\nHowever, it is important\
    \ to identify the most suitable communication technology for the\nsmart grid’s\
    \ successful implementation and deployment. The smart grid’s overall commu-\n\
    nication style is unique compared with conventional network communication patterns.\
    \ The\ncommunication network architecture of the smart grid must be able to handle\
    \ information\nexchange between sensors, actuators, smart electronic devices,\
    \ and numerous smart meters\nin such a particular environment with little to no\
    \ human intervention. This type of com-\nmunication, called Device-to-Device (D2D)\
    \ communication, is autonomous and may be\ninitiated in response to an event or\
    \ at regular intervals. Notably, depending on how these\nsmart grid applications\
    \ were built, their QoS requirements and characteristics differ greatly\nin terms\
    \ of delay, burst size, and packet arrival rate. For example, the latency requirement\n\
    of a smart meter event and a substation event are quite different [44]. In intelligent\
    \ grid\nnetworks, the monitoring, managing, and controlling functions inside the\
    \ same network\npresent the issues of ﬂexible QoS differentiation. Moreover, applications\
    \ based on the smart\ngrid can be developed and implemented using the current\
    \ wireless and wired networking\ninfrastructure and technologies. For some devices,\
    \ such as smart meters, designing and\nstandardizing acceptable smart grid-based\
    \ protocols is a critical matter [45]. Furthermore,\nthese smart grid-based networks\
    \ are too dependent on intelligent sensors, actuators, and\nother devices. This\
    \ makes them extremely vulnerable to attacks by malicious users. These\nsmart\
    \ grids could be taken over by malevolent users or hackers, who could then obtain\n\
    unauthorized access to many smart meters and alter crucial data. Moreover, as\
    \ the existing\nelectricity system is insufﬁcient for establishing smart grid\
    \ systems, high-level adjustments\nto current power infrastructure scenarios are\
    \ required. Subsequently, these smart systems\nrequire high installation costs\
    \ because the installation requires a large number of smart\nmeters, sensors,\
    \ and actuators for sensing and data collection [46]. The efﬁcient operation of\n\
    such a smart grid system also necessitates a dependable, consistent, and error-free\
    \ network\nchannel. Therefore, it will be challenging for developers of such intelligent\
    \ applications.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n10 of 63\nMany surveys [42–45,47]\
    \ reviewed communication frameworks for smart grids, smart-\ngrid-based networking\
    \ technologies, trafﬁc management, and the requirements of numer-\nous smart grid\
    \ applications. Further, Kansal and Bose [48] presented their insights on\ntransmission\
    \ grid applications regarding their latency and bandwidth requirements.\n3. Network\
    \ Requirements for SCAs\nThis section considers several communication requirements\
    \ including reliability, delay\ntolerance, bandwidth, power consumption, security,\
    \ network type, heterogeneous network\nsupport, and mobility support. It also\
    \ studies the aptness of different network protocols for\ndissimilar SCAs.\nSmart\
    \ city services and applications need robust and dependable communication\nsupport\
    \ as well as an effective networking infrastructure, which will permit competent\n\
    message-sharing procedures among the components of the smart city systems [49].\
    \ Every\nsmart city system has an intricate networking architecture made up of\
    \ various networking\ncomponents. Therefore, smart city systems are innately required\
    \ to have a variety of net-\nworking requirements. To access the far-off destination,\
    \ which may be clouds, the network\ntrafﬁc from a broad variety of deployed diverse\
    \ applications uses a common networking\narchitecture and resources. These resources\
    \ may consist of switches, routers, communica-\ntion connections (links), and\
    \ other forms of network middle-boxes. The idea of accessing\nfaraway clouds or\
    \ far-off destinations or remotely distributed apps consequently brings\nup problems\
    \ with high packet loss probability, signiﬁcant delay, and constrained network\n\
    bandwidth. In addition, security is a serious issue that must be considered when\
    \ develop-\ning, implementing, and deploying intelligent applications for smart\
    \ cities. Otherwise, users\nwould be reluctant to approve the use of such applications\
    \ in the absence of adequate secu-\nrity safeguards. Such intelligent applications\
    \ need a high-speed networking environment\nwhere the quick reaction may be managed\
    \ with the support of the ability of a fast-processing\nspeed. Furthermore, a\
    \ variety of apps can be implemented in the context of a smart city,\nbased on\
    \ their usefulness and relevance to the users. These applications, however, have\n\
    different networking requirements, particularly in terms of response and security\
    \ [50]. For\nexample, the networking requirements of smart emergency response\
    \ systems are quite\ndifferent compared to other applications such as smart healthcare\
    \ systems. Emergency\nresponse smart systems must be exceedingly secure and quick\
    \ to react [50]. In contrast,\nsmart-healthcare-based systems or apps do not necessarily\
    \ need to be especially dynamic.\n−\nNetwork Protocols: Monitoring applications\
    \ for smart cities often use a dense network\nof heterogeneous sensor nodes, including\
    \ ﬁxed sensor nodes, mobile sensor nodes,\nand crowd sensing nodes. Long-Term\
    \ Evolution (LTE) [51], LTE for Machines (LTE-M),\nextended coverage GSM IoT,\
    \ and ﬁfth-generation (5G) technologies [52] are intriguing\noptions to support\
    \ such heterogeneous networks. First, the bulk of crowd-sensing\nnodes (smartphones)\
    \ is already supported by LTE communications. Consequently, no\nfurther wireless\
    \ communication devices are required. To save energy, LTE and 5G can\nbe utilized\
    \ on the sink nodes (also known as cluster heads) to allow the data gathered\n\
    by the sink nodes to be transmitted to the monitoring center via base stations\
    \ (the\nbackbone network), as opposed to multihop relaying.\n−\nZigbee [53], WiFi,\
    \ and Bluetooth can still be used for the traditional stationary nodes\nto communicate\
    \ within clusters. This layout has the advantage of allowing the sensor\nnode\
    \ clusters to be separated from one another while maintaining network connectiv-\n\
    ity. Additionally, the moderate number of nodes in each cluster makes maintenance\n\
    simpler. In addition to supporting larger networks, LTE and 5G technologies also\
    \ make\npossible sensor nodes with faster data rates, improving the performance\
    \ of real-time\nmonitoring [54]. Applications for crowd sensing, for instance,\
    \ can accommodate video\nstreams taken by cameras on smartphones or moving vehicles.\
    \ The fast data rates\nprovided by LTE and 5G can potentially be advantageous\
    \ for the sink nodes or clusters.\nThe use of vibration data (accelerometer readings)\
    \ in structural health monitoring\napplications of bridges, tunnels, or towers\
    \ is fairly common. The cluster heads will be\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n11\
    \ of 63\nable to send the vibration data in this situation in real time. In conclusion,\
    \ practically\nall applications for smart city monitoring that demand a high data\
    \ throughput and\nminimal delay may be satisﬁed by LTE and 5G. Additionally, there\
    \ are some new\nsensor node standards, such as IEEE 802.11ah [55], LoRaWAN [56],\
    \ and Narrowband-\nIoT (NB-IoT) [57]. These narrowband protocols offer numerous\
    \ advantages: greater\ncoverage, improved scalability, reduced energy usage, and\
    \ increased device longevity.\nResearchers have tested these standards in more\
    \ than a few applications, including\nstreet lighting, energy metering, and home\
    \ automation, even though some are still\nbeing discussed and revised. The new\
    \ narrowband communication standards enable\nthe sensor nodes to run more sustainably,\
    \ which is beneﬁcial for applications that\naim for long-term monitoring. In addition\
    \ to these protocols and standards, the FogC\narchitecture [58] aids in monitoring\
    \ smart cities. In such an architecture, the mobile\nusers (the potential crowd-sensing\
    \ providers) and the cloud are connected via fog\nservers. These fog servers are\
    \ WiFi access points or cellular base stations. Mobile users\nare more inclined\
    \ to participate in sensing since they may upload their crowd-sensing\nmeasurements\
    \ to the fog server in just one hop, signiﬁcantly decreasing the cost and\nenergy\
    \ usage compared to cellular networks. As a result, such an architecture can give\n\
    us better sensing coverage. Using the measurements from the mobile users and the\n\
    WSNs, the fog servers can perform some basic regional estimation based on the\
    \ FogC\narchitecture, such as the nearby trafﬁc conditions. The service latency\
    \ and response\ntime are then decreased because mobile users can access such estimates\
    \ directly from\nthe fog servers rather than from a remote cloud through a backbone\
    \ network. Lastly,\nusing the appropriate networking protocols for each SCA is\
    \ crucial to getting the\nbest possible trade-off between delay, energy use, and\
    \ cost. The networks may be\nhierarchical so that diverse roles and functions\
    \ can be assigned at various layers to\nincrease the networks’ dependability and\
    \ cost-effectiveness. As a result, certain nodes\nmay be able to transmit data\
    \ utilizing various protocols.\n−\nBandwidth requirements: Many video applications\
    \ in smart cities require high band-\nwidth [59]. In these applications, sensors\
    \ capture video from the physical environment.\nMoreover, video transmission is\
    \ more bandwidth-hungry than the conventional scalar\ndata trafﬁc in IoT. Examples\
    \ of these applications are intelligent multimedia surveil-\nlance systems for\
    \ home monitoring, multimedia-based industrial monitoring systems,\ntrafﬁc monitoring\
    \ systems for road safety, and remote multimedia-based monitoring\nof an environmental\
    \ system.\n−\nDelay Tolerance: Some SCAs, such as smart transportation, only tolerate\
    \ a small\namount of end-to-end delay. For example, to prevent imminent danger\
    \ to the ve-\nhicle or potentially fatal crashes, the data that are being relayed\
    \ must arrive within\nmicroseconds. Therefore, the control systems must react\
    \ in time. However, other\napplications have a higher tolerance for delays [49].\
    \ Such applications rely on data\nmonitoring and information gathering for upcoming\
    \ analysis.\n−\nPower Consumption: Another crucial need for applications is power\
    \ consumption.\nSmart grid systems and other applications with local high-energy\
    \ sources can tolerate\nprotocols with higher energy expenditure levels [45].\
    \ Other applications have medium\npower needs and require energy sources with\
    \ limited capacities. One example of such\nan application is intelligent transportation.\
    \ Other applications demand protocols with\nlow or very low energy consumption\
    \ characteristics since they have limited energy\nresources. Unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ (UAVs), smart water networks, and pipeline\nmonitoring for gas and oil are a\
    \ few examples of such uses.\n−\nReliability: The majority of applications have\
    \ medium reliability requirements. A\ntypical example of such applications is\
    \ smart water networks. Some other applications\nhave high-reliability necessities\
    \ such as intelligent transportation and smart grids [49].\n−\nSecurity: The majority\
    \ of applications need medium to high security. Applications\nsuch as production\
    \ control and monitoring, for instance, need medium security, whilst\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n12 of 63\nothers, such as smart grids, need high security because\
    \ of the sensitivity of the data\nand the importance of the operations carried\
    \ out [50].\n−\nHeterogeneity of network protocols: The majority of smart city\
    \ systems use network-\ning protocols that link the system’s parts together. Intelligent\
    \ transportation and smart\nbuildings are two examples of such systems. These\
    \ protocols must coexist in such\nsituations without conﬂicting with one another.\
    \ To ensure seamless and effective\noperation, it is also necessary to correctly\
    \ map the control information in the head-\ners at the various networking stack\
    \ tiers used by the many heterogeneous protocols\nand networks.\n−\nWired/wireless\
    \ connectivity: The majority of SCAs that include wireless connectivity\nare UAVs\
    \ and monitoring of gas and oil pipelines. Others, including intelligent\ntransportation\
    \ and smart buildings, use wired and wireless connectivity [50]. In\nthese situations,\
    \ wired networking may be used for communication within a speciﬁc\nphysical system\
    \ (such as within a UAV), while wireless communication may be used\nto link the\
    \ physical system to other such systems that are comparable to it or to the\n\
    backbone and infrastructure networks.\n−\nMobility: Some systems, such as the\
    \ smart grid, pipeline monitoring for gas and oil,\nand smart water networks,\
    \ have low to medium mobility [50]. Other systems, such\nas UAVs and intelligent\
    \ transportation, are quite mobile. Medium- to high-mobility\nsmart city systems\
    \ can be connected if the networking protocols are reliable and\nadaptable to\
    \ node mobility without using up a large amount of bandwidth on control\nmessages\
    \ and related processing to react to changes in the network architecture.\nTable\
    \ 1 presents a qualitative comparison of the requirements of some SCAs. Each\n\
    SCA has its own transmission range and is sustained by a heterogeneous network\
    \ with\nlow, medium, or high trafﬁc rates and supporting high or low mobility\
    \ of devices. Each\nSCA is based on different protocols and requires different\
    \ bandwidth and latency tolerance.\nIn each SCA, the number of devices involved\
    \ differs.\nTable 1. Networking aspects and qualitative comparison of SCA requirements.\n\

    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n13 of 63\n3.1. Additional Challenges\n−\nInteroperability:\
    \ Smart city systems are built on several heterogeneous networking\nprotocols\
    \ that use various media access control (MAC) mechanisms at the physi-\ncal and\
    \ data link layers. For the underlying technologies to be integrated seam-\nlessly,\
    \ these protocols must be interoperable [60]. In digital home networks, the IEEE\n\
    1905.1 protocol [61], which was created to offer a convergent interface between\
    \ physi-\ncal/data link layers and the network layer, is aimed to perform this\
    \ function. Future\nresearch should focus on the creation of similar protocols\
    \ to increase the support\nsystem for smart city systems.\n−\nScalability: A smart\
    \ city platform must manage many devices that are connected to\nthe city’s infrastructure.\
    \ Large amounts of city-related data, which are continuously\nproduced and consumed\
    \ by devices and client applications, must be stored and\nprocessed. The platform\
    \ must simultaneously be able to handle hundreds of requests\nfrom users and services\
    \ that rely on it. Thus, the scalability requirements change\ndepending on the\
    \ features of the city as well as the installed applications and services.\nRecently,\
    \ Del Esponte et al. [62] suggested InterSCity, a microservices-based, open-\n\
    source smart city platform that facilitates the collaborative development of large-scale\n\
    systems, apps, and services for smart cities.\n−\nLoad Balancing: To maximize\
    \ the usage of resources, load balancing assigns appro-\npriate resources (i.e.,\
    \ network resources, storage capacity, computational resources,\nand energy resources)\
    \ to user tasks. A large-scale IoT network performs better and\navoids overload\
    \ thanks to an effective load-balancing strategy [63]. Response time,\ncost, throughput,\
    \ performance, and resource usage are all improved in terms of\nQoS parameters.\n\
    −\nThe Cloud/Edge/FogC Paradigms: Cloud, Edge, and FogC facilitate the creation\
    \ of\nsmart city prototypes. These computing paradigms efﬁciently aid in the gathering,\n\
    upkeep, and analysis of city data to pinpoint crucial city-related events that\
    \ demand\nadvanced processing and response [64]. Nonetheless, some IoT applications/systems\n\
    for smart cities have strict processing and delay constraints. These real-time\
    \ applica-\ntions present the greatest obstacles to cloud-based services. Consequently,\
    \ FogC and\nEdge Computing have emerged as viable computing paradigms for designing,\
    \ imple-\nmenting, deploying, and controlling such systems/applications. These\
    \ paradigms\nbring computing resources closer to the IoT/device plane so that\
    \ the primary computa-\ntion can be done locally [65,66]. Each computing paradigm\
    \ offers particular assistance\nbased on the requirements of the application at\
    \ hand. For example, to support a cloud-\nbased SCA, ClCom offers centralized\
    \ storage and processing capacity. For certain\nSCAs, ClCom can offer scalable\
    \ processing power and data storage [5]. The features of\nClCom (e.g., powerful\
    \ processing, massive and scalable data storage, and cutting-edge\nsoftware services)\
    \ can be used to provide various support services for a variety of\nSCAs. ClCom\
    \ can be the primary control and management platform for SCAs. The\ncity’s ClCom\
    \ services can be used to connect various sensors and actuators for SCAs\nto gather,\
    \ process, store, and manage sensor data for various SCAs. Vast volumes\nof data\
    \ are gathered across a smart city, which can eventually become big data. The\n\
    sophisticated platforms required for storing and analyzing this massive amount\
    \ of\ndata to improve operations and planning can be provided by Cloud Computing.\
    \ To\neffectively support SCAs, the communication between city sensors and actuators\
    \ and\nClCom may involve various communication requirements. The network architectures\n\
    used in the smart city should meet these requirements. Smart applications require\n\
    the integration of sensors, actuators, and the cloud, and they can only function\
    \ well\nwith a robust network that offers good communication services linking\
    \ both sides.\nThe fact that cloud services are either provided at a single central\
    \ location or across\nnumerous distributed platforms in various locations is another\
    \ problem that occurs\nwhen adopting ClCom for a smart city. For many cloud applications,\
    \ the distributed\nClCom strategy can offer greater quality and dependability\
    \ support [67]. However,\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n14 of 63\nit is frequently\
    \ necessary to establish effective communication channels between the\ndistributed\
    \ ClCom facilities that are present in various locations. The dependability\n\
    and efﬁciency of the networks linking all components on both sides present another\n\
    problem when using the cloud. There are issues with delays, dropped packets, and\n\
    unstable connections when the Internet is involved. To consider these challenges,\n\
    the SCA architecture must be carefully studied, as must the planning and control\
    \ of\nnetwork resources and communication models. However, some elements cannot\
    \ be\navoided, such as transmission delays. Ksentini et al. [68] investigated\
    \ the QoS require-\nments of many IoT/cloud-enabled applications in a FogC environment\
    \ to recognize\nQoS metrics. The authors introduced a QoS management model (QoS-Fog)\
    \ that is\ninspired by the work of the OpenFog consortium on the reference architecture\
    \ [69] for\na FogC system.\n3.2. Features and Challenges of Smart City Networks\n\
    A smart city network has the following features [70]:\n1.\nLarge Densities: A\
    \ smart city network has a very large density as thousands of smart\ndevices are\
    \ distributed in the area of a city.\n2.\nAbnormal Trafﬁc Patterns: Cascading\
    \ or synchronization among smart devices produces\nextremely bursty or correlated\
    \ trafﬁc patterns. These trafﬁc patterns differ from\nthe regular social-generated\
    \ trafﬁc patterns on which most existing schemes and\ntechnology used in our society\
    \ are based.\n3.\nDisorganized Network Topology: Unlike the widely used wireless\
    \ connectivity features,\nsmart city networks often adhere to a mesh network topology.\
    \ The problem arises\nwhen smart devices communicate across unreliable wireless\
    \ channels, where packet\nlosses caused by wireless channel special properties\
    \ are extremely common and even-\ntually have an impact on the functioning of\
    \ the smart city system. Therefore, it appears\nvery improbable that a single\
    \ high-throughput backbone can be deployable soon.\n4.\nHeterogeneity: SCAs use\
    \ a variety of technologies. In terms of power consumption,\nlatency, throughput,\
    \ and communication ranges, each of these technologies operates\nat a unique trade-off\
    \ threshold. The involved dissimilar technologies must coexist on\na single platform.\n\
    5.\nCoexistence of heterogeneous technologies: Communication technologies used\
    \ in smart\ncities are distributed over the same radio space. At the same time,\
    \ independent radio\ninfrastructures are connected through a variety of wireless\
    \ channels. Under such\ncircumstances, the SCA must handle interference issues\
    \ with competence.\n6.\nSecurity and Privacy: SCAs are extremely vulnerable to\
    \ several risks from malevolent\nusers. The majority of specialized smart sensors,\
    \ actuators, and other intelligent\ndevices are developed by designers without\
    \ considering security measures. Such\napplications may be highly vulnerable due\
    \ to hostile actors’ ease of access to these\ncutting-edge technologies and potential\
    \ threats to people’s security and privacy.\nThe main challenges for smart city\
    \ networks are as follows [70]:\n•\nLack of Standardization Solutions: The IEEE\
    \ 802.15.1 Bluetooth technologies for Personal\nArea Networks (PANs) and the IEEE\
    \ 802.11 groups for wireless LANs adopt the\nconcept of single-hop ad-hoc networking.\
    \ These standards permit direct communi-\ncation between two devices that are\
    \ in the transmission range of each other. At the\nsame time, the multi-hop ad-hoc\
    \ networking paradigm enables the communication\nbetween any two devices which\
    \ are not necessarily in their transmission range [71]. A\nproblem that researchers\
    \ must consider is how these intricate heterogeneous sets of\ndevices (i.e., actuators,\
    \ sensors, and other smart devices) can communicate uniformly\nwithout any standardization.\
    \ Global distributors and manufacturers must propose\nand accept standardized\
    \ network solutions that enable communication between di-\nverse devices on homogeneous\
    \ communication entities. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard\nis the dominant solution\
    \ that presents a sophisticated version of the Physical Layer.\nThis standard\
    \ deals with the trade-off between data rate, communication range, and\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n15 of 63\npower consumption. Several revisions or amendments\
    \ (i.e., IEEE 802.15.4g and IEEE\n802.15.4e) aimed at the SCA have just been released.\
    \ The IEEE 802.15.4g amendment\nallows for a redesigned physical layer, allowing\
    \ data rates and communication ranges\ncompatible with neighborhood mesh (wide)\
    \ networks. Then, it is followed by another\ncutting-edge modiﬁcation, known as\
    \ IEEE 802.15.4e, which modiﬁes and enhances\nthe method used by devices to access\
    \ wireless channels while also using time-slotted\nchannel hopping mode. This\
    \ hopping mode further delivers low-power consumption\nand improved dependability.\
    \ From another viewpoint, many researchers customized\nappropriate upper-layer\
    \ protocols (i.e., the Internet Layer). They made the necessary\nmodiﬁcations\
    \ there to make smart applications compatible with conventional infras-\ntructure.\
    \ Since the network of low-power smart devices is conﬁned, the researchers\ndeveloped\
    \ numerous adjustments to the Internet protocols to make them easily adapt-\n\
    able. For example, the most notable IETF projects are RPL [72] and 6LoWPAN [73],\n\
    which greatly aid in creating and adapting smart city scenarios.\n•\nInterference\
    \ problem: Sophisticated technologies that are spread across the same radio\n\
    space and independent radio infrastructures are linked via a range of wireless\
    \ channels.\nBecause of this, the smart application must handle interference problems\
    \ in such\nsituations. To share unlicensed bands, numerous networks must cooperate\
    \ and be\ncompatible with one another.\n•\nVertical handover (soft): Multiple\
    \ radios are used by the rapidly expanding number of\nsmart devices being developed.\
    \ These devices should be able to recognize and use the\nbest interface that is\
    \ currently available while balancing power usage and throughput.\n•\nD2D Communications:\
    \ In the IoT context, there are numerous D2D communication de-\nmands. Unfortunately,\
    \ conventional network gateways cannot handle such generated\nmessages from heterogeneous\
    \ devices.\n•\nShort Communicating Messages: Internet-based protocols support\
    \ and recommend\nacceptable performance for longer data packet scenarios. However,\
    \ smart devices\ncommunicate with one another using short messages (since most\
    \ of them are tiny\nand operate over low-powered battery devices). To this end,\
    \ short communicating\nmessages will positively impact network congestion detection\
    \ and avoidance policies\nand promote in-band aggregation.\n•\nLocal Network Trafﬁc\
    \ Pattern: Smartphones and D2D-speciﬁc devices frequently use the\nsame network\
    \ infrastructure. However, most cellular data networks are exclusively\nplanned,\
    \ implemented, deployed, and managed for smartphone usage. Fitting trafﬁc\nfrom\
    \ these heterogeneous devices onto a single platform is now the main challenge\n\
    that cellular data network providers face. It is difﬁcult to integrate the trafﬁc\
    \ from these\ntwo types of heterogeneous devices into the same network infrastructure\
    \ due to several\nintrinsic factors and the speciﬁed features of this traditional\
    \ network. Additionally,\nD2D devices use a more signiﬁcant proportion of scarce\
    \ resources than smartphones,\nunnecessarily creating a problem of unfairness\
    \ in the system [74]. Therefore, we\nmust ﬁrst comprehend D2D trafﬁc patterns\
    \ and how they differ from trafﬁc patterns\ngenerated by smartphones. Understanding\
    \ trafﬁc patterns can provide insights into\nmanaging and allocating shared network\
    \ resources more effectively and guarantee\nthe highest level of service quality\
    \ for both types of devices.\n•\nSecurity mechanisms: Denial of Service (DoS)\
    \ attacks are a remarkable threat to the\nsecurity of smart city networks and\
    \ must be identiﬁed. Some statistical methods\nhave been proposed to solve this\
    \ problem. Such a statistical method is presented\nin [75] that is based on feature\
    \ distance maps that enhance the statistical analysis\nprocess. Another security\
    \ mechanism is authentication, a process of identifying\nusers and devices in\
    \ a network and granting access to authorized persons and non-\nmanipulated devices.\
    \ Authentication is one method to mitigate attacks on the IoT\nsystems such as\
    \ the reply attack, the Man-in-the-Middle attack, the impersonation\nattack, and\
    \ the Sybil attack [76]. To realize end-to-end security, the nodes must be\nencrypted.\
    \ However, due to the heterogeneity of the IoT systems, some nodes might\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n16 of 63\nbe able to embed general-purpose microprocessors for\
    \ this task. In addition, low\nresources and constrained devices can only embed\
    \ application-speciﬁc integrated\ncircuits. Therefore, conventional cryptographic\
    \ primitives are not suitable for low-\nresource smart devices due to their low\
    \ computation power, limited battery life, small\nsize, small memory, and limited\
    \ power supply. As a result, lightweight cryptography\nmay be an efﬁcient encryption\
    \ for these devices. Trust management is another security\nmechanism that detects\
    \ and eliminates malicious nodes and provides secure access\ncontrol. Automated\
    \ and dynamic trust calculations are needed to validate the trust\nvalues of the\
    \ participating nodes in an IoT network. The majority of trust management\nschemes\
    \ focus on detecting malicious nodes; only a few trust-based access control\n\
    methods have been proposed. In fact, with scalability and the large number of\
    \ smart\nthings storing sensitive data, there is an urgent need for automated,\
    \ transparent, and\neasy access control management so that different nodes/users\
    \ can be granted different\nlevels of access. From another perspective, Blockchain\
    \ technology can be used to\ncreate secure virtual zones where things can identify\
    \ and trust each other [77]. Self-\norganization Blockchain Structures (BCS) can\
    \ also be planned to set up the relationship\nbetween Blockchain and IoT, as suggested\
    \ in [78].\n•\nAnomaly Detection in Sensor Systems: The type of data that ﬂow\
    \ through the IoT system\ncan vary to a great extent, in terms of either format,\
    \ shape (in time and space), and\nsemantics. Therefore, the process of separating\
    \ normal from abnormal sensed data is\nextremely demanding. In the context of\
    \ IoT applications, sensors are the real source\nof big data, which suggests that\
    \ anomaly detection at the edge could be a powerful\ntool to address the inevitable\
    \ data communication bottlenecks. Anomaly detection is\nconcerned with identifying\
    \ data patterns that deviate remarkably from the expected\nbehavior. This is critical\
    \ in the process of ﬁnding out important information about\nthe IoT system’s functioning,\
    \ detecting abnormalities that are often rare or difﬁcult\nto model or, otherwise,\
    \ to predict [79]. A timely identiﬁcation of anomalies is vital to\npreventing\
    \ IoT system failure.\n•\nAdvanced Techniques in Smart City Networks: Artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence (AI), machine learn-\ning (ML), and deep reinforcement learning\
    \ (DRL) play a key role in the evolution of the\nsmart city sectors [80]. These\
    \ techniques are now being developed as solutions for com-\npletely automated\
    \ IoT applications. Using these techniques, the optimal analysis of\nthe big data\
    \ is performed to reach an optimal decision. Utilizing DRL/ML approaches\ncan\
    \ improve security; decrease energy consumption; reduce latency; and increase\n\
    precision and accuracy in surveillance, energy management, air quality prediction,\n\
    person detection, trafﬁc management, etc. For example, an intelligent transportation\n\
    system is highly based on ML- and DRL-based techniques to realize self-driving\
    \ vehi-\ncles and guarantee the security of connected vehicles. DRL techniques\
    \ are also used to\nprecisely monitor and estimate the real-time trafﬁc ﬂow data\
    \ in an urban environment.\nIn SGs, big data analytics and thus the aforementioned\
    \ techniques can enhance the\nsafety of power grids, decision-making of power-sharing,\
    \ management, and power\ngrid performance. In particular, SGs are making effective\
    \ use of smart meter big data\nfor different applications such as load assessment\
    \ and prediction, baseline estimation,\ndemand response, load clustering, and\
    \ malicious data deception attacks. In health\nintelligence, extensive use of\
    \ AI, ML, and DRL techniques is implemented due to\nhigh-performance IoT devices,\
    \ Cloud Computing, and an increase in data rates. These\ntechniques can play a\
    \ vital role in disease diagnosis, cure prediction, social media ana-\nlytics\
    \ for a particular disease, and medical imaging [81]. In cyber-security, the role\
    \ of\nAI-, ML-, and DRL-based techniques is also outstanding. These techniques\
    \ can be used\nfrom an advanced security perspective of IoT to confront security\
    \ threats. Notably, the\naccuracy and precision of the aforementioned techniques\
    \ can be further enhanced by\nincreasing the amount of training data to strengthen\
    \ their learning capabilities and\nhence the automated decision efﬁciencies [82].\n\

    with IoT-enabled application protocols and suggested networking architectures\
    \ and protocols.\nSCAs involve numerous smart things that operate on low-powered\
    \ battery devices [83].\nNew connectivity solutions are being investigated in\
    \ light of the following question:\ndo the currently available methods, tools,\
    \ and techniques—especially those for wireless\nnetworks—allow for the reliable\
    \ handling of such a large number of smart devices?\nYaqoob et al. [84] provided\
    \ details on current connectivity solutions based on WPAN\ntechnologies such as\
    \ ZigBee, WiFi, Bluetooth, and others that offer low-power D2D com-\nmunication.\
    \ In these technologies, the throughput performance, the number of con-\nnected\
    \ devices, transmission ranges, etc., are severely constrained. Other technologies\n\
    (e.g., WiMAX, LTE, and LTE-A) involve signiﬁcant power consumption and are only\n\
    partially applicable to such settings. IEEE and 3GPP adapt their technologies\
    \ and commu-\nnication strategies to the rapidly expanding IoT-based modern communication\
    \ perspective.\nIEEE 802.11 (WiFi) was initially designed to maintain higher throughput\
    \ performance\nfor fewer stations distributed over a shorter distance in an interior\
    \ context. Due to the\nlimitations of its initial design, this standard does not\
    \ support IoT applications. Hence,\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n18 of 63\nto enable\
    \ IEEE 802.11 adaptive in such circumstances, the community (IEEE 802.11ah\nTask\
    \ Group (TGah)) developed a new power-efﬁcient protocol [55]. They aim to create\
    \ a\nsystem that enables effective communication between several indoor and outdoor\
    \ devices.\nNevertheless, the real-time implementation of IEEE 802.11ah may need\
    \ to be improved by\nthe absence of an appropriate interference mechanism.\nIEEE\
    \ 802.15.1 (Bluetooth), IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee), IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n, Cellular\n\
    3G/4G/5G/LTE/LTE-A, and IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) are only a few examples of standards\n\
    and protocols that should be evaluated for their applicability for various SCAs.\
    \ Smart\nhome automation systems, smart buildings, and smart garbage systems require\
    \ short-\nrange communication capability and can utilize protocols (e.g., Bluetooth\
    \ and Zigbee) from\nthe WPAN group. These protocols are distinguished by a lower\
    \ bandwidth requirement,\nminimal power usage, and a shorter-range communication\
    \ infrastructure environment.\nIn contrast, LAN groups such as WiFi can be used\
    \ for SCAs that require longer-range\ncommunication. Such applications are smart\
    \ transportation management systems.\nThe protocols from WAN groups, such as Cellular\
    \ and WiMAX, can be adopted by\napplications that need wide-range communication,\
    \ such as smart emergency response\nsystems, weather and air quality monitoring\
    \ systems, and smart grid systems. These\nfeatures designed in terms of standards\
    \ or protocols have enough capability that allows for\nboth synchronous and asynchronous\
    \ data connections. The best-effort trafﬁc (which can\neffectively tolerate latency)\
    \ allows the asynchronous data connections feature to be linked\nwith smart city\
    \ services or applications. Meanwhile, exploring synchronous data connec-\ntions\
    \ is possible for those services or applications that generate trafﬁc mandating\
    \ strict\nQoS standards such as low latency and high accessible network capacity\
    \ [49]. Since IEEE\n802.15.4 (Zigbee) is a short-range (low bit rate) communication\
    \ protocol that often suggests\nhigher ﬂexibility for small devices running on\
    \ low power, such a protocol can signiﬁcantly\nincrease network lifetime. Moreover,\
    \ such a protocol encourages and indicates support\nfor applications and services\
    \ with relatively relaxed latency and throughput conditions in\nWPANs. The authors\
    \ of [85] utilized a WSN based on IEEE 802.15.4 and proposed an intelli-\ngent\
    \ system for lighting applications. The authors highlighted the beneﬁts of using\
    \ wireless\nemulsions: uncomplicatedness in the implementation and deployment,\
    \ relatively easier in\nexpanding a network, and ﬂexibility in the system due\
    \ to the use of wireless technology,\nwhich supports the usage of heterogeneous\
    \ devices in the same implemented and deployed\nstructure. Furthermore, they emphasized\
    \ the advantages of employing the same intelligent\ninfrastructure for a variety\
    \ of services, leading to more effective management, monitoring,\nand cost-effectiveness.\
    \ For example, by including speciﬁc smart metering devices such as\nwater or gas\
    \ meters, the smart network or infrastructure (that was initially established\
    \ to\ntarget smart lighting applications) can also be used for smart metering\
    \ applications.\n5G has just supplanted 4G with advanced access schemes called\
    \ BDMA and FBMC\nmultiple access, which was ﬁrst launched in 2015. In the case\
    \ of BDMA multiple access, an\northogonal beam is frequently used, meaning that\
    \ resources can be distributed in parallel to\neach mobile base station by dividing\
    \ the antenna beam in accordance with the position of\nthe mobile stations to\
    \ enable multiple accesses to the base stations. Successively, this helps\nin\
    \ improving the capacity of 5G networks [86]. Speciﬁcally, the idea of moving\
    \ towards\n5G is based on current technology advancements and particularly on\
    \ unique customer\nneeds. Nonetheless, it is typically presumed that implemented\
    \ 5G cellular networks should\naddress noteworthy complications that are not successfully\
    \ addressed by 4G, i.e., enhanced\nnetwork capacity and data rate, lower End-to-End\
    \ (E2E) latency, reduced cost, and con-\nsistent user QoE provisioning. In addition,\
    \ massive and rapid growth in the number of\nhighly developed connected devices\
    \ leads to a sharp increase in network trafﬁc and a\nwidening range of applications\
    \ with unique dynamic requirements and features. Gupta\nand Jha [86] studied numerous\
    \ facilitators, such as choice or use of spectrum, massive\nMIMO, trafﬁc and power\
    \ management policies, ofﬂoading (local), and self-conﬁguring and\norganizing\
    \ networks, which can address these challenges effectively. Real-time managing\n\
    and supervising in smart city scenarios will be conceivable these days thanks\
    \ to 5G. 5G\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n19 of 63\nultimately targets some networking\
    \ possibilities, i.e., ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Com-\nmunications (uRLLC),\
    \ enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), and massive Machine Type\nCommunications (mMTC).\
    \ In a smart city context, eMBB controls data transfer between a\nvariety of networked\
    \ user end devices, edge devices, or cloud servers. Conversely, mMTC\naims to\
    \ manage huge connected, complex devices, such as wearables, actuators, and sen-\n\
    sors, through dense urban deployment. Finally, uRLLC takes responsibility for\
    \ managing\nhighly time-critical communication such as vehicular communication,\
    \ base stations, and\nedge devices communication [87]. Although 5G has completely\
    \ brought about a new\nrevolution in the ﬁeld of networking, numerous unknown\
    \ challenges still are possible in\nthese cases of communication when 5G is deployed\
    \ in the context of smart cities. One major\nproblem is power-efﬁcient communication,\
    \ especially when communicating low-powered\nbattery devices such as sensors and\
    \ other smart, complex wearables. Additionally, when\ntwo distinct technologies\
    \ (4G/5G) work together, there might be a problem. Speciﬁc device-\nlevel compatibility\
    \ problems might always persist when communication infrastructures\nmigrate to\
    \ next-generation platforms. Moreover, a big question arises, namely, how to\n\
    handle the widespread use of gadgets, particularly those in isolated or difﬁcult-to-reach\n\
    places, as well as the potential high costs associated with building and maintaining\
    \ 5G\nnetworks.\nTable 2 compares protocols used for smart cities, while Table\

    Through modifying and proposing novel PHY layer\nspeciﬁcations or implementations\
    \ and reforming the CN,\nLTE-A offers much-improved performance over UMTS/HSPA\n\
    MNwTs. It can speed up to 3 Gbps download and 1.5 Gbps\nupload. Additionally,\
    \ it has various antenna systems that\nsimplify switching between cell regions,\
    \ as well as\ncutting-edge transmission techniques that pack more data per\nsecond\
    \ into each hertz of the spectrum and improve\nthroughput performance at the level\
    \ of cell boundaries.\nSubsequently, it leads to superior performance in terms\
    \ of\nconsistent connection and capacity (network) [89,91,92].\nP2P\nWAN\nThe\

    and quick increase in highly sophisticated connected devices\ncontributes to a\
    \ sharp escalation in network trafﬁc and an\nexpanding variety of applications\
    \ with distinct dynamic\ndemands and features.\nSince LTE user equipment is not\
    \ required to be able to operate\non an NR carrier, NR is designed to be optimized\
    \ for\nperformance without taking backward compatibility into\naccount. Moreover,\
    \ NR can support operations in licensed\nspectrum bands from below 1 GHz to 52.6\
    \ GHz with a\nspectrum expansion facility.\nIn the case of mmWave frequencies,\
    \ excellent capacity and\nhigh data rates are possible. This technology’s ultra-lean\n\
    design seeks to decrease interference and improve system\npower efﬁciency by effectively\
    \ reducing always-on\ntransmissions [93,94].\nThis technology utilizes sophisticated\
    \ access procedures such\nas Beam Division and FBMC Multiple Access to adapt 4G\
    \ to\n5G networks. Beam Division Multiple Access (BDMA)\nschemes’ central design\
    \ principle is concurrently serving\nnumerous mobile users. This technique typically\
    \ uses an\northogonal beam, which suggests that resources can be\nallocated in\
    \ parallel to each mobile base station by separating\nthe antenna beam in accordance\
    \ with the position of the\nmobile stations to enable numerous accesses to the\

    \ 802.11 Standards\nTable 4 presents IEEE 802.11 standards and their features.\n\
    Table 4. IEEE 802.11 standards and their enhancements/features.\nStandards (Year\
    \ Released)\nEnhancement(s)/Feature(s) *\nTarget\nIEEE 802.11 (1997) (Original)\n\
    The standard and its amendments serve as the foundation for\nwireless network\
    \ products bearing the WiFi brand. This signiﬁes\ntwo raw data rates of 1 and\
    \ 2 Mbps that must be transferred via\nDSSS and FHSS at 2.4 GHz in the ISM band.\n\
    Wireless Standard (basic)\nIEEE 802.11b (1999)\nThis standard is intended to operate\
    \ in the 2.4 GHz spectrum;\nhowever, the level of interference issues is higher\
    \ when this\nstandard-based device tries to interoperate with many other\ndevices/standards\
    \ operating on the same band. It can attain a\ntheoretical data rate of 11 Mbps.\
    \ Nevertheless, dynamic\nadaptations can be applied to the transfer rate subject\
    \ to the current\ninterference level and signal power to minimize the error rate\
    \ (ARS\nPolicy). Depending on the channel conditions, the raw data rates\ncan\
    \ be adapted to 5.5 Mbps, 2 Mbps, and 1 Mbps. Additionally, it\nprovides somewhat\
    \ simpler deployment processes (e.g., upgrading\nthe current chipsets) as it demonstrates\
    \ backward compatibility\nwith the original standard due to the use of CDMA and\
    \ DSSS (same\nas the original standard) [89]. The coverage indoor and outdoor\n\
    ranges are 115 feet and 460 feet, respectively.\nWiFi-1\nIEEE 802.11a (1999)\n\
    Designed to operate on the 5 GHz spectrum and to have the least\namount of interference\
    \ compared to other devices. Depending on\nthe needs, the raw data rates can be\
    \ changed to 48 Mbps, 36 Mbps,\n24 Mbps, 18 Mbps, 12 Mbps, 9 Mbps, and 6 Mbps.\
    \ However, it can\nreach a theoretical transfer rate of 54 Mbps. The coverage\
    \ indoor\nand outdoor ranges are 115 feet and 391 feet, respectively [89].\nWiFi-2\n\
    IEEE 802.11g (2003)\nAllows for device compatibility with devices that operate\
    \ and\nfollow IEEE 802.16b standards. It can also attain a theoretical\ntransfer\
    \ rate of 54 Mbps. In real-time situations, it can achieve a\npractical data rate\
    \ of 24 Mbps. Nonetheless, when IEEE\n802.11b-based devices are introduced into\
    \ IEEE 802.11g networks,\nor when these heterogeneous compliant devices interoperate,\
    \ the\nrate decreases drastically to accommodate IEEE 802.11b-based\ntransmission\
    \ speeds every time that the compliant device tries to\ncommunicate [89]. The\
    \ coverage indoor and outdoor ranges are\n148 feet and 296 feet, respectively.\n\
    WiFi-3\nIEEE 802.11e (2005)\nIt speciﬁes a set of QoS augmentations for WLAN applications\n\
    through extensive amendments to the MAC sub-layer. It addressed\nQoS requirements\
    \ by emphasizing two-channel access schemes:\n(1) the contention-based EDCA scheme\
    \ and (2) the contention-free\nHCCA scheme. This standard, via EDCA, provides\
    \ trafﬁc\nprioritization support based on QoS classes (similar to\ndifferentiated\
    \ services). Conversely, this standard suggests\nparameterized QoS (similar to\
    \ integrated services) via HCCA. It\nalso speciﬁes enhancement over the conventional\
    \ IEEE 802.11\npower saver method (APSD) and reduces the signaling load [95].\
    \ It\nis designed to operate at frequencies ranging from 2.4 to\n2.4835 GHz or\
    \ from 5.75 to 5.850 GHz. This standard also speciﬁes\nthat a high transmission\
    \ rate may not be sufﬁcient to meet the QoS\nrequirements imposed by real-time\
    \ audio, voice, video, and\nlive-streaming applications. Following that, the provisions\
    \ of trafﬁc\nprioritization at the MAC sub-layer were insisted upon.\nQoS improvements\n\
    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n24 of 63\nTable 4. Cont.\nStandards (Year Released)\n\
    Enhancement(s)/Feature(s) *\nTarget\nIEEE 802.11n (2009)\nThis standard was suggested\
    \ while keeping the increased speed\nrequirement in mind. Later, it was able to\
    \ boost the attainable\nspeeds of WiFi networks beyond what was possible with\
    \ 802.11g.\nAchieving such high performance required several new features,\nincluding\
    \ a modiﬁed OFDM scheme, power-saving mechanisms,\nantenna technology, MIMO, and\
    \ wider channel bandwidth.\nNonetheless, backward compatibility in the standard\
    \ has been\nsigniﬁcantly affected (reduced) under exceptional scenarios.\nWhenever\
    \ or not an old standard compliance-based device attempts\nto communicate with\
    \ an IEEE 802.11g-based device in an 802.11g\nnetwork, the network’s operation,\
    \ performance, and other\ncapabilities suffer signiﬁcantly. These standard-based\
    \ APs can\noperate in Legacy mode (choosing one standard amongst\n802.11a/b/g),\
    \ Mixed mode (choose (out of 802.11a/b/g/n) and\noperate on heterogeneous conditions),\
    \ and Greenﬁeld mode\n(operate with a single (common) 802.11n altogether) [89].\
    \ It can\nreach a theoretical transfer rate of 600 Mbps. The coverage indoor\n\
    and outdoor ranges are 230 feet and 821 feet, respectively.\nWiFi-4\nIEEE 802.11ac\
    \ (2013)\nThis standard (called initially VHT) was suggested while keeping\nincreased\
    \ speed requirements in mind (likewise with other\nstandards). This standard was\
    \ later able to increase the achievable\nspeeds (up to 1 Gbps (minimum) to 7 Gbps\
    \ (maximum)) of WiFi\nnetworks beyond what 802.11n was capable of. The standard\n\
    enables the transmission of HD videos, online interactive games,\nlive-streaming,\
    \ and other demanding applications. It operates\nusing MU-MIMO technology, which\
    \ enables a single AP and its\nantenna to send data concurrently to several devices.\
    \ As a result,\nthis helps to increase airtime efﬁciency so that every associated\n\
    client—regardless of the 802.11 types it operates on—ﬁnally\nreceives the amount\
    \ of airtime it is supposed to receive, depending\non the technology used.\nWiFi-5\n\
    IEEE 802.11ah (2017)\nDesigned to operate on unlicensed spectrum below 1 GHz,\
    \ it can\nprovide signiﬁcantly more transmission coverage than traditional\n802.11\
    \ standards, which typically operate on 2.4 and 5 GHz bands.\nThis standard can\
    \ be employed in those scenarios where accessible\nbandwidth is comparatively\
    \ narrow. It can normally apply with\nWiFi (outdoor) for performing CTO, large-scale\
    \ WSNs (i.e., smart\ngrid), and extended-range hotspots. Supporting a reasonably\
    \ large\ntransmission range/coverage property aids in managing large-scale\nnetworks\
    \ where the number of devices may be much greater than\nwhat the conventional\
    \ 802.11 standard can support. It advises that\nchanges to the PHY and MAC layers\
    \ be made to provide important\nimprovements including energy-saving capabilities,\
    \ support for\naccommodating a high number of devices, reliable media access\n\
    techniques, and throughput performance improvement by using\nsmall frame formats\
    \ [96].\nExtended coverage, low-power\nWLAN\nIEEE 802.11ax (2021)\nThis standard\
    \ was proposed with the consideration of higher speed\nrequirements. Later, this\
    \ standard increased WiFi network\nachievable speeds above what was made possible\
    \ by earlier\nstandards. Speciﬁcally, it can offer support for a 10 Gbps data\
    \ rate,\nconsistency, and low power consumption. It operates using\nMU-MIMO and\
    \ MU-OFDMA multi-user technologies, which\nenables a single AP and its antenna\
    \ to send data concurrently to\nseveral end devices. Although the 802.11ac standard\
    \ is where\nMU-MIMO technology was ﬁrst introduced, 802.11ax now allows\nfor groups\
    \ of up to eight clients. In addition, this standard also\nsuggests several improvements\
    \ in spatial reusing policies and\npower-saver schemes [97].\nWiFi-6\n* ARS: Adaptive\

    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n25 of 63\n4.2. IEEE 802.15.1\nThe IEEE 802.15.1 (WPAN\
    \ protocol) uses the 2.4 GHz spectrum and a master/slave\ntime division duplex\
    \ mechanism that operates smoothly in the 10 to 100 m range with a\n1 Mbps data\
    \ rate. This technology uses modest data rates for short-range services designed\n\
    to use less power. Recent implementations of this technology include Bluetooth\
    \ and\nBluetooth Low Energy (BLE), offering IP connectivity to aid the IoT [98].\
    \ The deployment\nof services offered for tracking and localization devices is\
    \ typically suggested by BLE-based\ndevices, which are recognized as BLE beacons.\
    \ These beacons produce a signal that other\ncompatible devices can pick up between\
    \ 50 and 70 m away. Using such a beacon promises\ngreater indoor localization\
    \ accuracy than other technologies such as WiFi or GPS. They can\nbe used for\
    \ a wide range of services targeted toward information dissemination, the launch\n\
    of points of sale, user tracking, etc., thanks to this capability. Additionally,\
    \ to provide\nspeciﬁc services of interest, it is frequently required to combine\
    \ the BLE technology with\nother technologies such as WiFi [99]. Originally, the\
    \ aim of BLE technology (Bluetooth\nClassic Radio (BCR)) was to provide a continuous\
    \ wireless connection, i.e., BlueTooth\nBasic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate (BT BR/EDR).\
    \ It became the perfect option for the IoT\nsince it permits connectivity and\
    \ audio-streaming applications using brief bursts of long-\ndistance radio, which\
    \ lowers the battery consumption of mobile devices (because they need\nnot be\
    \ connected all the time). Using the idea of dual-mode chipsets and the new BLE\n\
    speciﬁcation, smartphones or regular phones can be linked to other heterogeneous\
    \ devices\n(such as headphones) in BR/EDR mode. Otherwise, they can be connected\
    \ to wearables\nin LE mode. A low-power radio called BCR, or BT BR/EDR, intends\
    \ to broadcast data\nacross 79 channels in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed frequency range.\
    \ Wireless audio streaming is\nprimarily made possible through BCR, which has\
    \ evolved into the industry-standard radio\nprotocol for in-car entertainment\
    \ systems, wireless speakers, and headphones. BLE aims to\ntransmit data over\
    \ 40 channels in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed frequency range. To facilitate the\ndeployment\
    \ of dependable and large-scale device networks, BLE seeks to provide support\n\
    for a wide range of communication methods, typically P2P; broadcast; and, most\
    \ notably,\nmesh [100]. This unique Bluetooth feature can be used to create distribution\
    \ and locating\nmaps utilizing ﬁngerprint templates for indoor device and user\
    \ localization. Due to BLE’s\ngreater susceptibility to abrupt fading and substantial\
    \ changes in received signal strength,\nit has been proven that using BLE is more\
    \ efﬁcient than using WiFi-based solutions [99,101].\nHowever, Bluetooth technology\
    \ has a problem with increasing power usage, particularly\nwhen its BR/EDR mode\
    \ is used in an IoT context. This is because this mode allows the\nmaster nodes\
    \ to continuously poll the slave nodes, even when there is no data transmission.\n\
    The researchers [102,103] already brought up this issue, addressed it, and offered\
    \ a variety\nof scheduling techniques for polling the slave nodes. Moreover, the\
    \ BR/EDR mode reveals\na lack of scalability that further restricts the performance\
    \ of the system.\n4.3. LoRA\nThe LoRa protocol was primarily used for WAN applications\
    \ and operated as a low-\ndata-rate, low-power technology on the sub-1 GHz spectrum\
    \ that could go up to 10 km.\nLoRa communicates on three classes of bandwidth:\
    \ 125, 250, and 500 KHz. Even while\nthis technology can function at the largest\
    \ bandwidth class, which further improves data\nrate, it still causes issues with\
    \ high power consumption, a shorter communication range,\nand an increase in the\
    \ likelihood of interference because it is free to operate in a wider\nfrequency\
    \ spectrum. This method is founded on the idea of spread spectrum modulation\n\
    and a CSSM variant with a spreading factor ranging from 7 to 12. The transmission\
    \ range\nwill expand as the spreading factor’s value rises, but the power consumption\
    \ will rise\nas well. The CSSM utilizes complete allocated bandwidth, thereby\
    \ making it resilient to\nchannel noise and multi-path fading, but it does not\
    \ differentiate the noise in the channel\nsuch as DSSS. In contrast to the FSK\
    \ modulation approach, which normally identiﬁes\nsignals that are 8 to 10 dB above\
    \ the noise ﬂoor, the CSSM feature enables this technology\nto sense, perceive,\
    \ and capture signals that are 19.5 dB below the noise ﬂoor [103]. Its\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n26 of 63\narchitecture uses a star network topology and includes\
    \ gateways and end nodes. In this\ndesign, end nodes are referred to as slaves\
    \ and run on battery-powered devices with\nlimited power, but gateways are thought\
    \ of as powerful machines that gather data from\nslave nodes. Furthermore, LoRaWAN\
    \ is a communication layer that operates on top of\nLoRA. LoRaWAN incorporates\
    \ the basic LoRa criteria and suggests improved adaptability\nand suitability\
    \ for low-power applications. This layer/technology has advantages over\ncellular\
    \ technologies, which are expected to be battery hungry by the concept. In practice,\n\
    LoRaWAN improved network features and functionalities by addressing the concept\
    \ of\na specialized server (network) and speciﬁcally deﬁning numerous device types\
    \ to meet\nthe needs of each specialized application. Managed communication, packet\
    \ ﬁltering, and\npacket scheduling are all made possible using specialized network\
    \ servers. LoRaWAN\nhas also facilitated bi-directional-employing adaptive transmission\
    \ power and rate, which\naids in optimizing network performance in terms of power\
    \ consumption and throughput.\nThis technology can be employed for a wide range\
    \ of applications, such as smart health\nnursing [104], trafﬁc monitoring [105],\
    \ agriculture monitoring [106], localization [107],\nand smart grid applications\
    \ [108]. In particular, this technology is useful for non-latency-\nsensitive\
    \ applications and those that call for extensive deployments. Haxhibeqiri et al.\
    \ [109]\nand Adelantado et al. [110] emphasized that LoRaWAN is feasible for smart\
    \ metering,\ntracking, and localization-based applications. At the same time,\
    \ it is not so feasible for\nreal-time monitoring and video surveillance.\n4.4.\
    \ WiMAX\nWiMAX can handle high capacity, i.e., a potential peak data rate of 60\
    \ Mbps for an\nentire downlink operation and a rate of 28 Mbps for an entirely\
    \ uplink operation, based on\nthe original IEEE 802.16 air interface standard\
    \ (2004) [111] and the IEEE 802.16e amend-\nment [112]. It can be done using two\
    \ antennas with a channel bandwidth of 10 MHz.\nAdditionally, it may provide support\
    \ for multimedia services with different trafﬁc charac-\nteristics and wide area\
    \ mobility with changing QoS needs. Additionally, it offers a variety\nof QoS\
    \ scheduling options for accommodating heterogeneous trafﬁc, such as Internet\
    \ data\ntrafﬁc, VoIP (Voice over IP), classic audio trafﬁc, and voice and video\
    \ streams [113].\nTable 5 shows the speciﬁed WiMAX standards and their operational\
    \ parameters [114].\nThis standard provides a communication channel between geographically\
    \ separated de-\nvices. As a result, the maximum achievable covered distance ranges\
    \ between 30 km and\n100 km. However, this technology has some drawbacks, such\
    \ as high installation costs\nand the possibility of complications and irregularities\
    \ when dealing with high-deﬁnition\nmultimedia trafﬁc.\nWireless network trafﬁc\
    \ has recently increased extraordinarily due to the rapid pro-\nliferation of\
    \ smart handheld devices, sensors, and actuators. These devices, along with\n\
    smart controllers, mobile users, and other smart services-based specialized devices,\
    \ are\nthe most common use cases for W-LANs in dense network environments. In\
    \ such a dense\nnetwork environment, interference is a critical issue that must\
    \ be addressed if satisfactory\nperformance and, thus, proﬁcient spatial frequency\
    \ reuse is required. Subsequently, the\nstandards IEEE 802.11 were designed and\
    \ implemented to support these requirements.\nNumerous international organizations,\
    \ including IEEE and 3GPP, adopted and improved\ntheir technologies in response\
    \ to changing needs and the emerging IoT market. For instance,\nthe original IEEE\
    \ 802.11 (WiFi) standard was designed to support and provide superior\nthroughput\
    \ performance to a small number of stations located close to each other, and as\
    \ a\nresult, this technology was not particularly useful for IoT systems. As a\
    \ result, to address\nthe challenges and requirements of IoT, the IEEE 802.11ah\
    \ Task Group (TG) was formed by\nthe IEEE 802.11 MAN/LAN Standards Committee to\
    \ redesign and extend the applicability\nof WiFi standards to IoT scenarios. They\
    \ focused on the critical issue of power-aware\nefﬁcient schemes and protocols\
    \ to extend the functionality and applicability of 802.11-based\nnetworks while\
    \ dealing with a variety of small power-constrained smart outdoor and\nindoor\
    \ devices [55,97].\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n27 of 63\nTable 5. WiMAX standards\

    \ Protocol Suite\nIn IoT, smart sensing motes, devices, and actuators share unique\
    \ features such as\nconstrained memory, power, and processing capabilities; the\
    \ need for facilitating real-time\nrequirements of smart applications; extremely\
    \ vulnerable radio environments; and little to\nno human involvement after deployment\
    \ [115]. By enabling communication amongst these\ndevices utilizing low-power-cost\
    \ technologies, a new infrastructure for deployed smart\nservices has been formed.\
    \ Researchers [116] argued that the TCP/IP protocol suite might\nprovide a solution\
    \ and be ﬂexible enough for a variety of evolving IoT communication\nscenarios.\
    \ Unfortunately, there were additional challenges that network administrators,\n\
    designers, and researchers had to overcome. Researchers were searching for the\
    \ best way\nto install IPv6-based sensor motes that can effectively/minimally\
    \ use the system’s limited\nresources (i.e., power and bandwidth). Because of\
    \ such power constraints, researchers\nhighlighted the requirements of low-power\
    \ Layer-2 technologies (i.e., BLE, IEEE 802.15.4)\nand low-power WiFi usage. In\
    \ contrast with traditional Ethernet links, these technologies\noperate with smaller\
    \ maximum transmission unit (MTU) sizes and slower transmission\nspeeds. IoT network\
    \ protocol designers faced a problem in adapting to and determining\nthe ideal\
    \ MTU size. Another obstacle is that IoT networks often are based solely on wireless\n\
    networks and thus they can only communicate using wireless mesh technologies.\
    \ This\nvulnerability brings extra challenges in front of TCP/IP architecture:\n\
    (1)\nThe current IP addressing model cannot assist mesh communication (since it\
    \ relies on\na multi-link subnet prototype) at all.\n(2)\nIn mesh communication,\
    \ the multicasting and broadcasting communication methods are\nquite expensive,\
    \ power-demanding, and prohibitive as the network nodes are extremely\npower constrained.\
    \ Moreover, unicasting is the only remaining alternative method.\n(3)\nUnicasting\
    \ is power intensive in and of itself because it may take many hops while\nforwarding\
    \ and may wake up an excessive number of nodes that are asleep. Notably,\nidle\
    \ nodes and hops can modify the radio state’s operation mode to save power. Ad-\n\
    ditionally, a large amount of power is used and saved by a node during transmission,\n\
    reception, overhearing, idle, and sleeping phases [117]. However, to ensure successful\n\
    delivery, we cannot just alter the operational modes. Instead, it requires effective\n\
    coordination and intricate synchronization [117,118].\n(4)\nThere is a high requirement\
    \ for scalable routing/forwarding schemes for IP communi-\ncation to take place\
    \ over mesh architectural systems.\n(5)\nFor many IoT applications requiring data\
    \ prioritizing and customized control, original\nTCP-suited features such as those\
    \ operational on ﬁxed MSS sizes (such as MTU sizes)\nthat further lead to silly\
    \ window syndrome or in-order byte-stream delivery to ensure\ndependability, are\
    \ unsuitable [119]. Nonetheless, the IETF started deﬁning standard\nInternet protocols\
    \ such as RPL [120] for such specialized environments to minimize\nprotocol overheads\
    \ that impair the computing ability and memory management of\nthese specialized\
    \ resource-constrained devices.\nWiFi-based infrastructure networks enable backhauling\
    \ support, which helps estab-\nlish and sustain seamless connectivity among smart\
    \ IoT devices. In smart home wireless\nnetworks, this form of connectivity can\
    \ be provided through TCP connections. The TCP/IP\nprotocol suite supports dependable\
    \ data delivery and congestion control strategies to main-\ntain network throughput\
    \ performance via TCP at Layer-4. TCP is a protocol that has been\nregularly modiﬁed\
    \ and improved over the years to effectively transport large amounts of\nbyte-stream\
    \ in-ordered data via resilient P2P connections with comparatively lower latency\n\
    needs. IoT services deal with atypical communication patterns, for which TCP/IP\
    \ protocol\nsuite-based protocols, such as TCP, are unable to handle such patterns\
    \ adequately [119].\nThere are severe problems that TCP faces when it deals with\
    \ an IoT application:\n(1)\nTCP connection establishment and termination (three-way\
    \ handshaking) incur signiﬁ-\ncant overhead in the system as most communication\
    \ in an IoT application includes\nthe transmission of brief segments and relatively\
    \ little data.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n29 of 63\n(2)\nTCP functionality needs\
    \ resilient P2P connections. It is impossible to sustain these con-\nnections\
    \ in an IoT network environment because smart sensors and other connected\ndevices\
    \ switch their mode of radio state from active to sleep phase persistently [119].\n\
    (3)\nSome IoT applications might need broadcast and multicast communication patterns,\n\
    and enabling such patterns via TCP will result in substantial network overhead\
    \ in the\nentire IoT system and high-power consumption.\n(4)\nSome IoT services\
    \ have very granular delay requirements, and any extra delay in\nthe form of connection\
    \ establishment or MSS creation (waiting for data to ﬁll the\nentire MSS) is completely\
    \ unacceptable for their performance. Thus, TCP is unable to\nprovide much support\
    \ for these IoT services.\n(5)\nIoT applications that rely on wireless communication\
    \ scenarios must deal with crit-\nical wireless channel characteristics such as\
    \ channel error, interference, and wire-\nless interface properties that result\
    \ in buffer-induced, channel-induced, link-layer\ncontention-induced, and collision-induced\
    \ packet losses. When TCP operates in such\na setting, its stringent in-order\
    \ delivery requirements and retransmission policies\n(i.e., fast retransmission)\
    \ may occasionally result in very serious system problems\nsuch as Head-of-Line\
    \ (HoL) or Receiver Buffer Blocking, which ultimately results in\na reduction\
    \ in throughput, delay, and power consumption performance [121–124].\nFurthermore,\
    \ wireless MAC methods that use MAC-level retransmissions may fur-\nther impair\
    \ TCP’s performance, if Layer-2 retransmission latency exceeds the TCP\nRetransmission\
    \ Time Out timer.\nSome standards, such as BACnet/IP [125], were proposed to implement\
    \ Layer-4\nfunctionalities at the Application Layer (AppL) itself and proposed\
    \ to utilize UDP as an\nunderlying Layer-4 protocol. Managing packet losses should\
    \ depend on an application’s\nrequirements, which may vary from application to\
    \ application. However, TCP and its\nupdated variants rely on the concept of data\
    \ delivery deferment and try to perform retrans-\nmissions from an already created\
    \ copy in the sender buffer. However, this is not the only\napproach to dealing\
    \ with packet losses in the network. Another method is for AppL to\naccept packet\
    \ delivery that is not completely ﬂawless and proceed with its current opera-\n\
    tions. This feature will be helpful in real-time audio and video distribution.\
    \ Additionally,\nretransmission is an additional option. However, AppL should\
    \ handle this retransmission\nrather than an underlying Layer-4 protocol such\
    \ as TCP. In terms of buffering the lost data\nbits, doing so enables the source\
    \ application to reconstruct them. Furthermore, in situations\nwhere real-time\
    \ services are severely constrained, the transmitting application may transmit\n\
    fresh data instead of retransmitting lost data to “repair” the effects of the\
    \ initial loss [126].\nClark and Tennenhouse [126] concluded these concepts and\
    \ subsequently introduced the\nconcept of Application Level Framing (ALF). Implementing\
    \ Layer-4 facilities at AppL itself\nbrings the idea of employing ALF into the\
    \ system. Hence, utilizing the notion of ALF,\na network can recognize individual\
    \ Application Data Units (ADUs), and subsequently\ncan offer support for ﬂexible\
    \ Layer-4 facilities, i.e., employing adaptive retransmission\nprocedures for\
    \ diverse forms of ADUs and disseminating data more effectively by using\nin-network\
    \ caching. Unluckily, the TCP/IP protocol suite forbids applications from adding\n\
    any application semantics into network-level packet structure. Therefore, it fails\
    \ to provide\nsupport for the ALF scheme [119].\n4.6. Compound TCP for IoT\nCompound\
    \ TCP [127] was initially designed to offer support for improved channel\nutilization\
    \ and fairness performances. It will play a signiﬁcant role in home networks with\n\
    WiFi-assisted smart and standard devices [115,128].\nPokhrel and Williamson [115]\
    \ studied the effectiveness of a compound TCP over an\nIoT scenario involving\
    \ sensors and other devices (i.e., smartphones, laptops, PC, and home\nappliances).\
    \ They analyzed and evaluated the scenario improving the performance of con-\n\
    nections made using the examined TCP variant across infrastructure WiFi networks\
    \ in the\npresence of signiﬁcant buffer-overﬂow-induced losses and severely degraded\
    \ transmission\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n30 of 63\nchannel circumstances. The\
    \ authors also addressed the varying bandwidth requirements\nfor all IoT devices\
    \ as well as ubiquitous connectivity, ranging from traditional bandwidth-\nhungry\
    \ Internet devices to low-power gadgets. The authors of [129] demonstrated a\n\
    thorough evaluation of the steady-state performance of TCP via WiFi-assisted classical\n\
    devices considering the situations of high-buffer-overﬂow-induced losses and signiﬁcantly\n\
    deteriorated transmission channel conditions. The authors of [115,129] suggested\
    \ models\nthat aided in capturing the dynamics of congestion and ﬂow control of\
    \ several concurrently\nrunning competitive long-lived compound TCP connections.\
    \ In evaluating and developing\nthese models, they considered MAC-level retransmissions,\
    \ link-layer contention, channel\nfailures, and collision. The authors of [130]\
    \ utilized a transient model suggesting a new\nqueue management scheme to capture\
    \ the interactions of short-lived TCP ﬂows (the most\nworkable ﬂows in IoT scenarios)\
    \ over conventional trafﬁc patterns over WiFi networks.\nHowever, the performance\
    \ of TCP in WiFi networks is constrained, especially when using\na single shared\
    \ Access Points (APs). As a result, TCP might not be able to scale well and\n\
    provide superior performance in wide-area Industry 4.0 networks, especially when\
    \ wireless\nchannels are often reused by several APs [131].\n4.7. Viewpoints of\
    \ Network Layer Routing for IoT Systems\nThe network architectures for IoT are\
    \ heterogeneous and include WiFi, WSNs, Wireless\nMesh Networks (WMNs), Vehicular\
    \ Networks, and Mobile Communication Networks\n(MCNs) (5G/LTE/4G/3G) [132]. Due\
    \ to the large-scale production of intelligent sensing\ndevices, survivability\
    \ and self-organization of deployed functional networks are essential. A\nWSN\
    \ is deployed for a variety of smart agricultural, environmental, domestic, and\
    \ military\napplications. It is an ad-hoc network with no infrastructure, in which\
    \ the sensor nodes\ncommunicate over multi-hop routing. WSNs run on battery-powered,\
    \ low-power sensors\ncapable of sensing, collecting, processing, aggregating,\
    \ and regulating communication.\nNumerous WSN-based platforms, including MICA2,\
    \ TelosB, and MICAz MOTE, have\nbeen suggested. Therefore, some standards were\
    \ introduced to enable interaction and\nother compatibilities among these numerous\
    \ heterogeneous platforms. For example, the\nIEEE802.15.4 (Zigbee) standard creates\
    \ the WSNs backbone as part of the IoT. WSNs provide\ncritical functionalities\
    \ for developing IoT systems, allowing Low-Powered battery-operated\nEnd Devices\
    \ (LPEDs) with very minimal resources to attach to the Internet. A WSN can be\n\
    considered a special form of LoWPAN consisting of several equipped sensor nodes.\
    \ Due\nto the lack of IP communication infrastructure, interoperability must be\
    \ obtained from the\nviewpoint of WSN and the Internet. To address the interoperability\
    \ issue, various works\nsuggested a standardized arrangement that could enable\
    \ the usage of IP over LoWPAN.\nThe IEEE 802.15.4 standard allows for the interoperability\
    \ for Low power and Lossy\nNetworks (LLNs). The design tenet of this standard\
    \ outlines the physical and data link\nlayers of the network and offers a low-cost\
    \ framework for network operations. To link\nLPEDs to the Internet, 6LoWPAN may\
    \ be used as an adaptation layer to enable sensors\nto implement an IP stack and\
    \ become approachable by other conventional devices over\nthe Internet. This adaptability\
    \ layer also supports end-to-end connectivity, which enables\na variety of applications\
    \ and permits these LPEDs to implement routing and forwarding\nalgorithms at the\
    \ Internet layer. However, the current network layer routing policies cannot\n\
    be supported when the number of nodes grows. Therefore, the RPL protocol [72]\
    \ considers\nthe LLN situation [133]. Most of the nodes in LLNs are resource-constrained,\
    \ and they are\nconnected by some lossy links that only support low data rates.\
    \ These links are thought\nto be extremely unstable and have poor performance\
    \ in terms of packet delivery rates. In\nsuch specialized networks, the trafﬁc\
    \ patterns are often P2MP and MultiPoint-2-MultiPoint\n(MP2MP) rather than just\
    \ P2P [72]. These networks contain hundreds of smart devices.\nThis makes the\
    \ implementation of routing policies more difﬁcult than ever. In addition,\nnumerous\
    \ existing traditional ad-hoc wireless network routing methods, such as DSR and\n\
    AODV, cannot manage these unique situations and unforeseen circumstances. Designing\n\
    and implementing routing in ad-hoc networking settings has been more difﬁcult\
    \ due to the\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n31 of 63\nmobility aspect and the resource\
    \ limitations at wireless nodes. Their forwarding policies’\ndesign principles\
    \ emphasize QoS elements including bandwidth usage and end-to-end\nlatency [134,135].\
    \ The forwarding rules frequently created and applied for WSNs situations\ntake\
    \ into account the increase in the network lifetime by effectively utilizing the\
    \ node\nenergy [117,136]. As these ad-hoc networks were designed to operate and\
    \ maintain solely\ninside their operational infrastructure, this was very feasible.\
    \ However, the interoperability\nof these ad-hoc networks is a major problem when\
    \ such networks are integrated with\nIoT networks. The ad-hoc network integration\
    \ with IoT needs novel routing policies\nthat support scalability and assure QoS,\
    \ fairness, and connectivity between two nodes\n(both in APs and ad-hoc networks)\
    \ with the least amount of power consumption. The\nstandard classical forwarding\
    \ strategies were intended to ensure QoS between a pair of\ndevices/nodes. In\
    \ the case of an IoT environment, the routing procedures should suggest\nenough\
    \ fairness so that each node can sufﬁciently get enough chances to communicate\
    \ with\nnearby APs. For such specialized scenarios, hierarchical routing solutions\
    \ are followed\nto decrease data redundancy and ensure data aggregation. Researchers\
    \ have often raised\nconcerns about the disadvantaged forwarding rules, which\
    \ lead to the consumption of\nexcess energy in networks while taking into account\
    \ mobile and static ad-hoc network\nscenarios. It consequently increases the likelihood\
    \ of frequent network disconnections,\nroute failures, and even network partitioning,\
    \ all contributing to the system’s signiﬁcant\nMAC-level and routing-level overhead\
    \ problems [134,135]. Hence, bearing in mind the\nhigh-power consumption problem,\
    \ many researchers presented numerous smart routing\nparadigms [118,134,135,137].\
    \ Still, many of these suggested schemes failed to achieve the\ndesired QoS.\n\
    Cross-layer design-based recommendations for power consumption and congestion\n\
    control are well-suited design proposals for comprehending the changes in wireless\
    \ channel\nattributes. Therefore, signiﬁcant work has been done in these areas.\
    \ These designs provide\nsupport for dynamically accessing and evaluating extremely\
    \ variable channel parameters\nat lower layers (MAC and PHY) for the Internet/Routing\
    \ and Transport layers to further\noptimize forwarding and congestion window adaptations\
    \ decisions [121,134,135,138–140].\nThe Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)\
    \ indicates how well a device can hear a\nsignal from an AP or router. A network\
    \ layer forwarding policy can effectively utilize the\nRSSI (accessible through\
    \ lower layers dynamically) to assess link quality. AODV and DSR\nare examples\
    \ of the traditional ad-hoc routing protocols used in various smart forwarding\n\
    systems designed for IoT scenarios. The AOMDV IoT [141] and MLB [142] routing\
    \ mecha-\nnisms were suggested for the IoT scenarios and talked about node and\
    \ link disjoint paths\nwhile discovering routes. However, the proposed schemes\
    \ do not shed light and discuss\nanything related to performance issues when there\
    \ is a signiﬁcant level of interference in\nthe network because of trafﬁc running\
    \ parallel onto multiple paths. The abovementioned\ntechniques do not always perform\
    \ well in terms of throughput and end-to-end delay.\nRecently, the scheme [140]\
    \ considered different critical factors such as interference level,\nlink-layer\
    \ contentions, routing load, MAC load, and other performance issues related to\n\
    wireless scenarios. The authors of [140] insisted that multipath load distribution\
    \ policies’\nefﬁciency depends on the distribution (physical) of routes. Nevertheless,\
    \ different possible\ndisjoint routes—those lacking any common nodes or links—might\
    \ be able to interfere\nwith one another due to the radio signals’ predicted broadcasting\
    \ behavior in wireless\ncommunication. Consequently, such separate disconnected\
    \ pathways could be utilized to\nenhance the performance of the network as a whole\
    \ [138,140].\nWhen employing an IoT-based system, the end sensor nodes depend\
    \ on WSN-based\nnetworking connectivity to deliver sensed and collected data from\
    \ smart things to sink\nnodes. These nodes are commonly known as IoT GateWay nodes\
    \ (IoT-GW). To balance\nenergy usage and gather crucial sensor data, numerous\
    \ such static and mobile IoT-GWs\ncan be deployed in the system. In the whole\
    \ system, numerous WSNs, gathering numerous\ntypes of critical data, are connected\
    \ to the Internet [142,143]. Originally, Zigbee speciﬁed\nthree forms of devices:\
    \ Zigbee Coordinator, Zigbee Router, and Zigbee End Device, and\nElectronics 2023,\
    \ 12, 2490\n32 of 63\nthree forms of network topologies: tree, star, and mesh.\
    \ Moreover, the Zigbee stack\nembraces AODV to create paths dynamically. In the\
    \ case of star network topology, the\nReduced and Fully Functional Devices (i.e.,\
    \ RFDs and FFDs) can communicate with the\nPAN central coordinator only. They\
    \ are not capable of communicating with one another.\nHere, the PAN coordinator\
    \ may be powered by mains, while the RFDs and FFDs run on\nlow-powered limited\
    \ battery devices. Moreover, in the case of the mesh network topology,\nany device\
    \ can communicate to within-range devices at a point of time. Moreover, this\n\
    topology contains a PAN coordinator, which can communicate with other RFDs and\
    \ FFDs.\nFurthermore, this networking topology offers support for the usage of\
    \ the integrated\nforwarding scheme united with hierarchical/tree and AODV routing\
    \ procedures. Lastly,\nthe tree (cluster) network topology is a subset form of\
    \ mesh networking topology, consisting\nof RFDs and FFDs (which may act as coordinators).\
    \ However, the FFD count could be\nmore than the RFD count in the network. RFDs\
    \ may attach to tree (cluster) network\ntopology as the end nodes in the system.\
    \ The coordinator FFDs can offer synchronization\nfunctionalities to other connected\
    \ coordinators and devices. However, there will be a single\nPAN coordinator amongst\
    \ these coordinators [144].\n4.8. IoT Application Protocols\nEach IoT application\
    \ is based on IoT application layer protocols for data transfer.\nThese protocols\
    \ can be the following:\n•\nRepresentational State Transfer Hypertext Transfer\
    \ Protocol (REST HTTP): HTTP [145] is\nthe primary client/server protocol that\
    \ adopts the request/response model. HTPP has\nbeen related to the REST architecture\
    \ [146] to ease the interaction between dissimilar\nentities over web-based services.\
    \ The mixture of HTTP and REST enables IoT devices\nto make their status readily\
    \ available in terms of the standardized CRUD (create, read,\nupdate, delete)\
    \ functions [147]. The CRUD functions are mapped to the POST, GET,\nPUT, and DELETE\
    \ techniques of HTTP, correspondingly. In this fashion, we can build\na REST model\
    \ for dissimilar IoT devices [148].\n•\nConstrained Application Protocol (CoAP)\
    \ [149]: It is a lightweight RESTful protocol lately\nstandardized by the Internet\
    \ Engineering Task Force (IETF). CoAP is used by IoT\ndevices for IP-based, HTTP-like\
    \ interactions. It uses UDP with acknowledgment mes-\nsages to set up reliable\
    \ communication based on a request/response interaction. It has\nreduced complexity,\
    \ and thus it is suitable for resource-constrained IoT applications\nand machine-to-machine\
    \ (M2M) communication.\n•\nMessage Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) [150] is\
    \ established for IoT messaging.\nAccording to MQTT design principles, network\
    \ bandwidth and device resource re-\nquirements should be kept to a minimum while\
    \ also aiming to assure dependability\nand some level of delivery assurance. Since\
    \ June 2016, MQTT has been recognized by\nISO as a standard (ISO/IEC 20922). The\
    \ protocol continues to progress by formalizing\npopular capability options and\
    \ adding new functionalities. The most recent version,\nMQTT v5.0, was released\
    \ in 2018. MQTT operates according to a publish/subscribe\nparadigm. Clients connect\
    \ to a centralized broker when using MQTT.\n•\nOpen Platform Communications Uniﬁed\
    \ Architecture (OPC UA) [151]: This interoper-\nability standard is used for the\
    \ secure and reliable exchange of data in the industrial\nautomation domain and\
    \ other industries. It is platform independent and ensures\nthe seamless ﬂow of\
    \ information among IoT devices from multiple vendors. It sup-\nports two different\
    \ communication methods: the Client/Server method as well as\nPublish/Subscribe\
    \ (e.g., over UDP or MQTT) to mainly meet different industry re-\nquirements from\
    \ the production systems to edge and cloud scenarios. Today, the main\nIoT vendors\
    \ including IBM, AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft, and SIEMENS leverage\nsecure, standardized\
    \ information exchange in edge-to-cloud applications based on\nOPC UA.\n•\nExtensible\
    \ Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) [152]: This extensible protocol is\n\
    based on text messages that use XML (Extensible Mark-up Language), through which\n\
    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n33 of 63\nit can implement both request/response and\
    \ publish/subscribe methods by using\nsuitable extensions. XMPP exchanges instant\
    \ messages between clients, and this\nhappens in real-time using a push mechanism\
    \ to avoid increasing unnecessary network\nloads. XMPP also determines the state\
    \ of an XMPP entity as online, ofﬂine, busy, etc.\n•\nAdvanced Message Queuing\
    \ Protocol (AMQP) [153]: An open standard for passing\nbusiness messages between\
    \ applications or organizations using TCP. It connects sys-\ntems, feeds business\
    \ processes with the information they need, and reliably transmits\nonward the\
    \ instructions that achieve their goals using the point/point and pub-\nlish/subscribe\
    \ interaction modes. AMQP was designed to achieve the main goals of\nmessage orientation;\
    \ queuing; routing; security; reliability; and interoperability.\n•\nData Distribution\
    \ Service (DDS) [154]: DDS was developed by the Open Management\nGroup (OMG).\
    \ DDS is a real-time M2M protocol that enables dependable, high-\nperformance,\
    \ interoperable, scalable data exchanges using a publish–subscribe pattern.\n\
    DDS provides low-latency data connectivity, high reliability, and scalability\
    \ in publish–\nsubscribe and request/response patterns over TCP and UDP. The needs\
    \ of various\nIoT applications requiring real-time data exchange can be addressed\
    \ using DDS. Such\napplications are air trafﬁc control, transportation systems,\
    \ autonomous vehicles, and\nsmart grid management.\nLastly, Glaroudis et al. [155]\
    \ provided a comparison among IoT application protocols\nin terms of well-accepted\
    \ key performance indicators and discussed their suitability in the\nframework\
    \ of smart farming.\n5. Networking Architectures and Protocols\n5.1. Generic Architectures\n\
    Zanella et al. [37] provided an in-depth analysis of an urban IoT’s enabling technolo-\n\
    gies, protocols, and architecture. They also demonstrated the implementation of\
    \ an IoT\nisland as a proof-of-concept in the Italian City of Padova. In the IoT,\
    \ two methods provide\ndata access to objects/things. The ﬁrst involves deploying\
    \ multi-hop mesh networks with\nshort-range communication among network nodes\
    \ using unlicensed frequency. The second\ninvolves using licensed frequency band\
    \ long-range cellular technologies (e.g., 2G/GSM).\nCentenaro et al. [156] presented\
    \ a hopeful alternative solution (i.e., a new type of wire-\nless connectivity)\
    \ called Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs). LPWAN is based\non a star topology\
    \ characterized by low-rate, long-range transmission technologies in\nthe unlicensed\
    \ sub-GHz frequency bands. The authors considered LPWAN to provide\nconnectivity\
    \ in the IoT scenario for a characteristic SCA. Furthermore, they discussed\n\
    the advantages of LPWAN over well-known methods regarding effectiveness, efﬁciency,\n\
    and architectural design. Leccese et al. [157] created a Raspberry-Pi Card-controlled\
    \ SCA\nthat uses a ZigBee Sensor Network and WiMAX to provide completely controlled\
    \ street\nlighting. Sanchez et al. [158] described SmartSantander, an IoT experimental\
    \ research\nfacility that was deployed in Santander City, Spain. SmartSantander\
    \ supports testing\nproposed protocols, services, and conﬁgurations in a realistic\
    \ setting at an appropriate\nscale. Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication is\
    \ a signiﬁcant part of IoT. Vilajosana\nand Dohler [159] reviewed currently used\
    \ smart city M2M technologies (i.e., sensors, data\nloggers, wireless modems,\
    \ and gateway). They considered one of the most famous deploy-\nment use cases,\
    \ i.e., smart parking. In any IoT environment for smart cities, a huge amount\n\
    of M2M communication requests occur. Unfortunately, conventional network gateways\n\
    cannot face this challenge. Huang et al. [160] presented an admission control\
    \ model for\nM2M communications. Their model differentiates all M2M requests into\
    \ delay-sensitive\nand delay-tolerant. Then, it aggregates all delay-tolerant\
    \ requests by routing them into\none low-priority queue, aiming to reduce the\
    \ number of requests from various devices\nto the access point in the IoT for\
    \ smart cities. Silva et al. [161] developed the bottom-up\narchitecture after\
    \ analyzing a variety of existing architectures. This architecture has four\n\
    layers: sensing, transmission, data management, and application. Each layer integrates\n\
    security modules to protect sensitive data. The sensing layer, located at the\
    \ bottom of the\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n34 of 63\narchitecture, collects\
    \ data from physical devices. The transmission layer is located above\nthe sensing\
    \ layer. Several communication technologies are used to transmit data from the\n\
    transmission layer to the (upper) data management layer. The data management layer\n\
    performs data fusion, data analysis, data processing, and data storing. It stores\
    \ valuable\ninformation that various applications use at the application layer\
    \ to provide services.\nThe majority of the above works mainly focus on a single\
    \ characteristic, such as quality\nof service [162].\nMarques et al. [163] proposed\
    \ a generic, multilevel IoT-based smart cities infrastructure\nmanagement architecture\
    \ that allows the integration of physical objects, communication\ninfrastructure,\
    \ cloud platform, and IoT-based services in a pervasive way. This architecture\n\
    (Figure 4) is generic and includes four layers: (1) Physical Objects, (2) Communication,\n\
    (3) Cloud Platform, and (4) Services.\nElectronics 2023, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW\

    \ is used to collect sensor data. A communication de-\nvice can implement different\

    35 of 63\nare processed by a NodeMCU, which communicates with a Local Processing\
    \ unit\nresponsible for gathering information used by the application providing\
    \ a service.\nThe local processing unit brings elements of edge computing, as\
    \ it pushes part of the\ncomputation to edge nodes instead of relying on concentrating\
    \ all the computation in\na centralized remote server.\n2.\nThe Communication\
    \ Layer: The architecture supports a variety of network access\ntechnologies.\
    \ The communication layer supports the implementation of various\nwireless technologies.\
    \ The local processing unit located at the Physical Objects Layer\ndeﬁnes the\
    \ technology to be used and relays data to the communication layer using\nthe\
    \ interface of a network access point.\n3.\nThe Cloud Platform Layer provides\
    \ three services: processing, database queries, and\ndata storage. In the context\
    \ of providing services for smart cities, each of these services\ncan be dynamically\
    \ allocated to satisfy the needs of various applications. Notably,\nonly some\
    \ applications and service types require a cloud platform to operate correctly.\n\
    This layer is offered as part of the infrastructure provided, and its implementation\n\
    is optional.\n4.\nThe Services Layer implements four groups, which are called\
    \ classes of services:\n(I) Surveillance, (II) Transportation and Logistics, (III)\
    \ Infrastructure, and (IV) Tech-\nnology. In each class, different kinds of applications\
    \ can be implemented to deal with\nthe challenges of smart cities.\nThis architecture\
    \ is a generic solution, so the underlying layers are designed to offer\nsupport\
    \ to the applications. Therefore, it can be adapted to the speciﬁc implementa-\n\
    tion of a given service. To this end, the authors adapted their architecture to\
    \ a waste\nmanagement scenario.\nAnother multi-level smart city architecture [164]\
    \ was built on semantic web technolo-\ngies, and its design is mostly used in\
    \ smart city wireless sensor network applications. Data\ncollection, data processing,\
    \ integration and reasoning, and device control and alerts make\nup its four layers.\
    \ Using ontology, a data model, at the network’s edge, Gheisari et al. [165]\n\
    suggested a novel architecture for IoT devices in the smart city that protects\
    \ privacy.\nSaadeh et al. [166] proposed a four-layer architecture for mobile\
    \ object authentication in the\ncontext of IoT smart cities. Their architecture\
    \ is based on the applicability of a proposed hier-\narchical elliptic curve identity-based\
    \ signature authentication protocol. Naranjo et al. [167]\npresented a Fog-based\
    \ smart city network architecture called FogC Architecture Network\n(FOCAN). To\
    \ reduce latency and increase the efﬁciency of services among things with\nvarious\
    \ capabilities, FOCAN is a multi-tier framework in which the applications operating\n\
    on things collaborate to compute, route, and interact with one another through\
    \ the smart\ncity environment. One of FOCAN’s primary beneﬁts is that the IoT\
    \ device can deliver\nservices effectively and with less energy consumption.\n\
    5.2. SDN-IoT Architectures\nSoftware-deﬁned networking (SDN) [168] is an approach\
    \ to enable ﬂexible and efﬁ-\ncient network conﬁguration to enhance a network.\
    \ SDN can provide many advantages\nfor conﬁguring city networks to support different\
    \ applications. For example, SDN can\nimprove the QoS of city networks against\
    \ link failures [169] and meet smart city latency de-\nmands [170]. While some\
    \ efforts are investigating this approach for supporting SCAs, there\nis room\
    \ for developing more advanced management and networking mechanisms in SDN\nfor\
    \ efﬁcient, reliable, and secure network conﬁgurations in smart cities. Jazaeri\
    \ et al. [171]\nconsidered the advantages of integrating edge computing, SDN,\
    \ and IoT technologies and\nreviewed different frameworks and platforms.\nLiu\
    \ et al. [172] proposed an architecture that decouples urban sensing applications\n\
    from the physical infrastructure. In their architecture, centralized controllers\
    \ manage\nphysical devices and offer APIs for data acquisition, transmission,\
    \ and processing services\nto develop urban sensing applications. Bi et al. [173]\
    \ proposed a scalable SDN-enabled\narchitecture that integrates a variety of smart\
    \ city components and provides reliable and\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n36 of\
    \ 63\ntimely scheduling for big data transfer to support smart city services.\
    \ They also studied\nthe time-constrained big data transfer scheduling (TBTS)\
    \ problem under this architecture\nand proposed a heuristic with an intelligent\
    \ scheme that can maximize the throughput and\nschedule the multi-ﬂow transfer\
    \ dynamically.\nIoT systems collect and process data vulnerable to availability,\
    \ integrity, and privacy\nthreats. Nguyen et al. [174] proposed a collaborative\
    \ and intelligent-network-based in-\ntrusion detection system (NIDS) architecture,\
    \ namely, SeArch, for SDN-based cloud IoT\nnetworks. SeArch is a security architecture\
    \ in which an arrangement of three layers of IDS\nnodes, i.e., Edge-IDS, Fog-IDS,\
    \ and Cloud-IDS, is introduced with an effective collaboration\namong nodes.\n\
    Blockchain is an innovative solution for increasing data integrity and privacy\
    \ in smart\ncities [175]. Sharma and Park [176] proposed a novel hybrid network\
    \ architecture for the\nsmart city by exploiting the strength of emerging SDN\
    \ and Blockchain technologies. To\nachieve efﬁciency and address the current limitations,\
    \ their architecture is divided into\ncore and edge networks. By designing a hybrid\
    \ architecture, their architecture inherits\nthe strength of centralized and distributed\
    \ network architectures. “PrivySharing” [177]\nis a Blockchain-based innovative\
    \ framework for privacy-preserving and secure IoT data\nsharing in a smart city\
    \ environment. This framework protects data privacy by segmenting\nthe blockchain\
    \ network into different channels, consisting of a limited number of approved\n\
    businesses and handling a certain category of data, such as health, smart auto,\
    \ smart\nenergy, or ﬁnancial information. Additionally, smart contracts contain\
    \ access control rules\nthat regulate who has access to the users’ data within\
    \ a channel. In addition, private\ndata gathering and encryption are used to further\
    \ isolate and safeguard the data within\na channel.\nIslam et al. [178] designed\
    \ a decentralized and distributed architecture for the IoT\necosystem that addresses\
    \ the existing challenges through the use of the technologies\nBlockchain, SDN,\
    \ and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). This energy-aware architec-\nture\
    \ confronts the problems of scalability, ﬂexibility, complexity, monitoring, managing,\n\
    and collecting IoT data and defends against cyber threats.\n5.3. Architectures\
    \ for Smart Grid\nThe automated and intelligent management of the next-generation\
    \ electric power\nsystems determines their effectiveness and efﬁciency. Smart\
    \ Grid (SG) is the name given to\nthe next generation of electricity systems,\
    \ which are anticipated to offer various beneﬁts\nover the current systems in\
    \ terms of digitization, ﬂexibility, intelligence, resilience, sustain-\nability,\
    \ and customization [179]. Smart transmission infrastructures use new technologies\n\
    to improve power quality. Smart control centers monitor and communicate with electric\n\
    devices remotely in real time, while smart substations self-consciously coordinate\
    \ their local\ndevices. The dispatch of electricity to end-users is implemented\
    \ by using the electrical and\ncommunication infrastructures that connect the\
    \ transmission and customer domains. The\ndistribution domain includes distribution\
    \ feeders and transformers to supply electricity.\nIt interacts with much different\
    \ equipment, such as distributed energy resources (DERs),\nplug-in electric vehicles\
    \ (PEVs), automatic metering infrastructure (AMI), and sensors with\ncommunication\
    \ capability. The distribution domain is responsible for delivering electricity\n\
    to energy consumers, user demands, and energy availability. To provide quality\
    \ electricity,\nthe stability of this domain is monitored and controlled.\nTypical\
    \ applications [44] of the smart grid communications network are automatic\nmeter\
    \ reading, demand response, PEVs, substation automation, and DERs/microgrid.\n\
    DERs are tiny energy production and/or storage devices linked to the distribution\
    \ system.\nDistributed generation (DG), distributed storage (DS), or a combination\
    \ of renewable\nand non-renewable sources are all possible sources for DER. Solar\
    \ panels, wind turbines,\ncombustion turbines, fuel cells, battery storage systems,\
    \ etc., are a few examples of DER.\nAn electric power system with one or more\
    \ DER units and loads is referred to as a microgrid.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n\
    37 of 63\nThe communication infrastructure in the smart grid supports the capabilities\
    \ of the\nsmart grid and complies with performance standards. This infrastructure\
    \ connects a huge\nnumber of electric devices and manages complex device communications.\
    \ As a result, it is\nbuilt in a hierarchical architecture with interconnected\
    \ individual sub-networks, and each\nsub-network is responsible for separate geographical\
    \ regions. The extremely dispersed\nsmaller area networks that support the power\
    \ systems at various locations are connected by\nWANs, which act as the communication’s\
    \ backbone. When the control centers are located a\ngreat distance from the substations\
    \ or the end-users, the real-time measurements made at\nthe electric devices are\
    \ transported to the control centers through the WANs, and in the\nopposite direction,\
    \ the WANs carry out the instruction communications from the control\ncenters\
    \ to the electric devices.\nThe authors of [43] present a communication architecture\
    \ in an SG. This architecture\nincludes (1) an energy smart house with electric\
    \ appliances connected to the smart grid,\n(2) a residential complex with AMI,\
    \ (3) a residential subdivision installed with solar panels,\n(4) a PEV charging\
    \ station, (5) a power substation, and (6) power transmission lines. In this\n\
    architecture, the Internet and ISPs serve as the backbone in connecting the distributed\
    \ sub-\nnetworks. Demertzis et al. [180] presented and categorized the communication\
    \ network\nstandards that have been established for smart grids and should be\
    \ considered in planning\nand implementing new infrastructures. Such standards\
    \ are IEC 61850 for substation\nautomation. This standard is based on open architecture\
    \ and incorporates sampling\nand timing synchronization speciﬁcations based on\
    \ IEEE 1588 in LANs and WANs [181].\nNotably, IEEE 1588 is the standard for a\
    \ precision clock synchronization protocol for\nnetworked measurement and control\
    \ systems [182].\nDue to the widespread use of renewable energy resources (RERs)\
    \ throughout the\npower grid, it is anticipated that electric power distribution\
    \ networks in smart grids would\nundergo signiﬁcant changes to accommodate the\
    \ nature of non-radial power ﬂow. For the\nmost part, the low-voltage distribution\
    \ networks where RERs (such as solar cells) may be\nattached are not monitored\
    \ by the majority of the present supervisory control and data ac-\nquisition (SCADA)\
    \ systems for power grids. For the goal of active monitoring and control,\nAbdrabou\
    \ [183] presented a multi-hop wireless network with a cellular frequency-reuse\n\
    structure that may supply the communication infrastructure to dense low-voltage\
    \ distribu-\ntion networks. A position-based QoS-aware routing protocol was also\
    \ presented as a useful\nmethod for prioritizing data transfer across the newly\
    \ introduced network architecture.\nHetGrid [184] is a unique overlay network\
    \ design with a speciﬁc QoS routing method\nfor power distribution grid applications.\
    \ It delivers QoS assurances across the network\nwhile taking into account three\
    \ factors: bandwidth, latency, and dependability. The authors\ncreated two components\
    \ to accomplish this:\n•\nA multipath routing mechanism that compensates critical\
    \ applications for their high-\nreliability requirements by using end-to-end physically\
    \ disjoint paths, and\n•\nAltruistic resource allocation with the QoS routing\
    \ mechanism that targets communi-\ncation with QoS guarantees for applications\
    \ with strict QoS requirements.\nThe ﬁndings in [184] show that the HetGrid overlay\
    \ network architecture enables ex-\ntremely effective, trustworthy, and QoS-aware\
    \ communication in heterogeneous networks.\nThe major characteristics that set\
    \ SG apart from the standard electrical power grid are\nthe ability to execute\
    \ two-way communication, demand-side management, and real-time\npricing. The present\
    \ SG systems have interoperability problems because they need to\nbe protocol\
    \ independent. Therefore, global communication network management and\nmonitoring\
    \ approaches have been proposed using SDN [185]. Thanks to SDN, network\nadministrators\
    \ may more efﬁciently manage their networks by separating the control plane\n\
    from the data plane. SDN has advanced in SG due to its reliance on communication\n\
    networks. SDN implementation in SG systems has the potential to increase efﬁciency\n\
    and resilience. SDN can assist the SG in integrating several SG standards and\
    \ protocols\nby virtue of its programmability, protocol independence, and granularity\
    \ capabilities to\ncope with varied communication systems. Rehmani et al. [185]\
    \ presented SDN-based\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n38 of 63\nSGC architectures,\
    \ along with case studies. They discussed routing schemes for SDN-\nbased SGC\
    \ and provided a detailed survey of security and privacy schemes applied to\n\
    SDN-based SGC.\nAlam et al. [186] provided a detailed survey on smart grid communication\
    \ networks in\nterms of communication network requirements, architecture, technologies,\
    \ and applications.\nThey proposed a Cognitive Radio (CR)-based Communication\
    \ Network for Smart Grid.\nCR is a software-deﬁned radio (SDR) platform that can\
    \ quickly reconﬁgure its operating\nparameters, such as modulation/demodulation,\
    \ compression algorithm, and error coding\ntechniques, according to changing circumstances\
    \ and requirements, through cognition. In\nsuch an SDR platform, radio transceivers\
    \ can switch functions and operations on demand\nonly. Molokomme et al. [187]\
    \ reviewed architectures that aim to accomplish the various\nand strict QoS requirements\
    \ in SG communication systems.\nWireless communication networks have been motivated\
    \ to harvest energy from\nambient environments and run energy-efﬁciently for economic\
    \ and ecological beneﬁts\nthrough improvements in the smart power grid and the\
    \ advocacy of “green communica-\ntions”. Hu et al. [188] examined recent developments\
    \ in energy harvesting, redistribution,\ntrade, and planning for future wireless\
    \ networks integrating with smart grids. The authors\nconsidered the optimization\
    \ of various energy-harvesting wireless systems as well as tradi-\ntional models\
    \ of renewable energy-harvesting technologies. Moreover, they discussed how\n\
    to distribute redundant (unused) energy generated by cellular networks, plan for\
    \ energy\nunder dynamic pricing when smart grids are in place, and engage in two-way\
    \ energy\ntrading using smart grids.\nFrom a different viewpoint, including IoT\
    \ devices and providing connectivity, au-\ntomation, and monitoring for such devices\
    \ enables SG systems to sustain multiple network\noperations during the generation,\
    \ distribution, transmission, and expenditure of energy.\nNumerous IoT-aided SG\
    \ systems have been proposed in the literature. The survey [189] on\nIoT-aided\
    \ SG systems considers the systems’ current architectures, uses, and prototypes.\n\
    5.4. Architectures for Smart Buildings\nThere are various building applications\
    \ such as heating, cooling, load control, air\nquality, ventilation, lighting,\
    \ water management, and cooking gas management. A smart\nbuilding incorporates\
    \ the major building systems on a common network and functionality\nto provide\
    \ operational efﬁciency, ﬁre safety, and security. A smart building architecture\n\
    (SBA) manages several real-time domains, including automated temperature regulation,\n\
    air cleaning, HVAC systems, and humidity control (i.e., indoor environment regulation\n\
    and monitoring); smart lighting and controlling home appliances (energy management);\
    \ a\nsmart ﬁre detection system; and other building operations. A typical smart\
    \ building [190]\nhas security cameras, lighting sensors, an indoor air quality\
    \ system, a ﬁre alarm system, a\nwater management system, and an energy management\
    \ system. Moreover, it can detect\nintrusion and supports HVAC services.\nDiverse\
    \ SBAs include complex operational systems, sensing, and communication\ntechnologies.\
    \ Such architectures have converged into an IP-based architecture. This con-\n\
    vergence is occurring rapidly with the increased usage of IP-based smart devices\
    \ driven\nthrough IoT concerning conventional building management and smart buildings.\
    \ Tradi-\ntionally, numerous building systems utilized varied forms of networking\
    \ protocols and\ncabling systems. This variety makes the whole system more complex\
    \ and highly infeasible\nfrom both a deployment and a system administration standpoint\
    \ [191]. SBAs entail making\nplans for and assisting with the inclusion of operational\
    \ technologies that improve the\napplication’s, service’s, or provision’s operational\
    \ steps while also boosting the well-being\nof its users. Researchers, policymakers,\
    \ and implementers should pay attention to several\ncrucial issues, such as reliable\
    \ communication/connection procedures, power-efﬁcient\nmeasures, competent security\
    \ measures, efﬁcient sensors and actuators, and data analyt-\nics procedures.\
    \ Amalgamating new systems and technologies with conventional (base)\ntechnologies\
    \ to accomplish the revelation of SBAs, includes, but is not limited to, WSN\n\
    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n39 of 63\ndeployment; advanced power-aware trafﬁc\
    \ engineering policies; cloud, edge, and fog com-\nputing paradigms; big data\
    \ engineering and analytics; and human–computer interaction\nprocedures [192].\
    \ The rapid development of ICT technologies has enhanced the connect-\nedness\
    \ of intelligent sensing, actuators, and communication devices to real-time physical\n\
    entities. Recently, smart sensing mechanisms, actuators, and data harvesting technology\n\
    have boosted the area of SBAs proposals. However, choosing the best ICT technologies\
    \ for\na particular smart building domain poses signiﬁcant difﬁculties, including\
    \ heterogeneity\nof IoT devices and applications, workable networking protocols\
    \ and architectures, power\nefﬁciency, and QoS/QoE provisioning [190,193]. One\
    \ solution is the SDN paradigm, which\nmanages the network more efﬁciently than\
    \ a customary one. SDN also assists network\nservices, including storage, routing,\
    \ dynamic bandwidth management, and QoS. Hence,\nthese simpliﬁcations offer a\
    \ creative environment through the implementation of proper\nsoftware tools for\
    \ smart buildings. Network architecture and its implementation for in-\ntelligent\
    \ infrastructure is based on IoT relationships (between IoT in home automation\n\
    and applications) and can be established using smart home Cloud Computing based\
    \ on\nSDN. Recently, Younus et al. [190] proposed an SDN architecture that improves\
    \ critical SB\nparameters such as bandwidth efﬁciency, energy efﬁciency, latency,\
    \ security, and reliability.\nSilva et al. [194] presented a Web of Things (WoT)\

    \ application programming interface (API). The RESTful\nAPI employs HTTP requests\
    \ (e.g., GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE) to access and use WoT\ndata. Regarding network\
    \ performance and smart building power management, the authors\nshowed how their\
    \ recommendation for smart city architecture improved performance.\nSmart sensing\
    \ devices and actuators permit collecting, monitoring, controlling, or\nmodifying\
    \ vital building parameters so that users receive the best QoS/QoE possible. These\n\
    functionalities depend on sensor integration competence and their properties.\
    \ These sys-\ntems comprise signal conditioning circuits, implanted algorithms,\
    \ power, and transceiver\nmodules [195]. Researchers developed such system-based\
    \ SBAs for assessing and regulat-\ning air quality, smart lighting systems, ﬁre\
    \ detection systems, power management, and\nother basic building operations.\n\
    An indoor-air-quality-based SBA considers sensing and actuator-based systems for\n\
    monitoring and regulating air quality parameters. An indoor environmental observing\n\
    system was initially suggested in [196] that observes polluting gases, temperature,\
    \ and\nrelative humidity. Other kinds of such systems have been proposed in [197,198].\
    \ Con-\nsidering smart indoor lighting systems, numerous solutions have been proposed\
    \ in the\nliterature. In SBAs, light sensors manage and track the lighting system\
    \ to satisfy the users’\nneeds. The authors of [199] shed light on power consumption\
    \ reduction via energy-efﬁcient\nsmart lighting systems. Today’s smart building\
    \ employs low-power usage LED-based\nlight sources that last longer than Compact\
    \ Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) [200]. In reality, the\ndevelopment of control technologies,\
    \ heterogeneous networks, and embedded systems\nhas made it promising to create\
    \ smart innovative lighting systems that can effectively\naddress the problem\
    \ of energy conservation. Researchers have recently begun testing by\nintegrating\
    \ different power-saving techniques in a single illumination system for improved\n\
    energy efﬁciency while enhancing lighting performance without sacriﬁcing user\
    \ satisfac-\ntion. According to the authors of [201], using several cheap detectors,\
    \ as opposed to a\nsingle expensive sensor, would result in improved performance\
    \ and higher power savings.\nConsidering the same motivation, various authors\
    \ [202–204] have suggested similar types\nof smart lighting systems for several\
    \ room types, such as classrooms and ofﬁces. In [205],\nthe authors provide a\
    \ deep and profound study concerning smart lighting systems focusing\non power\
    \ savings procedures and connectivity alternatives as well as the integration\
    \ of\nvisible light communication technology [206].\nRecently, researchers focused\
    \ on two main goals, namely, occupants’ work perfor-\nmance and thermal comfort,\
    \ to propose effective SBAs. Hence, many Occupant-Oriented\nTechnologies (OOT)\
    \ have been put forth by academics who want to maximize thermal\ncomfort while\
    \ conserving energy. OOT-based systems offer a practical way to lessen the\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n40 of 63\ndrawbacks of the automatic control used today. In\
    \ practice, thermal comfort analysis is\nbased on parallel objective and subjective\
    \ evaluation. The objective evaluation comprises\nmonitoring, assessing, and recording\
    \ the status of environmental parameters through dedi-\ncated sensors and instruments\
    \ following standardized guidelines. Subjective evaluation\ninvolves monitoring,\
    \ assessing, and recording thermal preference, thermal sensation, and\nthermal\
    \ environment acceptance. Further thermal comfort sensor results as the cumulative\n\
    method to both above-mentioned analysis can be found in [193].\nGreen building\
    \ refers to SBAs with an ambient intelligence system that adjusts to\npredetermined\
    \ circumstances in real-world situations. In this situation, the system makes\n\
    full use of embedded sensors in an environment that can gather data and subsequently\n\
    allow the system to act in accordance with that data. The ambient intelligence\
    \ concept aims\nto conserve natural resources with limited and efﬁcient use of\
    \ them to offer comfort to the\noccupants. Through unconventional energy sources,\
    \ it also meets some of the conventional\nenergy requirements [207]. Many aspects\
    \ of SBAs, such as security, monitoring, and\npower efﬁciency, are the subject\
    \ of extensive study. However, one of the most important\nfunctions of an SB system\
    \ is to control the interior climate, which is typically done by\nHVAC systems\
    \ [208]. The performance of HVAC systems in the instance of commercial\nbuildings\
    \ for frequency regulations has been demonstrated by the authors of [209] for\
    \ this\ncontext. Their demonstrated numerical experiments suggest that 15% of\
    \ rated fan energy\ncan be employed for regulation use while having a minor effect\
    \ on a building’s indoor\ntemperature. The method of computational control for\
    \ passive and active sources was\nused in another scheme [210]. The authors emphasized\
    \ the problem that the ambient and\nactive sources of lighting, heating, ventilation,\
    \ cooling, and shading are not synchronized\nin buildings. Such a computational\
    \ control scheme is also suitable for reducing daily power\nusage. Similarly,\
    \ numerous methods [211–213] considering HVAC systems have been\nproposed with\
    \ respect to frequency regulation, predictive control, and smart controller.\n\
    An IoT-assisted HVAC smart system tracks environmental situations. It also notiﬁes\n\
    when measurements exceed thresholds and provides data on energy usage and consump-\n\
    tion. In addition, it can autonomously turn equipment intermittently at programmed\n\
    times. As individuals spend more time indoors (at home, work, or in other enclosed\
    \ spaces)\nthan outdoors, the air quality inside buildings should be improved\
    \ along with that of the\nexternal surroundings. This is the task of indoor Air\
    \ Quality Monitoring Systems (AQMS).\nThe basic parts of an AQMS (Figure 5) are\
    \ a sensor array, a processing/display unit, a signal\nconditioning circuit, a\
    \ small amount of external memory, and a communication module\nthat is typically\
    \ wireless. A sensor array is a group of specialized micro-sensors that can\n\
    detect certain airborne concentrations of gases such as NOX, SOX, CO2, CO, and\
    \ O3, as\nwell as some essential environmental parameters such as humidity and\
    \ temperature. These\nsensors are connected to a GUI unit that shows the values\
    \ of the real-time indoor air quality\nparameters and an external memory used\
    \ to store real-time data [214]. When deploying\nsuch systems, various communication\
    \ (wireless) modules, including WiFi, ZigBee, and\nLoRAWAN technologies, are considered.\n\

    \ capabilities.\n5.5. Smart Water and Pipeline Network Monitoring\nRetroﬁtting\
    \ the traditional water distribution system with smart devices has some\nbeneﬁts,\
    \ including lower utility costs, lower consumer bills, and less water loss [222,223].\n\
    For example, smart water sensors can keep an eye on the pressure online and alert\
    \ utilities\nto pressure changes or large pressure losses in the water network,\
    \ allowing them to remotely\nadjust the pressure to save energy consumption [224].\
    \ Automation can be used for both\noperational procedures and components that\
    \ provide functionality. For instance, when a\nwater problem occurs during operation\
    \ or with the element itself, the smart components\ninform the system center and\
    \ then take action to avert a crash. The water utility can also\ndetermine a sensor’s\
    \ requirement for maintenance or replacement thanks to the automatic\nself-veriﬁcation\
    \ mechanism [225].\nIn [226], the authors suggest an IoT-based smart water grid\
    \ architecture that includes\ntechnical systems, functions, and a hierarchy framework.\
    \ Moreover, this smart water\nsystem (SWS) also comprises smart sensing mechanisms,\
    \ simulation procedures, diag-\nnostic techniques, disposal, warning, and control\
    \ mechanisms. Although an SWS incor-\nporates ofﬂine performance, real-time performance\
    \ is deﬁned by online procedures such\nas online data monitoring, online data\
    \ assimilation, online modeling, online charting,\nand online results output.\
    \ An SWS must have real-time functionality to implement the\nnecessary smart features\
    \ [227]. Researchers put a lot of effort [228] into developing wa-\nter systems\
    \ that operate intelligently. Real-time modeling, real-time sampling, real-time\n\
    controlling, etc., which seek to reduce the lag between system input and system\
    \ output,\nshould be added to the smart performance of SWS. It was discovered\
    \ that using SCADA\nwould considerably increase the data transfer efﬁciency [229].\
    \ A smart water architec-\nture [230] often includes ﬁve layers: (1) the physical\
    \ layer; (2) the sensing and control layer;\n(3) the communication layer; (4)\
    \ the data management layer; and (5) the data fusion layer.\nWithin the framework\
    \ of the GST4Water project, the authors of [230] presented a system\nthat allows\
    \ for receiving consumption data sent by a generic smart meter installed in a\n\
    user’s house and transferring them to a cloud platform. The consumption data are\
    \ saved\nand processed to characterize leakage at the district meter area and\
    \ the individual user level.\nMeanwhile, the processed data are returned to the\
    \ Water Utility and can be used for billing.\nOn the other hand, they provide\
    \ regular feedback to the user, thus gaining full awareness\nof their consumption\
    \ behavior. Panagiotakopoulos et al. [231] presented an IoT framework\nbased on\
    \ FIWARE that aims to realize a highly ﬂexible standards-based open-source soft-\n\
    ware solution for developing SWSs. They designed an architecture consisting of\
    \ various\nFIWARE software components and two dashboard applications. Amaxilatis\
    \ et al. [232]\nconsidered numerous intelligent infrastructure solutions regarding\
    \ conventional water\nmetering systems, which effectively facilitate uninterrupted\
    \ bi-directional (whenever re-\nquired) data exchange between water ﬂow devices,\
    \ metering equipment, and end-users.\nThe authors’ ultimate objective is to design,\
    \ implement, and deploy more sophisticated\ninfrastructure offering improved performance\
    \ in bigger smart city infrastructure. To limit\nthe amount of data that needs\
    \ to be shared between the various system layers, their ap-\nproach makes use\
    \ of the FogC paradigm to develop the infrastructure for the smart water\ngrid\
    \ model.\nThe Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Solutions for the\
    \ Efﬁcient\nWater Resources Management project was funded by the European Commission\
    \ under the\nauspices of the Seventh Framework Program (FP7). The goal of the\
    \ Smart Water project is\nto examine the role of ICT in monitoring and effectively\
    \ managing urban water systems,\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n44 of 63\nwith a\
    \ focus on the deployment of sensors, communication technologies, and related\n\
    decision support systems in utility providers’ water networks to address issues\
    \ such as\nleakage management, demand management, asset management, and so forth.\
    \ Kulkarni\nand Farnham [233] focused on the issues surrounding wireless connectivity,\
    \ proposed\na framework for assessing potential solutions based on the total cost\
    \ of ownership, and\nhighlighted lessons learned from two European utilities’\
    \ Smart Water case studies.\nPipelines are used to transport water, gases, and\
    \ oil. Since they are frequently under-\nground, the humid atmosphere easily erodes\
    \ them, which may result in leaks. In addition,\nwater in the pipelines may get\
    \ contaminated by infectious agents or substances that are\nmistakenly or purposely\
    \ introduced into the system. As a result, maintaining pipeline\nnetworks is crucial\
    \ for maintaining public health and protecting the environment. The sen-\nsor\
    \ node deployment profoundly impacts the sensing performance indicators for pipeline\n\
    network monitoring, including coverage area, coverage population, and detection\
    \ time.\nThe sensor nodes should typically be positioned near the pipeline network’s\
    \ junctions [234].\nGiven the design of the pipeline network, the optimal sensor\
    \ node deployment challenges\nare therefore formulated as integer optimization\
    \ problems, where the integer variables\nrepresent the maximum amount of sensor\
    \ nodes that must be placed at each junction. The\ndeployment difﬁculties for\
    \ pipeline network monitoring are typically challenging to solve\nbecause of the\
    \ integer decision variables.\nPipeline network ﬂows are not predictable. As a\
    \ result, depending on the ﬂow pattern,\nthe sensing performance of a deployed\
    \ sensor node may vary. As a result, the ﬂow pattern\nis taken into account in\
    \ [235], which formulates a mix-integer optimization problem to\ndecide how to\
    \ deploy sensor nodes to reduce the projected population at risk of malicious\n\
    contamination. The authors solved the ensuing mix-integer optimization using a\
    \ branch\nand bound technique. Even though a strategy such as this can identify\
    \ the ideal answer,\nthe time complexity is typically signiﬁcant. This means that\
    \ large pipeline networks cannot\nbe used with the method. Similarly, the study\
    \ in [236] considers the various demand\npatterns of water ﬂows through pipes.\
    \ The authors used a genetic-based method to ﬁnd the\nbest deployment locations\
    \ to increase coverage under various monitoring station demand\npatterns. The\
    \ global optimum of these heuristic algorithms could take a while to reach.\n\
    The performance of the algorithms may also be impacted by their parameter choices.\n\
    Consequently, we do not advise using it for massive pipeline networks.\nSingapore’s\
    \ WaterWise@SG program aims to identify pipeline leaks and anticipate\nburst incidents\
    \ [237,238]. PipeNet has also been put to the test in Boston to ﬁnd pipeline\n\
    leaks, where three tiers of nodes are employed to quantify pH levels and pressure.\
    \ To\nreduce water waste, a system named IWCMSE [239] has been designed to track\
    \ water\nconsumption for businesses. A Steamﬂood and Waterﬂood Tracking System\
    \ [240] has been\ncreated to ﬁnd irregularities in pipeline systems, such as leaks\
    \ and bottlenecks. With the\naid of all these technologies, the investigators\
    \ had the opportunity to evaluate the efﬁciency\nof the monitoring algorithms.\
    \ However, these technologies rely on ﬁxed sensors, and we\nstill need to put\
    \ innovative testbed models and systems built around crowd sensing and\nmobile\
    \ WSN into place.\n5.6. Architectures for Smart Transportation\nThe Internet-of-Vehicles\
    \ (IoV, also known as V2X) aims to reduce trafﬁc congestion\nand accidents. It\
    \ also enables information exchange involving the vehicle and all entities\nthat\
    \ may have an impact on it. Vehicle networking and vehicle intelligence are the\
    \ two\ntechnologies that underpin IoV implementation. The three components that\
    \ compose\nvehicle networking are the onboard information service, VANET, and\
    \ mobile network.\nVANET stands for vehicle-to-vehicle short-range communication.\
    \ Providing remote loca-\ntion, remote diagnostics, navigation, and other information\
    \ services is referred to as an\nonboard information service. Every car can be\
    \ utilized as a potent mobile terminal thanks\nto mobile networks. Vehicle intelligence\
    \ is the use of cutting-edge technologies, including\nartiﬁcial intelligence (AI),\
    \ big data analytics, deep learning (DL), and cognitive computing\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n45 of 63\n(CogC), to facilitate information sharing among people\
    \ and vehicles, as well as between\nvehicles and the environment, infrastructure,\
    \ or other vehicles.\nVehicular networks consist of data-gathering sensors and\
    \ inter-vehicle communica-\ntion systems. Such networks require an open and ﬂexible\
    \ layered architecture to handle\ncharacteristics such as interoperability, scalability,\
    \ dependability, and modularity. Recently,\nthe research community proposed efﬁcient\
    \ vehicle network architectures. For example,\nthe Universal IoV (UIoV) architecture\
    \ [241] includes seven layers. Offering services and\nchoosing messaging protocols\
    \ are tasks that fall within the application layer. Data prepro-\ncessing, big\
    \ data processing, and intelligent transmission are all tasks that the multimedia\n\
    and big data layer is in charge of. For IoV systems, the cloud service layer’s\
    \ ClCom and\ncloud virtualization technologies offer hardware computing platforms,\
    \ infrastructure, and\nsoftware services. In the UIoV architecture, the communication\
    \ layer and the intra–inter\ndevices layer are merged to accomplish the connectivity\
    \ of many heterogeneous objects\nand networks. Notably, there is no intra–inter\
    \ devices layer in classical architecture. The\nUIoV system’s physical objects\
    \ layer gathers and transmits all the data to the intra–inter\ndevices layer for\
    \ additional processing. In the IoV, both vehicles and non-vehicle items are\n\
    identiﬁed using the Identiﬁcation Layer.\nLiu et al. [242] suggested another IoV\
    \ network architecture to increase the ﬂexibility of\napplication management while\
    \ enhancing the scalability and dependability of information\nservices. This architecture\
    \ has four layers in total, the data layer of which has a variety\nof nodes with\
    \ various wireless communication interfaces. Because the topology of IoV\nis frequently\
    \ changed, an immense quantity of data are frequently produced and trans-\nmitted\
    \ at the data layer. To safeguard the accurate semantics of the underlying resources,\n\
    the virtualization layer splits a few nodes into fog nodes and the network, computation,\n\
    communication, and storage resources in IoV. To execute applications such as road\
    \ safety\nmanagement and data sensing, the control layer’s SDN controller is responsible\
    \ for schedul-\ning the abstraction resources of the virtualization layer and\
    \ interacting with the application\nlayer. A difﬁcult topic in network architecture\
    \ design is dealing with diverse networks.\nInteroperability, scalability, dependability,\
    \ and adaptability are some of its network features.\nThe design seeks to increase\
    \ layer separation and network architecture’s total number of\nlayers. In addition\
    \ to being a service-oriented design, the IoV architecture should facilitate\n\
    the connectivity of cars with heterogeneous networks and other communication devices.\n\
    By introducing the CogC paradigm into autonomous driving systems, the learning\
    \ ability\nof autonomous vehicles can be effectively improved. Utilizing both\
    \ physical and network\ndata space, the Cognitive Internet of Vehicles (CIoV)\
    \ paradigm [243] improves network\nsecurity and transportation safety. CIoV enables\
    \ IoV to bear more accurate perceptive\nability through cognition in the intra-vehicle\
    \ network (driver, passengers, smart devices,\netc.), inter-vehicle network (adjacent\
    \ intelligent vehicles), and beyond-vehicle network\n(road environment, cellular\
    \ network, edge nodes, remote cloud, etc.). The CIoV architecture\nincludes a\
    \ cognitive data engine that can conduct cognition of user tasks by the use of\n\
    data collected, e.g., driving behavior model analysis, emotion analysis, and road\
    \ condition\ninvestigation. Five layers are present in the network architecture\
    \ of CIoV. The gathering\nand preprocessing of big data from several sources are\
    \ done by the sensing layer. As\nopposed to the previous communication layer (of\
    \ other architectures), the architecture’s\ncommunication layer uses a cloud/edge\
    \ hybrid structure to accommodate various applica-\ntion schedules. The data cognition\
    \ engine at the cognition layer processes and interprets\nheterogeneous data streams\
    \ (machine learning (ML), DL, data mining, etc.) using a variety\nof cognitive\
    \ analysis approaches. The control layer’s resource awareness engine is in\ncharge\
    \ of allocating and scheduling network resources with the aid of technologies\
    \ such\nas NFV, SDN, network slicing, and self-organized networking (SON). There\
    \ are primar-\nily two categories in the application layer (i.e., usual application\
    \ services and intelligent\ntransportation applications).\nEfﬁcient message authentication\
    \ and integrity are required to guarantee vehicle pri-\nvacy and safeguard vehicular\
    \ communications. To protect V2V and V2I communications\nElectronics 2023, 12,\
    \ 2490\n46 of 63\nin the context of the VANET against a broad range of cyber threats,\
    \ Karim [244] provided\na cryptography-based routing solution. This solution includes\
    \ a data encryption and de-\ncryption mechanism based on attributes and identity\
    \ that has the lowest computational\noverhead while keeping the optimum level\
    \ of security. Contreras-Castillo et al. [245]\nsuggested a seven-layer network\
    \ architecture. The user interface layer, which controls infor-\nmation exchange\
    \ between the user and the vehicle, is the top layer. Utilizing roadside units\n\
    (RSUs) and onboard sensors, the data collecting layer gathers data. The pre-processing\n\
    and ﬁltering layer eliminates the unnecessary information from the gathered data\
    \ before\nsending the remaining information to the communication layer for transmission.\
    \ Making\nchoices and managing network service providers are the responsibilities\
    \ of control and\nmanagement. Large volumes of data must be processed by the processing\
    \ layer to create\nthe pertinent data needed for various applications. To stop\
    \ assaults, the security layer\ndirectly manages each of the layers above. A unique\
    \ network architecture with enhanced\nthroughput, reduced latency, higher security,\
    \ and widespread connectivity was recently\nproposed by Ji et al. [246]. This\
    \ architecture consists of four layers:\n1.\nSecurity authentication layer: The\
    \ RSUs on the road may monitor trafﬁc environment\ndata in real-time after setting\
    \ several sensors, surveillance footage, and radar. This\nlayer determines the\
    \ legality of the car and RSU that are requesting to join the network.\nPerhaps\
    \ an illegal vehicle or an RSU that has been installed unlawfully will attempt\n\
    to steal or alter the information of a real vehicle.\n2.\nData acquisition layer:\
    \ This layer collects and categorizes many types of data from\nvarious networks.\
    \ To ensure that the data can be sent to the edge layer securely, it\ndigitizes\
    \ the data.\n3.\nEdge layer: Edge devices produce several data streams. As a result,\
    \ processing and\nanalyzing data in one go using ClCom will result in signiﬁcant\
    \ delays. As a result, we\nmust process data more closely related to the data\
    \ source. The edge node, a physical\ndevice situated closest to the data source,\
    \ is used by the edge layer to carry out basic\nprocessing and analysis on the\
    \ acquired local data. It releases data analysis ﬁndings\nfor nearby trafﬁc incidents\
    \ and current road conditions in real-time, then creates a\nlocal decision-making\
    \ plan, carrying out various ClCom jobs and boosting the cloud\ndata center’s\
    \ computing power.\n4.\nCloud Platform Layer: The cloud data center analyses the\
    \ information it has collected\nabout global trafﬁc in this tier, develops a plan,\
    \ and rationally distributes trafﬁc\nresources. This layer, having the ability\
    \ to implement connection management, data\nmanagement, aided autonomous driving,\
    \ intelligent navigation, path planning, and\ninformation security, is the “smart\
    \ brain” of the IoV.\nA blockchain-based vehicle network architecture (Block-VN)\
    \ for the smart city was\npresented in [247]. Building innovative distributed\
    \ transport management systems is made\npossible by the robust and secure Block-VN\
    \ architecture. The authors considered how the\nnetwork of vehicles evolves with\
    \ paradigms focused on networking and vehicular informa-\ntion. To handle real-time\
    \ transportation data, Jan et al. [248] created a model for assessing\ntransportation\
    \ data using Spark and Hadoop. This model/system is separated into four\nlayers:\
    \ data collection and acquisition, network, data processing, and application.\
    \ Each\nlayer is built to process and manage data in a structured manner. On the\
    \ data processing\nlayer, Hadoop and Spark are used to test the data. By utilizing\
    \ the suggested event and\ndecision mechanism based on Named Data Networking [249],\
    \ the data are made available\nto a smart community member. The suggested approach\
    \ was examined using transporta-\ntion datasets from some reliable sources. The\
    \ outcomes demonstrate data processing and\nreal-time distribution to citizens\
    \ in the shortest amount of time. Spark with the Hadoop\nenvironment produces\
    \ ﬁndings that are quite accurate. From another viewpoint, Social\nIoV (SIoV)\
    \ are a breed of socially aware ephemeral networks [250], where vehicular nodes\n\
    share/exchange information with different entities and are thus forth comparable\
    \ with\ntraditional social networks. Kerrache et al. [251] proposed a trust-aware\
    \ communication\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n47 of 63\narchitecture for social\
    \ IoV (TACASHI), which offers a trust-aware social in-vehicle and\ninter-vehicle\
    \ communication architecture for SIoVs.\n5.7. Architectures for Smart Rural Areas/Smart\
    \ Villages\nThe smart village paradigm digitizes various aspects of rural activities\
    \ using IoT\ntechnologies. In the countryside, a variety of activities are carried\
    \ out, including smart\nagriculture, waste management, irrigation management,\
    \ livestock management, smart\nenergy, smart healthcare, and smart education.\
    \ A smart village or smart rural area can\nenable real-time data analytics and\
    \ automate decision-making for local villagers regard-\ning healthcare, agriculture,\
    \ environment, transportation, and energy. It differs from a\nsmart city as there\
    \ are key differences (e.g., low cost, infrastructure, and sustainability)\nbetween\
    \ urban and rural environments [252]. To realize the smart village goal, The Euro-\n\
    pean Commission (2017) [253] launched an action plan, in which it proposed to\
    \ interfere\nICTs in villages. Cambra-Fierro and Pérez [254] addressed the meaning\
    \ of “smart” in\nrural contexts as well as its link with sustainability. The European\
    \ Commission-funded\nSmart Rural 21 initiative [255], which has the ultimate goal\
    \ of encouraging and motivat-\ning communities to create and execute smart village\
    \ methods and tactics throughout\nEurope as a tool for rural development, serving\
    \ as the authors’ primary source. IEEE\nSmart Village [256] also supports the\
    \ world’s energy-impoverished communities by pro-\nviding a complete solution\
    \ combining renewable energy, community-based education, and\nentrepreneurial\
    \ opportunities.\nMalik et al. [257] discussed the implementation details of smart\
    \ villages with different\ntechnologies. They concluded that digitization is only\
    \ possible if a reliable and robust net-\nwork and communication infrastructure\
    \ are installed in the village environment. Shrestha\nand Drozdenko [258] proposed\
    \ a Smart Rural framework to mitigate the effects of climate\nchange using IoT\
    \ and the Cloud, building a prototype on the Louisiana Tech University\ncampus.\
    \ Their framework is an energy-efﬁcient monitoring system for observing the envi-\n\
    ronmental conditions that affect agricultural production and human health. It\
    \ consists of\nthe following subsystems: Wireless Sensor Nodes, Fog Server, Cloud\
    \ Services, and a Web\nDashboard. The dashboard converts raw sensor data into\
    \ meaningful information from\nwhich public ofﬁcials and residents can adapt to\
    \ or frustrate the effects of climate change.\nMonzon Baeza and Alvarez Marban\
    \ [259] proposed a ﬂexible and scalable Smart Rural\nsystem for gathering and\
    \ processing IoT data from remote rural areas with no traditional\ncommunication\
    \ coverage as a handicap. The authors offered an architecture structured in\n\
    separate segments using IoT, 5G, Cloud, and High-Altitude Platform Station (HAPS).\
    \ Their\nproposal is applied to the rural environment to thus cover all the needs\
    \ of the system in the\ncollection of IoT data from these remote rural areas,\
    \ its coverage by space vehicles, and its\nprocessing and storage through 5G terrestrial\
    \ networks and cloud services. Their proposal\nincludes the deployment of IoT\
    \ sensors and the development of Amazon Web Services.\nConversely, the part of\
    \ the space segment, considered by HAPS, has been simulated for\ndifferent space\
    \ channels. This method provides a complete and automated smart rural\nsystem\
    \ that allows access to these IoT data from remote rural areas through the Internet.\
    \ To\nprovide secure services close to end-devices, Aljuhani et al. [260] explored\
    \ the integration\nof a Distributed Fog Computing (DFC) network architecture with\
    \ IoT in improving security\nand privacy solutions for villagers and consumer\
    \ electronic (CE) devices. As a case study,\nthe authors designed and evaluated\
    \ the performance of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)\nin a DFC-based smart\
    \ village environment. Moreover, they discussed open security issues\nand challenges\
    \ regarding Fog-to-Things enabled smart villages. Rohan et al. [261] proposed\n\
    a collaborative edge-computing architecture considering the resource constraints\
    \ in a smart\nvillage. The authors illustrated the concept of collaborative edge\
    \ computing as applicable\nto reduce cost and better manage the existing infrastructural\
    \ facilities. Collaboration occurs\nbetween the multiple IoT edge devices (e.g.,\
    \ the edge data centers or edge routers) for data\nprocessing and storage. For\
    \ example, in times of high computational load demand, one\nvillage’s edge devices\
    \ can collaborate with another village’s edge devices.\nElectronics 2023, 12,\
    \ 2490\n48 of 63\n6. Summary\n•\nVarious SCAs have different network requirements\
    \ such as bandwidth, delay toler-\nance, power consumption, reliability, wireless\
    \ connectivity, mobility, security, and\nprivacy. Therefore, they need different\
    \ protocols at the OSI-RM layers. The network\narchitectures for IoT are heterogeneous\
    \ and include various network technologies such\nas WiFi, WSNs, Mesh Wireless\
    \ Networks (WMNs), Vehicular Networks, and Mobile\nCommunication Networks (MCNs)\
    \ (5G/LTE/4G/3G). The standards adopted in these\narchitectures must allow interoperability,\
    \ while cross-layer design-based recommen-\ndations for power consumption and\
    \ congestion control are well-suited proposals.\n•\nState-of-the-art generic network\
    \ architectures for smart cities adopt the SDN paradigm\nand are based on FogC\
    \ to reduce latency and increase the efficiency of provided services.\n•\nFog\
    \ and ClCom will be used in smart grid communication system architecture in the\n\
    future to fulﬁll QoS needs. Such architecture will additionally feature communication\n\
    methods that can lessen QoS issues like latency, security, and spectrum efﬁciency.\
    \ The\nCR technology will be an indispensable part of this architecture as this\
    \ technology can\nquickly reconﬁgure the operating parameters of the SG communication\
    \ system to the\nchanging requirements through cognition.\n•\nBy extracting usable\
    \ data from both the physical and network data space, it is possible\nto increase\
    \ network security and transportation safety in IoVs. Future IoV architectures\n\
    will become cognitive. These architectures will include cognitive data engines\
    \ that\nwill conduct cognition of user tasks by the use of data collected, e.g.,\
    \ driving behavior\nmodel analysis, emotion analysis, and road condition investigation.\n\
    •\nThe networking performance of SDN is better than the customary networking of\
    \ smart\nbuildings (SB). However, as Younus et al. [190] state, it also has been\
    \ facing some\nchallenges such as network management in terms of maintenance,\
    \ east–west interface,\nsouthbound interface, trafﬁc management, energy, ML-based\
    \ SDN networking for SB,\nand the network resources issue of SB SDN-based networking.\n\
    7. Open Research Issues\n−Network slicing management is required: IoT services\
    \ such as smart transportation and\nsmart energy have diversiﬁed requirements.\
    \ To accommodate diverse IoT services, the\nnetwork slicing paradigm is suggested\
    \ because it enables multiple independent logical\nnetworks running on the same\
    \ physical network infrastructure. Wu et al. [9] presented\nan architecture for\
    \ intelligent network slicing management for the Industrial IoT (IIoT)\nfocusing\
    \ on three IIoT services (smart transportation, smart energy, and smart factory).\
    \ The\nauthors also provided a comprehensive survey on intelligent network slicing\
    \ management\nin this ﬁeld.\n−NFV Implementation in the SDN-IoT Environment: The\
    \ ETSI Industry Speciﬁcation\nGroup proposed NFV to virtualize the network functions\
    \ that were before performed\nby some proprietary dedicated. NFV allows for the\
    \ ﬂexible provisioning of software-\nbased network functionalities on top of an\
    \ appropriately shared physical infrastructure by\nseparating the network functions\
    \ from the underlying hardware appliances [262]. Utilizing\ninexpensive commodity\
    \ servers, it solves the issue of operating costs associated with\nadministering\
    \ and controlling this closed and proprietary equipment. When SDN is\nused in\
    \ conjunction with NFV (the software-deﬁned NFV architecture), it can overcome\n\
    the difﬁculties associated with intelligent service orchestration and dynamic\
    \ resource\nmanagement [263]. SDN can dynamically establish a virtual service\
    \ environment through\nNFV. As a result, the need for specialized hardware and\
    \ labor-intensive effort to fulﬁll\na new service request is avoided. In conjunction\
    \ with the use of SDN, NFV also allows\nreal-time and dynamic function provisioning\
    \ along with ﬂexible trafﬁc forwarding. The\nSDN-IoT network may be improved and\
    \ secured with NVF. It enables the software-based\ndeployment of network devices\
    \ as virtualized components. Throughput is increased\nbecause of NFV integration\
    \ in the SDN-IoT network, which enhances network performance.\nTo this end, Sinh\
    \ et al. [264] proposed a practical model for hosting IoT services and building\n\
    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n49 of 63\nSDN controller applications to show that\
    \ SDN/NFV can effectively apply to IoT services.\nRecently, Mukherjee et al. [265]\
    \ proposed an SDN-based distributed IoT network with NFV\nimplementation for smart\
    \ cities.\n−Cognitive IoT network architecture for smart cities: CR technology\
    \ can address the\nbandwidth needs of IoT applications [266]. IoT devices can\
    \ be enabled with cognitive\nfunctionalities, including spectrum sensing, dynamic\
    \ spectrum accessing, circumstantial\nperceiving, and self-learning. Many SCAs\
    \ and services can be based on CR technology\nbecause it can do dynamic sensing\
    \ and cognition of the surrounding environment. For\nexample, in smart grid applications,\
    \ cognitive IoT can achieve the objective of enabling\nusers to know their energy\
    \ consumption at any time and anywhere [267]. In smart home ap-\nplications, cognitive-radio-equipped\
    \ sensors can handle potential heterogeneous network\ninterference [268]. At the\
    \ same time, cognitive IoT can help with smoother real-time moni-\ntoring over\
    \ longer distances in the healthcare industry without worrying about spectrum\n\
    availability [269]. The complete utilization of cognitive radio technology in\
    \ IoT demands\nextensive research in spectrum optimization, standardization, hardware\
    \ design, privacy\nprotection, heterogeneous network fusion, scalability and ﬂexibility\
    \ problems, etc. [270].\nFor this reason, many CIoT-based smart city network architectures\
    \ must be proposed to\nsolve such problems. In this regard, Park et al. [271]\
    \ suggested a CIoT-based smart city\nnetwork architecture that outlines how data\
    \ collected from SCAs may be analyzed using\nthe CogC paradigm and manage the\
    \ scalability and ﬂexibility challenges.\n−Challenges in IoT communication through\
    \ TCP/IP suite: Unfortunately, many Access\nPoints (APs) can utilize identical\
    \ WiFi channels in overlapping regions, leading to interfer-\nence problems that\
    \ can signiﬁcantly impair TCP performance over WiFi [272]. Now, many\nAPs can\
    \ provide support for wireless access to numerous users in a WiFi network with\n\
    the DownLink multi-user MIMO (DL MU-MIMO) functionality. DL MU-MIMO is a PHY\n\
    layer technology (included with IEEE 802.11ac standard [273]) that increases the\
    \ capacity\nof WLANs by simultaneously broadcasting data streams to several stations.\
    \ As a result, it\nis possible to achieve greater data rates that are equal to\
    \ the number of antennas on APs.\nThus, several stations are served at once. Pokhrel\
    \ and Singh [131] stressed the employment\nof CR and Federated Learning (FL) methods\
    \ with many APs to improve the Compound\nTCP’s performance in wide-area Industry\
    \ 4.0 WiFi networks. An FL method can accelerate\nthe learning processes of the\
    \ transport protocols such as Compound TCP. In FL, training\ndata are dispersed\
    \ across a large number of clients, each having unreliable and compar-\natively\
    \ slow network connections, with the aim of developing a high-quality centralized\n\
    model. The authors of [131] insisted on using these specialized strategies to\
    \ coordinate\nnumerous APs with regard to losses caused by unique wireless channel\
    \ characteristics and\nWiFi downloading and uploading dynamics. Through the use\
    \ of FL and CR approaches in\ndual AP settings, it is now possible to improve\
    \ the Layer-4 performances of TCP versions.\nAnother study [274] assumed TCP Cubic\
    \ [275] as the Layer-4 protocol and considered the\nFL approach for IoVs. The\
    \ authors of [276] developed a framework for exploiting the FL\ntechnique, which\
    \ enhances the efﬁciency and privacy protection for the case of IoVs.\n−Digital\
    \ Twins for Smart Processes: A virtual depiction of resources, personnel, proce-\n\
    dures, systems, devices, and locations is referred to as a digital twin. Digital\
    \ twin technology\ncan be used to duplicate a variety of objects, including humans,\
    \ IoT devices, aircraft en-\ngines, and vehicles. A digital twin of the original\
    \ vehicle is created, for instance, when\nan automobile business creates a virtual\
    \ representation or digital duplicate (copy) of a car\nmodel. If a manufacturer\
    \ creates a virtual representation of its manufacturing process, the\nreplicated\
    \ process is a digital twin of the physical process. A digital twin is a proﬁle\
    \ of\nthe actual process or physical object’s past and present state. In this\
    \ virtual graphic, the\ndynamics and features of an IoT device’s life and operation\
    \ are depicted. The digital twin\ncan offer the location, state, and/or status\
    \ of physical assets in real-time due to continual\nlearning and advancements.\
    \ This fusion of the real and digital worlds enables organizations\nto monitor\
    \ systems, set strategies, and anticipate problems before they occur. Digital\
    \ twins\nare created using digital twin technology, which integrates network infrastructure\
    \ graphs,\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n50 of 63\nAI, software analytics, and the\
    \ IoT. Through digital twins, the idea of the smart city is\ndemonstrated. This\
    \ technology can efﬁciently administer the city, from urban planning to\nthe optimization\
    \ of land use. Digital twins make it possible to simulate plans before putting\n\
    them into action in the real world, revealing issues before they materialize.\
    \ If a digital twin\nis in place, government organizations can only fully assess\
    \ what might be achieved with\nthe data to better citizens’ lives, offer economic\
    \ opportunity, and establish a more cohesive\ncommunity. Although the idea is\
    \ currently novel, it is expected to catch on in the next few\nyears [277].\n\
    −The 6G Network for Futuristic Smart Cities: A futuristic smart city is a dense\
    \ and\nAI-centric city because massive device connectivity with vast data trafﬁc\
    \ is estimated in\nthe future. In such cities, the concept of IoT will be converted\
    \ to the concept of Internet of\nEverything (IoE). Networks of futuristic smart\
    \ cities should have a huge bandwidth, low\nlatency, and AI integration. Such\
    \ networks should also provide ubiquity, high QoS, and\non-demand content for\
    \ thousands of interconnected devices. The 6G network [278] is the\nproblem-solving\
    \ network of futuristic cities, with huge bandwidth and low latency. It is\nunder\
    \ development for wireless communications technologies supporting cellular data\n\
    networks. Like its predecessors, 6G networks will probably be broadband cellular\
    \ networks,\nin which the service area is divided into small geographical areas\
    \ (cells). It is expected that\n6G will be supported by existing 5G infrastructures\
    \ such as SDN, NFV, and network slicing,\ntogether with new infrastructure. The\
    \ network requirements of 6G are as follows [278]:\n(1) ultra-fast data rates\
    \ as high as 1 Tbps; (2) ultra-low latency of less than 1 ms; (3) increased\n\
    mobility and coverage; (4) ﬂexible and efﬁcient connection of trillion level objects;\
    \ (5) peak\nspectral efﬁciency of 60 b/s/Hz; (6) very high system reliability;\
    \ and (7) improved network\nsecurity [279]. However, the main problem of 6G is\
    \ that transmitting at a higher frequency\nspectrum is prone to high path loss,\
    \ making the distance for transmission limited [280].\nThe expected 6G of the\
    \ radio access network is based on terahertz (THz) waves with the\ncapability\
    \ of carrying up to one terabit per second (Tbps). THz waves have the capability\
    \ of\ncarrying a large amount of data, but these waves have numerous drawbacks,\
    \ such as short-\nrange and atmospheric attenuation. Hence, these drawbacks can\
    \ introduce complications\nand hinder the performance of the 6G network. Therefore,\
    \ such complications of THz waves\nmust be considered, and efﬁcient AI-centric\
    \ multilayer physical network architectures of 6G\nmust be proposed for futuristic\
    \ smart cities. Farooq et al. [280] considered the expectations\nfrom a network\
    \ of futuristic smart cities and the problems of THz waves and proposed\na conceptual\
    \ terrestrial network (TN) architecture for 6G. The nested Bee Hive [280] is a\n\
    scalable multilayer architecture designed to meet the needs of futuristic smart\
    \ cities. It\nprovides an on-ground cloud network that helps smart devices to\
    \ run AI applications\npartially on their own and the rest on the cloud. Furthermore,\
    \ the distributed and edge\ncomputing-oriented infrastructure of Bee Hive provides\
    \ security and reduces trafﬁc load on\nthe upper layer of the network. Undoubtedly,\
    \ pervasive AI is the main enabling technology\nin 6G, while some forms of AI\
    \ are realized as part of 5G. Many successful examples of\nusing AI on wireless\
    \ communications have been proposed, from physical layer designs\n(e.g., channel\
    \ estimation and precoding), to network resource allocation (e.g., trafﬁc control\n\
    and cache storage management), to security and authentication, to dynamic cell\
    \ and\ntopology formation and management, to fault prediction and detection, etc.\
    \ However,\nDL-based solutions require high computational complexity, which might\
    \ not ﬁt in current\nmobile phones [281]. Apart from the complexity, Artiﬁcial\
    \ Neural Network (ANN)-based\nRL algorithms must be carefully designed to decrease\
    \ the computational resources required\non these devices [282]. Quantum communication\
    \ [283] offers a promising approach to\navoiding the challenge of limited computational\
    \ resources and energy efﬁciency. Applying\nArtiﬁcial Neural Networks in IoT also\
    \ comes with the trade-off challenge between accuracy\nand computational/energy\
    \ requirements [282]. Tariq et al. [284] studied some of the above\nissues and\
    \ envisioned 6G to facilitate futuristic smart cities with pervasive autonomous\n\
    systems. Apart from pervasive AI, Imoize et al. [285] discussed other important\
    \ enabling\ntechnologies of 6G and their challenges. These enabling technologies\
    \ are as follows:\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n51 of 63\n•\nReconﬁgurable Intelligent\
    \ Surfaces (RISs) [286] that reﬂect signals and help in places\nwhere maintaining\
    \ Line of Sight (LoS) is difﬁcult. RISs will be mainly deployed on\ndoors, windows,\
    \ and buildings.\n•\nCell-Free Massive MIMO: The massive MIMO technology is introduced\
    \ in 5G with\na more dense network of access points (APs), and this is further\
    \ developed in 6G\nto include a network with no cells (cell-free) [287]. Cell-Free\
    \ Massive MIMO im-\nproves spectral efﬁciency in communication networks, but there\
    \ are some health risks\nassociated with such a dense network of APs.\n•\nCubeSat\
    \ communication or the Internet of Space Things [288]. A CubeSat (or U-class\n\
    spacecraft) is a miniaturized spacecraft with sizes that are multiples of U, up\
    \ to 6U,\nand U being 10 × 10 × 10 cm cubic units.\n•\nUAVs/satellite communication.\n\
    •\nTerahertz communication and Optical Wireless Technology [289].\n•\nBlockchain\
    \ technology [290] and quantum communication [283].\nThe development of futuristic\
    \ smart cities keeps up with the development of energy-\nefﬁcient 6G communication.\
    \ Kamruzzaman [291] presented the key trends in the IoT for\nenergy-efﬁcient 6G\
    \ wireless communication in smart cities. He argues that the application\nof IoT\
    \ devices to 6G in smart cities will provide a 100 Gbps data rate, <0.1 ms latency\
    \ rate,\nup to 1000 km/h mobility rate, 100 bps/Hz spectral efﬁciency, and 1000\
    \ GHz frequency.\nThis will resolve the issues of energy inefﬁciency and other\
    \ concerns in conventional\ncommunication networks. Moreover, the use of energy-efﬁcient\
    \ 6G in smart cities via IoT\ndevices probably will solve various problems that\
    \ are encountered by existing smart city\nsystems. In futuristic smart cities,\
    \ residents will use the innovative 6G brain–computer\ninterface (BCI) technology\
    \ [292] for a multi-sense experience. BCI is based on the signals\nand information\
    \ that monitor and control machines using sensible wearable headsets and\ndevices.\
    \ It uses human consciousness more than external sources for better interaction.\n\
    As humans have ﬁve senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste), BCI comprises\
    \ ﬁve\ndatasets, comprising features of human senses that are used for human interaction\
    \ with the\nmachine [292].\n8. Conclusions\nUtilizing resources efficiently, reducing\
    \ operating expenses, and enhancing city\ndwellers’ quality of life are the objectives\
    \ of the smart city paradigm. This goal is ob-\ntained by combining various technologies\
    \ including IoT, WSNs, CPS, ClCom, FoC, big\ndata analytics, and robots. For this\
    \ model, the effective networking and communication\nbetween the many components\
    \ required to enable various SCAs are crucial for achieving its\nobjectives. The\
    \ ever-increasing need for networking leads to many elastic and manageable\nplatforms\
    \ for various SCAs including smart grid, smart buildings, smart home, smart water,\n\
    and smart transportation systems. The networking needs of the key SCAs were examined\n\
    in this research, and the appropriate protocols that can be applied at different\
    \ system\nlevels have been identiﬁed. Additionally, we provided examples of networking\
    \ protocols\nand smart grid, intelligent building, smart residence, and smart\
    \ transportation system\narchitectures. We concentrated on key criteria for a\
    \ variety of networking designs, such as\nenergy savings, routing, security, dependability,\
    \ mobility, and support for heterogeneous\nnetworks. In addition, we presented\
    \ open research issues.\nThis survey can assist researchers to recognize research\
    \ gaps/problems working in the\nnetworking architectures for smart cities, and\
    \ it provides an overview of available protocols\nand architectures for SCAs.\n\

    Footnotes Abstract: The IoT concept has grown in recent years and has transformed
    people’s lives by making them easier, regardless of the scope of application.
    The global population is projected to grow more and more, reaching 9 billions
    by the year 2050, so IoT devices are needed in agriculture to increase crop yield
    and therefore feed sources. However, this solution is not exempt from challenges.
    Weather conditions, climate change and the environment have a great impact on
    farming practices. To reduce the costs and losses involved in these activities,
    we analyze the use of the equipment provided by Adcon Telemetry, such as solutions
    for plant monitoring, disease detection, frost warning, decision support, management
    and water quality. All data collected by Adcon equipment can be viewed on the
    addVANTAGE Pro platform, which can be accessed anywhere using a web browser and
    Internet connection, in graphical or tabular form. Published in: 2018 International

    Romania SECTION I. Introduction IoT is a set of devices and software elements,
    sensors that allow connection, collection, visualization and data sharing, which
    through their properties improve energy efficiency and reduce human effort while
    also bringing economic benefits [1]. The IoT devices are divided into four classes
    as follows [2]: portable devices - clocks and physical activity monitoring devices.
    Their running time is between a few days and a few weeks; Set-And-Forget devices
    (SAF) - This category refers to the devices used to automate the processes inside
    the buildings. Their running time is several years; geophysical infrastructure
    monitoring devices or Integrated Grant Management System (IGMS), which have a
    service life of several years; computers or Transient Powered Computers (TPCs)
    with temporary power, battery-free devices that depend on remote power sources.
    A recent study argues that by 2020 approximately 50 billion smart IoT devices
    will help solve telemetry, health, energy minimization, and building automation
    issues [2]. US retailer Kroger has developed the Retail Site Intelligence platform
    by adopting IoT technologies. This enables video, video and wireless video analysis
    to improve the customers’ shopping experience by quickly finding shelf products
    and shrinking time at the cash register [4]. This paper covers the research we
    have done regarding the use of IoT devices in the field of agriculture and telemetry
    to bring about significant improvements in crop monitoring and efficiency of the
    consume energy. The article is structured as follows: Chapter 2 presents related
    work, Chapter 3 contains information about IoT telemetry solutions, Chapter 4
    describes the results of our studies, and Chapter 5 concludes the paper. SECTION
    II. Related Work Agriculture faces many problems to ensure the need for food for
    the entire population. Ideally, agricultural production will increase as the population
    grows. Some of the problems encountered in agriculture include climate change,
    the environment, limited water resources, etc. To address these issues, the agricultural
    sector needs to adapt to new technologies. Farmbot [5] is a device that is used
    to solve problems in agriculture, but on a small scale. It also has an application
    that can configure and control Farmbot from your browser, laptop, tablet, or phone.
    The application has real-time manual commands and a module that allows creating
    routines for Farmbot execution. The application receives the user input commands
    so that it can create the type of farm. The MQTT Gateway is the interface between
    the web application and the Farmbot device. Decision Support System analyzes the
    data collected by sensors and based on them they use algorithms that will optimize
    the events programmed by the system. For example, considering meteorological forecasting,
    soil moisture and crop type, Farmbot can decide what water needs to be used to
    irrigate the plants. All information collected is stored in a database [6]. The
    British pioneer technology Kevin Ashton proposed in 1999 the term Internet of
    Things (IoT) defining interconnected devices that can communicate with each other
    [7]. The internet of thing automatic station is an automated weather station which
    is constructed on the Internet of Things (IoT) platform, which completely integrates
    the real-time data interoperability, data fusion and other features of the IoT
    technology. With the advent of the IoT, it will become increasingly widespread
    [8]. This telemetry cloud testing platform uses different types of RTUs and sensors
    that monitor and transmit relevant information from selected locations, such as
    temperature, precipitation, light, or wind speed. The cloud testing environment
    provides to the platform a processing data from several different sensors that
    allow the analysis of environmental data through a large sample of RTUs [8]. RTUs
    transmit data to GSM / GPRS sensors to the cloud platform, where the data is processed
    in real time, is displayed in the web viewer application, with detailed information
    on power generation and optimized energy revenues. The system can be connected
    to other systems management for better use of resources, considering certain factors
    such as energy price, consumption trends and improved risk management [9]. One
    of them is SlapOS which is based on a grid computing daemon called slapgrid which
    is capable of installing any software on a PC and instantiate any number of processes
    of potentially infinite duration of any installed software. Slap Grid daemon receives
    requests from a central scheduler the SlapOS Master which collects back accounting
    information from each process. SlapOS Master follows an Enterprise Resource Planning
    (ERP) model to handle at the same time process allocation optimization and billing.
    SLAP stands for “Simple Language for Accounting and Provisioning” [9]. This structure
    is implemented for cloud automation of ERP, CRM and M2M programs for small businesses
    in the renewable energy field, and some issues are being developed within the
    European research project “Cloud Consulting” [9]. M2M telemetry software consists
    of a client / server architecture that collects data from one or more Adcon telemetry
    gateways and makes it available for viewing or for specialized analysis. The server
    is that part of the software in which all the actual processing takes place. The
    server is that part of the software where all the actual processing takes place.
    The server is the area where all the actual processing takes place. Taking responsibility
    for downloading data from Telemetry Gateway, storing data in the database, starting
    and stopping extensions, and serving customers during the connection [10]. IoT
    is not only an evolution of the present situations in which devices can be remotely
    controlled, being also considered a major issue for efficiency applications for
    several reasons: number of connected objects: It is estimated that by 2020 there
    will be installed 26 billion units, some of which will not be used for energy
    efficiency applications; business Opportunity: $ 300 billion in additional business
    by 2020; nature of objects: It refers not only to smart devices but also to simple
    devices up to an LED bulb; techniques and architectures involved, based on technical
    ecosystems: Vertical integration into one supplier environment will be less common;
    sensor revolution: IP camera, geo-location, personal contextual information from
    devices such as sensors that can be worn; Big Data Disruption: Ability to collect
    large amounts of unstructured data, analyze and predict future behavior; smart
    phones and applications become the primary user interface to IoT [11]. SECTION
    III. IoT Telemetry Solutions ADCON Telemetry [12] is a company founded in 2003,
    located near Vienna. In 2011, the company was taken over by OTT Hydromet [13]
    and moved its headquarters to Germany, Kempten. Adcon works by providing solutions
    for monitoring, analysis and decision making in the meteorological, hydrological
    and agricultural field. Telemetry solutions are based on radio and GSM / GPRS
    / UMTS technologies. Among the features and benefits of using Adcon equipment
    are [12]: minimum power consumption due to the use of small solar panels; data
    transmission over long distances due to the high sensitivity of the receiver;
    the ability to integrate all devices into a single Gateway; recording, sharing,
    storing, processing and viewing all data collected by devices on a common platform.
    The solutions and technologies provided by the Adcon Group can be applied in:
    irrigation management; protecting crops; support decisions; water quality monitoring;
    water management. Agriculture has always played an important role in the lives
    and well-being of people, being a process of producing food and a source of food
    for both the population and domestic animals. Over time, the climate has undergone
    changes that people have had to adapt to, and implicitly adapt the solutions used
    to ensure food or water quality, both irrigated and used daily [12]. In the field
    of agriculture, crops need to be irrigated when needed and only with the amount
    of soil required at the time of irrigation. Determining the right time and quantity
    for irrigation is a complex process that takes into account certain information
    and parameters such as: the phenological phase of the culture; the amount of water
    lost through evapotranspiration; the amount of water that comes from the rainfall;
    moisture level from, below and above plant roots; the amount of water used for
    irrigation. Irrigations are important in terms of: harvesting and quality; efficiency
    of fertilizer application; soil salinity and oxygen content at its level; the
    balance of soil microorganisms; energy consumption; the service life of the pumps
    and equipment used. A. Monitoring soil moisture With the growth of plants, their
    roots move through the soil. Ensuring the need for water and fertilizer becomes
    a very important aspect. Too much water can cause the loss of fertilizer. Too
    little water causes the fertilizer to be blocked in the upper layers of the soil
    and therefore unnecessary consumption. For these issues Adcon offers a solution
    based on a multitude of soil moisture monitoring sensors. The solutions offered
    are for all types of crops and soil. Adcon sensors not only measure humidity but
    also salinity and soil temperature. They are easy to install, do not modify the
    soil structure and provide data at short intervals [9]. The data and parameters
    recorded by these sensors refer to: soil moisture; the depth of irrigation; rate
    of infiltration; water consumption per day; date and time of irrigation; running
    time; the total amount of water used per week, month or season. The big advantage
    of using these sensors is the precision of reading the data at the desired location
    of the farmer. B. Disease Models The pests and diseases can affect the health
    and development of crops. Applying spray protection should only be done when it
    is really necessary and at the same time protecting the environment. To ensure
    that the spray is applied when computer models are being used, they process meteorological
    data and issue warnings and recommendations for treatments only in the event of
    an outbreak of high-risk disease. Adcon offers solutions developed by specialists
    to combat pests and diseases, regardless of crop type. Solutions have been implemented
    by specialists and are based on algorithms that detect diseases such as Apple
    Scab or Phytophthora in potatoes [12]. The stage of plant evolution is presented
    in a table where all phases of development can be viewed. Users are also emailed
    about the disease index and treatment recommendations. For better evidence and
    vision of the crop stage, farmers can create their own database where they can
    introduce all the actions related to the applied treatments and irrigation. C.
    Frost warning Another phenomenon faced by farmers is frost. With the coming of
    the cold season, they must take crop protection measures. The most common methods
    of protection against frost are: Wind machines, Heaters, Irrigation systems. The
    parameters to be monitored for frost risk are: air temperature, wet bulb temperature
    and dew point. Extremely low temperatures are a challenge for battery monitors,
    not just crops. It is recommended that they are well loaded and set for multiple
    alarms with yellow and red warnings [12]. D. Decision support The agricultural
    decision-making system is software that collects multiple input data (eg data
    from crop sensors, chemical agents, pathogenic data, etc.) and that helps the
    farmer make a decision about problems that may occur at the level crops (e.g.
    diseases, frost or need for irrigation). Complex agricultural operations involve
    making daily decisions about chemical spraying, measures taken against frost,
    when to harvest, etc. All these decisions take into account a multitude of parameters.
    The decision-making system should include a monitoring station equipped with crop
    sensors and addVANTAGE Pro [11] software for viewing all collected data. The software
    is designed to process data from sensors and to suggest actions beneficial to
    crops according to their status. These suggestions may be recommendations for
    treatment, frost alarms, or disease installs, all of which allow the user to take
    action before affecting crops [12]. Adcon’s decision-making support system evaluates
    and sends suggestions for the following situations: Soil temperature (recommended
    seed time, seed emergence, nematode activity), Leaf Wetness (foliar spray timing),
    Temperature (foliar spray timing, plant stress), Precipitations (spray timing,
    spray wash-off), Relative Humidity (foliar spray timing, Pruning Time), Wind (Spray
    timing and reporting, Plant Stress, Irrigation) [12]. E. Water quality monitoring
    Determining the quality of water involves analyzing its physical, chemical and
    biological characteristics. Water pollution can endanger both human health, the
    aquatic environment and the entire ecosystem. Detecting and acting quickly in
    such situations is very important in order to minimize the impact on the environment
    and to determine the source of the pollution. Adcon A705 and A753 devices are
    compatible with water quality sensors. Also, the OTT PLS-C [13] sensor provides
    data related to the level, temperature and water conductivity. In special cases,
    Hydrolab water quality probes can be used to measure 16 parameters at the same
    time [12]. Depending on the needs and demands of farmers or crops, sensors can
    be implemented to monitor: water temperature, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen,
    REDOX potential, turbidity, blue algae, ammonia, nitrate, chlorophyll, rhodamine,
    etc [12]. F. Water Management Water management refers to monitoring, distribution
    and purification of water, irrespective of where the water comes from. Adcon offers
    all the necessary components for an outdoor monitoring system, whether it is GSM
    / GPRS / UMTS mobile communications or UHF radio, they are very resistant and
    are protected by aluminum enclosures with stainless steel connectors [12]. It
    also provides support for the following applications [12]: leak detection and
    pipeline damage, pressure and flow monitoring; remote monitoring of meters and,
    implicitly, consumption; level monitoring in tanks, rivers or lakes; water quality
    monitoring, determined by 16 parameters that transmit data simultaneously; control
    of irrigation systems; remote actuation of pumps, valves and motors; wireless
    data transfer via radio or GSM; compatibility with SCADA [13] industrial systems
    (Siemens LSX [14], WinCC [15], Rittmeyer [16]); data visualization software; data
    processing, alarm functions for many parameters. SECTION IV. Results Our telemetry
    research activity has focused on acquiring Adcon equipment, assembling and testing
    it. On this line, in 2013 Beia Consult International has put in place a monitoring
    system for Danube waters and its tributaries. A total of 21 stations have been
    installed, 9 of which are located on the Danube. All monitoring systems consist
    of the A753 remote monitoring unit, the SDI-12 temperature sensor, the OTT-RLS
    [17] level sensor, the A850 data storage unit and the addVANTAGE Pro platform
    [18]. The architecture of the telemetry system can be seen in Fig. 1. Fig. 1.
    Beia – Adcon solution Show All All the data collected from the stations can be
    accessed, viewed and downloaded, as a table or graph. Every 15 minutes, addVANTAGE
    Pro [18] receives data related to water level and temperature. You can see the
    addVANTAGE Pro interface in the Error! Reference source not found.. Fig. 2. addVANTAGE
    Pro 6.5 interface Show All We have continued the research by experimenting the
    addSWITCH A724 device in order to create an automated irrigation system using
    decision support notions. It is a telemetry device (RTU) capable of transmitting
    an electrical impulse to the solenoid control valve. In Fig. 3 it can be seen
    that the addSWITCH equipment has a VALVE port that can transmit variable voltage
    pulses. An advantage of this equipment is the possibility of power supply generated
    by small photovoltaic panels. Fig. 3. addSWITCH Show All Also, a small valve shown
    in Fig. 4 was used in the experiment. This can be controlled in a voltage range
    of 9-20V with pulse with 20-100mSec at a maximum pressure of 10 bar. Fig. 4. Valve
    Show All The A850 Gateway is the core of every Adcon [12] monitoring network that
    knows precisely how to recover data from each RTU, indifferent to the RTU communication
    mode. So, it is necessary to use the A850 Gateway to configure the addSWITCH RTU,
    where the data specific to the addSWITCH and the characteristics of the valve
    used are entered, as can be seen in Fig. 5. Fig. 5. A850 Gateway GUI Show All
    Until now, we have made communication between Adcon [12] and solenoid valve. For
    remote control of the solenoid valve, it is necessary to install a server for
    Adcon [12] equipment and implement the addVANTAGE Pro 6.5 platform [18]. The addVANTAGE
    Pro 6.5 [18] can be accessed anywhere as any public IP, which gives us the achievement
    of this experiment. Thus, we created a link between addVANTAGE Pro 6.5 [18] and
    Gateway where it provides us with the ability to generate reports for the data
    received from the sensors or to command other equipment, such as the solenoid
    valve, as shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6. Time graph of solenoid valve operation Show
    All The addSWITCH RTU was selected for the experiment in particular for the options
    offered in the solenoid control, so in the Fig. 7 you can see that we can set
    the exact time of the valve’s operation using the Switch ON / OFF function. Fig.
    7. Interface addVANTAGE Pro 6.5 Show All In case of our experiment, we set the
    output voltage to 9 V. If we desired, the addSWITCH has the option to adjust the
    voltage to 15 V, depending on the power required to operate the valve at different
    flow rates. When closing the solenoid valve, a 9V voltage was measured using a
    multimeter, this value reflecting that a positive pulse on the valve phase was
    generated by equipment A724, as can be seen in Fig. 8. Fig. 8. Parameters generated
    by A724 when closing the solenoid valve. Show All When the solenoid was opened,
    the voltage was again measured with a multimeter. It showed a voltage value of
    -9V, the value indicating that a negative pulse on the valve phase was generated
    by addSWITCH, as shown in Fig. 9. Fig. 9. Parameters generated by A724 when opening
    the solenoid valve. Show All The “condition” function is a handy tool because
    there are several types of comparators in the list of options. For example, to
    create a decision support system, it is necessary to meet certain conditions such
    as: if the soil moisture value drops below 40% AND the temperature value is between
    two intervals then a TRUE signal is transmitted. If one of the conditions is not
    met, the signal will be FALSE. In Fig. 10 is the graphical representation in time
    of the signal sent by the function. Fig. 10. The graph of the “Condition” function
    signal Show All SECTION V. Conclusions The role of IoT is to make life easier
    for people regardless of their scope. Integration of IoT in the field of agriculture
    brings real benefits in terms of crop monitoring, considering the weather conditions,
    the environment, and finally the right decision to act to increase yield and agricultural
    production. Our proposal helps farmers with a crop monitoring solution, a warning
    in the case of preventing the installation of diseases or in the event of freezing
    conditions and making decisions in these situations. In the future, we aim to
    create a friendlier interface for users and building a more advanced decision
    support system where under normal irrigation conditions a part of the solenoid
    valves act, and in exceptional cases, such as drought, commanding all valves would
    be a priority. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Footnotes

    20, 7163. Copy Abstract Research has shown the multitude of applications that
    IoT, cloud computing and forecast technologies present in every sector. In agriculture,
    one application is the monitoring of factors that influence crop development to
    assist in making crop management decisions. Research on the application of such
    technologies in agriculture has been mainly conducted at small experimental sites
    or under controlled conditions. This research has provided relevant insights and
    guidelines for the use of different types of sensors, application of a multitude
    of algorithms to forecast relevant parameters as well as architectural approaches
    of IoT platforms. However, research on the implementation of IoT platforms at
    the commercial scale is needed to identify platform requirements to properly function
    under such conditions. This article evaluates an IoT platform (IRRISENS) based
    on fully replicable microservices used to sense soil, crop and atmosphere parameters,
    interact with third party cloud services, planning and scheduling irrigation as
    well as control of irrigation water control devices. The proposed IoT platform
    was evaluated during one growing season at four commercial scale farms on two
    different broadacre irrigated crops with very different water management requirements
    (rice and cotton). Five main requirements for IoT platforms to be used in agriculture
    at commercial scale were identified from implementing IRRISENS in rice and cotton
    production: scalability, flexibility, heterogeneity, robustness to failure and
    security. The platform addressed all these requirements. The results showed that
    the microservice approach followed in the platform is robust against both intermittent
    and critical failures in the field that could occur in any of the monitored sites.
    Further, processing or storage overload caused for any reason at one farm did
    not affect the performance of the platform regarding the other monitored farms.
    This paper also discusses how the microservice approach can address the data heterogeneity
    issue when crops with different management requirements are monitored. Since there
    are no shared microservices among farms, the IoT platform proposed here also provides
    data isolation maintaining data confidentiality for each user, which is relevant
    in a commercial farm scenario. Keywords IoT platform; microservice; smart agriculture;

    Abstract: In recent years, different types of monitoring systems have been designed\
    \ for various\napplications, in order to turn the urban environments into smart\
    \ cities. Most of these systems consist\nof wireless sensor networks (WSN)s, and\
    \ the designing of these systems has faced many problems.\nThe ﬁrst and most important\
    \ problem is sensor node deployment. The main function of WSNs\nis to gather the\
    \ required information, process it, and send it to remote places. A large number\
    \ of\nsensor nodes were deployed in the monitored area, so ﬁnding the best deployment\
    \ algorithm that\nachieves maximum coverage and connectivity with the minimum\
    \ number of sensor nodes is the\nsigniﬁcant point of the research. This paper\
    \ provides a systematic mapping study that includes\nthe latest recent studies,\
    \ which are focused on solving the deployment problem using optimization\nalgorithms,\
    \ especially heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms in the period (2015–2022).\
    \ It was\nfound that 35% of these studies updated the swarm optimization algorithms\
    \ to solve the deployment\nproblem. This paper will be helpful for the practitioners\
    \ and researchers, in order to work out new\nalgorithms and seek objectives for\
    \ the sensor deployment. A comparison table is provided, and the\nbasic concepts\
    \ of a smart city and WSNs are presented. Finally, an overview of the challenges\
    \ and\nopen issues are illustrated.\nKeywords: smart city; wireless sensor network\
    \ (WSN); deployment; coverage; connectivity;\nmeta-heuristic\n1. Introduction\n\
    Many large cities around the world are adjusting to become smart cities, in order\n\
    to enhance the quality of life for their citizens. With the use of digital, information,\
    \ and\ncommunication technologies, traditional networks and services have become\
    \ more effective.\nIt means smarter transport networks and more efﬁcient water\
    \ supply, waste disposable\nfacilities, and upgraded ways to heat and light buildings;\
    \ as shown in Figure 1, it provides\na city administration that is more interactive\
    \ and responsive. It also enhances the use of\ncity infrastructures and resources.\n\
    The basic component of smart city monitoring systems is wireless sensor networks,\n\
    which consist of a large number of sensor nodes that are used for collecting and\
    \ processing\ndata. Due to the small size and low cost of sensor nodes, different\
    \ WSNs are used for\ndifferent applications, and this plays a vital role in the\
    \ existence of Internet of Things (IoT)\ntechnology, which facilitates the building\
    \ of a smart city, since it comes up with timely\ninformation that helps in deciding-making\
    \ regarding comfort or safety. WSNs always comes\nup with new applications that\
    \ enrich the IoT vision. Therefore, there is always a need for\nadvanced and updated\
    \ models and strategies for supporting on-demand WSN deployment\nSensors 2022,\

    \ \n2 of 31 \n \n \nWSN deployment to meet countries’ goals in increasing surveillance,\
    \ intelligence, and re-\nconnaissance in many safety-critical applications, where\
    \ the IoT will also have an im-\nportant role. \n \nFigure 1. Smart city applications\
    \ [1]. \nThough designing WSN many challenges can appear in the form of deployment,\
    \ lo-\ncalization, communication, data gathering, coverage, and tracking, the\
    \ most important \nissue that we focus on here in this research is the deployment\
    \ problem, which is the first \nmajor challenge in designing a WSN monitoring\
    \ system for a smart application. \nMotivations: Most of the research in the literature\
    \ focused on the deployment prob-\nlem of WSNs in general. Based on the idea of\
    \ monitoring large and open spaces, on the \nother hand, very few studies have\
    \ been conducted regarding this problem in smart cities \nfor reasons that are\
    \ listed as follows [2]: \n• \nThe monitored area: some areas are large and require\
    \ a network structure, such as \nwater distribution networks, transportation networks,\
    \ and streetlight networks. \nSome areas required three-dimensional (3D) monitoring,\
    \ such as the structural health \nmonitoring of bridges and towers. \n• \nDifferent\

    \ other\nhand, very few studies have been conducted regarding this problem in\
    \ smart cities for\nreasons that are listed as follows [2]:\n•\nThe monitored\

    \ networks, transportation networks, and streetlight networks.\nSome areas required\
    \ three-dimensional (3D) monitoring, such as the structural health\nmonitoring\

    \ Wireless Sensor Network Components and Node Architecture\nA WSN is composed\
    \ of a large number of sensor nodes distributed over an area. These\nnodes are\
    \ small in size and have a low cost, with limited storage capacity, processing\n\
    capability, and energy. The sensor node architecture can be seen in Figure 3,\
    \ which consists\nof the sensing unit that can be either the sensor or actuator,\
    \ which senses the environment\nand take measurements of things such as temperature,\
    \ humidity, sound, or vibration,\nthereby converting the collected analog signals\
    \ into digital signals through the analog to\ndigital converter. Then, it sends\
    \ these signals or measurements to the processing unit to be\nprocessed and stored\
    \ until sent through the communication unit to a relay node or a sink\nnode [7,8].\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n5 of 31 \n \n \nFigure 3. Sensor node architecture.\
    \ \nThe WSN consists of all, or parts, of the following components [9]: \n1. \n\
    Sensor node: A small-sized, low-powered node responsible for collecting data,\
    \ pro-\ncessing it, and sharing it with other required nodes in the network. \n\
    2. \nRelay node: This node is used to communicate with the neighboring node as\
    \ a mid-\nway node. This node is used to improve network reliability. It does\
    \ not have any \nsensing or controlling processes. \n3. \nActor node: A high-end\
    \ node used to set up and implement a decision based on the \napplication’s demands.\
    \ Usually, these nodes are resource-rich devices that are sup-\nFigure 3. Sensor\
    \ node architecture.\nAll the parts of the sensor node require energy to operate,\
    \ and the power unit can be\neither a battery, such as a CR2032, or some type\
    \ of renewable energy, such as solar energy.\nThis power unit should be stable\
    \ and stay as long as possible, since the sensor nodes may\nSensors 2022, 22,\
    \ 5094\n5 of 30\nbe thrown in hazardous, rough, or harsh areas that cannot be\
    \ reached for a replacement\nand where recharging the batteries is not possible.\
    \ Another part is the communication\nunit, which is a radio transceiver unit that\
    \ transmits and receives signals from one node\nto another through wireless channels.\
    \ In the processing unit, the central processing unit\n(CPU) calculates the computational\
    \ capabilities and energy consumption. The memory\nstores the required programs\
    \ and data. Finally, if the sensor node is a mobile node, then it\nshould have\
    \ a location ﬁnding system, in order to get the required position, for example,\n\
    the global positioning system (GPS).\nThe WSN consists of all, or parts, of the\
    \ following components [9]:\n1.\nSensor node: A small-sized, low-powered node\
    \ responsible for collecting data, pro-\ncessing it, and sharing it with other\
    \ required nodes in the network.\n2.\nRelay node: This node is used to communicate\
    \ with the neighboring node as a midway\nnode. This node is used to improve network\
    \ reliability. It does not have any sensing\nor controlling processes.\n3.\nActor\
    \ node: A high-end node used to set up and implement a decision based on\nthe\
    \ application’s demands. Usually, these nodes are resource-rich devices that are\n\
    supplied with higher transmission power, processing capabilities, and battery\
    \ life.\n4.\nCluster head: This node is used for gathering data from sensor nodes\
    \ in WSN. There\nmay be one or more inside the cluster, depending on the application’s\
    \ requirements.\nThis node should have high bandwidth and be reliable and secure.\n\
    5.\nGateway node: This node is used to provide the connection between the WSN\
    \ and\noutside networks\n6.\nSink node or base station: A control center where\
    \ users can retrieve data gathered\nfrom the sensor network.\nWhen deploying a\
    \ huge number of sensor nodes that work together to monitor\na speciﬁed target\
    \ or a physical environment, the networking of these nodes is evenly\nsigniﬁcant,\
    \ since the sensor nodes connect with each other, as well as with the base station,\n\
    through wireless communications.\nThe base station sends the required tasks to\
    \ the sensor nodes, while the latter gath-\ners the requested information and\
    \ sends it back to the BS for more processing. The BS\nsometimes acts as a gateway\
    \ that sends the necessary data to the end-user through other\nnetworks. There\
    \ are two types of network architectures, i.e., single- and multi-hop. In a\n\
    single hop, each sensor node has a direct connection to the BS or sink node.\n\
    Although transmission is possible for long distances, the energy consumption is\
    \ very\nhigh for communication, compared with the processing or data gathering.\
    \ So, the multi-hop\narchitecture is preferred, since the data can be transmitted\
    \ over one or more intermediate\nnodes. Multi-hop architecture or clustering can\
    \ be implemented in ﬁve ways, which are:\nhierarchal, partition-based, spectral,\
    \ grid-based, and density-based clustering.\nThe hierarchal architecture depends\
    \ on top-down or bottom-up approaches; it uses the\ntree structure, provides ﬂexibility,\
    \ and is preferred for point-to-point communication. In\nthe partition-based method,\
    \ the clusters are split into more sections; each section represents\na cluster\
    \ and can be used for a small number of nodes. The spectral type, used in the\n\
    similarity matrix, needs low processing time, utilizes image processing, and is\
    \ more suitable\nfor a small number of nodes. In grid-based clustering, the area\
    \ is divided into sections,\ndepending on certain criteria, and the sensor nodes\
    \ are added to these sections. This needs\nlow processing time and computational\
    \ complexity and provides high-performance data\ndistribution. In the density-based\
    \ method, the area with a larger number of clusters is called\nthe high-density\
    \ area, and it is separated from the low-density area, used with dynamic\nclustering,\
    \ and provides better performance in a harsh environment [10].\n2.3. Wireless\
    \ Sensor Network Application\nDifferent types of WSN are used for different applications,\
    \ as shown in Figure 4, the\nﬁrst use of WSNs was for military applications, where\
    \ a system of an acoustic sensor on\nthe ocean bottom was developed for monitoring\
    \ the soviet submarines in the cold war;\nSensors 2022, 22, 5094\n6 of 30\nlater\
    \ on, in 1980, the work started on developing distributed sensor network (DSN).\
    \ Now,\nWSNs are used in different areas, such as agriculture, bio-medical, health,\
    \ trafﬁc, industry,\nenvironment, and so on [7,11]. The work of WSN can be divided\
    \ into two dimensions. The\nﬁrst is monitoring, where it supervises, controls\
    \ the operation, and analyses the system in\nreal-time. The other is tracking\
    \ the variations in the behavior of a target, which may be a\nperson, animal,\
    \ or event [12].\nSensors 2022, 22, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n7 of 31 \n \n \nFigure\

    \ are used in many applications, there are several constraints and \nchallenges\
    \ that face WSN deployment, coverage, and connectivity. Some of these factors\
    \ \nare [22]: \n• \nLimited energy resources: Due to the small size of a sensor\
    \ node, the battery sup-\nported will be small, with a limited lifetime, and this\
    \ leads to limited processing \npower and limited storage capacity, resulting\
    \ in increasing the energy consumption \nproblem. \n• \nLow data rate: There is\
    \ a higher latency in WSN communication. WSN works in short \ni\nti\nd th\nt\n\
    i\ni\nd t\nt\nd\nd\nth\nf\nFigure 4. Types of WSNs.\nWSNs plays a signiﬁcant role\
    \ when they are deployed in the environment. In the\nforest, they detect the behavior\
    \ of wildlife, wildﬁre outbreaks, and landslides, in addition\nto monitoring and\
    \ tracking air pollution, earthquakes, ﬂood detection, and many other\ndisasters\
    \ [13,14]. In agriculture, WSNs can be used in smart farming, crop management,\n\
    irrigation management, disease detection, and yield prediction, as well as monitoring\n\
    temperature, humidity, and soil moisture measurements [15,16]. In the medical\
    \ ﬁeld, WSNs\ncan be used for remote patient status monitoring, diagnosis, and\
    \ emergency response [17].\nSensors 2022, 22, 5094\n7 of 30\nThey can also be\
    \ used in other healthy applications, such as eating habits, ﬁtness issues,\n\
    and monitoring sportive activities [18]. In transportation, WSNs can be used in\
    \ parking lot\nmanagement, railway tracks, and management systems, as well as\
    \ monitoring trafﬁc and\nroads [19]. In military and national security applications,\
    \ WSNs plays a vital role [20]. The\nwidespread application of WSNs has led to\
    \ the existence of the Internet of Things (IoT),\nwhich depends on sensory devices\
    \ that detect the information and send it through the\ninternet to be processed\
    \ and make decisions for the ease, safety, and comfort of human life.\nIn the\
    \ IoT, WSNs are applied in smart homes, health, agriculture, industry, building,\
    \ city,\ngrids, and much more [21].\n2.4. Wireless Sensor Network Constraints\n\
    Even though WSNs are used in many applications, there are several constraints\
    \ and\nchallenges that face WSN deployment, coverage, and connectivity. Some of\
    \ these factors\nare [22]:\n•\nLimited energy resources: Due to the small size\
    \ of a sensor node, the battery supported\nwill be small, with a limited lifetime,\
    \ and this leads to limited processing power and\nlimited storage capacity, resulting\
    \ in increasing the energy consumption problem.\n•\nLow data rate: There is a\
    \ higher latency in WSN communication. WSN works in short\ncommunication ranges,\
    \ and the transmission data rate depends on the frequency used.\n•\nCommunication\
    \ failures: The failed nodes result in communication failures, so there\nshould\
    \ be a fault tolerance to overcome the interruptions when this occurs.\n•\nSecurity\
    \ issues: The wireless communication channels of WSN are vulnerable to\npassive\
    \ and active attacks, thus resulting in serious problems.\n2.5. Deployment in\
    \ Wireless Sensor Network\nThe factor that has an important effect on all the\
    \ WSN performance metrics is de-\nployment. The optimal deployment of the sensor\
    \ nodes indicates that the whole required\narea is covered, and the network nodes\
    \ have the best communication with each other\nwith a minimal number of nodes\
    \ [23]. Deployment can be either static or dynamic; static\ndeployment is divided\
    \ into deterministic and random deployment, depending on the\nenvironment and\
    \ application required [24].\n2.5.1. Static Deployment\nWhen the information regarding\
    \ the application area is known in advance or the\nsensor node position can be\
    \ determined, then the deterministic deployment will be applied\nas shown in Figure\
    \ 5. Most of the research studies that depend on deterministic deployment\nset\
    \ up the node location based on geometrical structure. This can be in a two-dimensional\n\
    plane, such as a square, triangular, hexagon, and tri-hexagon tiling grids; it\
    \ was proven\nthat the regular hexagon is the best topology in the two-dimensional\
    \ plane [25]. The other\ndeployment can be in three-dimensional space by using\
    \ the three-dimensional mathematical\nmodel and space geometric theory to ﬁnd\
    \ a solution for the coverage problem in many\nthree-dimensional applications,\
    \ which can be classiﬁed as binary and probabilistic coverage\nmodels. The space\
    \ geometric methods can be divided into the volumetric quotient-based\napproach\
    \ and spherical overlap approach (k-coverage) [26].\n2.5.2. Random Deployment\n\
    When the sensing area is difﬁcult to reach (to put sensors) or not known in advance,\n\
    due to disasters, ﬁre forests, or battleﬁelds, then the random deployment is preferred,\
    \ i.e.,\nrandomly dispersing the nodes in the desired area, which can be thrown\
    \ from a plane\nin a disaster area, for example. This method is simple but, at\
    \ the same time, has many\ndrawbacks, such as bad coverage or loss of connectivity\
    \ due to obstacles or failures. So\nmany optimization strategies are used to ﬁnd\
    \ the best location, taking the requirements\nof coverage, connectivity, lifetime,\
    \ and robustness into account to achieve one of these\nobjectives or some of them\

    \ tiling grids; it wa\nproven that the regular hexagon is the best topology in\
    \ the two-dimensional plane [25]\nThe other deployment can be in three-dimensional\
    \ space by using the three-dimensiona\nmathematical model and space geometric\
    \ theory to find a solution for the coverage prob\nlem in many three-dimensional\
    \ applications, which can be classified as binary and prob\nabilistic coverage\
    \ models. The space geometric methods can be divided into the volumet\nric quotient-based\
    \ approach and spherical overlap approach (k-coverage) [26]. \n \nFigure 5. Deterministic\

    \ to reach (to put sensors) or not known in advance\ndue to disasters, fire forests,\

    backs, such as bad coverage or loss of connectivity due to obstacles or failures.\
    \ So many\noptimization strategies are used to find the best location, taking\
    \ the requirements of cov\nerage, connectivity, lifetime, and robustness into\
    \ account to achieve one of these objective\nor some of them simultaneously. Classical,\

    \ WSNs are coverage and connectivity. If the sensor node is\nactive and can detect\
    \ an object in the monitored region, then we can say that this object\nis covered\

    barrier coverage [28,29]. Area coverage can be full or partial coverage; full\
    \ coverage means\nthat each point in the monitoring area should be covered by\
    \ at least one sensor node or K\n(where K ≥ 1) node, according to the application\
    \ requirements, such as a battleﬁeld, where\nit is necessary to have precise information\

    \ essential issues in WSNs are coverage and connectivity. If the sensor node is\

    \ this object is \ncovered by the WSN. Coverage can be divided into three types,\
    \ i.e., area, point, and barrier \ncoverage [28,29]. Area coverage can be full\
    \ or partial coverage; full coverage means that \neach point in the monitoring\
    \ area should be covered by at least one sensor node or K \n(where K ≥ 1) node,\

    \ Review \nNumerous strategies are used in the literature to solve the deployment\
    \ problem of \nWSNs for optimizing coverage and connectivity issues. One of them\
    \ is optimization algo-\nrithms, which can be single- or multiple-objective; the\
    \ single-objective optimization algo-\nrithm is not suitable for real applications,\
    \ since optimizing one performance metric may \ninversely affect another metric;\
    \ for example, in sensor node deployment, maximizing cov-\nerage needs large spread\
    \ number of sensor nodes, and this will increase the consumed \nenergy, hence\
    \ reducing the network lifetime. For this reason, the solution goes towards \n\
    using the multi-objective optimization algorithms in WSN deployment, which aims\
    \ to sat-\nisfy multiple goals at the same time, with a set of constraints, which\
    \ will be a real chal-\nlenge. Meta-heuristic search algorithms have been widely\

    3. Literature Review\nNumerous strategies are used in the literature to solve\
    \ the deployment problem of\nWSNs for optimizing coverage and connectivity issues.\
    \ One of them is optimization\nalgorithms, which can be single- or multiple-objective;\
    \ the single-objective optimization\nalgorithm is not suitable for real applications,\
    \ since optimizing one performance metric\nmay inversely affect another metric;\
    \ for example, in sensor node deployment, maximizing\ncoverage needs large spread\
    \ number of sensor nodes, and this will increase the consumed\nenergy, hence reducing\
    \ the network lifetime. For this reason, the solution goes towards\nusing the\
    \ multi-objective optimization algorithms in WSN deployment, which aims to\nsatisfy\
    \ multiple goals at the same time, with a set of constraints, which will be a\
    \ real\nchallenge. Meta-heuristic search algorithms have been widely used in this\
    \ area, since they\ncan provide multiple elements in the Pareto front in a single\
    \ evaluation, as they have a\npopulation-based nature. These algorithms have the\
    \ advantages of preventing the local\noptimum traps and reaching the global optimum\
    \ points [33]. Within this line of research,\nSaad et al. (2020) proposed an improved\
    \ multi-objective genetic algorithm NSGA-II (non-\ndominated sorting genetic algorithm\
    \ II) to implement a new suggested mathematical\nformula for 3D WSNS deployment\
    \ problem with directional sensing ability, in order to\nmaximize the coverage\
    \ and minimize the deployment cost. Through extensive simulation,\nthey proved\
    \ the performance of the proposed formula, while using the proposed Bresenham\n\
    line-of-sight coverage model and assuming real sensors and 3D environment models\
    \ [34].\nKhaoula, Z. et al. (2020) [35] suggested a conceptual framework to maximize\
    \ the\nsensing coverage, and lifetime and minimize the total deployment cost of\
    \ WSN in the smart\nbuilding by using the building information modeling (BIM)\
    \ database, which includes all the\nrequired information about the building and\
    \ uses the sensor parameters as input data to the\nproposed system; then, an evolutionary\
    \ algorithm (genetic algorithm) will be used to solve\nthe optimization problem.\
    \ After that, this optimized solution will be visualized using the\nBIM plugin\
    \ tool in an off-line and real-time 3D building model, considering heterogeneous\n\
    sensors and different obstacles. The decision variable vector of the optimization\
    \ problem\nwill be the sensor node location in the smart building, while the constraint\
    \ is to ﬁnd\nat least one path between the sink node and each sensor node, in\
    \ order to construct a\nconnected graph.\nDue to the emergence of 3D data regarding\
    \ urban terrain, Bin C et al. (2019) [36] used\nthis data to implement a heterogeneous\
    \ wireless directional sensor network deployment in\nsmart cities by optimizing\
    \ three objectives, i.e., coverage, connectivity quality, and lifetime,\nwhile\
    \ simultaneously considering connectivity and reliability as a constraint. They\
    \ used a\ngraph-based 3D SPM signal propagation model, which evolved by employing\
    \ a line-of-sight\n(LOS) model for simulating wireless signals and calculating\
    \ the path loss and intensity of\nthe signal at a given point. To solve the optimization\
    \ problem, they proposed a distributed\nparallel multi-objective evolutionary\
    \ algorithm (MOEAs), with a message passing interface\n(MPI) called a distributed\
    \ parallel cooperative coevolutionary multi-objective large-scale\nevolutionary\
    \ algorithm with multiple populations (DPCCMOLSEA-MP). Two types of\nterrain data\
    \ were used, i.e., even and rough. This proposed algorithm was compared with\n\
    other evolutionary algorithms, in terms of performance and operation time.\nAnother\
    \ optimization algorithm called the ﬂower pollination algorithm was modiﬁed\n\
    by Zhendong, W. et al. (2019) [37] to propose two new versions of the algorithm.\
    \ The\nﬁrst is called the improved ﬂower pollination algorithm (IFPL), which is\
    \ a single-objective\noptimization algorithm used to maximize the coverage area\
    \ of WSN deployment in an\nurban area, assuming for solar batteries and heterogeneous\
    \ sensors with obstacles. This\nmodiﬁcation includes the use of tent chaotic mapping\
    \ to generate the mapping sequence,\nas well as the use of a nonlinear convergence\
    \ factor, so that the convergence ability of the\nalgorithm can be improved. Additionally,\
    \ greedy cross-over strategy was used to enhance\nthe accuracy of the solution.\n\
    The second proposed version of the algorithm, called the non-dominated sorting\n\
    multi-objective ﬂower pollination algorithm (NSMOFPA), is a multi-objective optimization\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 5094\n12 of 30\nalgorithm used to maximize the coverage rate,\
    \ thus minimizing the energy consumption\nand node radiation overﬂow rates, assuming\
    \ for heterogeneous sensor nodes that are\ndeployed in forest environment having\
    \ non-rechargeable batteries with obstacles. The\nglobal pollination problem is\
    \ solved by using the external archive and leader strategies,\nand the diversity\
    \ of the population can be maintained by using the proposed crowding\ndegree method\
    \ and elite strategy. These two proposed algorithms are applied to the WSN\ndeployment\
    \ problem, through extensive simulation experiments using the MATLAB 2014b\nprogram.\
    \ After comparing with other optimization algorithms, they found that IFPA can\n\
    provide enhanced in-network coverage and deployment cost. Additionally, the NSMOFPA\n\
    has a better optimization solution for WSN deployment.\nSmart parking is one of\
    \ the smart city applications. Slimane Ch et al. (2021) [38]\ndeveloped a new\
    \ optimization algorithm for WSN system deployment for ﬁre detection\nin smart\
    \ car parks called multi-objective binary integer linear programing (MOBILP).\
    \ The\nnodes in these networks are divided into two groups, i.e., sensor nodes\
    \ for target monitoring\nand relay nodes that receive alert messages from the\
    \ sensor nodes. This proposed algorithm\naims to simultaneously minimize the number\
    \ of sensor and relay nodes, as well as decrease\nthe maximum distance between\
    \ sensor and sink nodes, while ensuring coverage and\nconnectivity. They evaluate\
    \ this method through different tests and compare the results\nwith existing work,\
    \ such as the mono-objective function.\nEnergy consumption and high cost are the\
    \ disadvantages that present when deploying\nhomogenous or heterogeneous WSNs\
    \ to solve coverage problems. So, Belal et al. (2020)\ndeveloped a deployment\
    \ model that depends on the probability sensing model (PSM) and\nharmony search\
    \ algorithm (HAS) to attain the balance between the coverage performance\nand\
    \ cost of heterogeneous WSN. PSM is used to solve the overlapping problem between\n\
    nodes. The proposed model is evaluated through multiple simulation scenarios,\
    \ using\nMATLAB, by analyzing the coverage ratio and cost and comparing the obtained\
    \ results\nwith those from the scenarios that used a homogenous model and meta-heuristic\
    \ algorithm,\nsuch as the genetic algorithm [39].\nWSN lifetimes depends on energy\
    \ consumption and the covered area. To have efﬁcient\ncoverage and energy usage,\
    \ there must be an optimum network deployment because\nit affects all network\
    \ performance. Aparajita et al. (2021) proposed an optimization\ndeployment algorithm\
    \ that used glowworm swarm optimization, K-means algorithm, and\nVoronoi cell\
    \ structure for optimizing coverage and energy consumption with a minimum\nnumber\
    \ of nodes, multi-hop transmission, and sleep-wake mechanism [40]. To increase\n\
    network lifetimes, network clustering is used, which means dividing the network\
    \ into\nvirtual groups. For each group there is a cluster head, with powerful\
    \ capabilities, that\nis responsible for gathering data and sending it to the\
    \ base station, either directly or\nthrough multi-hope routing. Cluster performance\
    \ is a very important issue, since it affects\nnetwork lifetimes. Mohit, K. et\
    \ al. (2021) proposed a modiﬁed genetic algorithm-based\nload-balanced clustering\
    \ algorithm for WSN (MGALBC) that depends on residual energy.\nThen, compare it\
    \ with the (GALBC) algorithm. The new suggested algorithm shows an\nenhancement\
    \ in network lifetime, energy consumption, and the number of active sensor\nnodes\
    \ [41].\nAhmed et al. (2021) [42] tried to enhance WSN coverage and cost by proposing\
    \ a\nmulti-objective optimization algorithm (MOO) with variable-length decision\
    \ space for\nsensor deployment in a 2D environment. This algorithm used social\
    \ class multi-objective\nparticle swarm optimization with V-length nature (SC-MOPSO).\
    \ It expands the concept of\nsocial interaction of particle swarm optimization\
    \ by dividing the solution space into classes\naccording to their dimensions and\
    \ combines inter- and intra-class operators, in order to\nconﬁrm the required\
    \ dynamics of the solution changes to satisfy the Pareto front. This\nalgorithm\
    \ was evaluated through a different experiment by comparing it with weighted\n\
    sum variable length particle swarm optimization (WS-VLPSO) and nondominated sorting\n\
    genetic algorithm (NSGA-II).\nSensors 2022, 22, 5094\n13 of 30\nOne of the WSN\
    \ applications is border surveillance. Amira, Z. et al. (2021) conducted\na real\
    \ experiment on the Tunisia–Libya border. The aim was to achieve full coverage\n\
    and connectivity through the deterministic deployment of sensor nodes. They took\
    \ the\nparameters of sensor density, consumed energy, and quality of sensor coverage\
    \ into account\nwhen trying to reach k-coverage and connectivity with a minimum\
    \ number of sensor nodes.\nDifferent types of WSNs were used in this experiment,\
    \ i.e., were the wireless multimedia\nsensor and marine wireless sensor networks,\
    \ as border monitoring systems [36].\nKalaipriyan, T. et al. (2021) [43] proposed\
    \ an optimization deployment algorithm\nfor the target wireless sensor network\
    \ (T-WSN) based on an evolutionary-based non-\ndominated sorting genetic algorithm\
    \ (NSGA-II) to solve a multi-objective problem of\nincreasing coverage and connectivity\
    \ for the target monitoring. Pseudo-codes were written,\nand multiple scenarios\
    \ were implemented using the MATLAB simulation tool. The non-\ndominated sorting\
    \ keeps the better solutions in multiple objectives simultaneously using\ndominant\
    \ relation. The performance evaluation of this multi-objective algorithm was\n\
    performed in terms of performance indicators, i.e., overall non-dominated vector\
    \ generation\n(ONGV) and spacing (SP). This algorithm showed the best performance,\
    \ after comparison\nwith other algorithms.\nConsidering the mobility, environment\
    \ properties and using heterogeneous nodes in\nthe WSN increases its deployment\
    \ problem complexity. Fatima H. et al. (2021) [44] took\nthese problems into account\
    \ when designing their optimization deployment algorithm\nbased on integer linear\
    \ programming (ILP). The objective of this algorithm is to maxi-\nmize coverage,\
    \ while taking network lifetime, mobility, and heterogeneity as constraints.\n\
    They observed and discussed the importance of subarea monitoring in this research.\
    \ For\nlarge-scale monitoring areas, they proposed using a swarm intelligence\
    \ meta-heuristic algo-\nrithm for network deployment. In a simulation experiment,\
    \ they evaluated this algorithm\nby comparing the coverage ratio and energy consumption\
    \ with other recent algorithms.\nWhile Mohsen Sh. et al. (2021) [45] solved the\
    \ problem of target and area coverage and\nconnectivity in randomly distributed\
    \ homogeneous and heterogeneous WSNs, consid-\nering both centralized and distributed\
    \ nodes, using the steepest descent (SD) analytical\ndeployment algorithm with\
    \ Armojo and Wolf rules, instead of evolutionary algorithms.\nThe proposed method\
    \ was compared with the genetic algorithm, in the case of moving\nthe sensor nodes\
    \ towards the target. Through simulations, they found that it outperforms\nthe\
    \ genetic algorithm; however, in the case of considering both coverage and connectivity,\n\
    besides managing sensor movement in the required area, a hybrid algorithm was\
    \ used,\nwhich consisted ﬁrst of the genetic algorithm to deﬁne the ﬁrst positions\
    \ of the sensor\nnodes and then using the steepest descent algorithm to move these\
    \ sensors to the optimal\nlocations. They found that this method can support the\
    \ sensor’s trajectory and better\naccuracy for network coverage and connectivity.\n\
    To solve the energy-efﬁcient coverage problem for randomly deployed mobile WSN\n\
    with obstacles, Pakarat M. et al. (2022) [46] produced an improved competitive\
    \ swarm\noptimizer to increase the covered area and decrease energy consumption\
    \ at the same time.\nThey also used the virtual force algorithm (VFA) and Voronoi\
    \ diagram (VD) to enhance\nnetwork performance through the optimization process.\
    \ To control the position of the\nsensors, the VFA was integrated with a boundary\
    \ mechanism, while the VD was used to\nget the network information for the decoding\
    \ process.\n4. Research Method\nIn this paper, we applied a systematic mapping\

    \ study, the following research questions (RQs) have been identiﬁed and dis-\n\
    cussed. Each research question is related to a particular aspect of WSN deployment\n\
    optimization in smart cities, as listed below:\n1.\nWhat is the number and distribution\
    \ of studies published on WSN deployment\noptimization in the period between 2015–2022?\n\
    2.\nWhich are the most used optimization algorithms in the current studies that\
    \ are\nrelated to WSN deployment optimization in smart cities?\n3.\nWhat are the\
    \ advantages of using optimization algorithms in solving the deployment\nproblem\
    \ of WSN?\n4.\nWhat are the performance metrics that should be considered when\
    \ deploying WSNs\nin smart cities?\n5.\nWhat are the most used simulation and\
    \ software platforms to simulate and analyze\nthe WSN deployment scenarios in\
    \ the literature?\n6.\nWhat are the challenges and issues that WSN deployment\
    \ is facing in smart cities?\n7.\nWhat are the potential future issues for WSN\
    \ deployment in smart cities?\n4.2. Scientiﬁc Databases and Search Strategy\n\
    Four online academic search engines were used to conduct the search and ﬁnd the\n\
    relevant papers:\n1.\nIEEE Xplore digital library;\n2.\nScience direct;\n3.\n\
    Springer link;\n4.\nScopus.\nTo make an automatic search on the chosen libraries,\
    \ the search string consisted of the\nfollowing sections:\nWireless, sensor, network,\
    \ (deployment, deployment algorithm, or deployment op-\ntimization), and smart\
    \ city.\nIn the screening phase, the papers that were initially collected were\
    \ ﬁltered until only\npapers that answer the research questions remained. In this\
    \ work, relevant papers were\nselected using the following inclusion and exclusion\
    \ criterion.\nInclusion criterion:\n•\nPublications related directly to the deployment\
    \ of WSN sensor nodes using optimiza-\ntion algorithms.\n•\nPublications dealing\
    \ with enhancing or maximizing the coverage and connectivity\nof WSNs.\n•\nPublications\
    \ in the ﬁeld of WSN deployment in smart city applications.\nSensors 2022, 22,\
    \ 5094\n15 of 30\nExclusion criterion:\n•\nPapers published before 2015.\n•\n\
    Publications not written in the English language.\n•\nPublications related to\
    \ other types of WSN deployment methods, such as using geo-\nmetric or classical\
    \ deployment methods.\n•\nPublications related to other WSN problems, such as\
    \ localization, routing, data gather-\ning, etc.\nStarting with the general search\
    \ string “WSN deployment”, the number of publications\ncollected from IEEE Xplore\
    \ digital library was 253, Science Direct was 354, SpringerLink\nwas 621, and\
    \ Scopus was 586 documents. After using inclusion and exclusion criterion\nand\
    \ removing duplications, the total number of relevant studies was 68 documents\
    \ that\nrelated directly to the deployment problem of WSN using optimization algorithms\
    \ during\nthis period.\n5. Results\nMapping studies are often carried out based\
    \ solely on the abstracts. The primary study\nselection was increased by applying\
    \ the search criteria to all of the following sections: title,\nabstract, introduction,\
    \ and conclusion. The included papers, as well as a comparison be-\ntween their\
    \ used algorithms and objectives, are listed in Table 1. The following subsections\n\
    show the results and discussions of each research question.\nTable 1. Comparison\

    \ used meta-heuristic optimization algorithms to solve the\ndeployment problem.\
    \ The meta-heuristic stands for the Greek words meta and heuriskein,\nwhich means\
    \ solving problems using an upper-level methodology. Meta-heuristic algo-\nrithms\
    \ represent a part of optimization in computer science and applied mathematics\n\
    concerning algorithms and computational complexity theory, which depend on inspiring\n\
    their solutions from natural habits, such as particle swarms, annealing processes,\
    \ and ant\ncolonies. These types of algorithms are used in many ﬁelds, such as\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence,\nmathematical programming, soft computing, and operations\
    \ research. These algorithms\nare general approximate algorithms that can be deployed\
    \ to different types of optimization\nproblems and can be updated to solve any\
    \ hard problem, since they provide fast, ﬂexible,\nSensors 2022, 22, 5094\n23\
    \ of 30\nand robust solutions; besides, they are easy to design and implement.\
    \ The disadvantage of\nthese algorithms is that there is no guarantee that the\
    \ approximated solution is closed to\nthe optimal solution. Further, because of\
    \ the no free lunch (NFL) theorem, there is no meta-\nheuristic algorithm that\
    \ can be used generally for different optimization problems [103].\nThis means\
    \ that an optimization algorithm can outperform well for a speciﬁc problem\nbut\
    \ not so well with another one. Hence, there is always a need for newly proposed\n\
    optimization algorithms to ﬁnd solutions for more complex problems. This can be\
    \ done\neither by proposing new algorithms or updating existing ones or by a combination\
    \ of two\ndifferent types of optimization algorithms, such as a hybrid algorithm\
    \ between classical\nand meta-heuristic algorithms or meta-heuristic and artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence algorithms [11].\nAbout 35% of the reviewed studies worked on an\

    \ due to their ability to solve complex problems and provide\na satisfactory solution\
    \ in a feasible time [90]. These algorithms are applied to enhance\nnetwork performance\
    \ by combining them with other approaches and then comparing the\nobtained results\
    \ with other algorithms, such as the genetic, greedy, and multi-objective\nevolutionary\
    \ algorithms. The ratio of participation for each algorithm is shown in Figure\

    \ disadvantage of these algorithms is that there is no guarantee that the \napproximated\

    \ should be considered when deploying\nWSNs, starting with coverage and connectivity,\
    \ which are the most important parameters\nthat ensure high quality of service\
    \ from WSNs, as discussed earlier in Section 2.6, as well as\nother parameters,\
    \ such as the lifetime, energy consumption, latency, signal strength (RSSI),\n\
    accuracy, scalability, reliability, and more [32]. A brief discussion of these\
    \ parameters is\nexplained below.\n•\nLifetime\nOne of the most important metrics\
    \ in WSNs is the network’s lifetime. Through\nresearch, it is found that network\
    \ lifetime depends on two dimensions, the ﬁrst is network\nconnectivity, which\
    \ means that network lifetime can be deﬁned as the period from the\nnetwork deployment\
    \ until one or more nodes lost connection to the sink node. While the\nsecond\
    \ dimension depends on energy consumption, and this means network lifetime is\n\
    the period from network deployment until one or multiple live nodes fall below\
    \ a speciﬁc\nenergy threshold [104]. Most conducted studies in Table 1 tried to\
    \ maximize lifetime\nSensors 2022, 22, 5094\n24 of 30\nthrough optimal node deployment\
    \ that maximizes network coverage and connectivity,\nhence minimizing the power\
    \ consumption that leads to prolonged network lifetime.\n•\nEnergy Consumption\n\
    Each node in WSN needs energy in three parts, i.e., collecting, processing, and\
    \ commu-\nnicating data. The amount of consumed energy depends not only on the\
    \ energy capacity\nbut also on the heterogenous functionalities of the sensor\
    \ node. The efﬁcient use of energy\nprolongs the network lifetime. This can be\
    \ achieved through reducing the number of\nexchanged messages between nodes and\
    \ scheduling sleep intervals for redundant nodes,\nwhile leaving the remaining\
    \ nodes active to save network coverage and connectivity, as well\nas using efﬁcient\
    \ routing protocols; all these steps will minimize energy consumption [28].\n\
    •\nLatency and accuracy\nLatency and accuracy are related to each other. Latency\
    \ means the time required to\nsend a message from the source node to the destination\
    \ node across the network, and this\nrepresents the total delay of the sent message.\
    \ Accuracy represents the efﬁcient arrival of\nthe sent message to the destination\
    \ within the limited time required, so reducing delay\nensures network accuracy,\
    \ and this is an important performance metric in WSN [11].\n•\nSignal strength\
    \ (RSSI)\nThis metric represents a measure of link quality and depends on the\
    \ distance between\ntwo nodes to calculate the reachability of the node through\
    \ the communication process.\nRSSI stands for received signal strength indicator\
    \ that can be determined from the following\nequation [76,105]:\nRSSI = −10 ×\
    \ n × log10(d) + p\n(5)\nwhere,\nd: is the distance from the sensor node measured\
    \ in meters;\nn: is the propagation constant or path-loss exponent;\np: is the\
    \ power in reception mode (Dbm) (decibel-milliwatts).\n•\nScalability and Reliability\n\
    Scalability can be deﬁned as the ability of the network to be extended by including\n\
    more nodes in the network, while preserving network performance. The reliability\
    \ of a\nWSN represents its ability to deliver sensed data to the sink node, while\
    \ maintaining cover-\nage and connectivity through the mission period. This period\
    \ is application-dependent [90].\nWhile using optimization algorithms in solving\
    \ the WSN deployment problem, the\nperformance metrics that have been presented\
    \ in the literature to measure the qualities of\nthe approximations collected\
    \ from different optimization algorithms can be described as\nfollows [95].\n\
    •\nThe number of non-dominated solutions (NDS)\nIf Ps represents the set that\
    \ contains all the non-dominated solutions generated by the\nproposed algorithm\
    \ A, then the NDS-metric is deﬁned by the size of Ps, as follows:\nNDS = |Ps|\n\
    (6)\nA higher value of NDS means that a sufﬁcient number of choices exist [95].\n\
    •\nSet coverage metric (C-metric)\nIf there are two optimal sets of non-dominated\
    \ solutions, then the set coverage is\nthe comparison metric between these two\
    \ sets, which represents the ratio of the non-\ndominated solutions in set2, dominated\
    \ by non-dominated solutions in set1 and divided by\nthe number of solutions in\
    \ the set2. This means, if C(set1,set2) < C(set2,set1), then set2 has\nbetter\
    \ a solution than set1 [99].\n•\nDiversity metric (∆)\nThe diversity metric (∆)\
    \ determines the range of spread accomplished through the\nobtained solutions.\n\
    •\nHypervolume metric (HV-metric or S-metric)\nSensors 2022, 22, 5094\n25 of 30\n\
    The hypervolume metric (HV) (also deﬁned as the S-metric) presents the joint in-\n\
    formation about closeness and diversity in the acquired non-dominated set of solutions\n\
    (Ps) [42].\n•\nGenerational distance metric (GD-metric)\nThe generational distance\
    \ metric (GD-metric) determines how far the acquired Ps set\nof solutions is from\
    \ the true set PT.\n•\nComputation time or complexity\nThe computation time of\
    \ the optimization algorithm is required to measure its efﬁ-\nciency. An efﬁcient\
    \ algorithm should provide optimal solutions within an acceptable time.\nSo, this\
    \ metric is important for comparison between the algorithms [43,46].\nThe performance\
    \ metrics of each conducted study in this survey are presented in\nTable 1.\n\
    5.4. Simulation Programs (RQ5)\nThe preferable simulation tool for WSN deployment\
    \ using an optimization algorithm\nis the MATLAB/Simulink program [106,107], which\
    \ was used by many researchers in the\nliterature, as illustrated in Table 1.\
    \ This efﬁcient simulation program was designed by\nMathWorks. MATLAB stands for\
    \ matrix laboratory used with Simulink tools to design,\nsimulate, and analyze\
    \ embedded systems. It contains some toolboxes to generate new\nnetwork scenarios,\
    \ and the simulation data can be visualized using ﬁve tools, which are\nthe MATLAB\
    \ graphics, port value display, scopes, dashboard block library, and simulation\n\
    data inspector. This simulation program can work in two modes, the deterministic\
    \ and\nprobabilistic modes. The ﬁrst mode is used for code testing and debugging,\
    \ while the\nsecond one is used for wireless communication. It can be used to\
    \ simulate MAC layer\noperation, radio transmission, and collision detection in\
    \ ad hoc networks for any number\nof sensor nodes via an embedded tool called\
    \ Powerler.\n5.5. Challenges, Limitations, and Future Issues for WSN Deployment\
    \ in Smart Cities (RQ5&RQ6)\nNode deployment of WSN can be either indoor or outdoor,\
    \ depending on the smart\ncity application requirements. Indoor deployment can\
    \ be applied in closed areas, such as\nbuildings and structures, while outdoor\
    \ deployment can be applied in open and harsh\nareas, such as roads, gardens,\
    \ forests, and volcanoes. So, the area of the monitored region\nplays a signiﬁcant\
    \ role in determining the deployment type to be random, deterministic, or\ndynamic\
    \ [108]. The network coverage type also depends on the nature of the monitored\n\
    area, which can be area, target, or barrier coverage. In addition, some applications\
    \ require\none-connectivity, that is, a single path between sensor and sink node;\
    \ others require more\nreliable connectivity, called k-connectivity, with the\
    \ sink node [109].\nEach study has its own advantages, disadvantages, and limitations,\
    \ according to the\napplication, environment, sensing model, coverage type, and\
    \ required objectives, but it has\nbeen observed that most of these have the following\
    \ issues:\n•\nMost of the research studies deal with homogenous nodes in WSN and\
    \ use unreal and\nsimpliﬁed models.\n•\nMost of the research studies deal with\
    \ 2D plane deployment, while modern applica-\ntions require 3D space deployment.\n\
    •\nSecurity, reliability, scalability, and energy consumption are also important\
    \ issues\nthat need to be considered with coverage and connectivity when deploying\
    \ a sensor\nnode [110,111].\n•\nMost papers do not take the existence of the obstacle\
    \ into account when determining\ncoverage and connectivity.\n•\nLocalization techniques\
    \ need to be merged with the deployment techniques, in order\nto increase reliability\
    \ and robustness.\nIn the future, most of these limitations should be taken into\
    \ account when designing\nan optimization deployment algorithm for WSN node deployment.\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 5094\n26 of 30\n6. Conclusions\nThis paper provides a systematic\
    \ mapping study regarding the deployment problems\nof WSN sensor nodes in smart\
    \ city applications using the meta-heuristic optimization\nmethod. First, a detailed\
    \ background on smart city and WSN is presented; then, the\nearlier studies on\
    \ WSN deployment are reviewed. The research methodology discussed\nthe research\
    \ questions and used databases and inclusion and exclusion criterion to obtain\n\
    the results. It was found that 68 papers in the period between 2015–2022 related\
    \ directly\nto the WSN deployment using meta-heuristic optimization algorithms,\
    \ and 35% of these\nstudies focused on updating the swarm optimization methods.\
    \ Most of the selected studies\nused the MATLAB simulation tool to design and\
    \ code the WSN optimization algorithm for\nits efﬁciency and simplicity. Finally,\
    \ this paper discussed the challenges and limitations\nthat WSN deployment faces\
    \ in smart cities, as well as suggested future issues.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    \ \n\"Things\" that are part of the \"Internet of Things\" (IoT) are equipped\
    \ with sensors, software, and network \nconnectivity, giving them the ability\
    \ to gather and share data with one another and with other devices. The \nongoing\
    \ digital transformation is taking place in many different domains, including\
    \ medical, industry, \ntransportation, and urban planning[1]. Connected devices\
    \ and their networks are important to this \ntransformation. This response will\
    \ concentrate on the architecture, applications, and future directions of \npotential\
    \ development of IoT networks.The term \"Internet of Things\" (IoT) describes\
    \ a network of actual \nphysical objects that are linked to the internet and are\
    \ capable of exchanging data and information with one \nanother. These items,\
    \ often known as \"smart devices,\" have sensors, software, and network connectivity\
    \ that \nenable data collection and transmission[2]. Healthcare, industry, transportation,\
    \ and smart cities are just a few of \nthe sectors being transformed by IoT networks.IoT\
    \ networks are becoming more and more significant as \nbusinesses all over the\
    \ world continue to utilize this technology to increase operational effectiveness,\
    \ cut costs, \nand improve customer experience[3]. Over the coming years, the\
    \ global IoT industry is anticipated to expand \nrapidly, increasing in size to\
    \ an estimated $1.5 trillion by 2030.This study paper's main goal is to give a\
    \ \nthorough review of IoT networks, covering its design, uses, and prospects.\
    \ Also, this study will emphasize the \ndrawbacks and restrictions of IoT networks\

    III. \nArchitecture of IoT Networks \nIoT networks are made up of a variety of\
    \ parts that cooperate to make it possible to gather, process, and transmit \n\
    data. An IoT network's essential elements include: \nA. Definition and components\
    \ of IoT networks \ni. \nDevices: These are actual physical things with processors,\
    \ sensors, and network connectivity. Smart \nhousehold appliances, wearable fitness\
    \ trackers, commercial machinery, and environmental sensors are \na few examples\
    \ of IoT gadgets. \nii. \nSensors: Sensors are used to collect data from the physical\
    \ environment, such as temperature, \nhumidity, pressure, or position. A wide\
    \ range of sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, \nmicrophones, and cameras,\
    \ can be used by IoT networks. \niii. \nActuators: These parts are used to change\
    \ the environment in response to information gathered by \nsensors. For instance,\
    \ an IoT network may employ actuators to modify a room's temperature or turn on\
    \ \nand off lighting. \niv. \nNetwork Connectivity: IoT devices need to be connected\
    \ to a network to transmit data. Many network \ntechnologies, such as Wi-Fi, cellular\
    \ networks, and Bluetooth, can be used to do this. \nTurkish Journal of Computer\
    \ and Mathematics Education  \nVol.11 No.03 (2020), 2067-2075 \nDOI: https://doi.org/10.17762/turcomat.v11i3.13604\
    \ \n \n \n2070 \n \n \n \nResearch Article  \nv. \nData processing is necessary\
    \ in order to make use of the data that IoT devices collect. This can be \ndone\
    \ on the device itself, on a nearby edge device, or on the cloud. Data analysis,\
    \ aggregation, and \nfiltering are all examples of processing. \nvi. \nStorage:IoT\
    \ networks may store, process, and analyse data using cloud services. These can\
    \ include \nservices for data storage, data analytics, and machine learning. \n\
    vii. \nApplications: Software applications can be used by IoT networks to let\
    \ users interact with and manage \nthe network. These can include mobile or web\
    \ tools that let consumers access and keep tabs on data \ncoming from their Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) devices. \nviii. \nSecurity: IoT networks need to be secure\
    \ to avoid unauthorized access or modification of data. These \nmay include threat\
    \ detection technologies, access controls, and encryption. \nThese components\
    \ work together to enable IoT networks to collect, process, and send data from\
    \ the real world. \nIoT networks can offer a number of advantages by fusing these\
    \ elements, including increased operational \neffectiveness, lower costs, and\
    \ better user experiences. \nB. Four layers of IoT network architecture \nIoT\
    \ networks can be further divided into blocks or modules, each of which serves\
    \ a particular function. \nDepending on the particular use case of the IoT network,\
    \ these blocks can be organized in a variety of ways. \nSome of the typical building\
    \ blocks or modules for IoT network topologies include the following:All physical\
    \ \ncomponents of the IoT network, such as sensors, actuators, and gateways, are\
    \ included in the device layer. These \ngadgets gather information and talk to\
    \ other gadgets in the network.All network elements that permit \ncommunication\
    \ between devices, such as Wi-Fi routers, gateways, and switches, are included\
    \ in the network \nlayer. The network layer also comprises protocols and technologies,\
    \ such Bluetooth, Zigbee, and LoRa, that \nallow devices to connect with one another.\
    \ \ni. \nCloud Layer: This layer consists of cloud-based services that give the\
    \ IoT network access to storage, \ncompute, and analytics. These services can\
    \ be used to store data, handle data processing and analysis, \nand give end users\
    \ insights. \nii. \nApplication Layer: This layer consists of computer programs\
    \ that give end users access to the \ninformation gathered by the Internet of\
    \ Things network. These programs can be used to display data, \nstart processes,\
    \ and provide notifications. \niii. \nSecurity Layer:The security procedures in\
    \ this layer assure the availability, confidentiality, and \nintegrity of the\
    \ data gathered by the IoT network. Threat detection, access limits, and encryption\
    \ are \nexamples of security measures. \niv. \nDevice Layer:Device management,\
    \ network monitoring, and firmware updates are just a few of the \ntools and services\
    \ that help network administrators manage the IoT network. \nIoT networks can\
    \ be designed in a variety of ways depending on the network's needs and the individual\
    \ use \ncase. IoT networks often depend on a combination of physical objects,\
    \ network elements, cloud-based services, \nsoftware applications, security methods,\
    \ and management tools to operate, regardless of the architecture. \nC. Centralized\
    \ and decentralized networks \ni. \nCentralized Networks: All data gathered by\
    \ IoT devices is transmitted to a central server for \nprocessing and storage\
    \ in a centralized IoT network design. On-site or in the cloud are both viable\
    \ \nlocations for this server. The server is responsible for processing and analyzing\
    \ data, and may also \nserve as a gateway to other systems. As all the data is\
    \ in one place, centralized networks can be simpler \nto manage and maintain.\
    \ Yet, centralized networks may be less scalable and more subject to single \n\
    points of failure. \nii. \nDecentralized Networks: With a decentralized IoT network\
    \ architecture, data processing and storage \nis distributed among different devices\
    \ and systems. For instance, instead of being routed to a \ncentralized server,\
    \ data gathered by IoT devices may be processed and analyzed on the edge, in a\
    \ \nnearby gateway or device. While there are several nodes that can handle data\
    \ processing and storage, \nTurkish Journal of Computer and Mathematics Education\
    \  \nVol.11 No.03 (2020), 2067-2075 \nDOI: https://doi.org/10.17762/turcomat.v11i3.13604\
    \ \n \n \n2071 \n \n \n \nResearch Article  \ndecentralized networks can be more\
    \ scalable and resilient than centralized networks. Decentralized \nnetworks,\
    \ on the other hand, can be trickier to run and maintain because data is dispersed\
    \ throughout \nnumerous hardware and software platforms. \nNetwork topologies\
    \ that are centralized or decentralized each have benefits and drawbacks of their\
    \ own. The \nnetwork's size, the amount of data being collected, whether real-time\
    \ processing is needed, and the required \nlevel of security all play a role in\
    \ the architecture choice. To attain the appropriate level of scalability, \n\
    robustness, and security, certain IoT networks may employ a hybrid architecture,\
    \ which mixes centralized and \ndecentralized features. \nIV. \nApplications of\
    \ IoT Networks \nIoT networks are used in a wide range of fields and businesses,\
    \ including manufacturing, transportation, \nhealthcare, and smart cities. Below\
    \ is a summary of some of the major IoT network-using industries: \ni. \nHealthcare:\
    \ By enabling remote patient monitoring, streamlining hospital operations, and\
    \ giving real-\ntime patient data, IoT networks can improve patient outcomes and\
    \ lower expenses. IoT devices, for \ninstance, can be used to track patients with\
    \ long-term diseases like diabetes or heart disease and notify \nmedical professionals\
    \ of any changes in their state. \nii. \nManufacturing: By providing real-time\
    \ monitoring of production processes and equipment, IoT \nnetworks can assist\
    \ increase operational efficiency and decrease downtime. IoT sensors, for instance,\
    \ \ncan be used to monitor machine performance and anticipate maintenance requirements\
    \ prior to a \nbreakdown. \niii. \nTransportation: IoT networks can aid in enhancing\
    \ user experience, reducing congestion, and \nimproving safety in the transportation\
    \ sector. IoT sensors, for instance, can be used to track traffic \npatterns and\
    \ modify traffic lights to improve flow. \nIoT networks have the potential to\
    \ enhance urban environments' sustainability, safety, and livability. IoT sensors,\
    \ \nfor instance, can be used to monitor air quality, control energy use, and\
    \ improve waste management. \nA. Examples of specific use cases \nThe following\
    \ are some particular use cases for IoT networks: \na) Smart Homes: IoT devices\
    \ can be utilised to build energy-efficient, safe, and simple to maintain smart\
    \ \nhouses. For instance, IoT-enabled security systems can send out real-time\
    \ notifications if there is any \nunexpected activity in the home, while IoT-enabled\
    \ thermostats can automatically adjust the \ntemperature based on user preferences\
    \ and occupancy. \nb) Asset tracking: IoT networks can be used to track assets\
    \ like inventory, equipment, and vehicles in real \ntime. For example, IoT sensors\
    \ can be used to monitor the location and condition of products in transit, \n\
    enabling organizations to optimize their supply chain operations. \nc) Environmental\
    \ Monitoring: IoT networks can be used to keep an eye on things like weather patterns,\
    \ \nwater quality, and air quality. IoT sensors, for instance, can be used to\
    \ forecast weather patterns or \nidentify pollution levels in streams to assist\
    \ stop natural disasters. \nd) Agriculture: Agricultural operations including\
    \ irrigation, fertilizer, and pest control can be monitored \nand optimized via\
    \ IoT networks. IoT sensors, for instance, can be used to enhance crop development\
    \ \nand output by monitoring soil moisture levels and adjusting irrigation systems.\
    \ \n \nV. \nIV. Future Directions of IoT Networks \nA. Emerging trends in IoT\
    \ networks \nDigital twins are virtual reproductions of actual systems or gadgets.\
    \ They can be used to imitate the behavior of \nsystems in the real world because\
    \ they are developed using sensor data. Design, testing, and maintenance of IoT\
    \ \nsystems and devices can be made better with the use of digital twins. \nTurkish\

    Research Article  \ni. \nFog Computing: A decentralized computing architecture\
    \ known as fog computing puts processing \npower closer to Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) devices. Although though it uses a more distributed \nmethodology, it\
    \ is comparable to edge computing. For real-time IoT applications, data processing\
    \ speed \nand latency reduction are essential, and fog computing can help. \n\
    ii. \nHybrid Cloud: A hybrid cloud is an infrastructure that combines public and\
    \ private clouds. IoT \nnetworks may balance their needs for affordability, scalability,\
    \ and security with the aid of hybrid \nclouds. For instance, private cloud infrastructure\
    \ can be used to store sensitive data whereas public \ncloud infrastructure can\
    \ be used to store less sensitive data. \niii. \nHuman-Machine Interfaces (HMIs):\
    \ HMIs allow users to communicate with IoT systems and devices. \nHMIs come in\
    \ tactile, aural, and visual forms. These could aid in enhancing IoT networks'\
    \ usability and \naccessibility. \niv. \nPredictive Maintenance: In order to forecast\
    \ when maintenance is necessary before equipment fails, \npredictive maintenance\
    \ uses data from IoT sensors. Reduced downtime, increased dependability, and \n\
    lower maintenance costs can all be a result of predictive maintenance. \nv. \n\
    Smart Energy: To maximize energy efficiency and minimize waste, smart energy utilises\
    \ IoT networks. \nIoT sensors, for instance, can be used to track energy use in\
    \ buildings and modify heating or lighting \nbased on occupancy levels. \nvi.\
    \ \nVoice Recognition: Voice-activated instructions and IoT device control are\
    \ made possible by speech \nrecognition technologies. Speech recognition can help\
    \ make IoT networks more convenient and \naccessible. \n \nB. Edge computing and\
    \ 5G networks \nThe adoption of edge computing and 5G networks is one of the most\
    \ important trends in IoT networks. Instead \nof transmitting data to a central\
    \ server for processing, edge computing uses devices at the network's edge to\
    \ \nprocess data. Many IoT applications depend on low latency and quick reaction\
    \ times, which can be achieved \nwith this method. Contrarily, 5G networks provide\
    \ greater bandwidth and lower latency than earlier wireless \nnetwork generations,\
    \ making them ideal for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. \nC. Artificial\
    \ Intelligence and Machine Learning \nThe growing application of machine learning\
    \ (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) technology in IoT networks is \nanother\
    \ trend. IoT devices can benefit from AI and ML to improve decision-making and\
    \ automate processes like \nanomaly detection and predictive maintenance. Costs\
    \ can be cut, productivity can be increased, and the user \nexperience can be\
    \ improved. \nD. Blockchain technology \nIn IoT networks, blockchain technology\
    \ is another new development. Blockchain is a distributed ledger \ntechnology\
    \ that makes transactions safe, open, and impenetrable. Blockchain can be utilized\
    \ in IoT networks to \nbuild secure, decentralized systems that are impervious\
    \ to hackers or tampering. Blockchain technology, for \ninstance, can be applied\
    \ to develop a safe and open supply chain management system that can monitor the\
    \ flow \nof commodities from manufacture to delivery.IoT networks have a promising\
    \ future, filled with both exciting \nprospects and difficult obstacles. To ensure\
    \ that IoT networks can reach their full potential as the technology \ndevelops,\
    \ it will be crucial to solve challenges like privacy, security, and interoperability.\
    \ \nVI. \nChallenges & Limitations of IoT Network \nIoT networks provide many\
    \ benefits, but they also present a number of obstacles and constraints that need\
    \ to be \novercome. We will look at a few of these difficulties and their potential\
    \ effects in this section. \nA. Privacy and Security Issues \nTurkish Journal\
    \ of Computer and Mathematics Education  \nVol.11 No.03 (2020), 2067-2075 \nDOI:\
    \ https://doi.org/10.17762/turcomat.v11i3.13604 \n \n \n2073 \n \n \n \nResearch\
    \ Article  \nSecurity and privacy issues are one of the biggest problems facing\
    \ IoT networks. Given that there are billions of \ninternet-connected gadgets,\
    \ the possibility of cyberattacks and data breaches is a major worry. IoT devices\
    \ \nsometimes have poor security safeguards, which leaves them open to hacking\
    \ and other online dangers. \nFurthermore, IoT devices frequently gather and send\
    \ sensitive data, such private health information, \nnecessitating strong privacy\
    \ measures. \nB. Problems with Interoperability and Compatibility \nInteroperability\
    \ and compatibility problems are another difficulty facing IoT networks. IoT systems\
    \ and devices \nare frequently created by several manufacturers and may employ\
    \ various communication protocols or standards. \nAs a result, integrating equipment\
    \ from many manufacturers and developing a cohesive system may be difficult. \n\
    Additionally, the demand for interoperability and compatibility will only increase\
    \ as IoT networks develop. \nC. Congestion in the Network and Scalability \nScalability\
    \ and network congestion are additional issues that IoT networks must deal with.\
    \ The need for \nbandwidth and other network resources increases along with the\
    \ number of devices connected to the network. \nThis may cause network congestion,\
    \ which may have an effect on how well IoT applications work. Scaling the \nnetwork\
    \ infrastructure to meet the rising demand might be difficult as the number of\
    \ IoT devices keeps \nincreasing. \nD. Battery Life and Power Use \nFor IoT networks,\
    \ power consumption and battery life are major obstacles. Many Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) \ndevices run on batteries and can be found in far-off or challenging-to-reach\
    \ places. This makes it difficult to \nchange batteries or recharge devices, which\
    \ may affect the network's overall dependability and performance. In \naddition,\
    \ power consumption will become a more pressing issue as the number of IoT devices\
    \ increases.IoT \nnetworks provide many advantages, but there are also a number\
    \ of problems and restrictions that need to be \nworked around. IoT networks may\
    \ realize their full potential by creating strong security and privacy measures,\
    \ \naddressing interoperability and compatibility challenges, managing network\
    \ congestion, and minimizing power \nusage. \nVII. \nConclusion \nWe have covered\
    \ the architecture, applications, and anticipated future developments of IoT networks\
    \ in this \npaper. We have looked at an IoT network's four-tiered architecture\
    \ and all of its components, such as sensors, \ngateways, cloud platforms, and\
    \ apps. We have also discussed the various applications of IoT networks in a \n\
    variety of fields, including healthcare, industry, transportation, and even smart\
    \ cities.We have also looked into \nthe most recent advancements in the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT), such as edge computing, 5G networks, AI, and \nblockchain.\
    \ The usefulness and value of IoT networks may rise as a result of these tendencies.IoT\
    \ networks \nprovide a lot of advantages, but they also have some disadvantages\
    \ that need to be dealt with. This includes \nproblems with energy use, battery\
    \ life, interoperability, scalability, security, and privacy. It also includes\
    \ \nproblems with network congestion.To fully realize the potential of IoT networks,\
    \ future research should focus \non fixing these problems and overcoming these\
    \ limitations. Managing network congestion, optimizing energy \nuse, creating\
    \ robust security and privacy measures, and resolving interoperability and compatibility\
    \ issues are a \nfew of them.IoT networks, which have the potential to revolutionize\
    \ numerous industries and raise people's \nliving standards everywhere, represent\
    \ a significant advancement in technology. With further research and \ndevelopment,\
    \ IoT networks will without a doubt play a significant role in determining the\

    \ in-depth contextualized tutorial on Agricultural IoT (Agri-IoT), cov-\nering\
    \ the fundamental concepts, assessment of routing architectures and protocols,\
    \ and performance\noptimization techniques via a systematic survey and synthesis\
    \ of the related literature. The negative\nimpacts of climate change and the increasing\
    \ global population on food security and unemployment\nthreats have motivated\
    \ the adoption of the wireless sensor network (WSN)-based Agri-IoT as an\nindispensable\
    \ underlying technology in precision agriculture and greenhouses to improve food\n\
    production capacities and quality. However, most related Agri-IoT testbed solutions\
    \ have failed to\nachieve their performance expectations due to the lack of an\
    \ in-depth and contextualized reference\ntutorial that provides a holistic overview\
    \ of communication technologies, routing architectures, and\nperformance optimization\
    \ modalities based on users’ expectations. Thus, although IoT applications\nare\
    \ founded on a common idea, each use case (e.g., Agri-IoT) varies based on the\
    \ speciﬁc performance\nand user expectations as well as technological, architectural,\
    \ and deployment requirements. Likewise,\nthe agricultural setting is a unique\
    \ and hostile area where conventional IoT technologies do not\napply, hence the\
    \ need for this tutorial. Consequently, this tutorial addresses these via the\
    \ following\ncontributions: (1) a systematic overview of the fundamental concepts,\
    \ technologies, and architectural\nstandards of WSN-based Agri-IoT, (2) an evaluation\
    \ of the technical design requirements of a robust,\nlocation-independent, and\
    \ affordable Agri-IoT, (3) a comprehensive survey of the benchmarking\nfault-tolerance\
    \ techniques, communication standards, routing and medium access control (MAC)\n\
    protocols, and WSN-based Agri-IoT testbed solutions, and (4) an in-depth case\
    \ study on how to\ndesign a self-healing, energy-efﬁcient, affordable, adaptive,\
    \ stable, autonomous, and cluster-based\nWSN-speciﬁc Agri-IoT from a proposed\
    \ taxonomy of multi-objective optimization (MOO) metrics\nthat can guarantee an\
    \ optimized network performance. Furthermore, this tutorial established new\n\
    taxonomies of faults, architectural layers, and MOO metrics for cluster-based\
    \ Agri-IoT (CA-IoT)\nnetworks and a three-tier objective framework with remedial\
    \ measures for designing an efﬁcient\nassociated supervisory protocol for cluster-based\
    \ Agri-IoT networks.\nKeywords: Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE); cluster-based Agricultural\

    \ and Tutorial Contributions\nCurrently, agriculture is the world’s largest business,\
    \ employing over one-third of the\neconomically active global population and over\
    \ 70% of the economically active population\nin Africa [1,2]. The impacts of high\

    \ (Agri-IoT) via\nprecision farming and greenhouses the most promising remedy.\
    \ However, the existing\nbenchmarking Agri-IoT solutions can only be acquired,\
    \ deployed, and managed by farmers\nwith sufﬁcient ﬁnancial resources, an electricity\
    \ grid, Wi-Fi/cellular coverage, and technical\nexpertise in IoT, which is generally\
    \ not the case in Ghana and Sub-Saharan Africa. These\ncall for a paradigm shift\
    \ in farming techniques, and the most promising game-changers are\nprecision farming\
    \ and greenhouses whose underlying technology is a robust, affordable,\nautonomous,\
    \ and optimized, innovative WSN-based Agri-IoT [3] that satisﬁes the critical\n\
    design expectations presented in Figure 2.\nFigure 1. Seasonal failure probability-2014\

    \ tutorials have been authored on this subject, they present\nmere classifications\
    \ of communications trends on classical IoT [2,5–8] without any context-\nspecific\
    \ technical considerations of the critical design expectations in Figure 2. For\
    \ instance,\nthe authors in [2,6,7] examined IoT’s communication infrastructure,\
    \ platforms, standards,\ndevelopment trends, and possible network solutions in\
    \ agriculture. Similarly, the roles of\nindustrial IoT (thus, identification-based\
    \ IoT (example, RFID [6], WSN [9], QR codes [5],\nbarcodes) and communication-based\
    \ IoT (example, ZigBee [5], Z-wave [6], MQTT [5,6],\nLoRa [10], SigFox [11], BLE\
    \ [12], Li-Fi [5], Wi-Fi [13], Near-Field Communication (NFC) [5],\nand power\
    \ line area network) were reviewed in terms of current research trends, applications,\n\
    and main challenges in [5]. Although RFID tags and WSNs have similar data acquisition\n\
    capacities, the authors concluded that WSN technology is more energy-efficient\
    \ and suitable\nfor Agri-IoT than the costly RFID technologies [5]. Overall, Agri-IoT\
    \ technology has not\nyielded its intended paradigm transformation in the agricultural\
    \ sector due to several technical\nchallenges that have not received adequate\
    \ contextual research considerations [14]:\n1.\nThe agricultural setting is a\
    \ unique area where conventional IoT technologies do\nnot apply. Existing Agri-IoT\
    \ solutions are location-restricted because they are mostly\nbased on Wi-Fi or\
    \ cellular communication technologies and electricity grids with\nconstrained\
    \ coverages in Africa. A typical African agricultural setting lacks access\nto\
    \ reliable electricity and the Internet for cellular/Wi-Fi-based technologies,\
    \ and the\nintended users (farmers) of Agri-IoT technology are low-income earners\
    \ with limited\ntechnological expertise. Common Agri-IoT applications mainly utilize\
    \ architecture-\nrestricted, high-resource-demanding routing techniques (e.g.,\
    \ routing over low-power\nand lossy networks protocol (RPL)) and communication\
    \ standards (e.g., 4G, 5G, Zig-\nBee, LoRa, Wi-FI, and long-term evolution (LTE))\
    \ [15], which are difﬁcult to access\nin typical African farms. Consequently,\
    \ Agri-IoT users in Africa expect a context-\nrelevant solution that is affordable,\
    \ simple to deploy and operate by non-experts,\nlocation-unrestricted, supportive\
    \ of large-scale farm management, and based on freely\navailable technologies\
    \ that do not require licensing. Thus, they are unlike popular IoT\nuse cases\
    \ such as medical, vehicular, and industrial IoT, whose designs are mainly\naffected\
    \ by critical factors including security, stable connectivity, and interference,\n\
    respectively, Agri-IoT is compelled to drive on affordable battery-powered SNs,\
    \ which\nmake architecture, low-power communication technology, power optimization,\
    \ cost,\nfault tolerance, multihop routing, scalability, and environmental impact\
    \ critical design\nfactors in order to address its resource or deployment-induced\
    \ challenges [12,16,17].\n2.\nHigh susceptibility to faults and failures: Agri-IoT\
    \ networks are vulnerable to faults\nand failures since the resource-constrained\
    \ SNs are densely deployed in hostile envi-\nronments to autonomously operate\
    \ via a network supervisory protocol with limited\npost-deployment maintenance\
    \ services. This supervisory protocol must incorporate\nsufﬁcient power optimization,\
    \ auto-fault management (FM), and self-adaptability\ntechniques in order to achieve\
    \ the desired performance expectation. Due to the lack of\nan in-depth and context-relevant\
    \ tutorial that bridges the gap between theoretical tax-\nonomies and real-world\
    \ designs, most canon Agri-IoT testbed solutions, such as those\nauthored in [1,10,11,17–20],\
    \ suffered abrupt failures during outdoor deployments.\n3.\nAgri-IoT technology\
    \ lacks comprehensive context-based synthesis from SN de-\nsign to ﬁeld deployment.\n\
    The power- and resource-constrained SNs that form\nthe WSN-based Agri-IoT network\
    \ in the aforementioned context require limited\ndata transmission rates, computational\
    \ capabilities, memory capacities, commu-\nnication distance, and operational\
    \ stability. Consequently, the associated routing\nprotocol [9,12,17,21], communication\
    \ technology, and routing architecture [22–24]\nmust support mechanisms that ensure\
    \ packet size and communication distance mod-\neration [16], efﬁcient channel\
    \ access management (CAM), and SN’s tasks manage-\nment. It is not a mere application\
    \ of conventional IoT to a farm, as many authors\nattempted [1,10–12,17–20,23,25,26],\
    \ which lacked application-speciﬁc requirements\nsuch as dense network inter-connectivity,\
    \ higher information perceptibility, compre-\nIoT 2023, 4\n268\nhensive intelligence\
    \ services, remote monitoring, smart decision making, and the\nexecution of precise\
    \ control/actuation actions on the farm.\n4.\nSuperﬁcial consideration of desired\
    \ communication technologies of Agri-IoT with-\nout considering the cluster-based\
    \ architecture: To date, Agri-IoT-related surveys and\ntutorials focused on high-power-demanding\
    \ communication technologies (Wi-Fi and\ncellular-based technologies), the centralized\
    \ architecture-constrained ZigBee standard,\nand the operation principles of conventional\
    \ IoT as authored in [1,10,11,14,18,19]\nwithout an in-depth consideration of\
    \ the unique case of Agri-IoT. It is well estab-\nlished that the cluster-based\
    \ architecture is the best candidate for Agri-IoT applica-\ntion [12,16,17,24];\
    \ however, there are no systematic evaluations to cement this fact.\nFor instance,\
    \ most benchmarking WSN-based IoT testbed solutions are founded on the\nZigBee\
    \ IEEE 802.15.4 communication standard and high-resource-demanding Wi-Fi,\ncellular-based,\
    \ and 6LoWPAN/IPv6 routing standards. These standards also thrive on\nwired or\
    \ ﬁxed IP-based infrastructural backbones, total Internet/electricity coverage,\n\
    and highly complex graph-based and centralized routing protocols [1,10,11,14,18,19],\n\
    leading to a lack of global signiﬁcance because Africa, which is the focus of\
    \ this study,\nhas less than 50% electricity/Internet coverage [27]. Also, ZigBee,\
    \ Wi-Fi and cellular-\nbased communication technologies with centralized or ﬂooding-based\
    \ routing archi-\ntecture [1,10,11,14,18,19] are capital-intensive, complex to\
    \ manage, location-restricted,\nenergy-inefﬁcient, and over-reliant on ﬁxed supporting\
    \ infrastructure. Therefore,\nan in-depth contextual assessment of how low-power\
    \ communication standards such\nas LoRa, SigFox, and Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE)\
    \ evolve in cluster-based Agri-IoT\n(CA-IoT) networks can be of immeasurable beneﬁts\
    \ to the IoT community and farmers.\n5.\nThe role of Agri-IoT in eliminating food\
    \ insecurity, improving crop quality, alle-\nviating global poverty, and increasing\
    \ agricultural production volumes has been\nunderestimated [2,7,8,10,16,28,29].\
    \ The agricultural sector, which has been hindered\nby climate change, is the\
    \ largest global employer [3]. To revitalize this sector, CA-IoT\nhas emerged\
    \ with the most promising opportunities to address food and employ-\nment insecurity\
    \ issues and improve crop quality and economic conditions for the\nfarmers. However,\
    \ these beneﬁts have not been fully realized due to insufﬁcient\nresearch publicity.\n\
    To the best of our knowledge, no survey or tutorial articles have sufﬁciently\
    \ consid-\nered these technical issues and provided sufﬁcient technical guidelines\
    \ for the designers of\nAgri-IoT systems to make well-informed decisions in order\
    \ to achieve satisfactory network\nperformance. Additional realistic research\
    \ is needed regarding the contextual evaluation\nof SN design and deployment factors,\
    \ fundamental network design concepts and require-\nments, multi-objective optimization\
    \ (MOO) analysis of the parameters for designing the\nassociated routing protocol,\
    \ and efﬁcient operational metrics of the WSN sublayer of the\nAgri-IoT using\
    \ the cluster-based architecture. In addition, the assessment of the possibil-\n\
    ity of using low-power and accessible wireless communication technologies such\
    \ as BLE\nvia cluster-based architecture to achieve a complete infrastructure-less,\
    \ cheaper, energy-\nefﬁcient, self-healing, adaptive, and robust Agri-IoT network\
    \ is imperative. Furthermore,\na broader contextual overview covering all vital\
    \ aspects such as the fundamental concepts\nof Agri-IoT, technical design requirements\
    \ of SNs and WSN-based Agri-IoT, surveys of the\nbenchmarking communication standards,\
    \ routing protocols, and testbed solutions, and an\nin-depth case study on how\
    \ to design a self-healing, energy-efﬁcient, adaptive, and CA-IoT\nbased on the\
    \ performance and users expectations are illustrated in Figure 2. Such a refer-\n\
    ence document can help support researchers when they attempt to accurately model\
    \ and\noptimize the performance of Agri-IoT [14] so that the performance gap between\
    \ the simu-\nlated networks and the realized Agri-IoT testbed solutions [1] can\
    \ be addressed. By way of\naddressing these technical challenges, this tutorial\
    \ presents the following contributions:\n•\nPerform an in-depth synthesis and\
    \ review (1) the basic concepts of Agri-IoT, (2) the\ncomprehensive design considerations\
    \ of these networks, (3) the technical design re-\nIoT 2023, 4\n269\nquirements\
    \ of Agri-IoT, and (4) the up-to-date research progress on routing techniques,\n\
    communication standards, and testbed solutions of WSN-based Agri-IoT.\n•\nSystematically\
    \ survey the benchmarking of WSN-based IoT networks’ communication\nstandards,\
    \ FM techniques, routing and MAC protocols, and realization testbeds to\nrespectively\
    \ uncover the appropriate communication requirements for Agri-IoT, unveil\nthe\
    \ root faults and possible remedies in the WSN sublayer, derive a generalized\n\

    \ Agri-IoT (CA-IoT) for precision\nirrigation.Section 10 unveils open issues and\
    \ future works, while Section 11 concludes\nthe paper.\n1.1. Comparative Overview\
    \ of WSN, IoT, and Agri-IoT Technologies\nA comparative overview of the underlying\
    \ technologies (i.e., WSN, IoT, and Agri-\nIoT) forming the WSN-based Agri-IoT\
    \ are compared from the perspective of architectural\nvariations, users’ expectations,\
    \ and design and implementational differences in Table 1.\nAs depicted in Figure\
    \ 3, WSNs are formed by spatially distributed, autonomous,\nresource-constrained\
    \ SNs that wirelessly interconnect to communicate their sampled data\nto a BS\
    \ for further monitoring or event tracking purposes without necessarily requiring\n\
    the Internet. The main components of the WSN are the SNs, the BS/gateway, and\
    \ the\nevent sampling/routing software that supervises the entire network process.\
    \ A node\nmay route data directly or via relay SNs to the BS based on its location\
    \ and assigned\ntasks. The BS locally takes actionable decisions and execution\
    \ of the actuation actions.\nAlthough the WSNs are resource-constrained and fault-vulnerable,\
    \ they constitute the\ninevitable part of this technology [2] and the underlying\
    \ innovation of the WSN-based\nAgri-IoT framework. In contrast, classic IoT consists\
    \ of IoT devices that sense and transmit\ntheir sampled information directly or\
    \ via telemetry to the Internet for monitoring or event-\ntracking purposes, mostly\
    \ via the centralized routing architecture. Like BS in WSNs, IoT\ndevices can\
    \ connect to the Internet/IoT cloud via ﬁxed-line (thus, for a factory), 5G/4G/LTE\n\
    cellular/mobile networks, or Wi-Fi for further processing, storage, and decisions/actions.\n\

    Figure 4. Conceptual framework: Agri-IoT-based farm monitoring and control cycle.\n\
    The main hardware components of an Agri-IoT framework, as presented in Figure\
    \ 3\nand Table 2, include the WSN (i.e., comprising the ﬁeld-deployed SNs or IoT\
    \ devices),\na base station (BS) or gateway or actuator controller, cloud servers,\
    \ and the user’s monitor-\ning/control devices. The on-farm participants (e.g.,\
    \ SNs and BS) in Agri-IoT are mostly\nbattery-powered and must be equipped with\
    \ sensing, computing, and communication\nabilities to form infrastructure-less,\
    \ robust, self-healing, and self-conﬁgured WSNs for data\ncollection and event\
    \ management [33]. The core units of the SNs in Figure 3c and the BS\nare compared\
    \ and contrasted in Table 2. As the framework in Figure 3a depicts, the IoT\n\
    devices can sense, process, and transmit their sampled data directly to the Internet\
    \ or IoT\ncloud without a gateway, whereas the SNs in WSN-based Agri-IoT perform\
    \ likewise via\na BS. This resource-sufﬁcient BS interfaces between the IoT cloud/user\
    \ and the WSN or\nactuator control system. It can also process the received data\
    \ and locally execute actionable\ndecisions via the actuator of the farm event\
    \ being monitored. The received data can also be\nrelayed to the analytical data\
    \ engines in the IoT cloud via a wired and wireless medium for\nfurther processing\
    \ and actions [13]. The resource-constrained WSN sublayer mainly uses\ndata-centric\
    \ protocols due to the SNs’ high deployment densities, high network dynamics,\n\
    and limited power supply of SNs. Although data-centric protocols are fragile and\
    \ not\nstandardized, they are more suitable than the high resource-demanding ID-based\
    \ IPv4 or\nIPv6 protocols in the addressing space of the WSN-based Agri-IoT.\n\

    \ WSN and IoT technologies into contextualized intelligent farm\nmanagement systems\
    \ to achieve higher event data quality and offer remote monitoring\nand control.\
    \ WSN-based Agri-IoT consists of the WSN sublayer, the gateways, the cloud\nservers,\
    \ and the remote interface application, as illustrated in Figures 3a and 5. Uniquely,\n\
    the current trends of Agri-IoT mandate that both intra-SN and BS–cloud communication\n\
    are based on low-power, ubiquitous, and freely available wireless standards [2].\
    \ Also,\nmost Agri-IoT solutions support bidirectional communications between\
    \ the BS/gateway\nand the cloud/users, whereby the BS updates the cloud/user database\
    \ and receives ac-\ntionable/control remote messages from the user or cloud analytical\
    \ decision results for\nactuation purposes. The WSN-based Agri-IoT is the most\
    \ dominant technology in the global\nsmart farming use cases in the agricultural\
    \ sector. The core tasks of SNs in a WSN-based\nAgri-IoT application, which are\
    \ frequently supervised by the associated routing protocol,\ninclude network construction/management,\
    \ data sensing, data processing/aggregation,\nfault tolerance, and communication\
    \ [9,12]. Also, the routing architecture must be supported\nby the associated\
    \ communication platform and the application-speciﬁc requirements of\nthe network.\n\

    \ WSN-based\nAgri-IoT requires holistic integrations of the expectations in Figure\
    \ 2.\n1.2. Classiﬁcations of IoT Applications and Speciﬁc Roles of Agri-IoT\n\
    Generally, IoT technology is application-speciﬁc. However, it has limitless applications\n\
    and roles in the smart world agenda. Based on their intended purpose, WSN-based\
    \ IoT sys-\ntems can be broadly classiﬁed into condition monitoring and event-tracking\
    \ categories [34],\nas illustrated in Figure 6.\nThe monitoring-based applications\
    \ involve real-time event data collection and analysis,\nsupervision, and operational\
    \ control of systems. In contrast, tracking-based applications\ntrack changes\
    \ in the phenomenon of interest, such as the locations of objects, persons,\n\
    transported goods, animals, and vehicles. Both application domains can be subdivided\n\
    into industrial, environmental, and societal IoT applications in Figure 6, where\
    \ speciﬁc\nexamples are provided for each application domain. For instance, monitoring-based\
    \ ap-\nplications may include indoor/outdoor environmental monitoring [6], industrial\
    \ process\nmonitoring [5,29], process control [2], greenhouse automation [7],\
    \ precision agriculture\n(e.g., irrigation management, crop disease prediction,\
    \ prediction of production quality,\nIoT 2023, 4\n274\nand pest and disease control)\
    \ [2,8], biomedical or health monitoring [8], electrical grid net-\nwork monitoring/control\
    \ [12,29], military location monitoring [9], and so forth. Conversely,\nspecific\
    \ examples of tracking-based applications may include habitat tracking, traffic\
    \ tracking,\nplant/animal condition tracking, and military target tracking, as\
    \ outlined in Figure 6.\n1/21/22, 10:55 AM\n701.svg\nEcology: Wildlife Tracking\n\

    \ \nFigure 6. Generalized taxonomy of IoT applications.\n1.3. Agri-IoT Roles and\
    \ Use-Cases\nThe concept of intelligent farming involves data acquisition, data\
    \ processing/planning,\nand smart control using the WSN and IoT technologies,\
    \ big data, and cloud computing\ntechniques to provide proﬁtable solutions, as\
    \ presented in Figure 7. These principal roles\nin Figure 7 deﬁne their use cases.\
    \ For instance, monitoring the state of crops or the\nclimate of the ﬁeld using\
    \ Agri-IoT technology can allow farmers to know precisely the\namount of pesticides,\
    \ water, and fertilizers required to attain optimal crop quality and\nproduction\
    \ volume. However, the QoS requirements, the routing techniques, architectural\n\
    requirements, and the operational dynamics differ from one use case to another.\
    \ This\ntutorial focused on the critical and unique design requirements of WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT,\nwhich is the backbone of the smart agricultural initiative [35].\
    \ The resulting use-cases in\nFigure 7 can be explained as follows:\n1.\nAgri-IoT\
    \ for Climate Condition or Agronomical Monitoring: This Agri-IoT system mostly\n\
    comprises BS (i.e., weather stations) and a deployed WSN. The analytical data\
    \ engines\nmine the sampled climate or crop condition data in the cloud to predict\
    \ future climate\nconditions and farm automation plans. The most suitable crop\
    \ and precise farming\npractices can then be predeﬁned to improve agriculture\
    \ production capacity and\nquality.\n2.\nAgri-IoT for Precision Farming: This\
    \ is the most famous application of Agri-IoT, whereby\nfarming practices (e.g.,\
    \ irrigation, fertilizer application, etc.) are precisely and accu-\nrately controlled\
    \ to optimize these resources. Here, the SNs are mostly ﬁtted with soil\nsensors\
    \ to collect a vast array of microclimatic data (e.g., soil moisture, temperature,\n\
    and salinity) that can enable farmers to estimate optimal amounts of water, fertiliz-\n\
    IoT 2023, 4\n275\ners, and pesticides needed by the crops to minimize resources’\
    \ costs and produce\nhealthier crops. Additionally, the BS controls the event\
    \ actuation system via accurate\ndata-driven real-time decisions on the crops\
    \ using climate data, crop growth data,\nand disease infection data.\n3.\nAgri-IoT\
    \ for Greenhouse Automation: The Agri-IoT-based approach provides more accu-\n\
    rate real-time information on greenhouse conditions, such as lighting, temperature,\n\
    soil condition, and humidity, unlike manual greenhouse management. This allows\n\
    precise remote monitoring and control or automation of all farming practices.\n\
    4.\nAgri-IoT for Livestock Monitoring and Management: In this system, SNs are\
    \ attached\nto livestock to monitor their real-time health, track their physical\
    \ location, and log\ntheir performance. This helps the farmer identify and isolate\
    \ sick animals to avoid\ncontamination and reduce stafﬁng expenses.\n5.\nAgri-IoT\
    \ for Predictive Analytics: This Agri-IoT system provides highly relevant real-\n\
    time data that can be analyzed to make essential predictions, such as crop harvesting\n\
    time, risk of disease infection, yield volume, yield quality, and yield vulnerability,\n\
    for proper planning.\n6.\nAgricultural Drones (Agri-Drones): Agri-Drones, such\
    \ as DroneSeed, are ﬁtted with\nmobile SNs and farming tools to collect agricultural\
    \ data or perform activities such\nas ﬁeld surveillance, crop planting, pest control,\
    \ farm spraying, crop monitoring, etc.\nFor example, for Agri-Drones, all the\
    \ above use cases utilize the WSN-based Agri-IoT\nframework.\n1/21/22, 11:01 AM\n\

    \ established that the existing real-world attempts of Agri-IoT could\nnot meet\
    \ both performance and user users’ expectations because they are founded on the\n\
    fundamental concepts and the operational principles of classic IoT and WSN technologies.\n\
    To effectively achieve the expectations in Figure 2, it is imperative to conduct\
    \ a systematic\nassessment of the related architectural layers in classic IoT\
    \ and propose a suitable option for\nthe WSN-based Agri-IoT ecosystem. Generally,\
    \ the conventional IoT ecosystem consists\nof the network architectural layers\
    \ and the data management platforms [2,7,8], which\nare further grouped into devices\
    \ (sensors, actuators, and gateways/BS), network (BS to\ncloud), platforms/applications’\
    \ cloud, and agents/users. Due to the domain-speciﬁc\nrequirements of IoT applications\
    \ and the incorporation of numerous heterogeneous devices\nIoT 2023, 4\n276\n\
    with application-speciﬁc requirements, there are generally no uniﬁed or standardized\n\
    IoT architectural layers. Therefore, most application-defined layers are frequently\
    \ adapted\nfrom the canon architectural layers, which include the three-layer\
    \ [5], the cloud-based [7],\nthe service-oriented architecture (SOA) [2,7], and\
    \ the fog-based [2,7,29], as illustrated in\nFigure 8.\n1/20/22, 8:49 PM\n714.svg\n\

    \ in the state of the art of IoT ecosystem.\nThe fog-based architecture was adapted\
    \ from the three-layer parent architecture to in-\nclude cloud computing by offering\
    \ computing, storage, and network information between\nthe clients and the cloud\
    \ services [29] in a decentralized manner. Here, cloud computing\nand fog/edge\
    \ computing architectures only differ in where data computing occurs. These\n\
    layers are not uniﬁed because the respective network layers do not cover all underlying\n\
    technologies that transfer data to all IoT platforms [5]. Additionally, they are\
    \ based on com-\nplicated centralized and ﬂooding-based routing architectures,\
    \ high-resource-demanding\nand capital-intensive Wi-Fi/cellular-based communication\
    \ technologies. As well, they\nrequire wired infrastructural support in the farm,\
    \ which is too complex, location-restricted,\nand capital-intensive for most low-income\
    \ and non-expert farmers to implement and\nmanage. Consequently, they are unsuitable\
    \ candidates for the resource-constrained SNs\nin WSN-based Agri-IoT. By implication,\
    \ there are no reference guidelines for designing\nAgri-IoT participants and supervisory\
    \ protocols, controlling the speed of packet delivery,\nsmoothing out SN’s integration,\
    \ unifying technology, and creating standardized Agri-\nIoT reference models,\
    \ among other considerations. In contrast, an Agri-IoT ecosystem,\ndepicted in\

    \ Layers for WSN-Based Agri-IoT\nIn designing an efﬁcient Agri-IoT system of global\
    \ signiﬁcance, it is imperative to\npropose suitable architectural layers and\
    \ evaluate how the various components interact in\nthese layers. With the emerging\
    \ advances in low-power, freely available, and boundless\ncommunication standards\
    \ (e.g., BLE) and unfulﬁlled potentials of CA-IoT network [12,16],\nIoT 2023,\
    \ 4\n277\na new framework of cluster-based architectural layers for the WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT ecosys-\ntem is proposed in the left side of Figure 5. The center portion\
    \ of Figure 5 presents the key\ncomponents/technologies required in each layer,\
    \ while the Things taxonomies of hardware\ncomponents from the related literature\
    \ [4,8,29] are depicted on the right portion of Figure 5.\nThe underlying layers\
    \ in our four-tier layers in Figure 5 can be elaborated on as follows:\n1.\nIntegrated\
    \ Application and Management Layer: This operates all agriculture-related\napplications\
    \ that interface between the user (for example, farmer) and the Agri-IoT\nsystem\
    \ to make decisions and execute remote actions to keep their crops or animals\n\
    healthy. This layer manages the entire Agri-IoT system and its application-speciﬁc\n\
    functionality, high-resource-demanding applications, and core business model in\
    \ the\ncloud. This layer’s security requirements are crucial to the next sublayer;\
    \ however,\nthese are beyond the scope of this research. The business or management\
    \ sublayer\nmaintains end-to-end data integrity and security by ensuring that\
    \ data are transferred\nto the correct user. It also ensures that the correct\
    \ user executes the actuation.\n2.\nInformation Management Layer: This handles\
    \ data processing, storage, and other special-\nized cloud services and functionality\
    \ that make precise, actionable decisions. In Agri-\nIoT, the sensory data are\
    \ preprocessed locally to optimize communication power\nbut can be further processed\
    \ using analytic engines in the cloud for better decision\nmaking and remote monitoring\
    \ and control. This layer can be embedded in the above\napplication layers and\
    \ hosted in the cloud in a typical Agri-IoT ecosystem.\n3.\nNetwork Management\
    \ Layer: This layer discovers, connects, and translates devices over\na network,\
    \ and it coordinates with the above application layers. It also contains the\n\
    BS, which interfaces the resource-constrained WSN and cloud information network.\n\
    By convention, the WSN sublayer must utilize low-power communication standards\n\
    such as Zigbee, SigFox, LoRa, BLE, Z-Wave, SigFox, and IEEE P802.11ah (low-power\n\
    Wi-Fi), while the BS-to-Cloud connectivity can be achieved via the traditional\
    \ cellular\nnetworks, satellite networks, Wi-Fi, LAN, WAN, and LoRa, among others.\
    \ Unlike clas-\nsic IoT, Agri-IoT requires that the BS-to-Cloud connectivity utilize\
    \ low-power commu-\nnication standards. Also, since every communication standard\
    \ for the resource-limited\nWSN sublayer comes with unique resource speciﬁcations\
    \ and design tradeoffs be-\ntween power consumption, routing architectural constraints,\
    \ and bandwidth [4,14,17],\nthe best connectivity option must be selected to achieve\
    \ the desired application goals.\nConsequently, the stated WSN-based connectivity\
    \ technologies can be classiﬁed using\nseveral distinct parameters, such as energy\
    \ consumption rates, uplink/downlink data\nrates, packet size, SN-count per BS\
    \ (gateway), network routing topology, the SNs’\nsensing range, the SNs’ transmitter/receiver\
    \ power, frequency bandwidth, channel\nwidth, etc. (refer to the right portion\
    \ of Figure 5).\n4.\nPhysical/Perception/Things Layer: This layer refers to the\
    \ ﬁeld and all devices such as\nSNs, actuators, RFID tags, sensors, and edge devices\
    \ that interact with the environment.\nThis layer senses and collects the necessary\
    \ information from the connected devices in\nthe WSN sublayer to the BS. In Agri-IoT\
    \ networks, the sampled microclimatic data\ncan be processed and stored on the\
    \ local BS, the cloud, or both. The activities in the\ncloud or application layers\
    \ are beyond the scope of this tutorial.\n2.2. Associated Hardware Components\
    \ and Technologies Required in the Proposed Architectural Layers\nTo precisely\
    \ model and design an Agri-IoT network of desired expectations (refer to\nFigure\
    \ 2) using the proposed architectural layers shown in Figure 5, the knowledge\
    \ of the\nprincipal components and technologies used in each of these layers and\
    \ how they interact\nand adapt for their intended functions is imperative. As\
    \ depicted in the middle of Figure 5,\nthe Agri-IoT ecosystem is composed of the\
    \ following core components/technologies:\n1.\nThings: The Things unit is the\
    \ physical interface between the tracked/monitored asset\nand the BS or actuator\
    \ controller, which aligns with the physical or perception layer. It\ncomprises\
    \ the monitored/tracked asset (for example, ﬁeld, crop, or animal), the SNs,\n\
    or the entire IoT devices making up the WSN (for example, SNs, actuators, IoT-enabled\n\
    IoT 2023, 4\n278\ndevices, WSNs, and other smart devices), the event sampling,\
    \ and routing technology\nin the WSN. Since the SNs constituting this unit are\
    \ resource-constrained, freely\navailable communication standards such as Zigbee,\
    \ BLE, Z-Wave, and IEEE P802.11ah\n(low-power Wi-Fi) are the most suitable for\
    \ both SN–SN and SN–BS communications.\nThe Things unit accesses the cloud/Internet\
    \ via gateways (BS).\n2.\nGateway (BS): The BS interfaces the WSN out in the ﬁeld\
    \ and the applications situated\nin the cloud servers. This unit aligns with the\
    \ network management and actuator\ncontrol layer shown in the middle of Figure\
    \ 5. The WSN sublayer may have more\nthan one BS(s), each with the capacity to\
    \ handle most resource-demanding com-\nputational tasks besides actuation execution,\
    \ network construction, scheduling of\nevent sampling, and network supervision\
    \ services. They may also allow bidirectional\ncommunication with the cloud/user\
    \ and WSN. Similar to standalone IoT devices,\nthe BS can be equipped with 4G/5G/LTE/NB-IoT,\
    \ cellular-based, Wi-Fi, LoRaWAN,\nor wired ethernet communication technologies\
    \ to interact with the cloud, and low-\npower communication standards such as\
    \ LoRa, low-power Wi-Fi, SIGFOX, UMTS,\nBLE, and Zigbee (Figure 5) to communicate\
    \ with the sensor ﬁeld. However, Agri-IoT\nnetworks require that both upper-layer\
    \ and lower-layer communication technolo-\ngies of the BS should be low-power,\
    \ freely available, easy to deploy and manage,\nand platform-independent. The\
    \ BS may preprocess or relay the raw data to the cloud\nfor remote data processing.\
    \ The BS(s) locations are strategically chosen to optimize\nnetwork communication\
    \ costs.\n3.\nIoT Cloud: The Cloud unit aligns with the applications layer. It\
    \ consists of an on-\npremises or remote server farm that hosts the applications\
    \ layer, event data analytic\nengines, security protocols, robust IoT applications,\
    \ user interface, and event database.\nThe high resource-demanding data-processing\
    \ tasks are mostly executed by well-\nequipped cloud-hosted applications to manage\
    \ and store huge amounts of data,\nprovide monitoring and data analytical services,\
    \ enable communication with devices,\nand manage information access. The merits\
    \ of edge computing can be exploited to\nensure that large amounts of data are\
    \ post-processed off-device to reduce the response\ntimes of the cloud.\n4.\n\
    User Interface: With the aid of a web or mobile app, the user or farmer can live-\n\
    monitor the farm’s conditions and execute control actions. Additionally, a presentation\n\
    or business intelligence layer may be added to coordinate the activities of non-technical\n\
    business users through dashboards and reports rather than with the application\n\
    layer itself.\n2.3. Quality Expectations of Agri-IoT’s Architectural Layers\n\
    Although there is no uniﬁed, certiﬁed, and ﬂexible Agri-IoT architecture layer,\
    \ any\nsuitable options deduced from the benchmarking architectures in Figure\
    \ 8 must satisfy\ncertain quality requirements, including:\n1.\nSimultaneous data\
    \ acquisition, analysis, and control from many sensors or actuators.\n2.\nMinimization\
    \ of huge raw data transmissions via data aggregation techniques to\nmaximize\
    \ actionable information quality.\n3.\nProvision of reliable network architecture\
    \ that supports energy-efﬁcient routing, sta-\nble connectivity, self-adaptability,\
    \ fault tolerance, operational simplicity/ﬂexibility,\nplatform independence,\
    \ affordability, and location independence of Agri-IoT designs.\n4.\nSupport for\
    \ automated/remote device management and updates.\n5.\nEasy integration of each\
    \ layer with existing applications and other IoT solutions via\nspeciﬁed APIs.\n\
    6.\nUtilization of freely available, location-unrestricted, cheap, energy-efﬁcient,\
    \ and simple\nto deploy and manage by non-experts [4,29] underlying communication\
    \ technologies\nin the PHY and network layers as well as based on open standards\
    \ to guarantee\ninteroperability.\nIoT 2023, 4\n279\n3. Design and Implementation\
    \ of Agri-IoT Networks\nDespite the technical challenges associated with the WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT, its potential\ncontributions in the agricultural sector largely surpass\
    \ the least complex, capital-intensive,\npure IoT-based solutions, as illustrated\
    \ in Figures 3b and 7. Due to the broader applicability\nand higher signiﬁcance\
    \ of the WSN-based Agri-IoT networks relative to the classic IoT\nnetworks, this\
    \ study focuses on the former technology whose design and implementation\ninvolve\
    \ four crucial phases, namely:\n1.\nCustom-building of robust, affordable, energy-efﬁcient,\
    \ location-independent, and\nadaptive SNs and a BS that can form an infrastructure-less\
    \ and easily manageable WSN.\nThe SNs and the BS must consist of cost-effective,\
    \ architecture-deﬁned, and context-\ndeﬁned components so that the system operates\
    \ stably and efﬁciently, becomes afford-\nable to farmers, and easily integrates\
    \ to any real-world scenario without any expensive,\nﬁxed/wired backbone connections.\
    \ The low-power capabilities of the SNs help to\neasily integrate them into any\
    \ precision farms and greenhouses to operate over the\nentire crop season without\
    \ many technical hindrances.\n2.\nPhysical deployment of the SNs in the ﬁeld,\
    \ selection of the WSN’s communication\ntechnology, and design of a suitable supervisory\
    \ protocol to coordinate the construc-\ntion of appropriate event routing architecture,\
    \ the duty-cycle schedule of event sam-\npling to the BS, fault management, data\
    \ management, and network maintenance.\nAdditionally, a range of techniques such\
    \ as network participant mobility, cross-layer\ndesign, MAC techniques, data aggregation,\
    \ self-healing techniques, nodes’ duty-cycle\nschedule, security measures, localization,\
    \ and communication speciﬁcations of the\nSNs can also be exploited in the associated\
    \ routing protocols.\n3.\nSelection of appropriate BS/gateway communication technology\
    \ and design of a\nsuitable higher protocol to update the cloud database and execute\
    \ the actuation\nactions based on users’ requests or decisions on processed event\
    \ data.\n4.\nDesign of data analytical engines and applications in the cloud and\
    \ users’ remote\nmonitoring and control interface app, which is beyond the scope\
    \ of this tutorial.\nThese call for a systematic application-speciﬁc assessment\
    \ of the hardware components\nselected for every use case.\n3.1. Sensor Nodes\
    \ Design Considerations\nAs illustrated at the bottom of Figure 3, a node for\
    \ the WSN-based Agri-IoT network\nconsists of four main units, which include the\
    \ following:\n1.\nSensing Unit: This unit interfaces with the physical environment\
    \ and records the\nphysical phenomenon of interest. The type of sensor is application-speciﬁc\
    \ and can\nbe contact-based or non-contact-based. For instance, the STEMMA soil\
    \ moisture\nsensor and the DHT22 sensor can be used to sample environmental temperature\
    \ and\nhumidity (refer to Figure 3c).\n2.\nController Unit: This unit hosts the\
    \ processor, storage, and connection pins for the\nother units and all auxiliary\
    \ peripherals. The suitable controllers for building Agri-IoT\nSNs are Arduino-based\
    \ and Raspberry-Pi-based (refer to the bottom of Figure 3) due\nto their ability\
    \ to withstand extreme weather conditions. However, other off-the-shelf,\napplication-speciﬁc\
    \ controllers such as the ProPlant Seed Rate Controller, John Deere\nGreenStar\
    \ Rate Controller, Viper Pro multi-function ﬁeld computer, Radion 8140,\nTrimble\
    \ Field-IQ, etc. are also available.\n3.\nCommunication Unit: This unit is the\
    \ principal determinant of the node’s power\nconsumption, operational stability,\
    \ and affordability, as well as the routing architecture\nin the associated supervisory\
    \ protocol. The bottom of Figure 3 shows the available\ncommunication technologies,\
    \ but an Agri-IoT-based SN demands an energy-efﬁcient,\naffordable, freely available,\
    \ simple, and reliable communication standard. Conse-\nquently, LoRa, BLE, ZigBee,\
    \ LoRaWan, and SigFox are the best candidates based on\nIoT 2023, 4\n280\nthe\
    \ support of the routing architecture of the resulting WSN, but the selection\
    \ must be\njustiﬁed from the technology requirement metrics via a decision matrix.\n\
    4.\nPower Unit: Since the SNs are mostly battery-powered, the appropriate battery\
    \ size\nand probable energy-harvesting techniques must be determined during the\
    \ SNs’\ndesign according to the intended network lifespan and stability requirements.\
    \ Modern\ntrends in battery power banks with integrated solar-based energy-harvesting\
    \ systems\nand power ratings above 30,000 Ah are available.\nWhen selecting hardware\
    \ components, adequate caution should be taken to avoid unit\nincompatibility,\
    \ high operational complexities, unsuitable operational thresholds, and high\n\
    energy consumption, among others. This implies that high component survivability\
    \ and op-\nerational stability under different environmental conditions and the\
    \ application speciﬁcities\nare vital to monitor.\n3.2. Wireless Spectrum and\
    \ Core Communication Platforms of WSN-Based Agri-IoT\nThe wireless electromagnetic\
    \ (EM) spectrum, which has invisible, ﬁnite radio fre-\nquencies for wireless\
    \ communication, can be licensed and sold exclusively by speciﬁc\nproviders or\
    \ unlicensed for free usage. For instance, the Industrial, Scientiﬁc, and Medical\n\
    (ISM) frequency band (e.g., Bluetooth classic, BLE, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, and LoRaWAN)\
    \ is an\nunlicensed microwave frequency band clustered around 2.4 GHz and globally\
    \ reserved for\napplications such as Agri-IoT. Table 3 presents the various bands\
    \ and their applications.\nA suitable candidate for a given Agri-IoT application\
    \ is based on several factors, such\nas communication and the route architectural\
    \ requirements, power consumption, cost,\nand environmental adaptability impacts.\n\

    \ SNs and Designing the Supervisory\nSampling/Routing Protocol\nAfter custom-building\
    \ or selecting off-the-shelf SNs, the next activity is to deploy\nthe SNs on the\
    \ ﬁeld and design a contextualized supervisory protocol to coordinate the\naforementioned\
    \ network’s activities. The SNs’ deployment in the ﬁeld can be either random\n\
    or deterministic. Both options require different methods to optimize the resulting\
    \ network’s\nperformance. For instance, under the deterministic approach, the\
    \ optimal parameters such\nas node uniformity and density must be predeﬁned based\
    \ on the distance thresholds of the\nassociated communication technology (i.e.,\
    \ connectivity/distance range), the SNs’ resource\noptimization mechanisms, the\
    \ type of routing architecture, and the sensing range of the\nphysical parameter\
    \ to be measured. Since communication is the principal power consumer,\nthe best\
    \ ways to conserve power are to minimize communication distance and data sizes\
    \ as\nwell as operate the SNs in the appropriate sleep–active duty cycles using\
    \ a cluster-based\nrouting architecture [9,24,26].\nBeyond the physical installation\
    \ of the SNs at their most suitable in-range locations,\nthe remaining activities,\
    \ such as network construction, event sensing, data management, FM,\nIoT 2023,\
    \ 4\n281\nnetwork maintenance, sleep–active duty-cycle scheduling of SNs for sampling,\
    \ network adapt-\nability to turbulent and scalable conditions, power-optimization\
    \ mechanisms, and network\nreconfiguration, among others, are controlled by the\
    \ associated routing protocol [12,16,17,26,36].\nThis places crucial merits on\
    \ the physical locations of the SNs in the ﬁeld, thorough synthe-\nsis of network\
    \ design factors, and assessment of available routing architectures/techniques,\n\
    since this protocol manages all post-deployment tasks. This can be summarized\
    \ into\nthe core objectives of the routing protocol and its architecture, which\
    \ include power op-\ntimization, self-healing of any faults without the obstruction\
    \ of its normal operation,\nand self-adaptability to all turbulent and scalable\
    \ conditions. From the analysis above,\nwe can derive the critical primary factors\
    \ to consider when designing a routing protocol\nfor Agri-IoT networks, which\
    \ are presented in Figure 9 and grouped into the following\ncategories: SNs speciﬁcations,\
    \ security issues, application-speciﬁc factors, communication\nstandard compatibility\
    \ and capacities, and other auxiliary factors. At the PHY layer level,\nwhich\
    \ is the focus of this tutorial, these critical factors can translate into the\
    \ stipulated core\ndesign objectives, which can be addressed via phase-based multi-objective\
    \ optimization\n(MOO) formulation frameworks [12,23,24,37].\n1/21/22, 10:18 AM\n\

    \ 2023, 4\n283\nCost or Affordability of the Resulting Agri-IoT System: In addition\
    \ to being\ninfrastructure-less, ﬂexible, self-healing, adaptive, and energy-efﬁcient,\
    \ a WSN-based\nAgri-IoT must consist of cost-effective hardware and software components\
    \ so that the\nsystem is affordable for farmers, since existing real-world solutions\
    \ are too expensive and\ncomplicated [1,14]. Additionally, the installation, operational,\
    \ and maintenance costs of\nthe resulting WSN-based Agri-IoT network must be kept\
    \ to a minimum so that it can be\neasily acquired.\nSecurity Issues in Agri-IoT:\
    \ Security is still a challenge in classic IoT systems that\nhandle sensitive\
    \ information, especially during cloud communications. Although Agri-\nIoT networks\
    \ lack the requisite resource capacities in most large-scale, broadcast-based,\n\
    distributed, and infrastructure-less WSN systems to achieve adequate data conﬁdentiality,\n\
    authenticity, integrity, and other security requirements, the security of the\
    \ agricultural\ndata is rarely a priority [2,4]. Nevertheless, the associated\
    \ routing architecture, such as\nthe clustering architecture, has an embedded\
    \ capacity to resolve on-site security issues.\nIn addition, both on-site and\
    \ remote information access types (e.g., via a smartphone or\ndesktop computer)\
    \ must be selected based on solid internal infrastructure and security\nprecautions\
    \ to secure unwanted access to sensitive information.\nThe Application-Speciﬁc\
    \ Factors: As indicated in Figure 9, the application-deﬁned\nfactors vary based\
    \ on the Agri-IoT application, the ﬁeld settings, network maintenance prac-\n\
    tices, intended event routing architecture, and network participants’ mobility,\
    \ among other\nfactors. However, the routing protocol must incorporate all relevant\
    \ operational efﬁciency\nfactors of the routing software design objectives. Since\
    \ the collected ﬁeld data itself cannot\nmake sense without using analytic data\
    \ engines and predictive algorithms in machine learn-\ning, the BS or the application\
    \ layer in the cloud should deﬁne appropriate data-processing\nframeworks to obtain\
    \ accurate, actionable decisions from the collected data.\nCommunication Standards\
    \ of Agri-IoT Devices: The power-constrained WSN sub-\nlayer of Agri-IoT network\
    \ places hard restrictions on operational states of SNs’ radio\ntransceivers,\
    \ code space, and processing cycles as well as memory capacities of SNs to\nenhance\
    \ power savings [9,12,23]. The type of communication technology selected for a\n\
    typical Agri-IoT is the principal predictor of its routing architecture, affordability,\
    \ simplicity,\nadaptability, power-saving capacity, location independence, self-healing\
    \ capacity, and event\ndata quality [12,16]. Consequently, power and routing architectural\
    \ limitations constrain\nthe network design requirements. Despite the aforementioned\
    \ technical challenges on\nthe network’s operational efﬁciency, interconnected\
    \ SNs that form the WSN are expected\nto withstand extra operational disruptions\
    \ caused by unfavorable weather conditions in\nthe ﬁeld [2,4]. Consequently, the\
    \ de facto PHY-layer communication standards for this\nlow-power, low bandwidth,\
    \ and distance-limited communication Agri-IoT devices/SNs\nhave been the energy-efﬁcient\
    \ platforms such as BLE, LoRa, Sigfox, and NB-IoT. Also, a suit-\nable MAC technique\
    \ is imperative in the routing architecture to curb all channel access\nchallenges.\
    \ For instance, the ZigBee/IEEE 802.15.4 standard focuses on the physical and\n\
    the MAC layer speciﬁcations for WSNs, and it also supports the sleep–active or\
    \ duty-cycle\nscheduled operation modes of SNs to enhance energy savings in centralized\
    \ or mesh-based\narchitectures. BLE does likewise in the highly endowed cluster-based\
    \ routing architecture.\nConsequently, Agri-IoT network designers must make the\
    \ most appropriate and critical de-\ncisions regarding the network’s communication\
    \ requirements when designing the routing\nprotocol. Using Table 4, WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT designers can make realistic design decisions\nregarding energy-efﬁcient\
    \ multihop routing, architectural requirements of routing proto-\ncol, bandwidth,\
    \ routing table capacities, total communication cost, and the desired MAC\ntechnique.\
    \ Additionally, the physical conditions within the agricultural environment such\n\
    as atmospheric dust concentration, physical obstruction to wireless signal transmissions,\n\
    and the terrain need to be considered.\nAuxiliary Factors and Available Software\
    \ Tool: Finally, the auxiliary factors can be\nnon-exhaustive depending on the\
    \ designer’s ﬁnancial capacity, user interface, information\nrequisition model,\
    \ cloud activities, operational expectations, and the available software\nIoT\
    \ 2023, 4\n284\ntools. Additionally, an assortment of PHY-Layer design software\
    \ tools for Agri-IoT exper-\niments (thus, in both simulations and real-world\
    \ testbed deployments) that can be used\ninclude NS-3 [9,38], OMNeT++, MATLAB/Simulink\
    \ [9,12,39], Python [16], PAWiS [39],\nGloMoSim/QualNet [39,40], OPNET [12,39],\
    \ SENSE [37,39], J-Sim [39], Ptolemy II [39],\nShawn [9,39], and PiccSIM [12,39,41],\
    \ among others. The key features that are frequently\nconsidered when selecting\
    \ any of these software platforms include Python or MAT-\nLAB/Simulink compatibility\
    \ for software model and hardware prototype integration\nduring real-world operation,\
    \ compatibility with low-power communication standards\n(e.g., BLE, LoRa, ZigBee,\
    \ and SIGFOX), operating system support, programming lan-\nguage implementation,\
    \ the density of simultaneously simulated or ﬁeld-deployed SNs,\nco-simulation\
    \ with other hardware, documentation, easy access to upgraded versions,\nand installation\
    \ challenges [39]. MATLAB/Simulink and Python are the most commonly\nused experimental\
    \ tools, since these software tools are well-equipped with the stipu-\nlated features.\n\
    4. Unique Characteristics and Challenges of WSN Sublayer of Agri-IoT\nUnlike the\
    \ traditional IoT, which generally relies on ﬁxed hardware to route network\n\
    trafﬁc, a WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT combines automated sensing, computation, actua-\n\
    tion, and wireless communication tasks into the SNs that are spatially distributed\
    \ across\nthe farm to autonomously form an infrastructure-less WSN [31]. A node\
    \ may perform\nadditional tasks such as local data processing (data aggregation),\
    \ network construction,\ndata redundancy, error control, data routing (e.g., in\
    \ multihop networks), and network\nmaintenance practices based on the network\
    \ size, application speciﬁcity, and associated\nrouting techniques. Also, the\
    \ WSN can be equipped to observe heterogeneous conditions\nsuch as temperature,\
    \ humidity, sound, color, location, light, vibration, and motion, using a\nwide\
    \ variety of sensors contained within a task-scalable SN. Therefore, assuming\
    \ that the\naccuracy and precision of event data in upper layers are preserved,\
    \ the Agri-IoT’s lifespan\nand its operational efﬁciency are rooted in the WSN’s\
    \ robustness. Thus, a deeper contextual\nexegesis into the design and maintenance\
    \ of this sublayer is imperative. As opposed to con-\nventional IoT and wireless\
    \ ad hoc communication networks, the operational efﬁciency of\nthe WSN sublayer,\
    \ as well as Agri-IoT, hinge upon some application-speciﬁc characteristics\nand\
    \ resource-constrained factors such as:\n•\nHigher SN Deployment Densities: Generally,\
    \ SNs are densely deployed in either a deter-\nministic or random manner to provide\
    \ the desired redundancies, spatial variability of\nsoil, topography, distributed\
    \ monitoring and processing, accurate and precise event\nreporting, and fault\
    \ tolerance. However, this mostly leads to undesirable transmission\noverlaps,\
    \ data redundancies from the simultaneous reporting of the same data, routing\n\
    interferences, and packet collisions due to connectivity issues and the coexistence\
    \ of\ncommon standards in the ISM band [42].\n•\nLimited Power Supply: The SNs\
    \ are frequently battery-powered, which does not only\nconstrain their data transmission\
    \ rate, computational capabilities, and communication\ndistance but also subjects\
    \ Agri-IoT to possible SN-out-of-service and data outlier\nfaults due to rapid\
    \ power depletion beyond certain thresholds [26,43]. Consequently,\nnetwork power\
    \ management through data-management-related, architectural-related,\nand communication-related\
    \ parameters has been one of the principal research focuses\nin WSN-based IoT\
    \ applications to improve network lifetime.\n•\nFault Management (FM) (i.e., fault\
    \ detection, fault tolerance, or fault avoidance): The\nresource-constrained WSN\
    \ is highly vulnerable to faults and failures due to high\ndeployment densities\
    \ and a lack of post-deployment maintenance services [25]. Al-\nthough faults\
    \ are inevitable in Agri-IoT for the stipulated reasons, their occurrence\nrates\
    \ and effects on the network’s functionality can be minimized, avoided, or tolerated\n\
    without hindering the normal functionality of the network if the associated WSN’s\
    \ rout-\ning protocol is well-equipped with efﬁcient self-healing and fault-avoidance\
    \ (power-\nsaving) mechanisms [12].\nIoT 2023, 4\n285\n•\nSelf-Adaptability and\
    \ Scalability: Although WSNs are application-speciﬁc, the topologi-\ncal dynamism\
    \ is inevitable due to node failures, node mobility, and scalable conditions.\n\
    Therefore, the associated routing protocol and network architecture must adapt\
    \ to\nthese dynamic conditions using apt auto-reconﬁguration and reactive multihop\
    \ event\nrouting techniques [44,45].\n•\nNetwork Architecture: The underlying\
    \ routing protocol of the WSN sublayer constructs\na network architecture that\
    \ can be ﬂat, hierarchical (e.g., clustering, chain-based,\nand tree architectures)\
    \ or location-based. This routing architecture prescribes the\npossible measures\
    \ to achieve efﬁcient local data processing, network maintenance,\nscalability,\
    \ minimized communication overhead, prolonged network lifespan, and re-\nduced\
    \ network management complexities [25,36]. Therefore, a suitable network\ntopology\
    \ indirectly determines the resulting network’s ﬂexibility, scalability, reliability,\n\
    communication strategy/costs, and the quality of the reported event data [12].\n\
    •\nMostly Requires On-site Actuation: Regardless of where data are managed in\
    \ a typical\nWSN-based Agri-IoT, the actionable decision signal must be sent to\
    \ execute on-farm\nactuation.\nProposed Design Objectives of WSN-Based Routing\
    \ Protocols for Agri-IoT and\nRealization Mechanisms\nFrom the systematic evaluation\
    \ of the unique characteristics and challenges of the\nWSN sublayer, a three-tier\
    \ cluster-based framework that constitutes the condensed ex-\npected core design\
    \ objectives and their corresponding remedial strategies of WSN-based\nrouting\
    \ protocols for Agri-IoT applications is demonstrated in Figure 10. Suppose the\
    \ corre-\nsponding remedies in Figure 10 are implemented in the associated routing\
    \ protocol. In that\ncase, the desired power optimization, self-healing, and auto-adaptability\
    \ expectations can\ntransitively yield the desired event data quality and operational\

    \ and strategies of WSN-based Agri-IoT routing protocols.\nThe importance of this\
    \ three-tier framework can be expanded on as follows:\n•\nAn adaptive and scalable\
    \ WSN-based routing protocol, as proposed in Figure 10, normally\nconstructs a\
    \ routing architecture that supports multihop routing, self-reconfiguration,\n\
    self-healing, and local network administration at a minimal routing table size,\
    \ commu-\nnication cost, and and control message complexity requirement. Since\
    \ communication\nIoT 2023, 4\n286\nis the principal power consumer, the operation\
    \ of the routing protocol must invlove\nfewer control messages. Also, it must\
    \ adapt to network turbulence due to SN failures.\nThe cluster-based architecture\
    \ exhibits the highest potential compared to related ar-\nchitectures [9,16,17,26].\
    \ The cluster heads (CHs) efﬁciently coordinate these activities\nby registering\
    \ and tolerating all dynamism resulting from SN-out-of-service faults,\nincreasing\
    \ the network size and SN density.\n•\nDue to the high vulnerability of SNs to\
    \ faults and failures, it is imperative to deploy\nsuitable FM techniques that\
    \ can detect, tolerate, or avoid possible root faults such\nas SN-out-of-service\
    \ and data outliers [25]. The adaptive clustering approach can\neffectively resolve\
    \ SN-out-of-service faults, while the threshold-based decision theory\nat the\
    \ local nodes and global levels can be suitable candidates for event data outlier\n\
    detection and correction in the PHY layer. Since power mismanagement is the root\n\
    cause of most faults and failures, the best fault-avoidance techniques optimize\
    \ the\nnodes’ power consumption rates.\n•\nFigure 10 also outlines the suitable\
    \ measures for power optimization in the WSN\nsublayer of Agri-IoT. In clustering\
    \ approaches, power consumption in the constrained\nWSN can be managed via message\
    \ complexity control, connectivity-related metrics,\nand communication-related\
    \ parameters by exploiting the clustering architecture [46].\nIn addition to local\
    \ data processing (data aggregation, data redundancy, and error\nchecks) and local\
    \ network administration (FM, adaptability to network dynamics),\nsuitable MOO\
    \ and multihop routing frameworks can be derived using the clustering\narchitecture,\
    \ total communication cost, and optimal cluster quality metrics to serve as\n\
    a design optimization guide for the simulation and real-world implementations\
    \ of the\nWSN phase of Agri-IoT.\nTo achieve the expectations in Figure 10, there\
    \ is a need for an architecture-speciﬁc\nmulti-objective assessment of the WSN’s\
    \ design cycle; from this, the associated parameters\nand theoretical models can\
    \ be derived and then theoretically optimized and validated\nexperimentally. A\
    \ novel holistic MOO framework can help realize these expected goals in\nboth\
    \ simulation and real-world Agri-IoT implementations. Consequently, there exists\
    \ the\nneed to carry out a systematic survey and assessment on existing routing\
    \ architectures, FM\nschemes, and routing protocols, and how these evolved in\
    \ existing real-world realization\ntestbeds of Agri-IoT. Such an in-depth literature\
    \ synthesis can help assess these qualitative\nperformance indicators constituting\
    \ the root QoS metrics in Figure 10 as well as deduce\napplication-speciﬁc guidelines\
    \ for improving CA-IoT networks using a precision irrigation\nsystem as a case\
    \ study.\n5. State of the Art on Routing Protocols for WSN-Based Agri-IoT Applications\n\
    In Agri-IoT, it is not simply a matter of applying IoT to a farm; contextual due\
    \ diligence\non architecture, communication standard, cost, actuator, performance\
    \ stability, control,\nand environmental impacts augment the routing protocol\
    \ requirements. This section\npresents a systematic synthesis of WSN-applicable\
    \ routing protocols under network ar-\nchitecture, the route discovery process,\
    \ and protocol operation as illustrated in Figure 11.\nTo help Agri-IoT designers\
    \ make well-informed decisions concerning architectural selection,\nwe classiﬁed\
    \ the canon protocols based on routing architecture, route-discovery process,\n\
    and operations in order to uncover their strengths, weaknesses, and contextual\
    \ reasons why\nthey can be adopted for Agri-IoT applications. Generally, event\
    \ routing in every protocol\ncan either be source-initiated or destination-initiated,\
    \ and the optimal path selection from\nthe constructed routing architecture can\
    \ also be broadcast-based, probabilistic, cluster-\nbased, or parameter-determined\
    \ using location-related, weight-based, and content-based\nmetrics [13]. Also,\
    \ routing protocols must commonly resist link failures using mechanisms\nthat\
    \ ensure balanced network-wide power depletion rates, energy-efﬁcient multihop\
    \ rout-\ning, and effective implementation of the indispensable QoS metrics presented\
    \ in Figure 10.\nThe related routing protocols can be classiﬁed as illustrated\
    \ in Figure 11.\nIoT 2023, 4\n287\nfile:///C:/Users/emman/Downloads/704.svg\n\

    This class of protocols presented in Figures 11 and 12 can be sub-grouped into\
    \ ﬂat-\nbased centralized or direct communication and decentralized [47] (e.g.,\
    \ ﬂooding/peer-\nto-peer/graphical/mesh-like architectures), hierarchical/cluster-based/tree\

    \ Sample network architectures: centralized-data-centric, cluster-based, and graph/ﬂooding-\n\
    based architectural frameworks of WSN sublayer.\nIoT 2023, 4\n288\nThe centralized\
    \ protocols route data to the BS via single-hop routing, while the ﬂooding\nand\
    \ graph-based protocols ﬂood data through multihop routing. The graph-based routing\n\
    protocols construct a reactive or proactive graphical routing architecture with\
    \ G(V, E)\nwhere a node and path represent the vertex and edges, respectively.\
    \ This method relies\non resource-intensive routing techniques from graph theory\
    \ used in classic IoT and ad\nhoc networks to transmit event data to the BS. In\
    \ contrast, the clustering/tree topology\ndepicted in Figure 12 groups the SNs\
    \ into either static or dynamic clusters, each with an\noptimally selected CH\
    \ to minimize the communication distances of the cluster’s member\nnodes (MN).\
    \ The CH is then tasked with aggregating the received readings from its MNs,\n\
    executing error and measurement redundancy checks, and communicating directly\
    \ (single-\nhop routing) or via a relay CH (RCH) using a multihop routing technique\
    \ to the sink\nnode or BS. However, the RCHs must be assigned fewer MNs to balance\
    \ the network’s\npower depletion rates, since aggregated packet forwarding inﬂicts\
    \ extra energy burden\non the RCHs [37]. Additionally, the CH can be equipped\
    \ to perform extra roles such as\nFM, coordination of the reclustering process,\
    \ network maintenance, relaying of aggregated\npackets in large-scale networks,\
    \ and management of network dynamism [12]. In general,\ncluster-based routing\
    \ protocols differ in terms of CH selection methods and coincide in\nterms of\
    \ intra-cluster and inter-cluster multihop routing, local data processing by the\
    \ CHs,\nand CH role rotation [47], which ensure balanced network-wide power depletion,\
    \ prevent\nabrupt power exhaustion, and lead to exponential energy savings [37].\n\
    Although the ﬂat-based architectures, such as centralized and ﬂooding (see Figure\
    \ 12),\ncan be easily implemented in real-world small-scale Agri-IoT networks,\
    \ they suffer severe\npacket collisions, communication bottlenecking at the BS,\
    \ and high inaptness for scalable\nor turbulent large-scale WSNs where energy\
    \ efﬁciency is a priority. Again, an optimized\nclustering approach can provide\
    \ an ideal topology for addressing the proposed expectations\nin Figure 10, and\
    \ it can also offer extra beneﬁts such as minimized communication cost,\nstabilized\
    \ network topology, efﬁcient load management, improved network maintenance,\n\
    and improved network trafﬁc and channel access management [37,48]. The main challenge\n\
    of the clustering method is how to achieve the desired cluster quality (e.g.,\
    \ optimal cluster\ncount and cluster size) so that the computational, bandwidth,\
    \ memory, and routing table\ncapacities of the resource-constrained CHs are not\
    \ exceeded. Typical examples of clustering\nprotocols are the LEACH family of\
    \ protocols, which include RCEEFT, ESAA, DEEC, SEP,\nand PEGASIS in [12].\nIn\
    \ location-based routing architectures, routing decisions are made either reactively\n\
    (e.g., Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector—AODV) or proactively (e.g., RPL—Routing\n\
    over Low-Power and Lossy Networks protocol), using the SNs’ location information.\
    \ This\nnormally results in a decentralized, graphical architecture. Since the\
    \ SNs that form the\nWSN are spatially deployed in the ﬁeld without any IP-addressing\
    \ schemes, location\ninformation is needed in order to establish communication\
    \ between the nodes in a location-\nbased architecture. The location information\
    \ helps eliminate unwanted transmissions by\ncollecting data from a speciﬁc region\
    \ of interest. This architecture suffers from routing\ndelays, high infrastructural\
    \ cost, extreme difﬁculties in deployment and management,\nand high energy waste\
    \ due to SNs’ long idling durations. However, they are the most\ncommonly used\
    \ protocol in existing ZigBee-based Agri-IoT testbed solutions [1,10,14,17].\n\
    Since this approach yields non-energy-aware architectures, it is not suitable\
    \ for Agri-IoT\napplications [12].\nIt is evident from the above discussions that\
    \ Agri-IoT-based network architectures\nmust be deﬁned by the associated routing\
    \ protocol using the design requirements in Figure 9\nas well as the application-deﬁned\
    \ requirements [49] in order to enhance the performance\nexpectations in Figure\
    \ 10. In addition, the routing architecture must not compromise on\nthe quality,\
    \ precision, and accuracy of the event information. It must be in unison with\
    \ the\napplication-speciﬁc requirements to address possible deployments- and network-induced\n\
    challenges, such as network turbulence and SN mobility.\nIoT 2023, 4\n289\n5.2.\
    \ Route Discovery-Based Protocols\nAs shown in Figure 11, route discovery-based\
    \ protocols focus on when the route for\ndata transmission is built and can be\
    \ grouped into proactive, reactive, and hybrid protocols.\nIn proactive routing\
    \ protocols, the routes are pre-created before they are needed.\nThese protocols\
    \ are table-driven, since every node stores a large routing table containing a\n\
    list of all possible destinations, next-hop neighbors to those destinations, and\
    \ the associated\ncosts of all next-hop options. Proactive protocols such as the\
    \ RPL and the APTEEN family of\nprotocols [15] make local routing decisions using\
    \ the routing table’s content. For instance,\nthe RPL operates as a distant-vector\
    \ protocol for IPv6 low-power devices, utilizes the\nZigBee/IEEE 802.15.4 standard\
    \ on established IP infrastructure, and also supports the\n6LoWPAN adaptation\
    \ layer. RPL creates a multihop tree routing hierarchy of SNs, such\nthat nodes\
    \ can send data through their respective parent nodes to the BS/sink node in a\n\
    ﬂooded manner (Figure 12). Similarly, the BS or sink node can send a unicast message\
    \ to a\nspeciﬁc SN in order to complete a bidirectional operational framework\
    \ of RPL. The optimal\ncommunication costs and routes are estimated by ranking\
    \ the associated objective function\n(OF) metrics, which can be single-objective\
    \ optimization, SOO metrics, or MOO metrics.\nThis routing over LLNs (RoLL) restricts\
    \ densely deployed and resource-limited SNs to\ncommunicate using peer-to-peer\
    \ or extended star network topologies [13]. Technically,\nRPL builds a directed\
    \ acyclic graph (DAG) with no outgoing edges from the root element\n(e.g., BS)\
    \ to eliminate loops. RPL is the primary underlying routing protocol in most failed\n\
    Agri-IoT testbed attempts. Although the proactive or RPL-based family of protocols\
    \ are\nrobust, reliable, scalable, and can relatively operate at minimized control\
    \ messages with the\nhelp of timers, they are not suitable for Agri-IoT networks\
    \ due to these technical challenges:\n•\nThe core of RPL/proactive protocols still\
    \ suffers from key challenges such as en-\nergy wastage, a lack of adaptability/scalability,\
    \ reliability, congestion, and security\nissues. Speciﬁcally, the energy expended\
    \ by RPL-inherited protocols to create routes\n(e.g., establish and maintain routing\
    \ tables) and transmit data can be too high for\nresource-constrained SNs in recent\
    \ Agri-IoT applications.\n•\nThe underlying technology of RPL (e.g., ZigBee, 6LoWPAN,\
    \ or IPv6) was designed\nfor energy-sufﬁcient devices with high processing and\
    \ memory capacities. Therefore,\nRPL is inapt for typical resourced-constrained\
    \ Agri-IoT networks (refer to Table 5).\n•\nThey require costly ﬁxed IP infrastructural\
    \ supports and utilize the centralized routing\narchitecture, which becomes practically\
    \ impossible to manage as the network scales.\nConversely, the source-initiated\
    \ reactive or on-demand routing protocols only create\nthe routes on-demand by\
    \ a source to send data to a receiver. Reactive protocols (e.g., Ad hoc\nOn-demand\
    \ Distance Vector, AODV Protocol [13]) have no speciﬁc procedures for creating\n\
    and updating routing tables with route information at regular intervals. For instance,\n\
    the AODV is a loop-free, self-starting, and reactive routing protocol meant for\
    \ LLNs\n(e.g., WSN-based IoT) that are characterized by node mobility, link failures,\
    \ and packet\nlosses. AODV mainly consists of the route discovery process (RREQ\
    \ and RREP messages)\nand route maintenance (RERR and HELLO messages). Although\
    \ reactive or AODV-based\nprotocols can adapt to network dynamics and eliminate\
    \ periodic updates, the associated\nﬂooding-based route–search process incurs\
    \ severe overheads resulting in high control\nmessage complexity, high route acquisition\
    \ latency, and high energy wastages due to longer\nSN idling periods. Consequently,\
    \ these protocols are unsuitable for power-constrained\nWSN-based Agri-IoT applications.\n\
    The hybrid-based routing protocols merge the features of both reactive and proactive\n\
    routing processes. However, hybrid protocols such as APTEEN [13] also require\
    \ expensive\nﬁxed infrastructural support, which renders them unsuitable for Agri-IoT,\
    \ even if the\ncombined merits of reactive and proactive protocols are exploited.\n\
    A comparative assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the parent WSN-based\n\
    routing protocols for Agri-IoT applications is illustrated in Table 5.\nIoT 2023,\

    \ protocols can be classiﬁed based on the operation or communication\nmodel employed,\
    \ which may include:\n•\nNegotiation-Based Protocols: These protocols exchange\
    \ negotiation messages or use\nmeta-data negotiations between neighboring SNs\
    \ before the actual data transfers to\nreduce redundant transmissions in the network.\
    \ A typical example is the SPIN family\nof protocols [13].\n•\nMultipath-Based\
    \ Protocols: These use multiple routes simultaneously to accomplish\nhigher resilience\
    \ to route failure (i.e., fault tolerance) and load balancing.\n•\nQuery-Based\
    \ Routing Protocols: These are receiver-initiated protocols whereby a desti-\n\
    nation node broadcasts a query to initiate a data-sensing task from a node through\
    \ the\nnetwork. A node having the data being queried sends it in response to the\
    \ query.\n•\nCoherent and Non-Coherent Protocols: The coherent routing method\
    \ forwards data for\naggregation after a minimum local pre-processing. However,\
    \ in non-coherent routing,\nthe nodes locally process the raw data before routing\
    \ to the BS for further processing.\n•\nQoS-Based Routing Protocols: These protocols’\
    \ purpose is to satisfy a speciﬁc QoS metric\nor multiple QoS metrics such as\
    \ low latency, energy efﬁciency, or low packet loss.\nThese protocols ensure a\
    \ balance between energy consumption and data quality in\nevery event-reporting\
    \ task.\nIn addition to route architectural construction and data transmission,\
    \ efﬁcient MAC\nmust be embedded in the routing protocol to manage the wireless\
    \ medium access and the\nduty-cycle/sampling schedules of the deployed SNs in\
    \ Agri-IoT networks. As opposed\nto classic IoT, the MAC techniques in Agri-IoT\
    \ are architecture-deﬁned by the associated\nrouting protocol to meet the energy\
    \ efﬁciency requirements of the network via channel\naccess management (CAM) and\
    \ the moderation of the active–sleep duty cycles of the\ndeployed SNs to save\
    \ extra energy. The next subsection presents a concise overview of\nMAC techniques\
    \ and their roles in WSN-based Agri-IoT networks.\n5.4. MAC Techniques and Requirements\
    \ for Agri-IoT\nNext to node deployment, the routing protocol deﬁnes the network\
    \ architecture and\nselects a suitable MAC technique and a communication pattern\
    \ for the routing architec-\nture. Unlike classic IoT, requirements for Agri-IoT\
    \ applications include a low control\nIoT 2023, 4\n291\nmessage complexity and\
    \ low latency MAC technique that moderates sampling schedules,\naccess to a shared\
    \ medium, transceiver operation modes, (e.g., packet transmission and\nreception,\
    \ retransmission, collision, over-hearing, overhead handling, and idle listening)\n\
    active–sleep duty cycles of the deployed SNs, and transceiver channels. Thus,\
    \ an MAC\nprotocol for WSN-based Agri-IoT applications must be architecture-speciﬁc\
    \ and adaptive\nto network dynamics such as data transmission errors, interferences/packet\
    \ collisions,\nand regular interfacing of the active–sleep duty-cycled schedules\
    \ of the SNs’ transceiver\nstates (e.g., transmitting state, receiving state,\
    \ idle state, and sleep state [52]) during packet\ntransmission and reception\
    \ in order to improve network throughput, energy efﬁciency,\nlatency, and other\
    \ QoS metrics.\nUnlike MAC protocols for classic IoT, an efﬁcient MAC technique\
    \ for Agri-IoT must\nensure exponential energy savings via channel assignment\
    \ management (CAM) and active–\nsleep duty-cycle coordination in both time and\
    \ channel perspectives. Based on these\ncommon dual tasks of Agri-IoT-based MAC\
    \ (thus, duty-cycle optimization—DCO and\nchannel access management—CAM), existing\
    \ IoT-based MAC techniques can be classiﬁed\nas illustrated in Figure 13 and the\

    \ surveyed core Agri-IoT-based routing protocols and evalu-\nated the parent protocols\
    \ (i.e., RPL, AODV, and LEACH/cluster-based families of protocols)\nfor classic\
    \ WSN-based IoT networks, of which LEACH-based methods are the best candi-\ndates\
    \ for the resource-limited WSN-based Agri-IoT. However, the RPL and AODV have\n\
    received more research considerations in terms of realizations in both simulations\
    \ and prac-\ntice [9,12,21]. Although the cluster-based architecture has unique\
    \ endowments for realizing\nthe proposed expectations in Figures 2 and 10, it\
    \ lacks an in-depth design synthesis in the\ncurrent state of the art that can\
    \ uncover its contextualized performance optimization modal-\nities for real-world\
    \ Agri-IoT applications. In addition, the deployment requirements with\ntrending\
    \ technologies such as BLE, LoRaWAN, SigFox, 5G, LoRa via Satellite, and NB-IoT\n\
    under both simulation and real-world operational conditions is imperative. Consequently,\n\
    the following sections present in-depth overviews on FM, the benchmarking of WSN-based\n\
    Agri-IoT testbed solutions, clustering methods in the existing state of the art,\
    \ and how\nthe possible deductions from these syntheses can evolve in a typical\
    \ case-study such as a\nWSN-speciﬁc Agri-IoT routing protocol for precision irrigation.\n\
    6. State of the Art on FM Techniques for Classic WSN Sublayer of IoT\nSince faults\
    \ and failures are inevitable in the WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT networks (refer\n\
    to Figure 10), it is imperative to reevaluate the faults, causes, types, strengths/weaknesses\n\
    of existing FM (i.e., fault detection—FD, fault tolerance—FT, and fault-avoidance—FA)\n\
    schemes, revisit their founding assumptions [71], and make appropriate recommendations\n\
    for Agri-IoT network designers. In this section, we establish the root source/cause(s)\
    \ of\nfaults in the WSN sublayer by assessing the behaviors of the different fault\
    \ types, examining\nthe extent to which the existing FM schemes address these\
    \ root faults, and exploring\nhow these schemes will evolve in realistic WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT networks based on their\ncore assumptions, control message overheads/complexities,\
    \ and energy-saving capacities.\nFrom this thorough assessment, this section proposes\
    \ practical fault-avoidance-based FM\ntechniques for the next generation of WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT.\n6.1. Systematic Overview of Faults, Sources, and Taxonomy of Faults\
    \ in Agri-IoT\nAccording to the fault–error–failure cycle depicted in Figure 14,\
    \ a fault can be defined as\nany impairment that causes a system to produce erroneous\
    \ results or leads to the failure of the\nentire system or specific components\
    \ [72]. The prevalence of faults in WSN-based Agri-IoT\nis primarily due to the\
    \ SN component malfunction, lack of post-deployment maintenance,\nor resource\
    \ exhaustion [73], which can lead to either impaired event data quality (thus,\
    \ sensory\ndata error/outlier) or SN-out-of-service (thus, the shortened lifespan\
    \ of SNs) [25].\nDue to the high susceptibility of WSNs to faults, the supervisory\
    \ routing protocol is\nexpected to incorporate efﬁcient FM mechanisms that can\
    \ guarantee optimum event data\nquality and network availability. By implication,\
    \ FM algorithms for WSNs must not be\nstand-alone as currently seen in the state\
    \ of the art [73]; instead, they must be an integral\naspect of the routing protocol\
    \ that agrees with the core participants of the PHY layer, such as\nthe SN, wireless\
    \ communication medium, and the BS. As illustrated on the left of Figure 15,\n\
    the WSN sublayer is the most prevalent source of faults in the Agri-IoT ecosystem,\
    \ in which\nthe SNs are the central origin of faults that can propagate to the\
    \ upper layers [25,43,73].\nThis is because the BS is resource-sufﬁcient mainly,\
    \ and the link’s reliability also hinges\nupon the SNs’ availability, as indicated\
    \ in Figure 15. At the local SN’s level, each unit\ndepicted at the bottom of\
    \ Figure 3 is a potential source of fault/failure, but the degree of\nprevalence\
    \ is frequently accelerated whenever power consumption is mismanaged through\n\
    the disregard of any of the network design requirements and deployment conditions\n\
    presented in later sections.\nThe different taxonomies of faults in the state\
    \ of the art of the WSN sublayer [44,71,73–77],\nas illustrated on the left side\
    \ of Figure 16, can be compared as follows:\nIoT 2023, 4\n295\n•\nHard or permanent\
    \ fault refers to the inability of a node to stay active and communicate\ndue\
    \ to resource exhaustion or component malfunction, while in soft or static faults,\n\
    nodes continue to work and communicate with other nodes, but they sense, process,\n\
    or transmit erroneous data [44,74].\n•\nThe authors in [75,78] categorized faults\
    \ as permanent (refers to SN-out-of-service\nfaults), transient (caused by temporary\
    \ conditions), intermittent (shows sporadic\nmanifestations due to unstable behavior\
    \ of hardware and software), and potential\n(due to depletion of hardware resources\
    \ [78]).\n•\nData inconsistency faults can also result from faulty sensing, processing,\
    \ and communi-\ncation, which is frequently caused by power depletion below a\
    \ certain threshold, while\npower failure occurs when a node exhausts its battery\
    \ power completely [43,77,79].\n•\nThe authors in [73] classiﬁed faults into software\
    \ and hardware faults based on soft-\nware and hardware impairments, respectively.\n\
    •\nAccording to [71], faults can be either time-based, due to the depreciation\
    \ of hardware\ncomponents with time, or behavioral-based, due to SNs’ inability\
    \ to cope with harsh\nenvironmental and operating conditions.\n1/20/22, 8:48 PM\n\

    \ in the state of the art and proposed fault taxonomies for WSN-\nbased Agri-IoT.\n\
    From the above deﬁnitions and the fault taxonomies on the left side of Figure\
    \ 16, it can\nbe deduced that hard, permanent, and static faults are practically\
    \ manifested as SN-out-of-\nservice, while soft, dynamic, and data-inconsistency\
    \ faults can be observed as data outliers.\nBoth SN-out-of-service and data outliers\
    \ are consequences of unit malfunction or resource\nexhaustion and can be permanent\
    \ or intermittent in behavior. Both conditions can impair\nthe quality of event\
    \ data and the global actionable decisions of the network. Therefore,\nthe quality\
    \ of FM schemes can be evaluated based on their capacities to effectively detect,\n\
    tolerate, or avoid SN-out-of-service and data outlier faults. In summary, most\
    \ FM schemes\nin the state of the art focus on their effects, instead of the root\
    \ faults, which are the ﬂaws in\nexisting FM schemes [25]. Additionally, since\
    \ the SN is the sole network device responsible\nIoT 2023, 4\n297\nfor event sensing,\
    \ data computation, packet forwarding, and communication in the WSN\nsublayer\
    \ of Agri-IoT, it is the principal source of faults in Agri-IoT networks. A new\
    \ fault\nclassiﬁcation framework shown in Figure 16 can be deduced from the above\
    \ analysis.\nSecondly, it is discernible that SNs’ power mismanagement is the\
    \ most prevalent\norigin of faults [43,80,81], which then propagate to the backend\
    \ or application level (refer\nto the right side of Figure 15). For instance,\
    \ communication, sensing, and computational\naccuracies of a node can be impaired\
    \ when the battery energy falls below certain thresh-\nolds [43]. Also, network\
    \ faults can be traced to power exhaustion and node failures, which\ncreate holes\
    \ in the topology that divide the network into multiple disjointed segments [43].\n\
    On that account, faults can be avoided in WSN-based Agri-IoT if the energy-saving\
    \ strate-\ngies presented in Figures 9 and 10 are effectively implemented.\nAdditionally,\
    \ any FM scheme or fault-monitoring mechanism, be it proactive, reactive,\npassive,\
    \ or active, must incorporate the following underlying qualities: thresholds that\n\
    represent the probable fault conditions without false alarms, fault discovery,\
    \ minimized\nmessage/time complexities, and self-healing and self-reconﬁguration\
    \ to neutralize the\neffects of the faults [43].\nFM Framework and Architectures\
    \ in WSN Sublayer of Agri-IoT\nAs illustrated in Figure 17, every FM scheme consists\
    \ of three main steps, which\ninclude fault detection (FD), fault diagnosis, and\
    \ fault recovery/tolerance (FT) [82,83],\nwhich always require input information.\
    \ These steps are implemented in a decision-making\nframework that involves four\
    \ major processes: data/information collection, FD model\nformulation, FD decision\
    \ and fault classiﬁcation, and tolerance of its effects using any of\nthe FT mechanisms\
    \ shown in Figure 17. Thus, the FD model detects the fault, the fault\ndiscovery\
    \ technique distinguishes that fault from false alarms, while the FT mechanism\n\
    helps to auto-heal and recover from the faults or failures [84]. Mainly, SN-out-of-service\n\
    faults are detected and tolerated using self-reconﬁguration techniques, whereas\
    \ data outlier\nfaults must strictly follow Figure 17.\n1/20/22, 8:49 PM\n4.svg\n\

    Figure 17. FM framework in WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT.\nIn addition, FM schemes\
    \ can be implemented using either a centralized or distributed\narchitecture [44,85,86].\
    \ In a centralized scheme, the FD/FT protocol is hosted and managed\non the BS,\
    \ whereas the distributed scheme hosts and manages this algorithm on the local\n\
    SNs [87,88] (see Figure 17). The centralized approach is simpler for small-scaled\
    \ networks\nbut suffers many technical challenges, such as common point failure\
    \ due to heavy message\ntrafﬁc at the BS and high SN energy waste. In contrast,\
    \ the distributed approach saves\npower and controls message trafﬁc on the BS\
    \ because it allows local decision and self-\nIoT 2023, 4\n298\nFD/FT with or\
    \ without neighboring. According to Figure 17, the distributed architecture\n\
    can be implemented in three major ways [43,89–91], which include self-detection,\
    \ neighbor\ncoordination, and the clustering approach. Since the basic design\
    \ requirement of a WSN-\nbased Agri-IoT is to maintain the healthy functionality\
    \ and longevity of the SNs and the\nBS, any post-deployment impairments that cannot\
    \ be self-ﬁxed must be tolerated to not\ninterfere with the core function of the\
    \ network. Therefore, any automated FT mechanism\nthat can be achieved through\
    \ the self-reconﬁguration and self-management for enhanced\nnetwork availability,\
    \ reliability, and dependability is encouraged in the WSN sublayer [92].\nAccording\
    \ to Figure 17, an efﬁcient WSN-based Agri-IoT, therefore, requires a calculated\n\
    mix of FT mechanisms based on the intended application.\n6.2. Systematic Survey\
    \ of Fault Management Schemes in WSN-Based IoT\nFM in Agri-IoT networks has not\
    \ received adequate conceptualized research con-\nsiderations. As a result, existing\
    \ Agri-IoT solutions inherit the FM propositions from\nthe traditional WSN-based\
    \ IoT networks, which have proven to be unsuitable [14]. This\nsubsection presents\
    \ a concise overview of these FM schemes, including their strengths,\nweaknesses,\
    \ and underlying theories/concepts. It then proposes a more suitable remedy for\n\
    WSN-based Agri-IoT technology. In canon centralized FM schemes (see references\
    \ in [93–97]),\nthe underlying FM algorithm is hosted and managed on the BS, while\
    \ the local SNs host\nand manage the FM algorithm in distributed architectures\
    \ [87,88]. Although the centralized\napproach is simpler for small-scale networks,\
    \ it suffers many technical challenges, such\nas common point failure due to heavy\
    \ message trafﬁc at the BS, management difﬁculties,\nand high energy wastages\
    \ on distant routing. This clearly explains why most outdoor\nAgri-IoT testbed\
    \ experiments in [1,10,11,14,18,19] experienced severe FM complications to\nthe\
    \ extent that the networks became infeasible to operate or manage at higher scalability\n\
    levels. However, the distributed approach (see references in [74,76,77,91,98–103])\
    \ saves\npower and controls message trafﬁc and workload on the BS because it allows\
    \ local decisions\nas well as local-FD/FT with or without neighboring nodes. The\
    \ distributed FD/FT scheme\ncan also be self-executed, neighbor-coordinated, or\
    \ clustering-aided [89–91]. Although the\nclustering-based FM architecture has\
    \ promising potential to improve energy conservation,\nnetwork adaptability, and\
    \ ease of implementation, it has not been extensively researched\nand exploited.\n\
    Again, distributed FD schemes are mainly established on the assumption that the\n\
    failure of SNs is spatially uncorrelated, while event information is spatially\
    \ correlated.\nTherefore, the FD’s decision framework is frequently modeled using\
    \ sensory data or statis-\ntical properties of the spatial or temporally correlated\
    \ SNs [79,104–106] from the immediate\nneighborhood of a node [74,103] or data\
    \ from farther SNs [107]. To date, the applicabil-\nity of these solutions to\
    \ the Agri-IoT context has attracted several technical challenges.\nConsequently,\
    \ the strengths and weaknesses of the main results of the benchmarking FM\nschemes,\
    \ their underlying assumptions, and how they addressed the critical fault-afﬁnity\n\

    \ and Their Shortcomings\nThe conceptual models/theories of the canon FD decision\
    \ frameworks and the associ-\nated shortcomings can be expressed as follows:\n\
    •\nStatistical approaches such as Neyman–Pearson formulation [116], Bayesian statis-\n\
    tics [77,103], and normal distribution test types (e.g., Thompson Tau statistical\
    \ test [105])\nare high-resource-demanding techniques that may apply to classic\
    \ IoT. Still, they are\nunsuitable for power-constrained Agri-IoT devices or SNs.\
    \ In addition to being stand-\nalone and without application speciﬁcity, these\
    \ methods operate at high computational\nand control message complexities. Their\
    \ operational efﬁciencies increase with increas-\ning data dimensionality and\
    \ also require a priori knowledge of data distribution,\nwhich is not possible\
    \ in many real-life applications of Agri-IoT networks. Additionally,\nthey rely\
    \ on predeﬁned thresholds to make local and global FD decisions. Therefore,\n\
    regardless of the extensive research considerations of these methods, they are\
    \ generally\nnot suitable for low-power IoT applications, of which Agri-IoT is\
    \ no exception.\n•\nGraph-based FM techniques lack precise criteria for outlier\
    \ detections [83,109], suffer\nhigher computational complexities, and also make\
    \ unrealistic assumptions about the\ndata distribution. In addition, these approaches\
    \ (e.g., De Bruijn graph theory [109]\nand depth-based techniques) are unsuitable\
    \ for multidimensional and huge datasets.\n•\nMachine learning decision concepts\
    \ such as the k-out-of-n and majority decision\nrule concepts [93], naive Bayes,\
    \ iterative algorithms [107], and neural network-based\ntechniques, among others,\
    \ are susceptible to high dimensional datasets, suffer high\ncomputational cost,\
    \ and rely on sensitive model parameters.\nIn addition to the stipulated shortcomings,\
    \ these benchmarking FM methods usually\nignore the sensory data correlation (i.e.,\
    \ attribute correlation, spatial correlation, and tem-\nporal correlation) properties\
    \ of SNs, require high communication overhead with high FD\ndelays [83], and normally\
    \ operate in an ofﬂine manner, which is inconsistent with the\nmodus operandi\
    \ of typical Agri-IoT. Hence, they are unsuitable for the recent low-power\nAgri-IoT\
    \ applications.\n6.4. Open Issues on Existing FM Solutions for Classic WSN-Based\
    \ IoT Networks and\nRecommended Design Guidelines for Achieving Efﬁcient FM in\
    \ WSN-Based Agri-IoT\nA fault in the WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT networks can be\
    \ manifested as a data outlier\nand SN-out-of-service or node failure, both of\
    \ which must be detected and resolved locally\nor globally using the spatially\
    \ correlated event information and efﬁcient threshold-based\ndecision frameworks.\
    \ Although there has been extensive research concerning FM schemes\nfor the WSN\
    \ sublayer, several technical challenges that require urgent contextual research\n\
    considerations exist. They include the following:\n1.\nMost faults in the PHY\
    \ layer of Agri-IoT originate from the SNs’ power exhaustion,\nwhich implies that\
    \ the best fault-avoidance techniques are those that optimize power\nconsumption.\
    \ However, most FM schemes waste more energy and make the net-\nwork prone to\
    \ more faults/failures via high control messages and computational\ncomplexities.\n\
    2.\nMost FM schemes exist as stand-alone frameworks without architectural consider-\n\
    ations and are founded on unrealistic assumptions, which make them difﬁcult to\n\
    incorporate into existing routing protocols.\n3.\nThe cluster-based routing architecture\
    \ is endowed with many untapped local/global FM\npotentials and fault-avoidance\
    \ capacities for the next-generation Agri-IoT. However, these\npromising potentials\
    \ have received the least contextualized research considerations.\nExisting FM\
    \ solutions are meant for resource-sufﬁcient and expensive classic WSN-\nbased\
    \ IoT, not resource-constrained, context-speciﬁc use cases like Agri-IoT networks.\n\
    Regarding these technical challenges, this tutorial presents the following design\
    \ guidelines\nfor building efﬁcient and realistic FM schemes for WSN-based Agri-IoT:\n\
    IoT 2023, 4\n302\n1.\nFM schemes must rely on realistic and contextual assumptions\
    \ in order to detect and\nauto-tolerate sensory data outliers and SN-out-of-service\
    \ faults in real-time routing\nprotocols with minimal message, computational,\
    \ and memory complexities. Such FM\nschemes will be suitable for all power-constrained\
    \ WSN-based Agri-IoT applications.\n2.\nFuture works on FM schemes must be embedded\
    \ into speciﬁc routing protocols so\nthat their adaptability to topological dynamism\
    \ and scalability in terms of network\nsizes and node densities can be assessed\
    \ in an unsupervised manner. Therefore, fault\ndetection and fault-tolerance schemes\
    \ based on simple threshold-based theories are\nthe best candidates for this context,\
    \ since the threshold boundaries of agronomical\nmetrics can be accurately computed\
    \ from the historical data of the location.\n3.\nFM schemes must incorporate redundancy\
    \ check mechanisms by exploiting spatial\nand temporal correlations among sensory\
    \ data.\n4.\nFM schemes should maintain a good balance between local and global\
    \ FDs as well as\na reasonable detection rate and false alarm rate.\n7. State\
    \ of the Art on Real-World, Canon WSN-Based Agri-IoT Testbed Solutions\nIt is\
    \ well documented that WSN-based Agri-IoT is the most reliable remedy for mitigat-\n\
    ing the negative impacts climate change has had on agricultural production, for\
    \ which many\narchitectural designs and testbed prototypes have been proposed\
    \ [12,36]. In addition, since\nthe autonomous, resource-constrained SNs in Agri-IoT\
    \ are expected to operate without\npost-deployment maintenance checks, the issues\
    \ of FM, power optimization, and self-\norganization during SN design and network\
    \ deployment cannot be ignored in existing\ntestbed solutions [12,117]. Essentially,\
    \ the results from most research projects on Agri-IoT\nrelied on simulation experiments\
    \ [1,10,14], which have retained the gap between the phi-\nlosophy of this technology\
    \ and the comprehension of its real-world behavior for a more ac-\ncurate performance\
    \ assessment. This section presents a systematic performance assessment\nof the\
    \ few real-world WSN-based Agri-IoT testbed solutions currently based on the classic\n\
    WSN-based IoT principles. To understand how the benchmarking realization testbeds\
    \ of\nAgri-IoT in [1,10,11,14,18,19] fared in real-world operational conditions,\
    \ the results from\ntheir respective performances are systematically evaluated\
    \ and summarized in Table 8. It\nwas discovered that the current benchmarking\
    \ testbed solutions in [1,10,11,14,18,19] are\ncapital-intensive because they\
    \ are reliant on ﬁxed/location-restricted backbone infrastruc-\ntures (see the\
    \ middle of Figure 3), too complicated to deploy and manage by even expert\nusers,\
    \ based on unrealistic indoor conditions which do not commensurate real-world\
    \ envi-\nronmental conditions, and based on the high- power-demanding centralized\
    \ or ﬂooding\narchitectures which further complicate network manageability when\
    \ up-scaled. A concise\nand systematic survey of these benchmarking real-world\
    \ Agri-IoT networks and their ﬂaws\nin the state of the art is summarized in Table\
    \ 8.\nAdditionally, it can be established from the comparative assessment of the\
    \ benchmark-\ning Agri-IoT testbeds in Table 8 [10,11,18,19] that the embedded\
    \ communication technology,\nevent routing architecture, and the SNs’ power management\
    \ are the core factors that made\nthem capital-intensive and complicated to both\
    \ experts and low-income farmers. Addi-\ntionally, self-healing, reconﬁgurability,\
    \ and adaptability mechanisms to faults were not\ndeployed [1,14,17]; hence, faulty\
    \ and turbulent conditions could not be tolerated. Further-\nmore, since the battery-powered\
    \ SNs rely on expensive Wi-Fi and cellular communication\ntechnologies that are\
    \ not freely accessible at all locations, the SNs exhausted their battery\nsupply\
    \ a few days after deployment. Similarly, those that relied on ZigBee/IEEE 802.15.\
    \ 4\ncommunication technologies with power-intensive 6LoWPAN or IPv6 protocols\
    \ restricted\nthe resulting network to drive on the problematic centralized or\
    \ ﬂooding architectures\nwithout any efﬁcient FM techniques. As a result, these\
    \ solutions used costly ﬁxed IP\ninfrastructural supports and the centralized\
    \ routing architecture, making them practically\nimpossible to manage as the networks\
    \ scaled. This is why the SNs unstably exhausted their\nbattery power and abruptly\
    \ abridged network lifespans [1,10,11,14,18,19].\nIoT 2023, 4\n303\nTable 8. Comparative\

    Therefore, the freely available low-power wireless technologies (e.g., LoRa, BLE,\
    \ 5G,\nZ-wave, NB-IoT, and SigFox) that are founded on a suitable routing topology\
    \ are the best\ncandidates for making this ubiquitous application [1,16] cheap\
    \ [1,20] and simple for all\nusers. Thus, the cluster-based topology is more pivotal\
    \ to addressing the above challenges\nof Agri-IoT [10,17] than the traditional\
    \ cellular and WiFi technologies that are inaccessible\nin many farms, depending\
    \ on their locations [10,20]. However, besides distance-power\nconstraints, architectural\
    \ support, and network manageability challenges, these freely\naccessible wireless\
    \ communication technologies have speciﬁc limitations, which include:\n1.\nZigBee\
    \ technology achieves the desired power savings only when deployed in star or\n\
    centralized topology [14], and it operates at its low-power distance range (10–100\
    \ m)\nin line-of-sight mode depending on the environmental characteristics.\n\
    2.\nLoRa is limited to low-density and ﬁxed network sizes (non-scalable), a low\
    \ data rate,\nand a low message capacity [14]. It may require registration and\
    \ expensive antennae,\ndepending on its operation location.\n3.\nSigFox supports\
    \ a very low data rate and requires registration. LoRa and SigFox\npossess complex\
    \ implementations because they both require speciﬁc modules to\nfunction and gateways.\n\
    4.\nWiFi, GPRS, cellular technologies, and NB-IoT are high power consumption standards\n\
    and location-/architecture-restricted.\n5.\nBLE has a short communication range\
    \ but supports clustering architecture, which is the\nmost optimal architecture\
    \ for ensuring the best operational efﬁciency of WSN-based\nAgri-IoT deployments,\
    \ since this architecture allows cluster isolation and management.\nTherefore,\
    \ a research opportunity exists for a ﬂexible, ubiquitous, realistic, energy-\n\
    efﬁcient, self-healing, simple, low-cost, cluster-based, and wireless outdoor-based\
    \ testbed\nthat consists of infrastructure-less, task-scalable, and wirelessly\
    \ conﬁgurable experimental\nSNs and a BS. It should also be deployed, re-deployed,\
    \ monitored, controlled, and managed\nby non-experts to operate stably throughout\
    \ the entire crop-growing season.\n8. Case Study: Cluster-Based Agri-IoT (CA-IoT)\
    \ for Precision Irrigation\nAs earlier established in Figure 2, the design and\
    \ implementation of Agri-IoT networks\nare driven by unique critical factors,\
    \ which are mainly determined by the associated\nrouting architecture, communication\
    \ technology, actuation management mechanisms,\nand environmental impacts. In\
    \ the operation phase, these factors constitute the speciﬁc\nobjectives in Figure\
    \ 10, which the supervisory routing protocol must address in order\nto optimize\
    \ performance efﬁciency and stability. As systematically established above,\n\
    the LEACH-inherited cluster-based architecture has the most promising potential\
    \ to address\nIoT 2023, 4\n304\nthese technical challenges. It helps to attain\
    \ high power optimization via communication\ndistance and packet minimization,\
    \ efficient network administration/adaptability, high event\ndata quality through\
    \ auto-FM, and local data quality management, as indicated in Figure 10.\nSo,\
    \ this section presents a systematic analysis of how the merits of this architecture\
    \ evolve\nin CA-IoT for precision irrigation use cases. Using the framework in\
    \ Figure 12, the cluster-\nbased architecture was pre-examined to uncover how\
    \ the fundamental Agri-IoT design\nrequirements and goals presented in the reference\
    \ frameworks in Figures 2, 9 and 10 can\nunfold into realistic multi-parametric\
    \ optimization metrics.\nThe conceptual architectural framework of the proposed\
    \ network, as illustrated in\nFigure 18, can be implemented using Arduino-based\
    \ or Raspberry Pi(RPi)-based micro-\ncontrollers, BLE and LoRa for intra-cluster,\
    \ inter-cluster, and BS–cloud communications,\nrespectively, and DHT22/STEMMA\
    \ soil moisture sensors for measuring the respective\nambient and soil microclimatic\
    \ parameters. Also, a unit cluster from Figure 18 detailing\nthe key network components\
    \ of MNs, CH, BS, and the ﬁeld-deployed precision irrigation\nsystem is shown\
    \ in Figure 19. It is assumed that the core units constituting the MNs, CH,\n\
    and BS, as illustrated in Figure 19, are optimally selected and designed after\
    \ Figure 2. Using\nFigures 18 and 19 as the reference architectural frameworks\
    \ for achieving our contextualized\nobjectives, this section presents an in-depth\

    \ 20a, the cluster features deﬁne the underlying connectivity\nissues, such as\
    \ cluster quality indices (thus, cluster count, cluster size) and intra-cluster\n\
    and inter-cluster communication types (thus, single-hop or multihop or both) [23,24].\n\
    From the network design viewpoint, the cluster quality depends on the optimality\
    \ of the\nCH count and cluster sizes, which in turn rely on the core design parameters,\
    \ such as the\nspatial density and uniformity of the deployed nodes, the speciﬁcation\
    \ of the wireless\ncommunication standard, the routing architecture, and the size\
    \ of the network [47]. Since\nthe deployment of SNs in a typical Agri-IoT can\
    \ be controlled, the stipulated cluster quality\nproperties can be optimized to\
    \ resolve connectivity issues in Figure 20b. In a randomly\ndeployed ﬁeld, these\
    \ cluster quality parameters can be optimized using a pairing-based SN\nduty-scheduling\
    \ mechanisms [9,12].\nSecondly, the CH features can be static, mobile, or role-rotated\
    \ in both homogeneous\nor heterogeneous networks [9,12] based on the SNs’ resource\
    \ hierarchy. Additionally,\nthe CHs can be assigned different tasks, such as data\
    \ aggregation, FM, coordinating\nnetwork reconﬁguration or duty cycling, and network\
    \ maintenance, depending on their\nresource capacities and network requirements.\
    \ This case study is based on static SNs and\nthe distributed network construction\
    \ approach (see references in [9,12,33,126–132]), where\nthe SNs locally manage\
    \ the entire clustering process, and a CH is elected without the entire\nnetwork’s\
    \ information.\nAs shown in Figure 20a, the clustering process can be characterized\
    \ by the clustering\nmethod/network type (thus, centralized or distributed), the\
    \ CH selection method, recluster-\ning or network adaptability to topological\
    \ or scalable conditions, and the complexities (thus,\ncontrol message and computational\
    \ complexities) of the entire network operation cycle.\nUnlike the static approach\
    \ with ﬁxed CH, the adaptive clustering approach selects CH\nbased on the current\
    \ network conditions and rotates this role. However, both approaches\ncan incorporate\
    \ self-reclustering techniques to self-heal SN-out-of-service faults. Data\noutlier\
    \ faults can be best detected and corrected using threshold-based decision theory\
    \ or\nspatial correlation methods with the least complexities. Due to the large-scale\
    \ and high\ndeployment densities of WSN-based Agri-IoT, the distributed clustering\
    \ process is more\nsuitable for enhancing local FM, scalability, network management,\
    \ and power optimization\nthan the centralized approaches [37,47].\nGenerally,\
    \ the CA-IoT network can be optimized by formulating the deduced optimal\ndecision\
    \ metrics in Figure 20a into a MOO framework and multihop routing model in\norder\
    \ to provide the guidelines for the design of the WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT. From\
    \ the\ncomparative evaluations of Figures 10 and 20a, a taxonomy of MOO metrics\
    \ for designing\nan efﬁcient WSN-based CA-IoT network is proposed in Figure 20b.\
    \ To enhance the clarity\nof the state of the art on cluster-based protocols and\
    \ justify the need for the proposed MOO\nmetrics, a comparative summary based\
    \ on the characterization parameters is presented in\nTable 9.\n8.2. CH Election\
    \ Techniques\nA CH selection process is very critical to the resulting network’s\
    \ performance efﬁciency.\nIn addition to centralized networks and the computationally\
    \ expensive fuzzy-based clus-\ntering approaches [133,134], the efﬁciencies of\
    \ all LEACH-inherited protocols are mainly\ndependent on their CH selection techniques\
    \ [47,49]. Therefore, the correct estimation of\nthe cluster quality metrics (i.e.,\
    \ CHs count and cluster size) is pivotal in attaining the\nobjectives in Figure\
    \ 10. With the aid of nodes’ residual energy and location metrics, the op-\ntimal\
    \ CH count and cluster size can be preset before network deployment. Currently,\n\
    these metrics are randomly selected using a probabilistic approach in LEACH-inherited\n\
    protocol [9,21] or derived using a deterministic or an attribute-based method\
    \ [47,135].\nHowever, the probabilistic clustering, such as the LEACH-inherited\
    \ protocols, is expected\nto perform better in terms of network lifespan, minimal\
    \ clustering overhead, improved\nconnectivity, network/coverage stability, low\
    \ latency, collision-free routing, load balanc-\ning, high network stability span,\
    \ and algorithmic simplicity if the optimal CH count was\nIoT 2023, 4\n308\npredeﬁned\
    \ correctly [136]. However, the CH count is randomly predeﬁned in these proto-\n\
    cols [9,21], which undermines the CH’s stability and the resulting architecture’s\
    \ optimality.\nThis challenge can be addressed via common CH selection metrics\
    \ including Euclidean\ndistance, intra-cluster/inter-cluster communication costs,\
    \ energy-harvesting capacities,\nand probabilistic factors. To date, the related\
    \ attempts in [49,126,137–139] only relied on\nthe SNs’ residual energy and location\
    \ information to re-elect CHs after the initial CH count\nis deﬁned, which cannot\
    \ be ideal for WSN-based Agri-IoT.\nFor instance, an active SN in a particular\
    \ round decides whether or not to become\na CH by choosing a random number (rn)\
    \ ranging between 0 and 1 and comparing the\nnumber with a speciﬁed threshold\
    \ Th. A node, therefore, becomes a CH for that round if\nrn < Th, where Th is\
    \ expressed as:\nTh =\n(\npd\n1−pd×(( f irst−round)mod 1\npd\n,\nif n ∈ G\n0,\n\
    otherwise\n(1)\nwhere pd is the desired percentage of CHs or CH count per round,\
    \ and G is the number of\nSNs that have not been a CH in the previous 1/p rounds.\n\
    The authors in [119] proposed a three-layered LEACH (TL-LEACH) that operates in\n\
    three functional phases—CH election, MN recruitment, and data transfer—to enhance\
    \ the\nenergy efﬁciency of LEACH. Their ﬁrst-level CH election approach modiﬁed\
    \ Equation (1)\ninto an enhanced threshold T(i), which is expressed as:\nT(i)\
    \ =\n(\n(r + 1) × mod( 1\np × p),\nif i ∈ G\n0,\notherwise\n(2)\nwhere p is the\
    \ CH count, r is the current round number, and G is the number of SNs that\nhave\
    \ not been a CH in the previous 1/p rounds. The second-level CHs are selected\
    \ from\nthe ﬁrst-level CHs based on the shortest distance to the BS to function\
    \ as aggregated packet\nforwarders or relay CHs (RCHs).\nThe authors in [120]\
    \ introduced energy (E(i)) and distance (D(i)) attributes into Equa-\ntion (1)\
    \ to improve the load-balancing merit of LEACH. The resulting Th is expressed\
    \ as:\nTh =\n(\npd\n1−pd[r×mod 1\npd ] × [E(i) + (1 − D(i))],\nif n ∈ G\n0,\n\
    otherwise\n(3)\nMultihop routing via relay CHs (RCHs) was recommended for distant\
    \ CHs in the\nfuture scope of [120].\nIn the LEACH presented with a distance-based\
    \ threshold (LEACH-DT) algorithm\nin [121], the probability of becoming a CH depends\
    \ on the relative distance between a\nnode and the BS. This algorithm differs\
    \ from the LEACH algorithm because the desired\npercentage of CHs (pi) is predeﬁned\
    \ using Equation (5), while the threshold T(I, r) is\nexpressed as:\nT(i, r) =\n\
    (\npi\n1−pi×[r×mod 1\npi ],\nif Gi(r) = 0\n0,\nif Gi(r) = 1\n(4)\nNote that the\
    \ terms retain their usual deﬁnitions, namely:\np(i) = k\nξi\n∑N\nj=1 ξj\n, 0\
    \ ≤ pi ≤ 1,\n(5)\nwhere\nξi = 1/ECH × di − Enon−CH,\n(6)\nThe variable di depicts\
    \ the distance between node i and the BS, and ECH and Enon−CH\nare the average\
    \ residual energies in CHs and non-CHs, respectively. The authors further\nIoT\
    \ 2023, 4\n309\nestablished the need for a multihop routing approach in simulations\
    \ and real-world WSNs\nto validate the countless theoretical propositions and\
    \ beneﬁts.\nIn the decentralized energy-efﬁcient hierarchical cluster-based routing\
    \ algorithm\n(DHCR) [123], SNs compete to become CHs. First, the BS broadcasts\
    \ a trigger message at a\nspeciﬁc range. The receiving nodes then compete to become\
    \ a CH by disseminating a new\nmessage containing their residual energies and\
    \ distances from the BS. Using this informa-\ntion, a neighboring node i within\
    \ the target range receives the message and calculates its\nCHSn f uni as:\nCHSn\
    \ f uni = a × Erei\nEmax\n+ b ×\n1\nDis − To − BSi\n,\n(7)\nwhere Erei and Emax\
    \ are the residual and initial energy levels of node i, respectively;\nDis − To\
    \ − BSi is the distance between node i and the BS, and a and b are real random\n\
    values between 0 and 1 such that a + b = 1. The values of Dis − To − BSi of node\
    \ i\nand its neighbors are compared, and the node with the highest Dis − To −\
    \ BSi value is\nselected as the CH. A ﬁrst-level CH broadcasts its residual energy,\
    \ neighboring node count,\nand distance from the BS via a speciﬁc route. The next-level\
    \ CHs receive the information\nand similarly repeat the procedure to ensure that\
    \ every node determines a redistributor\nCH to the BS at the same time. A redistributor\
    \ CH has more energy and fewer neighbors\n(neighboring degrees).\nHowever, the\
    \ Hamilton energy-efﬁcient routing protocol (HEER) [124] creates an\nentire cluster\
    \ of nodes, aggregates data, and transmits them to the BS via a Hamiltonian\n\
    path that has been created by the entire cluster of nodes and controls the cluster\
    \ size by\nselecting one node as the CH using the probability function p, which\
    \ can be expressed as:\np = Lmessage\nFmax\n(8)\nwhere Lmessage is the size of\
    \ every node, and Fmax is the maximum size of a frame. The\nHEER protocol creates\
    \ the clusters only once in the ﬁrst round based on LEACH, and it\nrole-rotates\
    \ the CHs per the energy on the Hamiltonian path after a determined period.\n\
    Similarly, the two-phased EAMR protocol [125] randomly preselects the CH. A CH\n\
    also selects its closest CH as its redistributor CH. The clusters are static over\
    \ the entire\nnetwork lifetime, and the CH role rotates randomly within the clusters\
    \ according to a cluster\nreplacement threshold. The new CH inherits the redistributor\
    \ role if the old CH had one.\nOverall, since the node location, residual energy,\
    \ and sleep schedule are indispensable in the\nCH selection process, the CH selection\
    \ methods proposed by the authors in [9,12,36,120,140]\nare recommended WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT applications.\n8.3. Challenges of Existing MOO Frameworks and Recommended\
    \ Future Works\nAs Figures 9 and 10 illustrate, the performance efﬁciency of an\
    \ infrastructure-less\nWSN-based Agri-IoT mainly depends on the embedded MOO remedies\
    \ in the associated\nsupervisory routing protocol [12]. Several MOO frameworks\
    \ have been researched since\nAgri-IoT networks are subjected to multiple design\
    \ and operational constraints. A MOO\nframework is expected to formulate multiple\
    \ objective functions from a set of MOO metrics\nto simultaneously optimize these\
    \ multiple objectives, such as the maximal energy savings,\nhighest connectivity,\
    \ best latency, highest reliability, and balanced SN power depletion\nrates across\
    \ the network. Although the MOO methods are the best candidates for Agri-IoT,\n\
    the existing MOO solutions used in Agri-IoT are adopted from traditional WSN-based\
    \ IoT\nwithout any contextual evaluation [12,16,26]. Consequently, they have not\
    \ fulﬁlled their\nintended purposes due to several technical challenges, including\
    \ the following:\n1.\nThey are limited to non-cluster-based network architectures,\
    \ which implies that the promis-\ning potentials of the clustering architecture\
    \ are not adequately exploited [9,12,50,51].\n2.\nThey are frequently implemented\
    \ in the operational phase of the network, which\nmakes it challenging to ﬁnd\
    \ global optimal solutions with a balanced tradeoff among\nIoT 2023, 4\n310\n\
    conﬂicting objective functions. The performance optimality of the Agri-IoT network\n\
    starts from the SN design.\n3.\nThey rely on high-resource-demanding algorithms,\
    \ such as mathematical programming-\nbased scalarization methods, multi-objective\
    \ genetic algorithms (MOGAs), heuristics/\nmetaheuristics-based optimization algorithms,\
    \ and other advanced optimization\ntechniques [23,26,48], making them unsuitable\
    \ for the battery-powered SNs in Agri-IoT.\n4.\nThere are no contextual MOO guidelines\
    \ based on Figure 20 to govern the PHY-layer\ndesign of Agri-IoT to achieve global\
    \ optimal solutions with a balanced tradeoff among\nconﬂicting objectives. Consequently,\
    \ there are conﬂicting scenarios in existing MOO\nsolutions [50].\nTherefore,\
    \ there is an urgent demand for a realistic low-power MOO framework for\nCA-IoT\
    \ networks that is founded on the core WSN design metrics and MOO taxonomy\nmetrics\
    \ in Figure 10 and the top of Figure 20, respectively. The following section assesses\n\
    how evaluations and deductions evolve in a typical event sampling and routing\
    \ protocol\nin a CA-IoT network for precision irrigation system management.\n\
    9. Design of WSN-Speciﬁc CA-IoT Routing Protocol\nThis section proposes a CA-IoT-based\
    \ supervisory routing protocol that supports\nstatic SNs, rotatable/ﬁxed CH roles,\
    \ and enhanced SN resource management under the\ndeterministic deployment approach.\
    \ This can improve energy savings, connectivity, dis-\ntance moderation, and multihop\
    \ inter-cluster communication in the resulting network.\nThe operational cycle\
    \ and the embedded activities of our WSN-based CA-IoT protocol for\nprecision\
    \ irrigation application, as illustrated in Figure 21, include the following:\n\
    1.\nNetwork Construction or Setup Phase: This phase involves network modeling,\
    \ CH election,\nand cluster formation, which is explained in Figure 21. The active–sleep\
    \ duty-cycle\nscheduling ensures the SNs only switch to active mode during their\
    \ scheduled sampling\ndurations. In randomly deployed WSNs, redundant event reporting\
    \ can be avoided\nusing a correlated pairing-based active–sleep duty-cycle scheduling\
    \ approach in [12].\nThe optimal CH count and cluster size must be predeﬁned from\
    \ the resource capacities\nof the SNs. After the initial CH election, the MNs\
    \ are recruited and assigned their\nrespective sampling and intra-cluster communication\
    \ timeslots.\n2.\nSampling, Data Management, and Transmission Phase: The tasks\
    \ executed in this phase\ninclude event sampling, intra-cluster and inter-cluster\
    \ data transmissions, data outlier\nFM, and event data redundancy management.\
    \ Since microclimatic soil parameters do\nnot change swiftly [1,14], sampling\
    \ can only be scheduled during the day at 3-hourly\ntime intervals. In addition\
    \ to power optimization, the clustering approach provides\nsuperb potential for\
    \ both local and global FM using threshold-based FM theory and\nspatial correlation\
    \ techniques. Based on the architecture in Figure 19 and the resource\nlimitations\
    \ of the SNs, it is recommended that the communication beyond the BS or\ngateway\
    \ can utilize LoRa or Wi-Fi AirBox, whereas the intra-cluster and inter-cluster\n\
    communications must be the freely available low-power BLE technology, since it\
    \ is\nthe most suitable for the clustering architecture.\n3.\nNetwork Maintenance\
    \ and Reclustering Phase: This phase resolves all unforeseen topolog-\nical dynamics\
    \ caused by the SNs’ failures, network scalability, node mobility, and un-\nexpected\
    \ operational ﬂaws, without interfering with the normal network functionality\n\
    via adaptive reclustering, self-healing, and multihop routing techniques [12,23,24].\n\
    Here, a parent CH coordinates the election of child CHs (CCHs). While all non-CCHs\n\
    switch to sleep mode, the CCHs recruit new MNs using location and residual energy\n\
    parameters, assign them their respective sampling timeslots, and repeat Phase\
    \ 2 after-\nward, as shown in Figure 21. SN-out-of-service faults are auto-detected\

    \ suitable MAC method, a low-power wireless communication standard, data\naggregation\
    \ with data redundancy checks, and CH role rotation, among other factors.\nAlthough\
    \ the various sections of the deduced MOO metrics have been implemented in our\n\
    CA-IoT operational cycle, the most desired performance can be optimally attained\
    \ when\nthe MOO metrics are modeled into their respective objective functions,\
    \ and their optimal\nvalues are determined and implemented in both simulation\
    \ and testbed experiments in\nfuture works. Also, a realistic multihop routing\
    \ framework can also be inculcated into this\nprotocol for large-scale applications.\n\
    10. Open Issues and Future Works: Cluster-Based WSN-Speciﬁc Agri-IoT Networks\n\
    This tutorial has ﬁrmly established that the WSN-based Agri-IoT is an indispens-\n\
    able component of smart or precision farming and greenhouses, despite its resource-\
    \ and\ndeployment-induced challenges [12,26,141]. Unlike the conventional IoT,\
    \ Agri-IoT is com-\npelled to drive on batteries and affordable task-scalable\
    \ SNs. However, it must meet the\nexpectations in Figure 2 to guarantee a stable\
    \ performance. The cluster-based routing\ntechnique has emerged with promising\
    \ potential to mitigate these challenges. However,\nresults from existing testbed\
    \ solutions in this study show otherwise due to the absence of a\ncontextualized\
    \ in-depth overview of Agri-IoT as well as the following open issues which\nhave\
    \ not received extensive contextual research considerations in Agri-IoT applications:\n\
    1.\nThe cluster-based routing architecture for WSN-based Agri-IoT has not received\
    \ holistic\nand practical research considerations as far as FM, power optimization,\
    \ and network\nadaptability are concerned. Therefore, there is a demand for multi-parametric\
    \ optimiza-\ntion frameworks and guidelines for designing and implementing the\
    \ WSN sublayer.\n2.\nConcerning FM, most proposed schemes in the canon state of\
    \ the art are stand-\nalone, have high control message and computational complexities\
    \ (energy-inefﬁcient),\nand are mostly incompatible with the clustering architecture\
    \ [25,52]. The desired\nFM schemes for CA-IoT applications should be equipped\
    \ with fault-avoidance mech-\nIoT 2023, 4\n312\nanisms and the capacity to detect\
    \ and self-heal root faults (SN-out-of-service and\nsensory data outliers [25]),\
    \ not their effects.\n3.\nMultihop routing, which is a requirement to attain the\
    \ desired energy savings and\nnetwork adaptability in large-scale CA-IoT networks,\
    \ is asserted to be more energy-\nefﬁcient only in simulation experiments [33,120,121,123–125,128–130]\
    \ but not in real-\nworld implementation [22–24]. This imbalance is due to a lack\
    \ of a comprehensive\nand reliable theoretical multihop routing framework that\
    \ is based on the total commu-\nnication costs of multihop routing.\n4.\nThere\
    \ is a demand for a more realistic and holistic MOO framework that can op-\ntimize\
    \ the operational efﬁciency metrics such as cluster size, cluster counts, den-\n\
    sity/uniformity of nodes, communication distance, and activity schedule/duration,\n\
    right from the network design phase to the operational phase of Agri-IoT networks.\n\
    5.\nAlthough the current literature supports adaptive clustering with CH role\
    \ rotation\nideology, there exists the need for an optimal initial CH-count estimator\
    \ in order to\nimprove the stability of CH elections and the architecture. Thus,\
    \ the cluster quality\nindices (e.g., optimal cluster count and size) must be\
    \ predetermined before deﬁning\nthem in the associated CH election method, since\
    \ CH stability is compromised in most\nclustering methods [9,21,119–121,123,124].\n\
    6.\nMost protocols in the state of the art rely on perfect homogeneous networks,\
    \ which is\nunrealistic due to variations in modular specifications and resource\
    \ utilization and the\nfact that different SNs may have different communication\
    \ and data computational roles.\nTherefore, a more realistic, contextualized,\
    \ and adaptive clustering approach that leverages\nthe gap between the philosophy\
    \ and practice of Agri-IoT applications is needed.\n7.\nIn addition to the parent\
    \ LEACH protocol [21,61] which is a complete suite application\ncomprising routing,\
    \ MAC, and physical characteristics for wireless communication in\nWSNs, most\
    \ benchmarking MAC protocols purposed for traditional IoT applications\nare shelved,\
    \ since they are developed in solitude without application speciﬁcity and\nnetwork\
    \ architectural considerations. A custom-built and holistic protocol suite for\n\
    Agri-IoT remains a research opportunity.\n11. Conclusion and Future Works\nThis\
    \ tutorial presented: (1) a systematic overview of the fundamental concepts, tech-\n\
    nologies, and architectural standards of WSN-based Agri-IoT; (2) an evaluation\
    \ of the tech-\nnical design requirements of a robust, ubiquitous, self-healing,\
    \ energy-efﬁcient, adaptive,\nand affordable Agri-IoT; (3) a comprehensive survey\
    \ of the benchmarking FM techniques,\ncommunication standards, routing protocols,\
    \ MMAC protocols, and WSN-based testbed\nsolutions; and (4) an in-depth case study\
    \ on how to design a self-healing, energy-efﬁcient,\naffordable, adaptive, stable,\
    \ and cluster-based WSN-speciﬁc Agri-IoT from a proposed\ntaxonomy of MOO metrics\
    \ that can guarantee optimized network performance. Further-\nmore, this tutorial\
    \ established new taxonomies of faults, architectural layers, and MOO\nmetrics\
    \ for CA-IoT networks. Using the open technical issues, it recommended application-\n\
    speciﬁc requirements of Agri-IoT, general design expectations, and remedial measures,\n\
    and it evaluated them in CA-IoT for precision irrigation in order to optimally\
    \ exploit the\nproposed MOO metrics in a typical CA-IoT design in both simulation\
    \ and real-world\ndeployment scenarios. Overall, this tutorial can serve as a\
    \ new reference document for the\nIoT community and Agri-IoT designers, since\
    \ it adequately examined all critical aspects of\nWSN-based Agri-IoT networks\
    \ from theoretical modeling to real-world implementation.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    Tutorial on Agricultural IoT: Fundamental Concepts, Architectures, Routing, and
    Optimization. IoT 2023, 4, 265-318. Abstract This paper presents an in-depth contextualized
    tutorial on Agricultural IoT (Agri-IoT), covering the fundamental concepts, assessment
    of routing architectures and protocols, and performance optimization techniques
    via systematic survey and synthesis of related literature. The negative impacts
    of climate change and the increasing global population on food security and unemployment
    threats have motivated the adoption of the wireless sensor network (WSN)-based
    Agri-IoT as an indispensable underlying technology in precision agriculture and
    greenhouses to improve food production capacities and quality. However, most related
    Agri-IoT testbed solutions have failed to achieve their performance expectations
    due to the lack of an in-depth and contextualized reference tutorial that provides
    a holistic overview of communication technologies, routing architectures, and
    performance optimization modalities based on users’ expectations. Thus, although
    IoT applications are founded on a common idea, each use case (e.g., Agri-IoT)
    varies based on specific performance and users expectations as well as its technological,
    architectural, and deployment requirements. Likewise, the agricultural setting
    is a unique and hostile area where conventional IoT technologies do not apply,
    hence the need for this tutorial. Consequently, this tutorial addresses these
    via the following contributions: (1) a systematic overview of the fundamental
    concepts, technologies, and architectural standards of WSN-based Agri-IoT, (2)
    an evaluation of the technical design requirements of a robust, location-independent,
    and affordable Agri-IoT, (3) a comprehensive survey of the benchmarking fault
    tolerance techniques, communication standards, routing and medium access control
    (MAC) protocols, and WSN-based Agri-IoT testbed solutions, and (4) an in-depth
    case study on how to design a self-healing, energy-efficient, affordable, adaptive,
    stable, autonomous, and cluster-based WSN-specific Agri-IoT from a proposed taxonomy
    of multi-objective optimization (MOO) metrics that can guarantee an optimized
    network performance. Furthermore, this tutorial established new taxonomies of
    faults, architectural layers, and MOO metrics for cluster-based Agri-IoT (CA-IoT)
    networks and a 3-tier objective framework with remedial measures for designing
    an efficient associated supervisory protocol for cluster-based Agri-IoT networks.

    that fully automates the delivery of irrigation and calculates the water requirement
    from satellite images. The system optimizes water delivery for 140 cells located
    across four hectares of land based on two independent objectives (e.g., maximizing
    yield and increasing water efficiency) and is continuously adapting irrigation
    scheduling to the local spatial–temporal variability of the vegetation across
    the growing season. Irrigation is controlled by a central computer that issues
    commands to 693 control nodes to start irrigation based on the analysis of satellite
    images. The control nodes are laid out to create 15 m ×15 m cells and each cell
    can be addressed independently and can irrigate differentially. After two years
    of operation, this variable rate drip irrigation approach resulted in a 26% yield
    increase in the second year and an average increase of 16% in water use efficiency.
    This paper demonstrates that combining closed loop automation and advanced irrigation
    analytics can improve the water use efficiency and increase the yield on existing
    agricultural lands. Published in: IEEE Internet of Things Journal ( Volume: 5,

    I. Introduction Digitization of the physical world is fundamentally changing the
    industries fueled by sensor networks, automation, and robotization [1]. Sensor-based
    decision support or automated infrastructure control can minimize manual intervention.
    In agriculture, data driven decisions can enable a sustainable use of water, land
    utilization, and chemicals control through optimized analytics [2]. Sign in to
